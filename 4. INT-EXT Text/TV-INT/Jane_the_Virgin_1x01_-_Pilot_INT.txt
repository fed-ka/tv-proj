      Jane is solemn, staring at someone, as yet unseen.  As we 
      continue to WIDEN slowly on Jane:

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    It should be noted that at a mere 
                    ten years old, Jane s passions 
                    include  -- in no particular order -
                    - her family, God, and grilled 
                    cheese sandwiches.  

      REVEAL: Jane s Grandmother ALBA (50 s, religious, nurturing 
      and intimidating at once), staring at her. 

                                  ALBA
                    Look at the flower in your hand, 
                    Jane.

      As a dutiful Jane studies the flower:

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    This is Jane s grandmother, Alba 
                    Gloriana Garcia.  Her passions 
                    include God and Jane.  In that 
                      particular order.

      In subtitled Spanish (indicated by italics), Alba instructs 
      her granddaughter:

                                  ALBA
                    Notice how perfect it is.  How 
                    pristine.  
                          (as Jane notices)
                    Now Mija, crumple it up--  

      A female voice interrupts:                                                                            2


                                    XIOMARA
                    Really, mom?

      ANGLE ON: XIOMARA GLORIANA GARCIA, lying on the bed, bored.  
       Xo  (pronounced  Zo ) is 25.  Tight, Miami clothes.  
      Bleached blonde hair.  

                                  ALBA
                    Sssh --

                                    XIOMARA
                    But this is so lame --

                                  JANE
                    Mommy, shhh!

      Oh.  Xo is Jane s mother.  Jane gives her a warning look. Xo 
      feels badly.  She turns back to Alba, indicates:   continue.   
      Alba nods.  Then, she turns back to Jane. Serious.

                                  ALBA
                    Crumple the flower, Jane.

      Obediently, Jane closes her fist, crumples the flower.   When 
      she opens her hand again,  the flower is destroyed. Juice 
      leaking out.  Petals already turning to brown.

                                  ALBA (CONT D)
                    Good. Now try to make it look new 
                    again.  
                          (prodding)
                    Go on.  Try.

      Jane tries, but the flower is clearly ruined.  

                                  YOUNG JANE
                    I can t.

                                  ALBA
                    That s right.  You can never go 
                    back.
                          (then, with gravity)
                    And that is what happens when you 
                    lose your virginity.  You can t 
                    ever go back.

      Xiomara rolls her eyes, but Jane is oblivious, staring at the 
      flower, absorbing this bombshell as...

                                  ALBA (CONT D)
                    Never forget that, Jane.

      And as we PUSH IN: on the flower, holding on it a beat...

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    And Jane never did.                                                                            3


      And now we PULL BACK from the flower...which is in a frame in 
      Jane s room in the present...


      The same room, but now a 23 year-old Jane lives here. And she 
      is currently in a bra, making out/grinding/dry humping with 
      her boyfriend, MICHAEL (26, blue-collar sexy). Typed on 
      screen:  THIRTEEN...AND...A...HALF...YEARS...LATER.  A beat. 
      Then:  NOW.  Heavy breathing.  Grinding.

                  JANE         MICHAEL
      We should --I know --

      His hand is up her skirt.  A bit more kissing/grinding.  Jane 
      looks up at the flower, she s breathless --

                                  JANE 
                    Stop.  We should stop.

      Neither wants to, but still, they do, as typed on screen: 

 J A N E  T H E  V I R G I N

      Michael leans back for a beat, as Jane starts to get dressed.  
      At 23, Jane is a  good girl.   Hard-working.  Practical.  A 
      girl with a plan.  Jane pulls her shirt on and sees Michael 
      staring at her, smiling a little...

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    What?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Even now, even when I m this 
                      frustrated...I really love you, 
                    baby.   
                          (honest, sincere)
                    In like a can t-imagine-my-life-
                      without-you kind of way...  

      Jane bursts out laughing.  He s looking at her.  She realizes 
      he s not laughing.  She stops.  Smiles.  Tries to correct:

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  Yeah me too --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Really?  With the laughing --

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry, it was so over the top I 
                    thought you were kidding --                                                                             4


                                    MICHAEL
                          ( come on )
                    I was having a moment, I m allowed 
                    to have a moment --

                                  JANE
                    I know, I m sorry, you know I m not 
                    good with all that corny stuff--

                                    MICHAEL
                    It wasn t corny--

                                  JANE
                    Sorry!  You know what I mean.  That 
                    was sweet, what you said.   And I 
                    love you and all that stuff too.

      She kisses him.  He kisses her back.  PRELAP: with, romantic 
      music starting, building.  We MATCH CUT:


      The romantic music is swelling as Jane and Michael are now 
      kissing at the front door.  As they separate, she hands him 
      something --

                                  JANE
                    Don t forget this--

      His detective badge.  Michael grins, takes it from her.  One 
      last kiss and then Jane closes the door and heads into the 
      living room as the romantic music swells... 


      Jane enters:

                                  JANE
                    Ay, ay!  At least turn it down...

      The source of the music?  A telenovela.  Scrolled on screen:  
       The Passions of Rubio .  Alba (now late 60 s), wearing a 
      maid s uniform,  is watching along with Xiomara. At 39, Xo 
      looks like she s 29 and dresses like she s 19.  As Alba 
      lowers the volume on the TV:

                                  ALBA
                    I was letting you know that it was 
                    starting --  
                          (indicates plate)
                    Eat your grilled cheese, Mija.

                                    XIOMARA
                    Mom, she doesn t have to watch if 
                    she doesn t want to --                                                                            5


                                  JANE
                    Of course I m watching, you guys 
                    got me hooked on these things --

      As Jane sits down on the couch with her Mom and Grandma:

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    But you should know, telenovelas 
                    have completely ruined romance for 
                    me --

                                  ALBA
                    Sssh.

      The credits have ended.  ONSCREEN:  A man's back is to us.  
      He's on a boat, looking out at the water with a beautiful 
      blonde woman. This is RUBIO - an incredibly handsome 
      telenovela star (40).  In subtitled Spanish:

                                  RUBIO
                    Despite the circumstances, there s 
                    one thing I know.
                          (dramatically)
                    We were meant to be, my love...

      Xo glances at Jane.  Jane feels her gaze --

                                  JANE
                    What?

                                    XIOMARA
                    Nothing.  Eat your grilled cheese.

      Xo and Jane turns back towards the television, and we...PUSH 
      to the TV: on  Rubio, looking out at the water.  PUSHING past 
      him, into the dark of the water, the music swelling... Then, 
      we re ZOOMING OFF the water to establish: SOUTH BEACH NIGHT -- 
      the art deco, the heat, the sex...  


      ...in front of a mirror.  A voice behind her:

                                  OLDER WOMAN (O.S.)
                    You re starting to seem desperate.

      Reveal MAGDA, in the mirror s reflection. Way too much plastic 
      surgery.  She's got that cat woman look; her face has been 
      ruined.  This is Monica s (potentially clairvoyant) mother. 

                                  MAGDA
                    I don t blame you.  Your husband 
                    doesn t love you anymore.

      This hits Monica in the gut. Not wanting to believe it--

                                  MONICA
                    You re wrong, mother --                                                                            7


                                  MAGDA
                    It s all right.  Tomorrow will 
                    change everything.

                                  MONICA
                    I haven t decided whether --

                                  MAGDA
                    You will.

      And off this declaration...


      Jane is putting her things in her locker next to her 
      childhood best friend LINA (trashtastic with a humongous 
      heart and an even more humongous temper). There are 5-6 other 
      FEMALE WAITRESSES/BARTENDERS changing in here.  We ll meet 
      them later.  Right now, Jane and Lina are mid-conversation:

                                  LINA
                    Maybe Michael s gonna propose, my 
                    sisters say guys get all cheesy 
                    before they propose --

                                  JANE
                    No way, we have a timeline, I don t 
                    have my teaching certification yet, 
                    we only just merged our google 
                      calenders--

                                  LINA
                    You ve been dating three years and 
                    you haven t had sex.  He might move 
                    up your google timeline. 
                          (before Jane can protest)
                    You d say yes, right?  If he asked?  

      A beat, then Jane nods.  The girls share a smile - exciting!  
      But before they can continue there s a KNOCK on the door --

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Everyone decent?

      But he doesn t wait, just enters.  Meet ROMAN  ZAZ  ZAZO.  A 
      handsome, charming dog.  He talks fast and smiles faster. 
      Robert Downey Jr. 15 years ago.  Since we re dreaming. 

                                  LINA
                    Who are you?

      Zaz moves through the room, holding cocktail straws, 
      indicating that each girl should choose one.                                                                             8


                                  ZAZ
                          (in close to one breath)
                    Roman Zazo but everyone calls me 
                    Zaz -- I work for the management 
                    company that just bought the hotel. 
                    You could think of me as, say, your 
                    new boss -- pick a straw, please, 
                    pick one -- keeping in mind you 
                    have nothing to worry about as long 
                    as you re outstanding at your job -- 
                    A straw please--
                          (Jane takes one)
                    -- which benefits all of us, seeing 
                    as we all have the same goal here, 
                    that goal being to make bank-- okay, 
                    let s see those straws.

      The girls open their hands.  Jane is holding the short one.  
      Zaz smiles at her.  All charm.

                                  ZAZ (CONT D)
                    What s your name?

                                  JANE
                    Jane.

                                  LINA
                    But everyone calls her Jaz.

      The other girls laugh, even Jane.  Zaz doesn t miss a beat:

                                  ZAZ
                      Congratulations, Jaz.  You re in 
                    the canoe.

      And off Jane:  What canoe?


      Jane joins Lina as they approach the bar for more drinks.

                                  JANE
                    Do you remember a guy named Rafael 
                    Solano from when we worked at the 
                    yacht club?  He was a member --

                                  LINA
                    The jerk you had a monster crush 
                    on?

                                  JANE
                    It wasn t a monster crush--

                                  LINA
                    We talking about the same guy?  You 
                    had this magical kiss and he--

      They re now at the bar, next to a beautiful server, EVA (26).  

                                  EVA
                    Who d you have a magical kiss with?

      Eva s kind of the dumb beautiful blonde stereotype.  Except 
      she s transgendered.

                                  JANE
                    No one.  I was 15.  It was nothing--

      Another waitress -- MODEL MEG, approaching --

                    I need someone to run champagne to

      Escape!  

                                  JANE
                    Got it --


      The house is dark.  Luisa slips off her shoes as she opens 
      her bedroom door.  She reacts, shocked.  Her purse drops to 
      the floor--


      Jane, in her street clothes, is waiting for Lina to finish 
      changing.  Jane s bummed.

                                  JANE
                    You re sure he s the new owner?

                                  LINA
                    Yeah.  I got confirmation.
                          (off Jane upset)
                    Don t worry, I m sure he didn t 
                    hear the jerk thing.  He was 
                    focused on your boobies. And if he 
                    did hear, then he can t fire you 
                    because he was focused on your 
                    boobies.  Either way because of 
                    your boobies, you re cool. 

      Jane smiles a little.  She really hopes her friend is right.

                                  LINA (CONT D)
                    C mon, let s get out of here.  It s 
                    3:30 already.

      Off Jane:  that late?


      Jane is sitting next to Lina.  She takes her old laptop out 
      of her backpack.

                                  LINA
                    You gonna write?
                          (off Jane s nod)
                    Okay.  Wake me when we get there.

      Lina turns over and closes her eyes as Jane starts to write.  
      Music comes up: Regina Spektor s Blue Lips.  Haunting.  
      Tense.  He stumbled into faith and thought/God, this is all 
      there is... 


      The music is coming from Rafael s sister s car.  Luisa is 
      behind the wheel, and she s a wreck.  Crying.  Her phone 
      rings.   Allison.    She goes to shut it off, it drops on the 
      ground. Luisa looks away from the road, just for a moment, to 
      search for it...                                                                            13



      We're now with Jane, on the bus.  The song wails:   And all 
      the gods and all the worlds began colliding...  Suddenly, 
      Jane stops writing, struck by a thought...

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                          (dramatically, rapid)
                    Maybe it was seeing Rafael again, 
                    but suddenly Jane found herself 
                    wondering if there was a method to 
                    the madness, a plan to the sudden 
                    and strange way in which worlds 
                    collide --

      Now, we re CUTTING between Jane writing and  Luisa trying to 
      find her phone. Luisa's looking down, we're sure by the way 
      this is edited, with suspense...she's going to run a red 
      light, hit the bus, there's going to be a collision...  But 
      Luisa grabs the phone just in time, looks up, stops in front 
      of the light.  And the bus passes.   We stay with Luisa, 
      silencing the ring.  And then she breaks down sobbing.

      And Jane s bus is long gone.  

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    But then she stopped herself.  
                    Because that was the telenovelas 
                      talking...


      Jane enters... exhausted.   Checking her phone: 4:23.  

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    ...and not real life at all.


      Xiomara is asleep in her bed.  She left a note:   Needed 
      company tonight, Gary s been calling -- I m trying to stay 
      away.  Also, I ripped your black jeans, you were right, they 
      didn t fit me.  xo Mom.   P.S.  Good luck  tomorrow!   Jane 
      smiles.  Then, she heads over to her desk, takes out her tips 
      and puts all but $20 in an envelope marked:   Abuela -- 
      Medical.   She crosses off the total on the outside:  15, 455 
      and adjusts it.  STILL OWE:  15, 200.  We see the number was 
      originally  24, 834.  Jane s paid off a great deal.  But 
      there s still a long ways to go.


      Jane, now in pj s, gets in bed.  She turns off the light, 
      texts Michael:  I m home.  In bed.  A beat, then he texts 
      back.  Phone sex?  She smiles as she writes:  Mom s sleeping 
      with me.  His reply.  Soundly?  Jane:  Ew.                                                                              14


      Then, Jane again: Sorry, I freaked out before.  You know how 
      I feel about you, right?  Even though I don t say it?  From 
      him:  Yes.  Then from him again:  Go to sleep.  You have a 9 
      am doctor s appointment and a 12 pm interview.  Beat, then.  
      Enjoying your google calender.  She smiles.  Love you.  
      Michael: You too.  And Jane closes her eyes... In BLACKNESS 
      for the briefest moment before BEEP, BEEP, BEEP!


      Jane wakes up.  Already?  She looks at her alarm.  7 a.m. She 
      closes her eyes briefly, BLACKNESS AGAIN... A beat.  And 
      then, subtly, the blackness starts moving.  WIDEN TO REVEAL:  
      A SONOGRAM IMAGE OF AN EMPTY UTERUS.  Continue to WIDEN:


      We see NURSE SHARON (old war horse) doing a sonogram.

                                  NURSE SHARON
                    Well, you re definitely ovulating-- 

      REVEAL: Monica, Rafael s wife, on the table.  She snaps a 
      picture of Sharon with her i-phone.

                                  MONICA
                    For my husband.  He s so upset he 
                    couldn t be here today.  Made me 
                    promise to capture every moment.
                          (deep breath, then)
                    Okay, let s unfreeze it.


      We are TIGHT ON: A woman drying her face.  REVEAL:  Rafael s 
      sister -- Luisa.  She s had an emotional night, but she s 
      trying to pull it together.  A deep breath.  She stares at 
      herself -- Calm, stay calm -- and exits the frame...


      ...emerging into the busy hallway. We see she s wearing a lab 
      coat. NURSE SHARON approaches, starts talking immediately; 
      she s holding a metal tray with a turkey baster-like syringe.

                                  NURSE SHARON 
                    There you are, Dr. Alvez. You re 
                    running a little behind, remember 
                    you re covering for Dr. Peters... 
                    you have an insemination in seven, 
                    then a pap in six--

      But Luisa is distracted, her phone is vibrating.  On the 
      screen:   Allison  -- along with a screen ID: a picture of 
      Luisa and Allison kissing.  Rattled, Luisa sends it to 
      voicemail, then takes the metal tray with the sperm sample.                                                                            15


                                  LUISA
                    An insemination and a pap, got it.  

      The Nurse heads off.  Luisa walks a few more steps, then she 
      stops in a corner.  She can t help it, she has to listen to 
      the message.  Allison s voice is exhausted, broken:

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    I messed up, I messed up, I messed 
                    up.  I m a screwed up person, she 
                    means nothing to me, I swear -- 

      Sharply, Luisa disconnects.  Pull it together.  Do not cry.  
      A deep breath.  You can do this.  And she enters ROOM 6:


      Looking down at the patient history on the chart --

                                  LUISA
                    Nice to meet you, Ms. Garcia--

      REVERSE ON:  JANE, asleep in the stirrups. Luisa doesn t see 
      this:

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                    You all set for your insemination? 

      And she closes the door, waking Jane up.  Jane s disoriented, 
        embarrassed, she sees the Doctor studying the chart...

                                  JANE
                    Hi, yes. Yes!  Sorry I m tired.  
                    I m Jane, I usually see Dr. Peters--

                                  LUISA
                    I m filling in while she s on her 
                      honeymoon. 

      Honeymoon.  She can t help it, Luisa s eyes tear up! Jane is 
      not sure what to do.  Luisa tries to act like it s not 
      happening.

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                    Anyway, I m Dr. Alves and I ll be--

                                  JANE
                    Are you okay?

      Luisa is trying -- willing herself -- to stop crying.  She 
      sits down on the stool in front of Jane.

                                  LUISA
                    Oh.  Yes.  I m fine.  Sorry.  Let s 
                    just scoot down a little...
                                  (MORE)                                                                            16

                                  LUISA (CONT'D)
                          (tries for upbeat)
                    Did you bring anyone with you?

                                  JANE
                    Here?  No.  Just me...

                                  LUISA
                    Doing it alone. Good for you.  
                          (voice breaks)
                    Probably easiest --

                        JANELUISA
      Dr. Alves?  Are you sure Sorry,  I m sorry.  This is 
      you re okay?so unprofessional...

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                          (can only be honest)
                    I m just having some... personal 
                      problems--

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry --

      Luisa reaches over, picking up the turkey baster syringe 
      (which Jane can t see, because she s lying down):

                                  LUISA
                          (tries for bright)
                    Hey, we all have them, right?

                                  JANE
                    You know, I can come back. Maybe, 
                    another day -- Oh, okay, so you re 
                    starting.  

      And indeed, Luisa has the baster under the sheet over Jane s 
      lap.  Depressing the syringe Luisa inseminates Jane:

                                  LUISA
                    Nah, you d have to wait another 
                    month and that s not fair to you.  
                          (then)
                    Okay.  All done.  Call the office 
                    for your results in two weeks.

                                  JANE
                    That s it?

                                  LUISA
                    That s it.  Good luck.
                          (then)
                    And I m sorry again.  About my--

                                  JANE
                    No, it s okay.  And I hope 
                    things... turn out okay.  For you.                                                                              17


      Luisa nods, embarrassed and exits...


      Room seven.  Luisa picks up the chart.  Huh.  She enters:


                                  LUISA
                    I didn t know you were coming--

                                  MONICA
                    I had the nurse unfreeze Rafael s 
                    sperm.
                          (off Luisa, surprised)
                      A surprise for him.  That s why I 
                    didn t tell you, you guys are so 
                    close, so I didn t want to put you 
                    in a weird position.  

      Luisa reacts, as she starts to realize what happened.   
      Monica misreads her expression, gets defensive:

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    If you don t do it, someone else 
                    will.  I know from the internet that 
                    you can t refreeze the sample, so 
                    unless you want the sperm to die--

      As Monica continues, we drown sound, PUSHING IN: on Luisa.

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    And just like that, Luisa realized 
                    what she d done!


      Luisa s pacing.  Panicked.  

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    Later, when asked about so-called 
                       Immaculate Conception of Jane 
                    Gloriana Garcia,  Luisa Alves would 
                    say that it was the biggest mistake 
                    of her life.  

      A knock on the door.  

                                  LUISA
                    Come in.

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    It wasn t.

      ROSE enters.  At 32, she s all long legs and blonde hair.  
      But don t let the giant trophy wife diamond fool you.  Rose 
      is whip smart.  And right now, also visibly uncomfortable.  

                                  LUISA
                    I didn t know who else to call.

                                  ROSE
                          (cold, stiff)
                    You said it was an emergency.

                                  LUISA
                          (a beat, then)
                      I artificially inseminated the 
                    wrong woman.

      Rose takes this in.  Shocked.  A beat, then:

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                    So I need a lawyer --

                                  ROSE
                    You could ve called any lawyer--

                                  LUISA
                    I m scared, I needed someone to 
                    talk to--

                                  ROSE
                    Your wife.  Your brother --

                                  LUISA
                    I walked in on Allison in bed with 
                    her assistant last night.

                          (off Rose s reaction, 
                            quiet, admitting)
                    And it was Raf s sperm.

                                  ROSE
                    What?

                                  LUISA
                    Monica came in for an insemination.  
                    And I accidentally used his 
                    specimen on someone named...Jane 
                    Gloriana Garcia.


      Find Jane: sitting beneath a giant stained glass window of 
      Jesus.  She s talking to SISTER MARIA  (50 s, stern).  

                                  SISTER MARIA
                    Well, you re certainly quite 
                      accomplished academically, Jane. 
                    And your references are 
                      outstanding.  
                          (then)
                    I should mention that a requirement 
                    for our student teachers is that 
                    they be role models for our 
                      impressionable teenagers --

                                  JANE
                    And as a modern Catholic woman who 
                    is saving herself for marriage -- I 
                    believe I will be. 

      Sister Maria smiles.  Then --

                                  SISTER MARIA
                    Well, I think you d fit in 
                      beautifully here.  Can you start in 
                      September?

      And off Jane, elated...


      Rose is staring at Luisa, in shock --

                                  ROSE
                    What did you tell Monica?

                                  LUISA
                    I didn t.  I panicked.  I went back 
                    into the room and I inseminated her 
                    with... saline.

      And ROMANTIC MUSIC takes us into...                                                                            20



      Rafael reads a fortune cookie, confused:

                                  RAFAEL
                     You might be a father? 

      Monica takes his hand.

                                  MONICA
                    We ll know in two weeks.
                          (proud)
                    I used your sample, baby. 

      Rafael reacts: what the hell?  He is in complete shock.

                                  RAFAEL
                    What?  Without telling me --

      She looks at him. Hurt.  Emotional.  Seemingly laid bare.

                                  MONICA
                    I wanted it to be romantic.  I 
                    wanted some part of the fact that 
                    we had to do it...like this... to 
                    be romantic --

      Oh.  Rafael is reeling.  She moves closer, takes his hand.

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    Things have been so... hard with us 
                    lately.  So, I thought if I gave 
                    you what you want most in this 
                    world...

      And off Rafael, absorbing this bomb, we PRELAP:

                                  ROSE (O.S.)
                    What are the chances it will take?


                                  LUISA
                    About twenty percent.

      A beat, and then Rose speaks.  Grave.  Measured.

                                  ROSE
                    Then as your...
                          (what s the word?)
                      ...friend, not your lawyer, because 
                    I can not be your lawyer...  Don t 
                    say anything.
                          (off Luisa s surprise)
                    You re still on probation, you ll 
                    lose your license.                                                                             21


      Luisa nods.  She knows.  But still...

                                  LUISA
                    What about Raf?  How can I keep 
                    this from him?  I mean, it was his 
                    only sample --

                                  ROSE
                          ( face facts )
                    And it s gone.  How will telling 
                    him change that?

      Luisa contemplates this a beat.  Then, she slowly nods.  

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    Choosing to hide what she d done --
                    that was Luisa s biggest mistake. 


      Jane sits next to her mother, shopping bags at their feet.  
      Jane s not feeling great and is sipping a water.  Xo is glued 
      to her phone.  Typed on screen: 

      15... days...later. 

                                    XIOMARA
                          (re: phone)
                    Oh man.  You know that guy Darrell 
                    who s dating slutty Crystal? He 
                    found out that she s been boning 
                    Mauricio and she tried to deny it, 
                    but there was this text she sent 
                    him where she's like naked and 
                    grabbing her boobs, want to see?  

                                  JANE
                    Pass.

                                    XIOMARA
                    Already sent it.  
                          (she looks at Jane)
                    You alright, baby?

                                  JANE
                    Fine.  Just a little nauseous.  Why 
                    are you talking to slutty Crystal,  
                    I thought you hated her--

                                    XIOMARA
                    Yeah, but I just found out her 
                      brother-in-law knows Shakira s 
                    bassist so I gotta kiss her ass.
                    Hopefully I won t get an STD.

      Meanwhile, Jane s phone beeps.  She looks at the text, reacts--                                                                            22


                                  JANE
                    Ew, mom, I did not need to see --
                          (takes a closer look)
                    Crystal got fake boobs?

                                    XIOMARA
                    Six months ago.

      Meanwhile, the bus jerks to a stop.

                                    XIOMARA (CONT D)
                    Of course you re nauseous.
                          (yelling at the driver)
                    Hello, sir -- you re driving like a 
                    freaking maniac --

                                  JANE
                          (calming her)
                    Mom, it s okay.

      Meanwhile,  TWO PREGNANT WOMEN wearing yoga clothes enter the 
      packed bus.  There are no seats left.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    C mon, let s get up.

                                    XIOMARA
                    But you aren t feeling good --

                                  JANE
                    They re pregnant --

      Jane stands. But then suddenly, she s light-headed.  As the 
      bus lurches forward, Jane passes out, hitting her head hard.  


      Jane is now in the E.R., hooked up to an I.V. talking to DR. 
      MARCOS SPINOZA (30 s, handsome).  Xiomara is there as well.  

                                  DR. SPINOZA
                    We ll just get some fluids back in 
                    you, you should be on your way --

                        JANEXIOMARA
      Thank you.But she fainted -- she 
                                                    fainted -- in her whole life 
                                                  she s never fainted --

                                  DR. SPINOZA (CONT D)
                      Dehydrated --

                                    XIOMARA
                    And she s been nauseous --                                                                            23


                                  DR. SPINOZA
                          (to Xiomara)
                    I know you re concerned.  And we re 
                    running the tests.  But in my 
                    opinion, she just stood up too 
                    fast.  Put that together with 
                      dehydration and a bad city driver --

      He smiles.  Xiomara smiles back, reassured.  Then: slightly 
      flirty...

                                    XIOMARA
                    Thank you, Dr. Spinoza.  You have 
                    gone above and beyond in every way.

      Jane reacts.  Here we go.  She watches as Xiomara steps 
      forward, puts a card in his pocket.  Slightly inappropriate.  

                                    XIOMARA (CONT D)
                    Come check out my gig tomorrow 
                    night, boo. 

                                  DR. SPINOZA
                          (laughs a little)
                    Yeah, okay.  Maybe I will.

      When he is gone, Xiomara turns to Jane --

                                    XIOMARA
                    Don t you judge, the best way to 
                    get over a man is to find a new man 
                    --

                                  JANE
                    As long as you stay away from Gary 
                    I m happy --

                                    XIOMARA
                          (deflects)
                    Did you text Michael?  Tell him 
                    what happened?

                                  JANE
                    No, he s working, I don t want to 
                    worry him.  I ll see him tonight, 
                    we re going out for our 
                      anniversary.   
                          (then)
                    You have been, right?  Staying away 
                    from Gary?

                                    XIOMARA
                          (beat, then)
                    We ve been texting.                                                                            24


                                  JANE
                    Mom -- come on--

                                    XIOMARA
                    It s hard, Jane  --

                                  JANE
                    No.  It isn t.  He s married. And 
                    he s not leaving his wife.  I don t 
                    care what he says, he s not leaving 
                    her.  You know he s not --

                                    XIOMARA
                    Yeah, I know. 
                          (struggles, feels bad)
                    I know...

      Jane feels for her mom and takes her hand, squeezing it.


      Rafael is holding Monica s hand as they stare at a sonogram 
      screen.  Black.  And moving black.  And more...black. Reveal 
      Luisa, performing the sonogram.  She speaks, quietly:

                                  LUISA
                     You re not pregnant.

      Rafael absorbs this.  He looks devastated.

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                    I m so sorry.

                                  RAFAEL
                          (her pain before his)
                    No, Lu.  This isn t your fault.

      And off the truth, hanging in the air...


      Dr. Spinoza reenters Jane s bay. 

                                  DR. SPINOZA 
                    Nausea and fainting spell solved.
                          (then)
                    You re pregnant.

      Jane looks at him.  Mom looks at him.  A beat, and then both 
      women start to laugh. Dr. Spinoza is confused.

                                    XIOMARA
                    Sorry.  It s just she s not 
                    pregnant --                                                                            25


                                  JANE
                    No, I m not pregnant.

                                  DR. SPINOZA
                    We tested your urine.

                                  JANE
                    Trust me, the test was wrong --

                                  DR. SPINOZA
                    False negatives are frequent, false 
                    positives are rare --

                                    XIOMARA
                          (omg!)
                    Jane!  Did you and Michael --

                                  JANE
                    No, we didn t.
                          (to the doctor)
                    And it might be rare but it 
                    happened.  Because I m a virgin.

                                  DR. SPINOZA
                    A virgin?

      She nods.  He glances over at Xiomara  getting  it:

                                  DR. SPINOZA (CONT D)
                    Maybe we should talk in private?

                                  JANE
                    We don t need to--

                                  DR. SPINOZA
                    I think we do--

                                    XIOMARA
                    Where d you get your degree from, 
                    the University of Dumbass?  My 
                    daughter said she s an effin  
                    virgin, so do another goddamn test!


      Jane drinking water while Xiomara and Dr. Spinoza watch. 


      On Jane s face.  We hear the unmistakable TINKLE OF PEE


      Dr. Spinoza dips in the strip into a cup of urine.                                                                            26


                                  DR. SPINOZA 
                    Pink means pregnant.

      And then, we watch the sample turn very, very pink.  On Jane, 
      stunned.  Not understanding...

                                  JANE
                    But I ve never had sex...

      Xiomara believes her.  Which means...

                                    XIOMARA
                              (holy...fucking...shit...)
                      Immaculata.  You are immaculata...

                                  JANE
                    What?  No, mom --

                                  DR. SPINOZA
                    She s clearly not a virgin --

                                  JANE
                    Of course I am, it s a mistake --

                  DR. SPINOZAXIOMARA
      It s not a mistake --Forgive me Jane, for I have 
                                                    sinned--

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                      A hormonal thing --

                                  DR. SPINOZA
                    Exactly, pregnancy hormones --

      Jane is shaking her head no, she takes out a phone, dialing a 
      number as Xiomara whispers, staring at her daughter...

            DR. SPINOZA (CONT D)XIOMARA
      I understand, that this is It s been... well, a long 
        unplanned...time since my last confession-

      Over the chaos, Jane takes into the phone...

                                  JANE
                    Hello, this is Jane Garcia.  And I 
                    need to talk to Dr. Alves, some 
                    crazy doctor is saying I m pregnant--

                                    XIOMARA
                    Hail Jane, full of grace, the Lord 
                    is with thee...

      And off Jane, panicked: 

                                      End of Act Two                                                                            27


                                          Act Three


      Rafael and Monica are looking at Luisa, worried.  Luisa looks 
      back at them, gathering courage.   

                                  MONICA
                    Am I dying? 
                          (panicked)
                    If I m dying just say it --

                                  LUISA
                    No, no -- nothing like that --

                                  RAFAEL
                    Lu.  What s going on?

                                  LUISA
                          (honest, raw)
                    I don t know how to tell you --

                                  RAFAEL
                          (gentle)
                    It s me.  Just say it.

      A beat as Luisa looks at her brother, knowing that  saying 
      it  means she s going to lose him forever...

                                  LUISA
                    Two weeks ago, after I walked in on 
                    Allison and -- well it doesn t 
                    matter, two weeks ago --
                          (staring at Rafael)
                    I used your specimen on the wrong 
                    person.

                                  RAFAEL
                    What?

                                  LUISA
                      I inseminated a girl with your 
                    sperm.  Mistakenly.

      A beat as this lands in the room.  Absolute silence. In 
      shock.  Monica s jaw drops.  Rafael is reeling.  Meanwhile, 
      Nurse Sharon knocks, opens the door.

                                  NURSE SHARON
                    She s here.


      Jane is scrolling through her phone, trying to find credible 
      scientific reasons for her positive pregnancy test.                                                                             28


      Xiomara isn t sure what to believe.  Something divine?  A 
      scientific mistake?  

                                  JANE
                    Okay, look here, ten causes of 
                    false pregnancy tests --
                          (scrolling through)
                    Molar pregnancy, no, ectopic, 
                    recent miscarriages, no no -- okay, 
                    invalid tests, see? Invalid tests.

      Xiomara nods.  That makes sense.  But does it?  A beat, then 
      Xo blurts out --

                                    XIOMARA
                    I had sex with Gary three days ago--

                                  JANE
                    What?  Why are you telling me this 
                    now--

                                    XIOMARA
                    I don t know, what if you re like a 
                    religious messiah, I can t lie to a 
                    religious messiah --

      Before Jane can respond, Luisa walks into the waiting room.

                                  LUISA
                    Hi, Jane. 


      Jane and Xiomara are looking at Luisa.  She sits behind her 
      desk, in front of the window.  Behind her, in the distance, 
      we see a billboard advertising  The Passions of Rubio.

                                  LUISA
                    The reason those tests came back 
                      positive... is because... I 
                      accidentally inseminated you two 
                    weeks ago.

                        JANEXIOMARA
      What?You what?

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                    It was a mistake.  I made a 
                    mistake.  And there was only a 20 
                    percent chance it would take, so I 
                      thought... I thought you might 
                    never know.  Except that -- things 
                    turned out differently.                                                                             29


      Jane is just staring at her, in shock.  Time seems to slow.  
      We are PUSHING IN: on Jane as her heart beats.  We become 
      aware of the sound.  THUMP THUMP.  THUMP THUMP.  THUMP THUMP.

      Jane looks down and is startled to see Rubio (the telenovela 
      star) kneeling in front of her!  In subtitled Spanish:

                                  RUBIO           
                    It s alright.  Just take deep 
                      breaths...in and out.  In and out.

      Jane is a little confused, but starts breathing deeply.

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    It is important to note that right 
                    now Jane is having an out of body 
                      experience. None of this is really 
                      happening.  

                                  RUBIO
                          (to Jane)
                    I know exactly how you feel.  When 
                    I found out that the deepest, 
                    truest love of my life, was really 
                    my half sister born as a result of 
                    my father s secret double life, I 
                    was devastated.

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                          (rapidly, dramatically)
                    It seems that, unable to process 
                    the cosmic joke that had just 
                    happened to her, Jane s mind had 
                    jumped to the only other event that 
                    was even remotely as outrageous --

                                  RUBIO
                    I got through that, Jane.  And you 
                    will get through this.  

      And then, Luisa s voice interrupts --

                                  LUISA
                    I am so sorry, Jane --

      And just like that, Rubio is gone.  Jane is back in real 
      time.  Xiomara is furious, she gets up --

                                    XIOMARA
                    You re sorry?  You should be in jail, 
                    lady, you should be locked up--

                                  JANE
                          (quietly)
                    Mom.                                                                            30


      Xiomara sits back down.  Meanwhile Luisa continues: 

                                  LUISA
                    There are options of course.  You 
                    can have the baby or -- this is a 
                      prescription for -- a pill -- you 
                    can take -- 

      This lands on Jane.  Xo looks at her daughter.   So does, 
      Luisa.  Then, gently:

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                    You are under no obligation to 
                    consult with the father.  Though he 
                    knows and he would like to speak--

                                  JANE
                          (realizing)
                    The father...

      On Jane.  She didn t even think about the father.

                                  LUISA
                    He s in the next room.  Would you 
                    be willing to talk to him?

      Jane is in shock.  Numb almost.  Abruptly, she stands up.

                                    XIOMARA
                    Honey?

                                  JANE
                    I have to go...

                                    XIOMARA
                    Wait --

                                  JANE
                    No, mom.  I just...I have to go.

      And with that, she s gone, leaving Xiomara alone with Luisa.


      Rafael and Monica are sitting in silence when Luisa reenters.

                                  LUISA
                    She isn t ready to meet yet.  I m 
                    sorry --

      Monica turns to her, spits out years of venom --                                                                            31


                                  MONICA
                      You re...sorry?  Because she 
                    doesn t want to meet us or because 
                    your brother had testicle cancer 
                    and you just used his only sample 
                    on some stranger --

                                  LUISA
                          (quietly)
                    I m sorry...for all of it.

      She looks to her brother.  He holds her gaze.  Quietly...

                                  RAFAEL
                    You would never have told me.  If 
                    it didn t...take, you would never 
                    have told me.

      Luisa wants to protest, but she can t.  She looks away as we 
      PRELAP:  a baby crying.


      On: a Harried Mother tries to calm her Shrieking Baby.  
      REVEAL:  Jane, standing, staring at the baby.  Terrified.  
      The baby is crying harder and harder.  Jane looks like she s 
      going to burst into tears herself.  A seat opens up.  Another 
      Passenger goes to take it, but Jane needs to sit. Now.  She s 
      slightly too late, she looks to the Passenger, pulls the ace, 
        realizing...

                                  JANE
                    I m pregnant.

      Oh.  He gives her the seat.  Jane sinks down.  There s that 
      at least.  She looks up, sees the advertisement for The 
      Passions of Rubio.  Rubio stares back at her.  Jane 
      remembers, starts taking deep breaths -- in and out, in and 
      out...


                                  JANE
                    What s all this, I thought we were 
                    going out?

      She s noticing the candles are lit, the table is set.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I made dinner.   Grilled cheese...

      Jane reacts.  God, she loves him.  

                                  JANE
                    That sounds...perfect.

      She has to tell him, just has to say it.  She turns away, 
      puts down her purse on the hall table, psyching herself up:

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    But before we eat, I m officially 
                    giving you fair warning.  I m about  
                    to say some corny stuff.

      Jane turns, confused, to find:  Michael, down on one knee.  
      Holy.  Shit.  Michael smiles at her shock...

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Okay, ground rules.  You are not 
                    allowed to freak out because this 
                    is a moment we re gonna be telling 
                    our kids and grandkids about --

      Kids and grandkids.  Jane is looking at him, reeling --

                                  JANE
                    Michael. What are you doing?

                                    MICHAEL
                      Proposing. 

                                  JANE
                    But...I mean... 
                          (she s pregnant!)
                    ...our timeline --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Who cares about our timeline.  Or 
                    that you don t have your teaching 
                    degree, or that I haven t 
                      established my career, or that we 
                    have debts or whatever other 
                    reasons we have for waiting.  As of 
                    today, we ve been together three 
                    years.  
                          (off Jane, about to talk)
                                  (MORE)                                                                            33

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    And before you say anything -- I m 
                    not doing this because I want to 
                    have sex with you -- I mean I do 
                    want to have sex with you, three 
                    years is a really really long time -
                    - but that s not why I m proposing.  
                    I m proposing because  I want to 
                    spend my life with you.  And raise 
                    children with you. And have sex 
                    with you.

      Despite herself, Jane smiles.  He takes a deep breath:

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    So Jane Gloriana Garcia, will you--

      Shoot, he needs to know first!  Blurting out --

                                  JANE
                    Michael, I m pregnant. 

      And off Michael, in shock...

                                      End of Act Three                                                                            34


                                          Act Four


      Jane is now sitting, untouched champagne flutes in front of 
      her.   Michael is pacing, focused --

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    What will serve Michael Cordero Jr 
                    well in the illustrious detective 
                    career he will go on to have, is 
                    his ability to focus on facts --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Okay, I need you to tell me 
                      everything that happened, exactly 
                    as it happened-- 

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    Just cold, hard, facts.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We ll file criminal charges against 
                    that doctor-- how did it happen --

                                  JANE
                          (a little sharp)
                    Going over how it happened isn t 
                    going to change the fact that it 
                    happened.

      A beat.  Then:

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yeah, I know.  I know.  
                          (then, honest)
                    I m sorry.  I m just--I m freaking 
                    out a little, babe.

                                  JANE
                            (understanding)
                    Yeah, I know.  Me too.

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    And the fact was -- this sucked.

      She reaches for the champagne, takes a sip.  Then, 
        remembering, she spits it out.  He s staring at her.  

                                  JANE
                      I probably shouldn t drink.

      And off the two, reeling...                                                                            35



      Rafael, on the other hand, is drinking heavily.  So is Zaz, 
      who is taking in the news.  It should be noted:  the guys 
      have been friends since childhood. 

                                  ZAZ
                    Whoa.

                                  RAFAEL
                    Yeah.

      Dudes process differently.  Beat, then:

                                  ZAZ
                    And Luisa didn t tell you?

                                  RAFAEL
                    No.
                          (then)
                    She s dead to me.  

      Note:  This will come back to haunt Raf, in the third 
      episode, when Luisa ends up dead.  But you don t know that 
      yet.  Pretend you don t know that.


      And now we re back with Jane and Michael.  The doorbell 
      rings.  Damn.  He remembers...

                                    MICHAEL
                    I invited over our families.  
                          (then, wry)
                    I was pretty sure you d say yes --

                                  JANE
                    Michael.  I would ve--

                                    MICHAEL
                    Should we just act like you did?  
                    For now --

                                  JANE
                    Yes.
                          (means, I love you)
                    Yes.

      He nods, then slips the ring on her finger.  Both aware:  Not 
      the way this moment should have gone.


      Zaz and Rafael, two drinks deeper --                                                                            36


                                  ZAZ
                    An unexpected byproduct of cancer.  
                    They should put it in the manual-- 

                                  RAFAEL
                          (agreeing)
                    Possible side effects of being told 
                    you can t have kids will lead to 
                    you really wanting them.  Possibly 
                    in order to redo one s own screwed 
                    up childhood as an overpriced 
                    shrink told me.

                                  ZAZ
                    You see an overpriced shrink?

                                  RAFAEL
                    Once.  Luisa asked me to do a 
                    family session when she was going 
                    through her whole rehab thing.
                          (doesn t want to think 
                            about Luisa)
                    Whatever, yeah, I want the kid. 

      It s true.  He does.  Very much.  With certainty:

                                  RAFAEL (CONT D)
                    Monica will never go for it.

                                  ZAZ
                    Dude.  This is the girl who would 
                    not leave your side when you were 
                    going through chemo.  I m not gonna 
                    lie -- I thought she d bolt.
                          (Raf laughs a little)
                    Just sayin  I think you re 
                      underestimating her.

      On Rafael: not so sure...


      Establishing:  Jane s big family (aunts and uncles and 
      cousins) and Michael s big family. The engagement party in 
      full swing. We find Jane, talking to a concerned Xiomara --

                                    XIOMARA
                    Got it, I won t say anything, but 
                    baby, we need to talk about this --

                                  JANE
                    Later, mom, not now --

                                  ALBA
                    Jane!  there you are!                                                                            37


      It s Alba and her FOUR SISTERS.  All so excited.  Aunt Anita 
      (45, exuberant) hugs Jane. 

                                  AUNT ANITA  
                    Tell us about the proposal, mija!  
                    Was it so romantic?

                                  JANE
                          (beat, then forces smile)
                    Yeah.  It really was --

      Jane glances at Michael, across the room.  Deep in his own 
      awkward familial conversation.  

      ...And now we ZOOM to Michael with his grandparents:

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yup, it went pretty much perfect --

                        GRANDMAGRANDFATHER
      Good for you, Mikey --Good on ya, boy, good on ya --

      Michael s grandma is hugging him now.  Suddenly, Michael sees 
      his brother ANDRE entering.  Andre is 28.  In and out of 
      trouble his whole life.  Mostly in.  Dangerous.  Michael 
      stiffens.  He separates from his grandma, making his way over 
      to his dad, BOBBY -- union truck driver.  Bobby s looking 
      across the party at Andre as well:

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Mom must ve invited him.

      Bobby nods.  And off the two, slightly unsettled...


      Rafael is looking at his wife, surprised.

                                  MONICA
                    Of course I want the baby.  It s 
                    your child, so it s my child.

      Rafael is taking this in.  Maybe Zaz was right.  

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    We ll make your sister give us 
                      the...birth mom s number.  And then 
                    we ll convince her to let us adopt.  
                          (takes his hand)
                    And we ll have our child.  Which is 
                    all I want.  

      And off Rafael taking in her reaction...                                                                            38



      Tarot cards laid out.  One by one. REVEAL: Monica s mother, 
      Magda, dealing the cards.  She s careful.  Deliberate.  She 
      drops the last card.  A BLACK HEART dripping blood.  

      Her eyes close.  Not that.  Anything but that.


      Michael is talking to Andre, his older brother.   He and 
      Michael used to be tight. They re not anymore.  

                                  ANDRE
                    I was hurt man, that s all.  Not to 
                    get the invite from you.  After all 
                    we ve gone through, all we ve done 
                    together.

      Michael is looking at his brother.  Hears the implicit 
      threat.  He is even with him:

                                    MICHAEL
                    Didn t mean to hurt your feelings, 
                    Dre.  Glad you could make it.

                                  ANDRE
                    Uh-uh.  Don t treat me like that-- 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Like what?

                                  ANDRE
                    Like I m a bomb, that could go off. 
                    Which we know I could.  I mean, 
                    everyone here -- your fiancee -- 
                    they think you re such a good guy --

      And Michael s had enough.  He backs his brother around a 
      corner, quickly, effortless --


      And pushes him up against the wall.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Do not threaten me, do you 
                      understand --

      Michael s anger is hot, brewing.  They both feel it.  A beat, 
      then Andre smiles:                                                                            39


                                  ANDRE
                    Whoa, whoa.   I just came here to 
                      congratulate you on your 
                      engagement, that s all.  We re 
                    family.

      A beat.  And then Michael releases him.  Andre adjusts his 
      shirt.  Loses all trace of the threat from his tone.  He s 
      lighter --

                                  ANDRE (CONT D)
                    So?  Introduce me around.  I met 
                    Jane s mom.  Seems like a handful.  
                    Where s her pops?

      Michael is curt --

                                    MICHAEL
                    He s not a part of her life.

      As they head back into the living room --

                                  ANDRE
                    Oh yeah?  Bet there s a story there--

                                    MICHAEL
                    There s not a story --

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                          (interrupting, gossipy)
                    Okay, here s the story. Jane has 
                    never met her father.  


      Andre and Michael head past Xiomara.  We stay with Xo as she 
      checks her cell phone -- 

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    In fact, Xiomara herself hadn t 
                    seen Jane s father since the day 
                    she told him she was pregnant. 
                    Which was also the same day he told 
                    her to get rid of it.
                          (dramatically)
                    Until sixteen months ago, when she 
                    walked into Tito s Tacos --

                                                                    FLASHBACK TO:


      A bit of a dive, but the tacos are great.  Trust me.  A 
      Female Employee is watching the small TV Screen:  The 
      Passions of Rubio. Rubio is proposing to a beautiful blonde.                                                                               40


      In front of the cash register, a HANDSOME MAN (40 s) is 
      waiting impatiently to pay.  

                                  HANDSOME MAN
                    Can I get some help here?

                                  FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                    Sorry.  It s this new show...

                                  HANDSOME MAN
                    Yeah whatever, I m in a rush --

      On Xiomara.  Staring, shocked.  Like she s seen a ghost.

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    ...and saw Jane s father again.  
                    Right there.  In broad daylight.

      On Xiomara as she turns and rushes out.  Rattled.


      On Jane -- finally alone.  Writing.  It s how she relaxes.  
      She glances at the flower on her wall -- the symbol of her 
      virginity.  A knock on the door and then -- 

                                    XIOMARA
                    Let s talk Janie --

                                  JANE
                    Mom, I m not in the mood, I just 
                    want to write--

                                    XIOMARA
                    But baby, I know how you feel.  I 
                    was sixteen, when I got pregnant 
                    with you and I was so scared --

                                  JANE
                          (finally breaking)
                    And you were irresponsible.  You 
                    got pregnant because you were 
                      irresponsible. I don t even have a 
                    dad.
                          (as this lands on Xo)
                    And I ve done everything right.  My 
                    whole life, I ve tried to do 
                      everything right-- so that --

      She catches herself, stops.  But Xo gets it.

                                    XIOMARA
                    So you won t turn out like me.                                                                            41


                                  JANE
                          (beat,  I m sorry )
                    I said I didn t want to talk.

                                    XIOMARA
                          (nods, then)
                    I got the presciption.
                          (off Jane)
                    In case...

      She puts a bottle on Jane's desk.  It s the abortion pill. 

                                    XIOMARA (CONT D)
                    You don t have to have a baby.

      Jane looks at her mother.  A beat, then:

                                  JANE
                    Would you have had me?  If grandma 
                    hadn t made you?  

      Xiomara absorbs the implication - that Alba and her religious 
      beliefs stopped Xo from having an abortion.  We sense that 
      there s something more she wants to say here... but she holds 
      back.  

                                    XIOMARA
                          (honestly)
                    I m glad I had you --

                                  JANE
                    That s not what I asked.

                                    XIOMARA
                    Yeah, I know.

      And with that, she heads out of Jane s room, leaving the two 
      women estranged. And off Jane, looking at the pills, not sure 
      what to do.  

                                      End of Act Four                                                                            42


                                          Act Five


      Rafael shakes his father s hand.  REYNOLDO RAFAEL SOLANO 
      (early 60 s) is arrogant.  Oppressively successful.  Just ask 
      his kids.

                                  RAFAEL
                    How was Venezuela, dad?

                                  R.R.
                    Could have been Cambodia, I didn t 
                    leave the hotel--

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Well, I did.  And it was beautiful.

      Reveal his wife.  Rose. Yes, the same Rose that Luisa called 
      after the accident.  Her step-mother.  Who she clearly has 
      some complicated history with.  

                                  R.R.
                    It s funny, you open your 21st 
                    hotel, you lose sight of what a 
                    great accomplishment it is to even 
                    open one.  Congratulations, son, on 
                    opening one.

      Eeek.  Not the warmest dad --

                                  ROSE
                          (tries for casual, to Raf)
                    Will we be seeing your sister?

                                  RAFAEL
                    No.  We won t --

                                  MONICA
                    Something really terrible 
                      happened...

      And off Rose... she fears what s coming.


      Jane enters the hotel with Lina.  As they head towards the 
      service elevators, Lina jokes:

                                  LINA
                    I m just saying technically it s 
                    still a virgin birth.  So there s 
                    got to be some way to make money on 
                    it.  Just gotta ask yourself, how 
                    would Kris Jenner exploit this 
                      situation...
                                  (MORE)                                                                            43

                                  LINA (CONT'D)
                          (Jane laughs a little)
                    Okay good.  A smile at least.

      She puts a supportive arm around her friend as they round the 
      corner, heading past the Concierge Desk where Luisa is 
      waiting, her back to them.  We stay with Luisa as the 
      CONCIERGE hangs up the phone.

                                  CONCIERGE
                    I m sorry, Ms. Alves.  Your brother 
                    has asked us not to let you up to 
                    his suite.

      She is embarrassed.  Lies.

                                  LUISA
                    Yeah, okay.  We re meeting later 
                    anyway.

      She starts to walk away when she spots Jane and Lina, heading 
      into the service elevator.  A beat as Luisa absorbs this. 
      Then, she takes out her phone, texts her brother. Jane works 
      here.  The mother.  A beat, and then Rafael answers:  Where 
      are you?


      Monica lets herself into the hotel room as she talks on the 
      phone:                                                                            44


                                  MONICA
                    Well, hurry up.  I don t know how 
                    long I have.


      Jane approaches Rafael.  Nervous.  Not sure what he wants.

                                  JANE
                    Hi...?

                                  RAFAEL
                          (stands, then)
                    Jane.

                                  JANE
                    Look, I m sorry if I was out of 
                    line the other night--

                                  RAFAEL
                    I m the father.

                                  JANE
                    What?

                                  RAFAEL
                    Of the baby you re carrying.

      On Jane:  Reeling.  Overwhelmed.  She sits down.  He sits 
      down next to her.  

                                  RAFAEL (CONT D)
                    And I m sorry about the other day 
                    too...

      Neither knows quite what to say.  Silence, then:

                                  JANE
                    I used to work at the Key Biscayne 
                    Yacht club.
                          (off Rafael)
                    That s where we know each other 
                    from...

      He is staring at her, then suddenly he smiles.

                                  RAFAEL
                    Oh!  Yes...

                                  JANE
                    You don t have to act like --

                                  RAFAEL
                    I came after tennis at the end of 
                    the summer and the restaurant was 
                    closed --                                                                            45


      As he recalls the memory, QUICK CUTS as we FLASHBACK:


      A YOUNGER RAFAEL: knocking against the restaurant door--  The 
      sign on the door reads: CLOSED.  

                                  RAFAEL (O.S.)
                    But you let me come in anyway.

      CUT TO:  YOUNGER JANE goes up, opens the door as:

                                  RAFAEL (CONT D)
                    And you made me a killer grilled 
                    cheese sandwich.  

      CUT TO:  Rafael sitting at a table.  Jane puts down a hot 
      grilled cheese which brings us back to the present:  


      TIGHT ON Monica:

                                  MONICA
                    You didn t drop the cancer card?

      And we INTERCUT with Rafael:  in the hallway of the hotel.

                                  RAFAEL
                          (disgusted)
                    The cancer card --

                                  MONICA
                    Stop, you know what I mean.  Did 
                    you tell her that it was your only 
                    chance to have a biological child?

                                  RAFAEL
                    No --

                                  MONICA
                    Why not?

                                  RAFAEL
                    Look, she was really upset, I 
                    couldn t just--

                                  MONICA
                    Oh, give me a break --                                                                            48


                                  RAFAEL
                    What?

      Ssst!  Monica looks over.  REVEAL: Zaz naked in bed with her.  
      He gives her a look, cool it.  Monica rolls her eyes.  Then:

                                  MONICA
                          (into phone)
                    Fine, I ll play bad cop if that s 
                    what this is about--

                                  RAFAEL
                          (at a loss)
                    No.  It s not...
                          (then)
                    Just don t do anything, don t say 
                    anything.  I mean it.  We ll talk 
                    more later.

      And with that, he hangs up...


      As Jane enters her dark room, she hears a voice:  

                                  ALBA
                    You ve broken my heart.

      Jane turns on the light to find her grandmother sitting on 
      her bed.  She s holding the abortion pill, the words  to 
      terminate pregnancy  clear on the label. 

                                  JANE
                    Abuela, it s not what you think --

                                  ALBA
                    I think you have lied to me.  For a 
                    very long time.

                                  JANE
                    I didn t.  I got... accidentally...

      She stops.  Then:

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I don t know how to say it in 
                    Spanish actually--

                                  ALBA
                    You had sexual relations --

                                  JANE
                    No, no, I didn t, Abuela.  The 
                    doctor made a mistake.  And at my 
                      appointment she...accidentally...                                                                            49


      Again -- what s the word?  She tries -- delicately -- to 
      describe it --

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Put a sample from a man...into me.

                                  ALBA
                    A sample from a man?

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  From his...

      Starting to indicate where -- worst charades game ever.

                                  ALBA
                          (suddenly gets it)
                    Oh!

                                  JANE
                    Yes!

                                  ALBA
                          (realizes)
                    Oh.

      Jane nods.  Her grandma is reeling --

                                  ALBA (CONT D)
                    And you got pregnant?

      Jane nods.  Alba reacts.  It s overwhelming.  She makes the 
      sign of the cross.  

                                  ALBA (CONT D)
                    Then this is one of those moments 
                    when faith is tested --

      She looks at the abortion pill. 

                        JANEALBA
      Abuela, please --You have to hear this --

                                  JANE
                    But I know how you feel--

                                  ALBA
                    No, you don t know this.
                          (then)
                    When your mother came home at 16 -- 
                    and told me she was pregnant... 
                    I told her to have an abortion.

                                  JANE
                    What?                                                                            50


                                  ALBA
                    And she said no, thank god.  

      Jane absorbs this bombshell --

                                  JANE
                    She never told me that--

                                  ALBA
                    I asked her not to.  

      This lands on Jane.  Her mother was protecting her 
        grandmother.  Her mother chose to have her.  Alba continues:

                                  ALBA (CONT D)
                    But I carry that shame in my heart, 
                    every day.  Because now -- you are 
                    the best part of my life.
                          (then, meaning it)
                    And this will be the best part of 
                    your life, too...

      And off Jane, taking this in. Unsure.


      Luisa opens the door to find Rose standing there.

                                  ROSE
                    I heard she s pregnant.  

      Luisa nods.  A beat, then:

                  ROSE (CONT D)LUISA
      I m sorry--   worry, it was my *Don t
                                                    decision not to tell Rafael --*

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                    Yeah, but I --

                                  LUISA
                          (firmly)
                    It was my decision. 

      Rose nods.  Looks at her.  Then:

                                  ROSE
                    Are you okay?

                                  LUISA
                    Well, I ve lost my wife, my 
                    brother, my job --

                                  ROSE
                    How can I help?                                                                            51


      Luisa looks at her.  A beat.  Then, she smiles. 

                                  LUISA
                    See here s where I get confused.  
                    Step mother?  College roommate?  
                    Something else?

                                  ROSE
                    I should go.

                                  LUISA
                    Probably a good idea.

      A beat.  And then Rose leaves as Luisa s phone rings.  Luisa 
      looks at the I.D. and reacts, surprised:

                                  LUISA (CONT D)
                    Hello.

                                  MONICA
                    I need your help.  And in exchange, 
                    I ll convince your brother not to 
                    report you to the medical board. 

      And off Luisa, with a shred of hope, something....


      Jane opens the door to find Michael -- 

                                  JANE
                    You re early--

                                    MICHAEL
                    Just got called into work --

                        JANEMICHAEL
      Oh --Yeah, so I wanted to just 
                                                  stop by.  To talk real quick 
                                                  in person, you know?

                                  JANE
                    Sure, great.  Yeah...

      Her phone rings.  Dr. Alves.  She sends it to voicemail:

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  Go on.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Janie...I want to say that I ll 
                    support you no matter what --
                          (as Jane reacts, relieved)
                    Wait.  That s what I want to say.  
                    But that's not the way I feel.
                    We re starting our life together.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                            52

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    And I don t want to start it with 
                    you having some other guy's kid.
                    And I m sorry if that makes me a 
                    bad person but that s how I feel.  
                          (meaning it)
                    Please.  Don t have this baby.

      And off Jane, taking this in...truly torn.

                                      End of Act Five                                                                            53


                                            Act Six


      A small club in a strip mall. We are blasted by the opening 
      music of Shakira s  Whenever, Forever!   The performer s back 
      is to us; she s in a glittering, short dress, her hips 
      gyrating back and forth --

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    After her teenage boyfriend, 
                    Rogerio, told her not to have the 
                    baby, Xiomara Gloriana Garcia had a 
                    real problem.   

      The performer turns! It s Xiomara!  And she s actually pretty 
      good.  But here s the thing:  Shakira became Shakira at 19 
      and Xo is pushing 40.  Not that you d know it -- 

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    She knew she wanted the baby.  But 
                    she also knew she did not want 
                    Rogerio.  

      Xo s singing; she s shaking her hips:  Whenever, Wherever/ 
      We're meant to be together...

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    Aside from being a dropout with no 
                    ambition sans a faint desire  to 
                    become famous someday , Rogerio was 
                    also, to put it bluntly, a weasel.  

      I ll be there and you'll be near/ And that's the deal my dear 

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (CONT D)
                    When Rogerio was caught selling 
                    fake I.D. s and was deported back 
                    to Venezuela, it felt like a sign.

      You re over!  You re under!  And we FLASHBACK TO:


      A younger Alba staring at 16-year old Xiomara.  In shock. 

                                    YOUNGER XIOMARA
                    It s true.  I m pregnant.  

      Alba feels weak.  She leans against the table.  A WHITE 
      FLOWER has fallen from the vase.  Alba picks it up.

                                  ALBA
                    And who...is the father?                                                                            54


                                    YOUNGER XIOMARA
                          (beat, then lies)
                    Some army guy.  I didn t get his 
                    last name.

      Alba reacts, her hand instinctively crushing the white 
      flower.  She opens her hand again.  It s an image reminiscent 
      of our opening.  Alba stares at the flower.  It s ruined.


      Xiomara is finishing her Shakira song! There's nothing left 
      to fear/ If you really feel the way I feel...

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    And so, Xiomara kept Jane s 
                    father s identity a secret.  And 
                    until Tito s Tacos --she had never 
                    looked back.

      And she finishes to applause!  Xo smiles.  REVERSE ON: her 
      P.O.V.  Jane s there. Standing in the audience.  Clapping the 
      hardest.


      Jane and Xiomara are sitting at a table, mid-conversation.  
      Xiomara s explaining -- 

                                    XIOMARA
                    Abuela asked me never to tell you 
                    what she said.  And I didn t want 
                    you to look at her differently, 
                    so...

                                  JANE
                    Look at you, being all selfless...
                          (then, serious)
                    But no more secrets, okay? 

      Xiomara reacts, a flicker of guilt.  But then, she nods.  
        Redirecting:

                                    XIOMARA
                    I just wanted you to know you had a 
                    choice.  Because having one -- it 
                    helps, I think. 
                          (then)
                    Whatever you decide.

      Jane takes this in.  A beat, then --

                                  JANE
                    Dr. Alves left me a message.  
                    The... father, Rafael, he had 
                    cancer.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                            55

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    This was his only sample and he and 
                    his wife are this great couple, 
                    loving and wonderful and all they 
                    want is a child--


      Juxtaposed with: Monica staring at her husband in shock.

                                  MONICA
                    You want a divorce?

                                  RAFAEL
                    I do.  I m sorry --

                                  MONICA
                    I took care of you when you were 
                    sick --

                                  RAFAEL
                          (honest)
                    Which is why I didn t do this a 
                    year ago.  And I think, if you re 
                    being honest, you knew that.  And 
                    I m also pretty sure that s the 
                    reason you used my sample --

      Monica slaps him.  He is surprised.  A beat, then:

                                  RAFAEL (CONT D)
                    And regardless -- we seem to bring 
                    out an ugly side in each other.  
                    Don t you think?

      And with that, he heads out, leaving her alone.  Furious.


      But this room is not occupied by guests.  It s set up for 
      surveillance.  Three detectives have clearly been camped here 
      for a while.  Among them, Michael.  He s talking to FRANK 
      COOPER aka  Coop  -- weathered, seen in all. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nothing, sir.  He had some girl in 
                    there, but she took off.  Drug 
                    shipment hasn t come in yet --

      Coop looks through the binoculars, across the U-shaped hotel, 
      to:  a room on the other side. His P.O.V.  Zaz. 

                                  COOP 
                    It s coming.  Zazo s the contact, 
                    I m positive.
                          (then)
                    I.D. the girl--                                                                            56


                                    MICHAEL
                    Already sent the images down to the 
                    station. 

      Coop nods.  And Michael heads out, leaving him to watch the 
        surveillance cameras in Roman Zazo s hotel room.


      Monica slugs back a drink as the land line rings.  She picks 
      it up:

                                  MONICA
                    Hello?  
                          (then)
                    No, this is his wife.  
                          (then)
                    Jane.  Yes, of course...hello--


      It s the end of the night.  Xo is packing up her makeup bag 
      when we hear a knock at the door.    The CLUB MANAGER 
      (sleazy, 40 s) sticks his head in.

                                  CLUB MANAGER
                    Some guy s here to see you, Xo.

                                    XIOMARA
                    If it s Gary tell him I m serious, 
                    I don t want to see--

                                  CLUB MANAGER
                    It s not Gary.

      Annoyed, Xo turns around.  Then she reacts, stunned.

      REVERSE TO REVEAL:  It s Rubio, the telenovela star!  Though 
      in real life, his name is ROGERIO DIAZ.  And we FLASHBACK TO:


      We see the scene again. Xiomara enters.  A Female Employee is 
      watching TV.  A Handsome Man is waiting impatiently to pay.  

                                  HANDSOME MAN
                    Can I get some help here?

                                  FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                    Sorry.  It s this new show...

                                  HANDSOME MAN
                    Yeah whatever, I m in a rush --                                                                            57


      But Xiomara is staring past the Handsome Man, to 
      Rubio/Rogerio on the television screen.  Like she s seen a 
      ghost.

      BACK TO THE PRESENT.  Rogerio is looking at Xo, angry --

                                    ROGERIO
                    How could you keep my daughter a 
                    secret all these years?

      And before Xo can answer --


      And now Michael s back at the station.  An envelope on his 
      desk.  He opens it.  Looks through the pictures.  Zaz and 
      Monica in the act.  (Though at this time, Monica means 
      nothing to him.  That will change in the future).  Suddenly, 
      he hears a little hooting and hollering.  Calls of  Michael!   
       Get your ass out here! 

      He exits into the bullpen --


      Where Jane is waiting.   Dressed to the nines.  Maybe mom 
      helped her a little.  Slightly over the top, but she looks 
      sexy.  Michael s completely confused.  A few cat-calls and 
      wolf whistles from the cops and office personnel watching.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Babe.  What are you doing here?

                                  JANE
                    Trying to be brave.  And top on my 
                    list is showing you -- in public, 
                    how I feel about you --

      Whistles.  Whoo!  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    But before I propose...
                          (off Michael, surprised)
                    You need all the facts.  And the 
                    fact is... I m having the baby.  

      And now the other cops are a little confused.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    And we re going to give it to the 
                    father.  He and his wife really 
                    want it, they re a great couple--


      Rafael is looking at his wife in shock.                                                                            58


                                  RAFAEL
                    She s giving us the baby?

                                  MONICA
                    She wants it to grow up in happy 
                    home.  Where both parents want it.

      Rafael reacts.  Monica smiles.

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    So under the circumstances, I 
                    thought it best not to mention our 
                    previous conversation.  

      No mistaking the threat there.  And off Rafael.  Stuck.


      Michael is looking at Jane.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yeah, okay.  I m okay with that.

      Jane smiles.  Relieved.  Okay.  A beat, then, she gets down 
      on one knee.  Or tries to.  The dress doesn t allow.  She 
      adjusts.  Gets on two knees.  He s looking at her.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    You can stand --

                                  JANE
                    Can I?  Great, thanks...

      A few laughs from the cops as she gets up.  Then, she takes a 
      deep breath.  She s really nervous.  This is hard.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Okay. I m not good at this stuff. 
                          (another deep breath)
                    So instead of telling you all the 
                    reasons I love you, I m going to 
                    tell you all the reasons I don t.
                          (off Michael)
                    I don t love you because you are 
                    smart.   And kind. I don t love you 
                    because you re hard-working and 
                      competitive and way too defensive --

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m not defensive --

      She s smiling.  He smiles too.                                                                            59


                                  JANE
                    I don t love you because you re 
                      determined.  And honorable.  And 
                    funny--

                                  PRANKSTER COP
                          (calling out)
                    Who says he s funny?

                                    ANOTHER COP
                    Shut it, Rodriguez.

      Jane smiles.  But she s looking at Michael. 

                                  JANE
                    I don t love you because you re 
                      incredibly sexy.

      Cat calls from the cops.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I love you because you are my best 
                    friend.  And because I want to grow 
                    old with you.  And because right 
                    now, I m confused about every 
                    single thing in my life...
                          (meaning it)
                    Except you.

      Moved, Michael takes her into his arms and they kiss to 
      cheers and whistles.  As we go tight on the KISS, romantic 
      music starts to come up...

                                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR
                    And in that moment, in the arms of 
                    the man she thought she knew so 
                    well, Jane Gloriana Garcia really 
                    believed that to be true.

      And on this cryptic tease we FREEZE ON THE KISS.  Then, Typed 
      across the screen:  To...Be...Continued.

                                        End of Pilot.
