      Earth plummets past, revealing the pale, glowing face of-- 

      THE MOON.

      Its ragged surface fills FRAME. CAMERA WHIZZES PAST a busy 
      MINING SITE, ablur with activity, settling a mile away:


      A MOON BUGGY idles. TWO ASTRONAUTS in bright orange 
      spacesuits work on a crashed satellite. 

                                  MARTY
                    It s toast. 

      MARTY THURGOOD, 21, is the prosaic American astronaut. All 
      the right stuff: clean cut, square-jawed and confident. Right 
      now, he s elbow deep in the satellite. 

                                  LEON
                    How does that happen? Old age? 

      LEON, 45, is the opposite of  astronaut : unshaven, unkempt 
      and uncomfortably corpulent. 

                                  MARTY
                    Sabotage. 

      Marty plucks out a hair-thin strand of silicone with 
      mechanized pliers. The end is SPLIT and SINGED. 

                                  LEON 
                    Probably Russians...  

                                  MARTY
                    They are history s villains. 

      Marty peers at the underside of the satellite, an odd shaped 
      ROCK catching his eye. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Check this out.

                                  LEON
                    It s a rock.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 2.


      Brushing the Moon dust away, the rock is brown. If you didn t 
      know any better, you d think it was a piece of wood.

                                  MARTY
                          (intrigued)
                    No... it s a root.

      Marty quickly bounds away, tracing the path of the 
      underground root. He stops suddenly, awe covering his face. 
      Leon steps up beside him, eyes widening.  

                                  LEON
                    What... is that?

      A BRIGHT RED FLOWER stands stark against the drab white of 
      the Moon s loam, from which it s apparently sprouted.

                                  MARTY
                    It s a flower...

      The men stare, captivated. At a loss. With a small shrug, 
      Marty plucks the flower. Immediately, a RUMBLE deep in the 
      Moon. He looks from the flower in his hand to Leon.

                                  LEON
                    Do we have earthquakes on the moon?

                                  MARTY
                    Not by definition...

      A GIANT FIREBALL ERUPTS from a vent in the Moon s surface ten 
      feet from them, sending them stumbling back. As quickly as it 
      shoots up, the fire disappears in the vacuum of space. 

      Marty turns and bolts back for the buggy, Leon right behind.  

      Suddenly: WHUMP! The ground shudders again, then DISAPPEARS! 
      Marty, Leon, moon buggy, satellite -- everything in a half-
      mile radius is swallowed by a yawning SINKHOLE. 

      A tenuous moment of stillness... before-- 

      A MASSIVE, SILENT EXPLOSION turns the sinkhole inside out -- 
      rocketing everything it just ingested, along with with a 
      healthy portion of the Moon s rocky penetralia, into SPACE.

      All of it shoots into the firmament, fodder for what will be  
      the Moon s very first debris-ring. OFF THIS DISASTER:

                                    END OF TEASER  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 3.


                                        ACT ONE


      From within the beautiful, blue effusion of the Earth s 
      casually decanting atmosphere--

      FOOOSH! A SLEEK SHUTTLE glides lithely by. The ship s tail 
    fin sails past, revealing an art-deco red and white logo: 
       HUSSY GALACTIC.  *

                                                                            CUT TO:

    THE SAME LOGO, now embossed on a capped drinking glass. 
      WIDENING, REVEAL:


      A little PUFFT! of exhaust coughs out from her attractive 
      hairpin every few seconds. Ian joins her.

                                  EVE
                      Form-fitting, oxygen recycling 
                    force fields. 

                                  IAN
                    Beta testing? 

                                  EVE
                    Omega testing. I am wearing it.  *

      She taps on his helmet.

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                    You still get oxygen from your 
                    suit. Don t run out.   

      She gestures just off the dock. Below, Armstrong and Aldrin s 
      original landing site, complete with flag, footprints and the 
      plaque they left behind, all preserved as a monument. Beyond, 
      the under-construction Hussy Dome looms in the distance.  *

                                  IAN
                          (re: the dome)
                    That yours?

                                  EVE
                    Yes. And when it opens to the 
                    Moon s first recreational visitors 
                    in three months, we ll finally be 
                      delivering on the commitment made 
                    by this monument. 
                          (off him)
                    The Moon and her helium aren t just 
                    an energy drink to quench Earth s 
                    thirst for fuel. 
                                  (MORE)  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 7.

                                  EVE (CONT'D)
                    She s a medal pinned in the night 
                    sky to commemorate mankind s 
                    greatest accomplishment and remind 
                    everybody we re capable of more.  

                                  IAN
                    Very inspirational. 

                                  EVE
                    It s going to stay that way. That 
                    little lander didn t just carry two 
                    men to the Moon, it carried the 
                    promise of bringing the Moon to 
                    everyone on Earth, and I m not 
                    going to let sabotage, revenge or 
                    justice break that promise.   

      Eve offers a polite smile. Ian nods, respect growing. 

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                    Good luck with the General.

      She nods to a metal elevator in the side of a nearby rise. A 
      red, white and blue sign above it reads: 

      U.S. PROPERTY: NO TRESPASSING. 

      OFF IAN, POP WIDE. The MOON FILLS FRAME, ROTATING SLOWLY.  

                                  GALE (PRE-LAP)
                    The entire Moon is just bigger than 
                    Africa, and the five countries 
                      scratching helium-3 out of its 
                    green cheese share an area no 
                    bigger than the Sahara.

      WIDEN FURTHER TO REVEAL we are now:


    She attaches the YELLOW BOX to a burned-out piece of MOON-
      BUGGY. In front of her, the infinity of space is blurred by 
      spinning Moon rocks and broken mining equipment. 

    She pauses, feeling uneasy, like she s being watched. She 
      looks over her shoulder, and we see she s surrounded by --

      A FIELD OF INTERSECTING LASER BEAMS stretching back to the 
      Moon s surface.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 13.


                                  YAMA
                    Marker 7-1-1 coming online... Now. 

      She flips a switch on the yellow box and BZZOOUU, another 
      LASER BEAM shoots back toward the surface. 

                                  YAMA (CONT D)
                    Velocity, rotation, altitude place 
                    this in locus 276. More Moon Buggy. 

      She continues in silence. The only sound is her own breath. 
      It s eerie. Wary, she glances over her shoulder, just as --

      AN ASTRONAUT DRIFTS PAST HER.  

      She GASPS, but quickly composes herself when she sees the 
      dead, twisted face inside the suit -- LEON, the astronaut 
      from the Teaser. She shudders... then notices something else:

      A few yards away, a large CURVED PIECE of SCORED METAL. She 
      quickly attaches another YELLOW LASER MARKER to it. 

                                  YAMA (CONT D)
                    Marker 7-1-2, code for priority. It 
                    looks like ordnance.  Repeat, 
                    Marker 7-1-2 is a piece of a bomb! 

      She stops as she sees something floating behind the ordnance. 

      Small. Red... A FLOWER. 

      It cartwheels in place, mesmerizing. Ethereal to the point 
      that its reality is dubious. Yama stares, transfixed.

      She gingerly grabs the delicate flower, but no sooner do her 
      fingers wrap around it than a shadow comes over her. 

      Yama glances up to see what blocked the light. ANOTHER DEAD 
      ASTRONAUT floats toward her. 

      She reaches out to push it away, but its limp arm suddenly

      GRABS HER BACK! 

      She SCREAMS as the ASTRONAUT CLUTCHES for her, LETTING GO OF 
      THE FLOWER as she tries to wrench free. 

                                  MARTY
                    Stop hitting me!  *

                                  YAMA *
                    You re alive! *  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 14.


      We get our first clear look at MARTY -- haggard but alive. As 
      he bear hugs onto her for dear life: 

                                  END OF ACT ONE  HIGH MOON 06/12/1315.


                                        ACT TWO


      The SUN CRESTS over the horizon, inching back the terminator 
      (the line where the sun s light meets the Moon s dark side). 

      Suddenly: BUH-THUNK! A SMALL METEORITE crashes into the 
      Moon s dust. As it settles, we get a clear view of the 
      projectile:  TITLEIST.  It s a golf ball. 

      A Moon Buggy rumbles up and GALE piles out, grabbing a GOLF 
      CLUB. He pays no heed to the SMALL RED LIGHT BLINKING in the 
      darkness beyond the terminator, like the puff of a cigarette 
      in a dark alley. Instead he lines up his shot. 

                                  GALE
                    You re running out of oxygen. 

      The terminator recedes with the rising sun, exposing a pair 
      of boots in the darkness. 

                                    MYSTERY MAN
                    I always carry a spare.   

      The sun reaches the man s face, revealing STAN -- the Russian 
      Karaoke singer, now speaking perfect English. He pops in his 
      back-up O2 container and his blinking red light turns green. 

                                  GALE
                    Any scuttlebutt on an indentured 
                    miner named Martin Thurgood? Might 
                    be our trigger man. 

                                  STAN
                    Never heard of him. Everybody s 
                    pretty hush-hush in the Motherland.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 19.


                                  GALE
                    They got something new to hide? 

                                  STAN
                    Just the tunnel we ve been digging. 
                    New plan is to bury it before you 
                    find it.

                                  GALE
                    Even with all your sabotage and 
                      subterfuge, that Russian funnel s 
                    still nipping at my moonshine. 

                                  STAN
                    They haven t turned it on yet. 

      Gale looks up, confused. 

                                  GALE
                    Then who the hell else is stealing 
                    our helium? Our output is down 13 
                    percent from last month... 

                                  STAN
                    The Russians are losing yields, 
                    too. What do you know about this 
                    Thurgood guy?

                                  GALE
                    Small potatoes felon. Presumed dead 
                    in the blast, but showed up alive 
                    babbling about a flower the same 
                    day his well-connected brother 
                      coincidentally arrived. Whole thing 
                    stinks like fish. 

                                  STAN
                    I ll put a word-worm in the 
                      communications database and see if 
                    he turns up. 

      Gale pauses, thinking. 

                                  GALE
                    Any chance you haven t heard 
                    anything because they found out 
                    you re sabotaging their siphon?  

                                  STAN
                    They ve had plenty of opportunities 
                    to kill me and haven t yet.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 20.


                                  GALE
                    Never too late to start. Don t get 
                    cocky. 

      Gale swings back his club and THWACK! the golf ball 
      disappears in a cloud of Moon dust, MATCH CUT TO:

      The DUST kicked up by a MOON BOOT stamping down. We are:


      Marty and a Sergeant named HORTON stand on the precipice of 
      the giant sinkhole.  

                                  MARTY
                          (wary)
                    How come my brother didn t join us? 

                                  HORTON
                    This isn t exactly an official, on-
                    the-books sort of thing. He s 
                    trying to help you prove your story 
                    without compromising himself. 

                                  MARTY
                    Sounds like my brother, all right.   *

      Marty moves away from the sinkhole. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    The flower was growing over there. 

      Horton follows him, then pulls out a small device and holds 
      it to the ground. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Ground penetrating radar? 

                                  HORTON
                          (nodding)
                    There s a cavern beneath here...

                                  MARTY
                    There were no mining tunnels this 
                    far out, right?

                                  HORTON
                    Not even close. 

                                  MARTY 
                    The fireball came out of that vent 
                    there. Maybe where there s a 
                    flower, there s a garden...  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 21.


      Marty and Horton peer into the vent. 

                                  HORTON
                    You go first. 

                                                                          UPCUT TO:


      Horton glances over the edge of the vent. 

                                  HORTON
                    I m right behind you... 

      But instead, he rises and walks back toward his buggy.


        KABOOOOOOOOOOM! A COUGH OF MOON DUST BELCHES OUT RIGHT AFTER 
      HIM. Marty, gasping in pain, collapses, the fresh blood on 
      his suit standing stark against the white Moon.

                                  END OF ACT TWO  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 24.


                                      ACT THREE


      Emergency lights cast an unnatural glimmer over a deep crater, 
      filled with stilled mining drills and abandoned Moon buggies. 
      Various man-made ledges on the crater s steep wall lead into 
      the base beyond, and portend a similar silence within. CAMERA 
      SWOOPS THROUGH THE MAIN AIRLOCK and INTO:


      Filipov and Trofim frog march Marty and Stan toward their 
      waiting buggy. Filipov and Marty have similar confused 
        expressions. Trofim is silent, glowering. 

                                    FILIPOV
                    Sir... why is the corporal in 
                      handcuffs? And who--   

                                  TROFIM
                    Because he s a spy.

                                  MARTY
                          (to Stan)
                    What s the deal with you two? 

      Stan realizes something. Stops suddenly, turning. 

                                  STAN
                          (to Trofim)
                    You put a tracking device in the 
                    ring, didn t you? What kind of 
                    partner does that?  

                                  TROFIM
                      Apparently it s a good thing I did.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 44.


                                    FILIPOV
                    You two are partners? 

                                  MARTY
                    What s going on?

                                    FILIPOV
                    Partners in what?

                                  TROFIM
                    We re not partners. Not any more.

                                  MARTY
                      Everybody s getting louder...

                                    FILIPOV
                          (lightbulb)
                    Oh my God, you re both spies. 

      He stops and pulls his gun. 

                                    FILIPOV (CONT D)
                    Surrender your firearm, sir. 

                                  MARTY
                    Whoa...

      Trofim draws his gun. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Whoa!

                                  STAN
                    Everybody take it easy now. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Stand down, Private. That s an 
                    order.

        THUMPTHUMP-CRUUUUUNCHH! They all reel around as a GIANT 
      SHADOW CRAWLS OVER THEM. 

                                  MARTY
                    WHOA!

      A GIANT, 50 FOOT TALL TYRANNOSAURUS REX-LOOKING ROBOT JUST  *
      CRUSHED THEIR MOON BUGGY UNDER ITS HUGE FOOT!

      Stan and Trofim exchange a bewildered look. Marty is already 
      bolting as fast as he can. T-REX spots him and chases him--  *

      ITS GIANT FOOT COMES DOWN RIGHT ON TOP OF MARTY - and keeps 
      right on going, never breaking stride.    HIGH MOON  06/12/13 45.


      Stan winces, running to the spot of should-be squish, but 
      there s nothing -- MARTY IS SIMPLY GONE! 

      Stan stares agog as THE ROBOT LUMBERS AWAY. 

                                  END OF ACT FOUR  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 46.


                                        ACT FIVE


      Gale, Eve and the Marines are with him. As they march in, 
      wary, UPCUT TO: 


      Mikiko s safe and sound back at the rim -- the fail-safe. A 
      safe distance away, she strains to see down the hole: 

                                  MIKIKO
                    Yama? Marty? Are you there? *
                          (then)
                    Open Emergency Frequencies. Hailing 
                    General Gale Lynn Winehart!


      STAN and TROFIM bobble along. Stan offers Trofim his canteen. 

                                  STAN
                    What? You re gonna let yourself die 
                    of dehydration to spite me?

      Trofim relents, takes a swig. Stan looks relieved. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Where are we going? We can t go 
                    back to Russia.

                                  STAN
                    The Americans clearly aren t throwing 
                    open the doors anytime soon.

      Trofim shakes his head. 

                                  TROFIM
                    I can t sit by and watch you betray 
                    my country. I also can t turn you 
                    in or you ll be executed. 

                                  STAN
                    You could join me. 

                                  TROFIM
                    I m not a traitor.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 61.


                                  STAN
                    The Americans and Russians have 
                    been trying to kill each other 
                    forever. That doesn t fit into Eve 
                    Branson s utopia, so she keeps the 
                    peace. With me. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Guess you should ve been watching 
                    the Indians. 

                                  STAN
                    That s why we re hiring.  

                                  TROFIM 
                    Noble causes are subjective, and 
                    I ll always be loyal to my country.  

      Trofim leans back, rubbing his head, suddenly feeling woozy. 

                                  TROFIM (CONT D)
                    So what am I supposed to do? 

                                  STAN
                    Forget any of this happened. It s 
                    the only way to fix everything.

      Stan s up to something. Trofim looks at him, then the water 
      he was just drinking, realizing he s been drugged.

                                  STAN (CONT D)
                    The last 24 hours will be gone when 
                    you wake up. 

      As he gets groggier, Trofim shakes his head -- but behind the 
      disappointment lies the subtlest hint of relief in his eyes. 
      As he slumps over, Stan catches him and kisses the back of 
      his head. As Trofim s eyes shut, CUT TO:


      The Hussy Galactic Shuttle races over the surface.  *
