      Blossoms on trees.  Spring in the air.  And a cellphone 
      rings.  It s coming from...


      Kalinda starts toward her car in the parking lot.  Burton 
      follows.  Stops her.  Kisses her.  Kalinda lets him kiss her.  
      Arms limp.  Unmoved.

                                  BURTON
                    Okay, what am I doing wrong?

      Kalinda stares at him.

                                  KALINDA
                    Is that your car?

                                  BURTON
                    Yeah.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Get in it.

                                  BURTON
                    Why?

      Kalinda just shoots him a stare, and--

      --thirty seconds later-- klunk--he closes the door of his 
      four-wheel drive, in the driver s seat, window open.  Kalinda 
      outside.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Now what?

      Kalinda looks in the backseat.  Fishing equipment.  She 
      smiles.

                                  KALINDA
                    Three hundred miles, huh?

                                  BURTON
                    Seven hours.

      Kalinda nods, leans in, kisses him passionately through the 
      window.  Beyond passionately.  In control.  The door between 
      them.  Enjoying having the door between them.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Get in.

                                  KALINDA
                    No.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      28.

    But Kalinda hears a buzzing.  Looks toward the dashboard.  A 
      large fly there.  

                                  BURTON
                    What s wrong?
                          (it s not a fly; it s a bee)
                    Oh, yeah, some bees found their way 
                    into my backpack.  It s just-- 

    But Kalinda violently jumps away from the window.  Banging 
      against the car behind her.  Swiping at her hair.  Appalled.  
      Burton laughs...  

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                      What reyou--?  What s this, like 
                    Indiana Jones with the snakes?

    But Kalinda suddenly winces, feels her neck.  Shit, shit.

                                  KALINDA
                    I got stung.

                                  BURTON
                    What s wrong?

      Kalinda.  We see it on her face.  Alarm.  Alarm we haven t 
      seen there before.  She takes a second, thinking.  And hops 
      into action, racing toward her car.  Burton gets out.  
      Something s up.  Something serious. 

      Kalinda opens her car door, fumbling in a way we ve never 
      seen.  Searching her seat.  The backseat.  Damn, damn, damn.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Kalinda, you re freaking me out.

                                  KALINDA
                          (under her breath)
                    It s at the office.

                                  BURTON
                    What?  What is?

      Kalinda turns to Burton.  Calm:

                                  KALINDA
                    Tony, in about five minutes I m 
                    going into anaphylactic shock.  I 
                    need you to take me to the hospital-- 
                    Saint Anthony s is the closest-- and 
                    get on the phone with the emergency 
                    room; 
                                  (MORE)

                    tell them I misplaced my Epi-Pen 
                    shot, and I need an emergency 
                    injection of epinephrine.

      Burton gets it immediately.  Man of action.


      Beautiful grounds.  Beautiful wealthy person s house.  And...
