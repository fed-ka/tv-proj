Warner and Elle are seated at a cozy table on the patio.
Elle takes a sip from her freshly poured champagne flute.
Nervous and excited.
ELLE
Here' s to ~ us.
Warner is slower to sip his.
WARNER
The reason I wanted to come here tonight
was to discuss our future.
Elle is on the edge of her seat.
ELLE
I ' m fully amenable to that discussion.
WARNER
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now --
but things are gonna be different when
I ' m at Harvard Law school is a completely
different world. I need to be serious.
ELLE
Of course.
WARNER
My family expects a lot from me. And I
expect a lot from me. I .plan on running
for office some day.
ELLE
And I fully support that.

Elle takes a deep breath, filled with anticipation.
WARNER (CONT'D)
( ot n ig . .  > . ' .

I think we should break up.
Elle's champagne glass drops from her hand and CRASHES onto
the patio.
ELLE
What?
Elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard.
WARNER
I ' m sorry, Elle, I just --
ELLE
You're breaking up with me?!
(tearing up)
I thought you were proposing.
WARNER
Proposing?! Elle, If I ' m going to be a
politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not
a -- Marilyn.
ELLE
(stunned)
You're breaking up with me because I ' m
too -- blonde?
WARNER

ELLE
So when you said you'd always love me,
you were just "dicking around"?
Warner looks around the restaurant nervously.
WARNER
I do love you, Elle. I just can't marry you.
You have no idea the pressure I ' m under. My
family has five generations of senators. My
brother is in the top three at Yale Law. He

just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for crissakes.
Elle stares at him aghast, tears streaming down her face,
then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out.
WARNER (CONT'D)

It's not like I have a choice, sweetheart
He follows her out.

Elle teeters down the sidewalk as best she can in her three

convertible Saab.
WARNER
C'mon.
Let me take you home.
ELLE
No.
WARNER
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
Elle stops, thinks a minute, then gets in, still crying.
Catching her poofy little purse in the door. She re-opens

Warner pulls up in front. It's a starry, romantic night.
Everything should be perfect. It's not.

doing this, but I think it's the right
thing to do.

ELLE
How can it be the right thing if we're
not together?
WARNER .
I have to think about my future. And what
people expect from me.
ELLE
So you're breaking up with me because
you're afraid your family won't like me?
(through her tears)
Everybody likes me!
WARNER
East coast people are different.
ELLE
Just because I ' m not a Vanderbilt, all of
a sudden I ' m white trash? I grew up in
Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from
Aaron Spelling! I think most people
would agree that's way better than a
Vanderb ilt --
WARNER
I told you, Elle.
I need someone --
serious.
ELLE
I ' m seriously in love with you -- Isn't
that enough? He looks away.
WARNER
I ' m sorry.
She gets out of the car and drags herself up the stairs to
her sorority house. When she's at the top, she turns back to
look at him. His perfect cheekbones highlighted by the
streetlamp.
He meets her eyes, pained, but determined.
Then pulls away,
leaving her there.

Sweetheart, you don't need law school.
Law school is for people who are boring

Sapphire is in agreement.
SAPPHIRE
You were first runner-up in the Miss

Pale, studious LAW STUDENTS clad in earth tones, move into

In the distance, a HAPPY POP SONG (perhaps "Heaven Tonight by

A silver, convertible Boxster driving up, Elle at the wheel,/
MUSIC BLASTING. A large MOVING VAN follows the Boxster.

Elle's car stops in front of the dorm. She hops out,
scooping up Underdog and looking every inch the LA-Fred-Segal-

Elle looks at Underdog.
ELLE

She bends down to pour some Evian into his inflatable doggy

BURNED OUT 2L
Okay. Welcome to law school. This is the
part where we go around in a circle and
everyone says a little bit about
themselves. Let's start with you.
He gestures at a guy with glasses, DORKY DAVID.
DORKY DAVID
I have a Masters in Russian Literature, a
Ph.D in Biochemistry, and for the last
eighteen months, I've been de- worming
orphans in Somalia.
BURNED OUT 2L

He looks at Elle.
She sits up straight.
ELLE
I ' m a Gemini. I have a Bachelors degree

He smiles.
EMMETT
You have Stromwell.
ELLE

No, but she made me cry once. Not in

Warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his
side, presenting her.

hair behind her ear and there it is -- The Rock.

Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get

I want to be with you, Elle.
Forever.
He pulls her close, hand around her waist, kissing her. She
looks up at him, a trace of the old love in her eyes. For a
moment, she melts.
ELLE
.
'
I want to be with you, too, Warner.
After a moment, she steps back, removing his hand
from her
'
waist and wrenching it behind his back.
ELLE (CONT'D)
In court.
On opposing sides.
WARNER
(shocked)
Are you serious?

ELLE
Huh.
Imagine that.
Looks like I am.
She walks down the steps. Warner watches her go,
then turns
to see Sarah, who's witnessed the entire episode.
She glares
at him, then walks past.
WARNER
.
Sarah -- hold on.
.
She shoves him, knocking him on his ass, then rushes to .catch
up with Elle.
SARAH
(calling out)
El le , wait up --
Elle turns.

ELLE

They look at each other in a silent truce.
SARAH
So -- can we drink that champagne when I
get back from the pawnshop?
She pulls off her engagement ring.
ELLE

You're pawning The Rock?!
SARAH

Hell, yes. We've got finals to study
for. In Jamaica.
She smiles and heads off.
Elle smiles, processing this as
Em me tt approaches Elle.

EMMETT

ELLE
Are you asking me on a date?
EMMETT
-
As long as you realize I'm not just some
man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
ELLE

(joking)
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early
class tomorrow.

Perfect.
She heads down the stairs, stops and thinks a moment, then
runs back up --
-- Grabbing Emmett in a hellacious KISS. He kisses her back.
We CRANE UP as they embrace on the courthouse steps.

"Welcome Law Students Class of 2004" banners hang over
orientation tables. Nervous first year students stand in
line.
We PAN ACROSS a row of club tables -- passing "Harvard Law
.
Journal" and "Environmental Law Association" -- until we
reach a table that proudly bears the banner of "Blonde Legal
Defense Club".
Elle, in a red 2L t-shirt, stands behind the table,
straightening some flyers. UNDERDOG is plopped down on top
of the stack. Elle turns to see EMMETT next to her.

EMMETT
(re Underdog)
Someone missed you.
ELLE
Is he the only one?
EMMETT
What do you think?
They kiss.
EMMETT (CONT'D)
(continuing; re the crowd)
Looks like you're pretty popular.
Elle smiles, turning back as A NERVOUS 1L GIRL steps up.
NERVOUS 1L GIRL

ELLE
Only blonde at heart.
(to the girl next to her)
Right?
Elle smiles and looks down at -- the NEWLY BLONDE SARAH.
Sarah returns the smile as we PULL BACK to see a CROWD of
first year girls gathered around Elle's table, rushing to
sign up. Ready to be as blonde as they can be.
