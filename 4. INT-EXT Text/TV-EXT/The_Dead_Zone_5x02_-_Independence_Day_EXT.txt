          The quintessential American truck stop.  A scorching July
          sun assaults the dusty parking lot.  We FIND Bruce's Nissan
          Murano.

                                        DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
                        Happy fourth, friends and
                        neighbors.  Two hundred thirty
                        and the old girl's still kickin'...



          as he stomps through the parking lot; Johnny trails a
          half step behind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come on...  I was only kidding. 
                        So you were a late bloomer.  I
                        missed my prom with the flu. 
                        Sarah still hasn't forgiven me.

          Bruce stops in his tracks, spinning on Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's not about the prom, it's
                        about you and me.  You think it's
                        hard being a psychic?  Try being
                          a psychic's best friend.  That's
                        hard.

                        I mean, it'd be nice to spend
                        just one day without you peeking
                        inside my head.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Alright.

          Bruce's scowl ebbs.

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright?

                        hours, you've got my word.

          Johnny offers his hand. 

          Bruce hesitates, then shakes.  Something O.S. draws his
          concern...

                                        BRUCE
                        You can't be serious!!

                        What's wrong?


          REVERSE ON THE MURANO

          a large dent in the front fender; fresh white paint
          imbedded in the metal.


          RESUME ON BRUCE

          He scans the lot; the perpetrator long gone.

                                        BRUCE
                        Some jerk smashes into my car and
                        he doesn't leave note or anything. 
                        What is wrong with people today?

          Johnny steps to the fender, surveying the damage.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not so bad.

          CLOSE ON THE FENDER

          Johnny floats his palm across the damage... WHOOSH! 



          Johnny flashes out, rattled to the core by the vision. 
          Bruce is still checking out his bumper.

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't see any other damage.
                                (checks his watch)
                        Oh, dude, we are seriously behind

                        Bruce I just had a vision...

          Bruce reacts, both hands going up; halting Johnny in his
          tracks.

                                        BRUCE
                        If it's about me, or my car, I
                        don't want to hear it.  You gave
                        me your word.

          Bruce shoots Johnny an incredulous stare.  Johnny is
            resolute; his hand outstretched.

                                        BRUCE
                        As long as we get on the road.

          He tosses Johnny his keys and moves to get in the passenger
          seat. 

          Johnny palms the keys, gripping them tight.  No vision. 
          He reacts with disappointment. 

          Bruce looks back from beside the passenger side door...

          confines of their vehicles; milling about...

          in a bikini top and shorts, DENISE (30) spreading a beach
          towel across the hood of her car.  She hops up and proceeds
          to smear suntan lotion on her bronzed legs and stomach...

          Nearby, a trio of girthy BIKERS, cloaked in black leather,

          the shit.

          The bikers laugh heartily.  A young BOY and GIRL run past,
          trailing sparklers in their hands.  We STAY WITH them as
          they weave in and out of cars, right past...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me?

          She holds up her own phone.

                                        DENISE
                        There's no signal.  It's like
                        we're in some kind of... dead
                        zone.

          Johnny and Bruce exchange a knowing look.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's going on?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I met a girl.  She's pregnant.

                                        BRUCE
                          Pregnant?  You were only over
                        there for ten minutes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Very funny.  I think she might go
                        into labor any second.

                                        BRUCE
                        Out here?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Exactly.

                                        BRUCE
                                (thinks, then)
                        Maybe they can drive out on the
                          shoulder of the road.

          They look back at her again.

                        The shoulder is too narrow for a
                        car, plus there's drainage pipes
                        every hundred yards.  I checked.

          Johnny hands Bruce his phone, opening the Murano's
            passenger door; stepping up onto the seat for a better
          view.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey!  Watch the leather!

          Johnny scans the sea of traffic.  Something in the distance
            connects.  Bingo!  Johnny jumps down.

          He takes off through the parked cars.  SHOT HOLDS on Bruce.

          vehicles and random MOTORISTS, until he reaches a...


          POLICE CRUISER - HIGHWAY PATROL

          landlocked by the traffic; another victim of the
          congestion.  Johnny rounds the driver's side -- the car
          is empty.  As he peers in through the window...

                                        MASSEY (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

          Johnny TURNS to face...


          OFFICER J. MASSEY

          a man in his early thirties, crewcut; substantial physique
            straining against the confines of his police uniform. 
          His name tag reads J. MASSEY.

                          Officer, thank God you're here. 
                        There's a woman.  She's going to
                        need medical attention.

                        She's going to have a baby.  I
                        don't think we have much time.

                        Uh, no, I'm not.

                        Then what are we talking about?

                        If you could just get on your

                          A helicopter?  Alright, I've heard
                        enough.  You should go back to

                        It could be a matter of life and
                        death.

          Massey considers the look in Johnny's eyes and slips behind
          the wheel of his cruiser.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

          He picks up the handset.  (NOTE: THERE SHOULD BE A LABEL
            SOMEWHERE THAT READS "UNIT 557".)

          The speaker returns a volley of STATIC.

                        offline sometimes when it gets

          Johnny leans into the car, resting the palm of his hand
          on the doorframe.  A blast of STATIC erupts from the
          speakers... WHOOSH!



          Johnny has taken Officer Massey's place, wearing his
          uniform.  Speaking into the same handset; standing
            alongside his parked cruiser.  Just ahead... an old farm
          pickup; askew in a ditch.

          Officer Johnny drops the radio, replacing it with his
          service 9mm.  He approaches the truck with caution, the
          powerful pistol leading the way...


          JOHNNY'S POV - INSIDE OF THE CAB

          A beam of light dances across the tattered upholstery. 
          Drops of blood stain the fabric.  Shards of shattered
          glass everywhere.  Otherwise empty.


          BACK TO OFFICER JOHNNY

          heading back to his cruiser, holstering his weapon.  Back
          to the radio...

          On Johnny, considering what he just saw.

          The police officer raises an eyebrow, studying him
          curiously.

                                        JAKE (O.S.)
                        HEADS UP!

          Johnny reacts, looking up just in time to catch an incoming
          football... WHOOSH! 



          Lush rolling hills, a sprawling expanse dotted with
          headstones.  Observer Johnny stands alongside a MIDDLE
          AGED COUPLE, the woman sobs; her husband doing his best
          to comfort her.

          She kneels down at a grave marker, laying out a bouquet
          of flowers.  Addressing the stone through tears...

                                        MOURNING WOMAN
                        It doesn't make sense.  He was
                        only eighteen.  Nobody should die
                        at eighteen.

          Johnny comes around...


          THE HEAD STONE

          WHOOSH! 


  2424BACK TO JOHNNY

          Bruce is watching him as he flashes out of the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        July fourth... that's today.


          JAKE

          hovers by the Jeep, flanked by his friends; all staring
          at Johnny.

                                        JAKE
                        Hey, mister!  Little help!


          JOHNNY

          stares back at Jake.  Bruce can tell there's something
          wrong.

                                        BRUCE
                        What now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That kid is going to die today. 
                        I just saw his parents standing
                        over his grave.

                                        BRUCE
                        How? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  But I'm starting
                        think we both should have stayed
                        in the car.

          With that he launches the football back.

          Jake leaps for a perfect catch.  Lateraling the ball to
          an unsuspecting friend.  The football skims off his
          friend's fingertips, skittering end over end...

          SLAMMING off the windshield of the white pickup.


  2525CLOSE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR

    25CONTINUED:25

          Grim wobbles from the cab; clearly intoxicated.  He picks
          the football up off the pavement.

                                        JAKE
                        Sorry about that.

                                        GRIM
                        This belong t'you?

                                        JAKE
                        Yeah.  Can I have it back?

                                        HANK
                        Give the kid his football.

                                        GRIM
                        Sure thing, little brother.

          He pulls a significant hunting knife from his belt sheath,
          driving it mercilessly into the pigskin.  HISS!  He tosses
          the deflated ball back to Jake.

                                        GRIM
                        Here ya' go.

                                        JAKE
                                (angry)
                        What's your problem?

          Jake steps towards the big man holding the hunting knife. 


          JOHNNY

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, no.

          He rushes in, intercepting Jake before he can reach Grim.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whoa!  Take it easy! 

                                        JAKE
                        Guy just stabbed my football to
                        death!

                                        GRIM
                        Bring it on, college boy!

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not worth it, Jake.  He's
                        looking for a fight.

                                (taken aback)
                        Who are you?  How'd you know my
                        name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walk away and I'll explain. 
                        Please?  Just walk away.

          Jake hesitates, his anger waning.  Grim watches them go;
          popping open a new brew.

                                        GRIM
                        That's right!  Go have yourself a
                        nice cry... bitch!

                        Don't you think you've had enough
                        to drink?

          Grim turns to face him.

                                        GRIM
                        What's it to you, bro?

                        Alcohol doesn't mix too well with
                        the sun.

                                        GRIM
                        Hear that, little brother?  My
                        new friend thinks I've had too
                        much to drink.

                                        HANK
                        He's right.

          He regards Bruce with a look.

                                        HANK
                        It's okay, I'll keep an eye on
                        him.

          Bruce starts away, when something catches his eye...

                                        BRUCE
                        Son of a... it was you guys!


          PICKUP'S FENDER

          badly dented, scuffed with paint from the Murano.

          BACK TO BRUCE

          anger burning in his eyes.  Approaching Hank.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sideswiped my car back at the
                        truck stop.

          Before Hank can respond, Grim intercedes.

                                        GRIM
                        Your beef is with me.  I was
                          driving.

                                        BRUCE
                        Then you're gonna' pay for the
                          repairs.

                        Hell I am.

          Grim pushes Bruce; hard.  Bruce gathers himself, puffs
          his chest and charges...

          Johnny leads Jake to the Jeep, looking back; shocked...

                        Stay here.

          Johnny rushes back to Bruce's side, helping him up.

                        John, look out!

          Johnny turns... right into Grim's left hook.  As it catches
          his chin... WHOOSH! 


  2727VISION

          Grim, battered and bruised, stands over Hank's bloodied
          body; lying unconscious on a gurney, his face caked in
          blood; wearing the same plaid shirt.  His body is loaded
          into the back of an ambulance.  The doors slam shut to
          reveal Observer Johnny watching... WHOOSH!

          as Grim's punch follows through; rocking his jaw.  The
          street brawl continues around him; Bruce, Grim, Hank, and
          now Jake in the mix.

                        back to their cars... now!

          One by one, people shuffle back to their vehicles;
            MUTTERING frustrations under their breath.

          Massey turns away, as...

                        are going to get hurt.  Some of
                        them are going to die.

          This brings Massey to a stop.

          the silence.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't matter.  The fact is
                        we have to get that girl to a
                          hospital.

          Massey wavers.  An uncertain beat.

                                        MASSEY
                        I'll try my radio again.  Anything
                          changes, you let me know.

          Massey notices something...

                                        MASSEY
                        Better watch your step.

          Massey walks away, as Johnny looks down...


          HIS SNEAKER

          smeared with a black substance; slick motor oil.


          JOHNNY

          leans down curiously, wiping some of the oil onto his
          bare finger... WHOOSH! 


  3030MATCH, MOVE, MORPH...

          Johnny stands, now clad in an orange prison jumpsuit; Maine
          State Penitentiary stenciled across the chest.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT TWO - 6/6/05 - PINK 33.


    30CONTINUED:30

          He gasps for air, sweating profusely; concealed in a
          thicket of tall grass and heavy brush.  Moonlight the
          only illumination.  A beat of silence, then bloodhounds
          BAY in the distance; on his scent.  Johnny reacts, darting
          off into the night...


  3131FLASH! 

          Fugitive Johnny runs through an open field at dawn,
          repeatedly checking back over his shoulder.  He reaches a
          post and rail fence, pausing to catch his breath...


          JOHNNY'S POV 

          just beyond the fence, an old working farm.  A beat up
          truck parked alongside a barn...


  3232FLASH! 


          FARM TRUCK

          the driver's door open.  Johnny works beneath the dash,
          fiddling with the exposed wiring.  A beat.  The engine
          RUMBLES to life.  Johnny sits upright, sporting a
          triumphant smile, until... 

                                        FARMER (O.S.)
                        Don't move!

          Johnny reacts, going for the door handle...


          NEW ANGLE

          a pudgy FARMER levels an antiquated shotgun and fires. 
          BANG! 


          JOHNNY

          gets the door shut as the window explodes and races off. 
          The Farmer chases his truck for a few steps, then trails
          off; exhausted.



          Observer Johnny, still in his prison orange, stands amidst
          a sea of gridlocked cars; present day.  WHOOSH! 


  3535RESUME SCENE ON JOHNNY

          floored by the vision.  He takes off after Massey...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait!

          Again, Massey stops and turns.

                                        MASSEY
                        What now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The traffic jam.  They're looking
                        for an escaped convict.  That's
                        why the road is shut down.  I'm
                        right, aren't I?

          Massey's expression changes.  He considers Johnny, then...

                                        MASSEY
                        His name's Marvin Felps.  He broke
                        out of the State Penitentiary
                        late last night.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How dangerous is he?

                                        MASSEY
                        Extremely.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's here.

                                        MASSEY
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Felps... he's here with us.

          Off Massey's reaction...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:


  3636THE SUN

          burning brightly in a perfect, cloudless sky.  Beating
          down; mercilessly.

                                        DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
                        Hour three and no end in sight
                        for you tortured souls stranded
                        out on interstate ninety-five. 
                        Jammin' Jack knows just how you
                        feel. 


          A DASHBOARD

          the vinyl baking away; discarded crayons melting in the
          heat; oozing off the dash...

                                        DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
                        Hang in there folks.  Sweet relief
                        is on the way... this is the Voodoo
                        child himself, Mister Jimi Hendrix.

          Someone slams the car door shut just as the music starts.



          Johnny and Bruce WALK quickly past the parked car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The oil I stepped in must've
                        dripped from whatever car Felps
                        was riding in.

          As they pass random PEOPLE, Bruce eyes them suspiciously.

                                        BRUCE
                        Any idea what he looks like?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  But he's got a gunshot in
                        his side.
                                (pointing)
                        Right here.

                                        BRUCE
                        Then he shouldn't be hard to spot. 
                        What's the cop doing about it?

    37CONTINUED:37

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's checking ID's.  Making sure
                        everyone's who they say they are.

                                        BRUCE
                        This day just keeps getting
                          weirder.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (disturbed)
                        And the body count keeps rising.

                                        BRUCE
                        You think it has something do
                        with me... with what you saw happen
                        to me?

          Johnny considers the question, then...

                                        BRIAN (O.S.)
                        Bruce!  Mister Smith!

          REVEAL Brian, he's frantic and scared.

                                        BRIAN
                          Something's wrong with Nikki!



            A frantic Brian wipes the matted hair from Nikki's
            perspiration drenched forehead.

                                        BRIAN
                        She just stopped talking.  

                                        BRUCE
                        It's burning hot in here.

                                        BRIAN
                        The engine overheated.  I had to
                        turn it off.

          Bruce places his hand on Nikki's forehead.

                                        BRUCE
                        Nikki, can you hear me?








                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT THREE - 6/13/05 - YELLOW 37.


    38CONTINUED:38

          Nikki's eyes ease open; distant.

                                        NIKKI
                          Something's wrong with my baby.

                                        BRUCE
                        The baby's fine.  It's you.  You're
                          dehydrated.
                                (to Brian)
                        You have anything to drink?

                                        BRIAN
                        Just diet soda.  We were gonna'
                        stock up at the next rest stop.

                                        BRUCE
                        No good.  The sodium'll only make
                        things worse.  I need some...

          He turns back to Johnny... but he's already gone.



          as he weaves through cars, calling out... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Water!  We need water!

          Most people turn away; ignoring his plea.  The lead Biker
          stops Johnny, blocking his path.  Serving up an intense
          glare, punctuated by a nasty scar on his leather cheek.

                                        BIKER #1
                        What's the problem chief?

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's a pregnant woman.  She
                        needs fluids.

          The biker's snarl curls into a slight smile.

                                        BIKER #1
                                (to his pals)
                        You heard the man.  Let's find
                        the lady some H2O.

          The bikers immediately span out...

          Banging on peoples windows; hitting them up for whatever
          they can spare.          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT THREE - 6/6/05 - PINK 38.


  4040NEW ANGLE

          the lead Biker approaches a scrawny MAN sitting behind
          the wheel of his car, sipping from a bottle of water...

                                        BIKER #1
                        You done with that?

                                        MAN
                        No.

          The biker yanks the bottle out of his hand.

                                        BIKER #1
                        Now you are.  Have a nice day.


  4141NEW ANGLE - MOVING WITH JOHNNY

          through cars and random motorists.  He rounds an SUV,
          coming face to face with Hank.  A tense beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't want any trouble.

                                        HANK
                        Grim's sleepin' it off.  He's not
                        a bad guy, just lets his temper
                        get the best of him.

                        Tell your friend I'm sorry about
                        his car.  I'm good for the repairs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He'll appreciate that.

          Hank retrieves the infamous cooler from the truck bed.

                        Some ice.  For the girl.

                        Thanks.

          Denise, the sunbather, approaches.  Offering Johnny her
          spray bottle.

                        It might help cool her off.

          The Young Boy and Girl with the sparklers step up next,
          presenting Johnny with two candy bars.

          One by one, other motorists approach, offering whatever
          they can.  Piling stuff into his hands...

          REVEAL THE BIKERS

          each balancing a dozen or so bottles of water in their
          hands.  Sporting tremendous grins.

            A refrigerated cube truck immobilized on the other side
          of the median; Hendersons Home Made Ice Cream stenciled
          on the side.



          The driver climbs down, meeting Johnny and his entourage.

                        Sure.  It's got its own compressor.

                        Come again?

                        her body temp down, her baby might
                        be in danger.

                          Freezer's full.  I can't account
                        for the inventory, it'll mean my
                        job.

          Johnny looks around at the surrounding crowd; haggard
          faces.  He reaches for his wallet, offering the driver
          his credit card...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You take plastic?

          Off the driver's curious reaction.


  4545NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

          Two Bikers stand in the freezer tossing two-gallon drums
          of ice cream out to a huge jubilant crowd...

                                        BIKER #1
                        Cherry vanilla?  How 'bout rum
                        raisin?

          PAN OVER to the rear of the freezer compartment to FIND
          Nikki laying out across some cardboard boxes; a direct
          flow of cool air blowing across her body.  Brian kneels
          at her side, holding her hand.

                                        BRIAN
                        It's gonna' be okay, baby.

          Bruce climbs out of the truck, joining Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Ten minutes in there and her body
                        temp'll come right down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not going to stop the baby
                        from coming.

                                        BRUCE
                        No, but at least they have a
                        chance.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (overwhelmed)
                        What about you... and the rest of
                        these people?  How do I help them?

                                        BRUCE
                        This all started with me, right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        So?

                                        BRUCE
                        So, go back to the beginning.

          Bruce offers his hand.  Johnny hesitates, reluctant.

                                        BRUCE
                        I trust you.

          A beat.  Johnny reaches out, making contact... WHOOSH!


  4646MATCH, MOVE, MORPH...

          Another section of highway.  Observer Johnny stands amidst
          the aftermath of a multiple car pile-up... cars and trucks
          SMASHED and TWISTED.  Smoldering, twisted metal.  Survivors
          mill about in a daze.  Johnny moves through, passing by
          familiar faces...

          A battered Grim tries to free Hank's body from the
          overturned pickup...

          Jake lies on the side of the road; thrown from the open
          Jeep...

          Then Johnny SEES the Murano..

                                        OBSERVER JOHNNY
                        Bruce!

          He runs over to the crumpled car; it's torn open like a
          tin can...



          Johnny approaches the police cruiser... no sign of Massey. 
          He steps around to the rear of the car.

          Resting his open hand on the rear deck.  WHOOSH!


    49A49AVISION - PASSING THROUGH THE SHEET METAL

          into the trunk compartment, to reveal AN UNCONSCIOUS MAN,
          tied and bound; in his boxers and undershirt.  Dried blood
          on his forehead. FLASH!


    49AA49AADIRT ROAD - MORNING - VISION

          The Real Officer Massey (the unconscious man) speaks into
          his hand-held radio...

                                        REAL MASSEY
                          Dispatch, this is 557... all clear. 
                        Suspect is gone.  Contact CSU to
                        gather evidence.  Over.

            FOOTSTEPS from behind draw his attention.  He turns...

          Felps, in his prison jumpsuit, strikes him across the
          head with a pipe.  The Real Massey drops.  FLASH!


    49AB49ABFROM INSIDE THE TRUNK - PITCH BLACK

          The lid swings open, flooding the compartment with light. 
          The Real Massey's bound and tied body (in boxers) is
          dropped in with a sickening THUD; obscuring our view. 
          FLASH!


    49AC49ACDIRT ROAD - MOMENT LATER

          Felps, wearing Massey's unbuttoned police shirt, grimaces
          as he wraps gauze around his gunshot wound.  The Real
          Massey's MOANS and MUFFLED PROTESTS draw him back to the
          open trunk...


          REAL MASSEY'S POV

          Felps leans over him, glaring down; conjuring a sadistic
          grin.

          He cocks back a clenched fist, unleashing a violent attack!*

    49ACCONTINUED:49AC

          PAN OVER to REVEAL Observer Johnny standing over Felps'*
            shoulder; watching.  Cringing at the brutality.  FLASH!*



          A steady stream of people file past Bruce, moving
          purposely.  He bucks the current like a proverbial salmon. 
          Trying futilely to get their attention...

                                        BRUCE
                        Excuse me...  Pardon me...  Sir? 
                        Lady? 

          Nobody stops. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You can't go yet...  Please, just
                          listen...  It's dangerous...

          Bruce burns with uncertainty; this is hopeless.



          Brian is behind the wheel.  Bruce looks up through the
            window...

                                        BRUCE
                        Go straight to the emergency room. 
                        Don't stop for anything.  And not
                        too fast.

                                        BRIAN
                        Will do.

                                        NIKKI
                        Thank you.  For everything.

                        Good luck.

          Bruce watches as the camper pulls away, the caravan of
          bikers trailing directly behind.  The lead biker shoots
          Bruce a triumphant thumbs up as they pass...



          Bruce stands beside the Murano.  (The other lanes have
          started to move.)  The drivers trapped behind him lay on
          their horns.

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, Johnny, where the hell
                        are you?

          At that moment, the police cruiser slowly rolls past;
          Johnny behind the wheel.

          EYE CONTACT

          Bruce stares in disbelief as he and Johnny make eye contact
          as the police cruiser rolls past; what the hell is going
          on?  Then something else catches his attention, drawing a
          stunned reaction...


          BRUCE'S POV

          Massey's drawn gun pointed at Johnny.


          RESUME BRUCE

          He looks around, then jumps in behind the wheel...the
          keys are gone.

                                        BRUCE
                        He took my keys.

          Then he suddenly remembers something and jumps out of the
          car and moves quickly to the front bumper.  He reaches
          his hand up under the bumper and retrieves a spare key
            connected to a small magnet.

                                        BRUCE
                        Looks like all those times I locked
                        myself outt'a my car are gonna
                        pay off.

          He hesitates a half beat...          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT FOUR - 6/20/05 - GOLD  48A.

                        without me.


    55B55BRESUME BRUCE

          Making a heroic decision to tempt fate and try and save
          his best friend, Bruce jumps in the car and starts the
          engine.

                                        BRUCE
                        He'd do it for you.

          He throws the car in gear and takes off.



          as the free flowing traffic picks up speed.  We FIND the
          police cruiser in the mix....

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Where are we going?          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT FOUR - 6/6/05 - PINK 49.



          The car SCREECHES across three lanes, narrowly avoiding
          other traffic...

          It smashes through a steel guardrail, careening over an
            embankment...

          Bumping violently over uneven terrain.  Soaring skyward
          into a violent barrel roll, finally SMASHING to a halt;
          upside down.



          Johnny crawls through the driver side door and stumbles
          quickly out of the car, still dazed.

          Bruce's car skids to a stop on the shoulder of the highway. 
          He jumps out and runs down the steep drop-off to where
          Johnny is sitting on the ground.

          They watch as cars seem to move past them in a slow, safe
          manner.

          Johnny hurries around to the now-open trunk REVEALING...


          INSIDE THE TRUNK

          the tied and bound REAL OFFICER MASSEY looks up at Johnny
          as he removes the duct tape from his mouth...

                                (strained)
                        Thank you.

          Johnny can finally relax a little bit, as...

          Bruce checks his watch...

          Bruce tosses him the 'safety' key.

          HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny, bandaged and cleaned up; writes something on a
          piece of paper.  Bruce paces back and forth, surrounded
          by a few other familiar faces from the traffic jam.

          The lead Biker enters, balancing a stack of coffee cups
          on a tray as he rounds the corner...

                        Who needs a jolt of hot Java?

          As the others reach in for a cup, something just behind

          Standing in the doorway, cloaked in surgical scrubs; his

                        What's this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a list.  My deepest, darkest
                          secrets.  Stuff I'd only want my
                        very best friend to know.  It
                        might make things even between
                        us.

          They STOP at the end of the sidewalk leading to the parking
          lot.  Bruce seems deeply touched by the gesture.

                                        BRUCE
                        John, you don't owe me anything,
                        not after what happened today.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Does that mean you aren't going
                        to read it?

                                        BRUCE
                                (amused)
                        Not read it?  Are you crazy?  I'm
                        gonna memorize it!

          Bruce, having fun, starts off towards the car.  Johnny
          quickly FOLLOWS. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce?

                                        BRUCE
                                (screwing with him)
                        Maybe I'll put it to music!

                                        JOHNNY
                          Alright, give it back.

                                        BRUCE
                        The Ballad of Johnny Smith!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm serious, hand it over.

                                        BRUCE
                        Could go platinum!

                          Alright, have your fun. 

          As they reach the car, Johnny pulls out the keys.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I have another good idea.

                                        BRUCE
                                (still laughing)
                        Yeah, what's that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't you drive?

          The smile suddenly falls away from Bruce's face.

                                        BRUCE
                                (not so amused)
                        That's not funny.

          Now it's Johnny's turn to rub it in.  Bruce walks around
          to the passenger side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a little funny.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's demented, that's what it is. 
                          Twisted!

          They both get in the car.          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT FOUR - 6/6/05 - PINK 54.

          The car starts and backs out of its parking spot.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Okay, then how about we just go
                        home and pretend this day never
                          happened?

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        That works for me.

          A BEAT, then...

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        You're sure you don't want to
                        drive?

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        Turn on the damn radio!

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Have it your way.

          We HEAR the car radio turned ON, as the car drives away...
