      JANE, LISBON and RIGSBY walk a seemingly uncharted path 
      through a thicket of woods.  They are being led by POLICE 
      CHIEF ELAINE BRODY, 47. 

      Jane picks up some leaves, scrunches them up and smells them.  
      Brody gives him a sidelong glance.

                                  JANE
                    What is this type of tree? 

                                  BRODY
                    Couldn t say.  

                                  JANE
                    They smell good.  
                          (beat)
                    Not a local then? 

                                  BRODY
                    Born five miles down the road.  
                    Just don t give a crap about trees.  
                    He s there. 

    The SOUND of men and WALKIE TALKIES can be heard as Brody and 
      team approach...


      Several DEPUTIES, FORENSIC TECHS, and two or three CIVILIANS
      mill about.  Near one of the groups of men lies the body of a 
        fifteen-year-old boy, JUSTIN PRENTISS, lying on his back.  
      Justin s wearing a Bright Arch School T-shirt and shorts.  
      He s missing a HIKING BOOT, has a bit of a rash on his neck, 
    and sports a big black bracelet on his ankle.  Mud on his 
      boot.  The body and face are very dirty.  He has a BLOODY 
      WOUND on the side of his head.  As we take this in, Brody s 
      giving us the rundown... 

                                  BRODY
                    Name s Justin Prentiss.  Student at 
                    a private school operation a couple 
                    of miles from here.  They realized 
                    he was missing around six this 
                    morning, activated the electronic 
                    monitoring device he s got on his 
                    ankle.  Found him and called us at 
                    eight.

                    M.E. puts time of death somewhere 
                    between ten and one last night.  I 
                    wanted to take him down the 
                    mountain as soon as forensics were 
                    done, but as per your request, we 
                    didn t touch him. 

                                  LISBON
                    We won t take long, then you can 
                    take him down.  Why s he got the 
                    electronic monitoring device?  

                                  BRODY
                    Good question.  
                          (calls out harshly)
                    Mr. Maclean...

      ASHER MACLEAN, 48, speaking to a Deputy, turns at the mention 
    of his name and walks over.  He s sporting a Bright Arch 
      polo, cargo shorts and hiking boots.  Woodsy with a tough 
      hippy edge.   

                                  SHERIFF BRODY 
                          (with a little attitude)
                    This is the principal of the 
                    school.  Asher Maclean.  These 
                    people are from the CBI.  They want 
                    to know why your student had an 
                    electronic monitoring device on 
                    him.  

      Maclean is grieving, but stoic and staunch. 

                                  MACLEAN
                    Hi.  Good to meet you.  Ah, Justin 
                    had some truancy issues recently.  
                    Hence the device.

                                  LISBON
                    What kind of school is this 
                    exactly?

                                  MACLEAN
                    Bright Arch is a wilderness program 
                    for troubled youth.  

                                  JANE
                    Like a summer camp.

                                  MACLEAN
                    No, we re an accredited high 
                    school.  Students stay at Bright 
                    Arch for a year on average.

                    through close interaction with 
                    nature.  Plus the regular high

                                  JANE
                          (off Chief Brody and 
                            Maclean)
                    She doesn t like you.  And you 
                    don t like her.  Why is that?

      Maclean s taken aback.

                                  MACLEAN 
                    Ah, no comment.

                                  JANE 
                    Chief Brody?  Why don t you like 
                    him?

                                  BRODY
                    What has that got to do with 
                    anything?  

                                  JANE
                    Just curious.

                                  MACLEAN
                    I think you might show a little 
                    more respect.

                                  JANE
                    Respect for?

                                  BRODY
                    There s a dead child here.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, he s dead.  He doesn t care 
                    how I talk to you. 

      Jane turns away, studies the body, kneeling to get close. 
      Studies the ground nearby, and the surrounding trees.

                                  BRODY 
                          (to Lisbon)
                    I ve never worked with the CBI 
                    before.  Do all your units come 
                    with a clown? 

      Lisbon doesn t like it when other cops have a go at Jane, 
      especially other female cops.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST   "Blood Brothers"   YELLOW 4/13/09     4.

                    We get the job done.  

                                  BRODY
                    How about getting it done now, so 
                    we can take this kid out of here, 
                    how would that be?

      Lisbon and Brody eyeball each other.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.  We ll do that.

      Jane s seen enough already.

                                  JANE
                    You can move him now.  We have the 
                    basic facts.

                                  BRODY
                    Oh is that right?  That quick huh? 

                                  JANE
                    Uh, yes.

                                  BRODY
                    You want to enlighten us?

                                  JANE
                    Oh, forensics will have told you a 
                    lot of this already no doubt.   
                    His knuckles and his knees say he 
                    was overpowered in a hand to hand 
                    struggle.  A blow to his head was 
                    the coup de grace.  But the ground 
                    around him is barely disturbed.  
                    No footprints but his own.  So...

      Jane moves off and Lisbon and Brody and Maclean are compelled 
    to follow him uphill.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    The struggle must have occurred 
                    elsewhere.  Uphill from here 
                      presumably.  Injured animals tend 
                    to move downhill, of course.   

                                  BRODY
                    Do you have any actual facts?







                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST   "Blood Brothers"   YELLOW 4/13/09     5.

                                  JANE 
                    It s a fact that you dislike Mr. Maclean 
                    because he s a treehugging liberal 
                    wacko, probably running some kind of 
                    cult.  And he dislikes you because 
                    you re a small-minded, provincial 
                    hayseed.  Not that you are, necessarily.  
                    That s just what he thinks.  

      Brody almost smiles.  Almost.

                                  BRODY
                    I mean facts that matter to that 
                    poor boy.

                                  JANE
                    There was no moon last night.  Very 
                    dark.  Justin couldn t have moved 
                    very far, injured as he was.  

      They move through a thicket of trees... 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    He had a lot of dirt in his hair 
                    and in his ears, and deep under his 
                    nails.  So, somewhere close by -- 
                          (he sees something ahead)
                    Somewhere very close by, we ll find 
                    a spot where someone...  

      They emerge into a little clearing, with numerous signs of 
      human activity... empty beer bottles and other trash, 
      graffiti on the trees -- Z KREW RULE -- and aLARGE HOLEin 
    the ground, consistent with someone being buried and then 
      digging themselves out.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    ...Where someone buried him alive.

                                  BRODY
                    Oh my God.

    On Jane, sad to be proved right.

      FADE IN:


      Jane, Lisbon, Rigsby and CHO watch as Asher Maclean, flanked 
    by three COUNSELLORS, speaks to a group of about 30 KIDS, 
      ranging in age from 13 to 17, all wearing the same thing 
      Justin was found wearing.  

                                  MACLEAN
                    I know this last couple of days 
                    have been rough.  You have been 
                    exposed to a tragedy few people  
                    ever have to deal with.  Losing 
                    Justin hurts.  But his death cannot 
                    become your crutch for a negative 
                    attitude.  You can learn and grow 
                    from this experience.  

      A kid, BRYAN, 15, all arms and legs, raises his hand.

                    fire truth circle on Friday?

                                  MACLEAN
                    I think there s all the more reason 
                    to do it now.  We need healing. 
                    Listen, kids, the strangers you see 
                    here are detectives that will be 
                      investigating the situation with 
                    Justin.  They re here to find out 
                    what happened to him, and I want 
                    all of you to answer any questions 
                    they have as best you can.  Yes-yes-
                    yes people?

      ORRIN, 13, and small for his age, pipes up to the CBI team.

                                  ORRIN
                    Is it true that Justin was buried

      ELLIOT, 14 -- a spectacled, skinny, bright, nerd -- sounds 
      scared...

      A murmur rising from the kids.

                                  MACLEAN
                    That s enough now, Elliot.  
                          (to all)
                    Everything will be alright.  Let s 
                    get to our classes quickly, folks.  
                    We re wasting daylight.

    All of the kids animatedly get up and start walking away, 
      herded by the Counsellors.  

      ANGLE ON LISBON AND JANE and the team -- 

                                  LISBON
                    You guys start interviewing the 
                    counsellors.  We ll dig a little 
                    deeper with the Principal.  Before 
                    we get to the kids. 

      Maclean approaches them...

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Mr. MacLean.

                                  MACLEAN
                    Agent Lisbon, excuse me --

      With a free hand, he pulls in Orrin by the shoulder as he and  
      Elliot walk by.  Elliot keeps walking.

                                  MACLEAN (CONT D)
                    Orrin, we only speak when we re 
                    recognized as part of the 
                      discussion.  

      Orrin nods, walks away.

      They begin to walk.

      A CAR comes barreling up the road, screeches to a halt.       
      A man and a woman get out.  This is DAVID and JEMMA PRENTISS, 
      (40 s).  

      Catching sight of Maclean, David barrels toward him.  Jemma 
      follows, hard pressed to calm her angry husband... 

                                  DAVID PRENTISS
                    You sonofabitch, what happened? 
                    What happened?  What did you do? 

    He shoves Maclean, who steps back and goes into a sort of 
      placatory Tae Kwon Do pose.  

                                  MACLEAN
                    Mr. Prentiss, David, let s be calm 
                    now please...

      Lisbon swiftly steps between them.

                          (firm authority)

      Lisbon shows him her badge.  

                                  JEMMA
                    David.

      David steps back, takes it down a notch.

                                  DAVID PRENTISS
                    This man was supposed to look after 
                    my son.  It s his responsibility to 
                    keep his students safe.  And he 
                    didn t.  He didn t. 

    He moves toward Maclean.

                                  JEMMA
                    David, no.

      Lisbon sits with Jemma and David.

                    How did you learn about Bright

                                  JEMMA
                    One of David s colleagues had a 
                    child who was going way off track 
                    and they saw very positive results 
                    from the program.

                                  LISBON
                    Justin was misbehaving?

                                  JEMMA 
                    He d changed over the last year.  
                    He used to be this great kid who 
                    could tell me about anything.  So 
                      thoughtful.  

                                  DAVID
                    And then it was as if a cloud 
                    descended over him.  Suddenly, he 
                    was always locked up in his room, 
                    dour, uncommunicative.  Violent on 
                    occasion.  He wouldn t reason or 
                    listen to anyone.  Therapy didn t 
                    work.

                                  JEMMA
                    We needed help.

                                  LISBON
                    What kind of violence did he engage 
                    in?

                                  JEMMA
                    He often shouted at me and 
                    threatened his father.  You know, 
                    he would be screaming and shouting, 
                    throwing furniture around like a 
                    maniac.

                                  LISBON
                    Shouting.  But no actual physical 
                    violence or criminal behavior.

                                  DAVID
                    No.

                                  JEMMA
                    You think we re to blame.

      A small, grim bare room with four cots in it.  Each cot has a 
      wooden chest at its foot, with the student s name stencilled

    Cho and Rigsby scan the room, and unpack the meager

      Reluctantly, Marley hops to the ground, and does push-ups.  
    The other kids jeer, but lanky Bryan intercedes.

                                  BRYAN
                    Not cool.

    The kids immediately stop on his say so.  

      Jane strolls over.

    He simultaneously hands her a bottle of water and takes the

                    Now look at that.

    He points upward, and as she looks upward, he swiftly ties 
    her hands together, like a calf s legs.  The children roar 
      with laughter.

      Missy Jenkins, embarrassed, hurries away toward Maclean s

                    Who s Zachariah?

    The other kids shush Elliot with hard looks, and he 
      immediately shuts up.

                                  MARLEY 
                    There is no Zachariah.  It s a

                    Yeah, I was kidding.

                                  JANE

                    Aren t you a little old to believe

                                  BRYAN
                    A year ago, they found a townie kid 
                    dead in the woods. 

                                  ORRIN
                    He d been chopped up with an axe.  
                    His head was twenty feet up a tree,   
                    with a look of terror on his face.

                                  JANE
                    Okay, does Zachariah have anything 
                    to do with Z Krew?

    The boys look at Jane with eyes as big as saucers saying 
      nothing.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Was Justin a part of Z Krew?

      More scared silence.  Just then, Missy Jenkins returns with 
      Lisbon and Maclean in tow.

                                  LISBON
                    Jane what the hell are you playing 
                    at?  You can t tie people up.

                                  JANE
                    I m sorry.

                                  LISBON
                    I should think you are.  You ll be 
                    sorrier when I report this.      
                    Mr. Maclean, my apologies.  We ll 
                    be back tomorrow morning if that s 
                      convenient.

      Lisbon does all but take him by the ear as she hustles him   
      away toward their vehicle.  


    But once Maclean and Missy Jenkins are out of earshot, Lisbon 
      relaxes.  She was faking the anger.

      They get in the car...


      Rigsby and Cho move along a deer trail deep in the woods.  
      Cho s using a compass to guide them.

                    That house is marked on the map 
                    with a skull and crossbones.

    Cho and Rigsby look at each other and walk toward the house.

                                  RIGSBY
                    So, uh, what are the usual reasons

                    -- Look...

    Cho shines his flashlight on a patch of undergrowth by the 
      trail.  It s a HIKING BOOT.  Cho picks it up.

                    Looks a lot like Justin s shoe.


    Cho and Rigsby look around the front of the house, (Cho has 
    the bagged boot bulging his jacket pocket).  There s a little 
    red paint SPLATTER on the house.  The place is dark.  They 
      approach the front door and KNOCK.

    No answer.  After several KNOCKS, they move around to the 
      back of the house.  Just then, the COCK of a shot gun.  At 
      their backs is PERCY WINSTON, 56, holding a shot gun, wild 
      hair, and a mean drunk s face.

      Winston has his shotgun trained on Rigsby and Cho.  Rigsby 
      cautiously attempts to engage Winston but ends up making him 
      a bit more itchy.

      absently scratch his ankle.

      FADE IN:


      Bryan s drinking from the camp s rough hewn water fountain 
      when he sees Rigsby and Cho walking purposefully toward him.  
    His eyes go wide and he sets off at a run.

                                  CHO
                    You can handle this, can t you?

      Rigsby grins, takes off his jacket, carefully hangs it on a 
      tree branch... Then bolts after Bryan.  We hold on Cho...   


      Bryan enters at a run, Rigsby sprints after, and makes a 
      flying tackle that takes the two into the LAKE.  


      Jane basking in a spot of sun, Cho watching amused as Rigsby, 
    in boxers, gingerly washes off some pond scum with an outdoor 
      faucet and bucket.  (An old pair of Rigsby s jeans and a 
      folded Bright Arch T-shirt hang on the fence nearby.)

                                  JANE
                    Gave you some trouble uh?  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Nah.  He had quick reflexes.  
                    Shouldn t you be talking to him?

                                  JANE
                    Eh, it s too nice out to be 
                    indoors.

      Rigsby finds something unidentifiable and green on his 
      shoulder, hurriedly splashes water on it.

                    Hundred and fifty, hundred-sixty 
                    pounds maximum.    

                                  RIGSBY
                    I got him, didn t I? 

      Just then VAN PELTapproaches.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Hey, guys.  What happened to you?

      Rigsby s embarrassed to be caught with, well, his pants down.

                                  CHO
                    Old age.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Shut up you.

    He snatches up the T-shirt, puts it on.  

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    What are you doing here?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Gee, thanks for the welcome.

                                  RIGSBY
                    No I mean, you know what I mean.

    He longingly eyes his jeans on the fence, trying to be 
      nonchalant.

                                  VAN PELT

                    Hi, Van Pelt.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Boss.

                    We re short a girl name of Cassie 
                    Miniver.  Bryan says Justin was in 
                    love with Cassie.  He recently saw 
                    them arguing fiercely.

                    Cassie.  Yes.  She brought Maclean 
                    a cup of tea. 

                                  LISBON
                    We wanted to question her, but 
                    she s gone.  Hasn t been seen in a 
                    couple of hours.

                                  JANE 
                    Huh.  Interesting. 

      Jane s mind is whirring away...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Anybody else missing?

                                  JANE
                    Good question.

                                  LISBON
                    Don t be patronizing.  No, there

                                  VAN PELT 
                    So she s more likely running, not 
                    abducted.

                    Won t go well for her if she gets 
                    lost too deep in these woods.  

                                  CHO
                    So what do we do?

                                  JANE
                    That sounds horribly tedious.

      Jane strolls away, picks a daisy.

      Chief Brody and her Cops combing through woods...

                    Cassie!  Cassie!


      Rigsby and Van Pelt comb the woods.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Cassie!

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Hey, can I ask you something?  
                    Would you read, have you read your 
                      co-worker s personnel files?

    Van Pelt eyes him warily.  Where s this going?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Uh.  No.  Why?

                                  RIGSBY
                    No.  Good.  Neither did I.  Okay.

    Van Pelt looks at him quizzically.


    Up a driveway out of sight of the school buildings. 

    The gate is closed.  Jane sits in the sun, making a daisy 
      chain crown.

    An SUV approaches, heading out, stops at the gate.  Maclean 
      gets out to open the gate.

                                  JANE
                    Hello.

      Maclean hadn t seen him there.

                                  MACLEAN
                    Oh, hi.

      Jane gets up, brings the daisy chain with him.

                    Oh excellent.  That s where I want 
                    to go.

      With that, he gets into the car at the same time as Maclean, 
      sits alongside him. 

                                  MACLEAN
                    Um.  Alright.

                                  JANE
                    Thanks.  Very grateful.  

    He shuts his door and pulls through to the other side of the 
      gate.  Stops.

                                  MACLEAN 
                    Would you shut the gate for me,

                    As soon as I get out of the car,

                                  MACLEAN
                    Why on earth would I do that?

                                  JANE
                    The three Furies.  Shame, guilt,

                    What?

                                  JANE
                    The heart wants what it wants, 
                    doesn t it?  It won t be denied.   
                    It makes us do bad things. 

                                  MACLEAN 
                    What are you talking about?

      Maclean looks shame-faced.

                    Alright.  I have a great one. 
                    You all know about Zachariah, don t 
                    you?

    The kids look alarmed.

                                  MARLEY
                    We know.  But we don t talk about 
                    him.

                                  ORRIN
                    It s bad luck.

                                  JANE
                    Meh, Zachariah doesn t scare me.    
                    I have powers.  Dead people do my 
                    bidding, not the other way around.

    He tosses another log on the fire.*

                                    JANE(CONT D)*
                    Everyone knows aboutthe terrible*

    The kidsnod slowly in recognition...*

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    What many don t know is what 
                    happened after that horrible crime.  
                    In punishment, the townspeople *
                    burned Zachariahalive in a huge *
                    bonfire... on this very spot.  *
                    As the flames melted the flesh from 
                    his body, Zachariah didn t scream *
                    or struggle.  He just smiled at *
                    those watching and made a solemn *
                    vow.  Anyone, anyone at all who *
                    tells lies about him, who uses his*
                    name for their own ends, good or *
                    evil, will live to regret it.  *
                    Because he ll come for them.  He ll *
                    rise from the grave and come for *
                    them.    *

    The boys stare at Jane waiting for the next thing.  Jane 
      doesn t say anything else.

                                  BRYAN

    All of the boys relax and laugh.  Jane goes to Elliot.

                                  JANE
                    You shouldn t mock Zachariah.

                                  ELLIOT
                    Whatever.

      Awork-gloved HAND bursts from the ground and grabs hold of *
      Elliot s ankle! *

      Elliot shrieks as the hand yanks him to the ground.  Bryan *
      grabs hold of Elliot ashe skids toward the chasm.  The other *
      boys are freaked and watch in frozen horror.  Jane focuses on 
      Elliot.

                                  JANE
                    Tell the truth, Elliot!  It s your 
                    only chance.Who killed Justin?*

      With a heave, Elliot is yanked further down --

                                  ELLIOT
                    It was me!  I killed Justin!  It 
                    was me!

      Immediately Elliot stops being dragged under.  He s free.  
      Bryan lets go and Elliot scrambles to his feet.  Everyone s 
      staring at him in shocked silence.

                                  JANE
                    Saved!  Whew, that was close.

      Rigsby emerges from a well camo d hole in the ground, wearing 
      a GHILLIE SUIT and lumberjack gloves.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Oh, hey Rigsby.  *

    The kids all laugh.  Elliot is deeply embarrassed.*

                                  ELLIOT
                    I knew it was a joke.  I was just 
                    kidding.

                                  JANE
                    No.  You re a liar and a murderer, *

                    hiding the fact.  You lose.   

      A look of scarey malevolence washes over Elliot s face.  
      Without blinking, he picks up astick and quickly advances on *
      Jane.  Jane takes a step back.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Whoa.  A little help here.

      Rigsby swiftly moves in on Elliot, puts him in an armlock.

                                  RIGSBY
                    It s over, kid.


      MOSElliot, in a black mask, confronts Justin, pointing a 
      finger portentously.

                                  ELLIOT (V.O.)
                    I tried to shut him up with a 
                    message from Zachariah, but he 
                    wouldn t back off.

      Justin steps up to Elliot and grabs him and pulls off the 
      mask, pushes Elliot to the ground and laughs, starts to walk 
      away in disdain.

                                  ELLIOT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    He laughed at me.

      Enraged, Elliot leaps on the bigger boy.  They struggle.  
      Elliot picks up a rock and smashes it down on Justin s head.  

    END FLASHBACK


      Jane exits the building.  In the b.g., Van Pelt talks with 
      Jemma and David Prentiss, the parents of Justin (carrying his 
      meager belongings).  As Jane passes by a patch of foliage...

                                  JANE
                    Come on, Rigsby, you re not fooling 
                    anyone.

      A beat.  The foliage stands.  It s Rigsby, in the GHILLIE 
      SUIT.  Disappointed.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    How d you know?

                    Poplars don t grow around here.

    He spies Van Pelt and the parents, goes the other way...

      ANGLE - VAN PELT AND PRENTISSES

    Van Pelt spots Jane trying to make a discreet exit...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Ah, there he is.

      Busted, Jane raises a hand in greeting.  He hates this stuff.

                                  JANE
                    Here I am.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I was just telling Mr. and Mrs. 
                    Prentiss, it was you that caught 
                    their son s killer.

                                  JANE
                    Sorry for your loss.

      They re still grief-stricken, but trying bravely to be strong.

                                  JEMMA
                    Thank you.  Thank you very much.

                                  DAVID PRENTISS
                    We re very grateful.  It gives us 
                    some kind of closure at least.

    He nods amiably and turns to go, thinks better of it, goes 
      back to the parents.
