Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish. An eclectic NY
crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or
two, a couple of NYU professor types who love the
"authenticity" of this place.
KAY flashes a badge to the OWNER, Chinese.
KAY
Good evening, Mr. Wu.
MR. WU
(heavily accented, barely
INTELLIGIBLE)
Kay, Jay... So happy see you... Mr.
Wu get you regular table...
KAY
Not so fast, Wu. We'd like to take
a look in the tanks.
8
MR. WU
Yes, you see, very fresh.
JAY
The tanks in the back, Wu.
MR. WU
Oh... so sorry... please no
English, you come back later...
JAY
Hey, save the chop socky bullshit
for the locals, Wu. We need to see
the kitchen.
MR. WU
(PERFECT ENGLISH)
Why are you busting my balls, Jay?
KAY (O.S.)
Jay, take a look at this.
Wu protests, Jay blows by him.
THE KITCHEN
KAY
So this is what you're passing off
as tuna?
Reveal a giant tank holding a HUGE ALIEN FISH.
JAY
Wow, I didn't think there was
anything uglier than a catfish.
Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.
KAY
Ugly AND a clear violation of
Health ordinance 32, selling
UNLICENSED EXTRATERRESTRIAL
foodstuffs.
MR. WU
That's an earth fish. Very
traditional from China. You arrest
me, that's hate crime.
They turn their stares on him.
9.
KAY
I guess it would be.
(grabbing Wu's apron)
If you were Chinese!
Reveal -- from the waist down, Wu has the BODY OF A SLUG.
MR. WU
C'mon, I got larvae to feed. And
earth fish is so expensive. This
is the only way I could stay
afloat.
JAY
Look, Wu. You can serve it to
your... out of town guests, but
locals get earth fish. REAL earth
fish. The kind that doesn't jump
out of their stomach and get
everyone asking a lot of annoying
questions. Like, "Why is my lunch
eating Daddy?" You got it?
(back to the fish)
DAMN, that's ugly.
MR. WU
Yeah, yeah, thanks guys.
KAY
Aren't you forgetting something?
Wu walks them to a table, seats them.
MR. WU
(for benefit of customers)
Allow me most honorable benefit of
get you noodles.
(FOR GUYS)
Be right back, guys.
Wu walks off. Jay CLOCKS the other diners.
JAY
Something about this strike you as
weird?
KAY
Yeah, look -- clean fork.
10.
JAY
Look at table two over there. They
haven't ordered a thing. When's
the last time Wu let someone sit at
a table without ordering? And
table five over there just drank
his third cup of duck sauce.
Now Kay's radar is up --
KAY
Come to think of it... Why is Wu
getting our noodles... outside?
JAY
Because it's about to go down.
Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.
MR. WU
Sorry, guys.
Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys
reach for their weapons.
And IT GOES DOWN --
It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --
The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw
various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping
truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand
combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not
taking any chances.
Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --
He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVING
THEMSELVES FROM GETTING HIT.
But not for long...
An explosive lands between them --
Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, rolls to a stop in the
middle of the
DESERTED STREET
Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a
motorcycle. As he pulls into the light -- YAZI
11.
Kay's eyes go wide with recognition.
Yaz grins a murderous grin...
YAZ
Some things are worth waiting for.
KAY
Then come get it, you worthless
PIECE OF--
Yaz guns the engine and BEARS DOWN ON KAY.
INSIDE WITH JAY
Getting the worst of it.
A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN.
The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE! And he
goes RIGHT AFTER JAY!
JAY
You probably took that whole
catfish thing the wrong way --
The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!
JAY (CONT'D)
I was jealous, you know? Because
you're so pretty!
Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth,
squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep it
AT BAY--
JAY (CONT'D)
Kay! KAY!!! Little help! Little
help!
OUTSIDE WITH KAY
Yaz getting closer. He pulls out a CANNON of a gun, fires
into the air.
YAZ
This time you don't have your
friends to tell you what happens
next.
KAY
Oh, I know what happens next.
12.
Kay draws his EQUALLY BADASS-LOOKING WEAPON --
KAY (CONT'D)
I've been waiting forty years for
another shot at you, scum.
Kay takes aim and... CLICK! Empty.
GUN (V.0.)
Your weapon is empty! Please
recharge!
KAY
Damn!
GUN (V.0.)
Sorry you're having trouble! If
you survive this encounter, please
call customer service at--
Kay throws the gun at Yaz.
Yaz laughs. Gets Kay in his sights.
YAZ
All I wanted was justice, Kay.
Justice for my brothers. But you
had to meddle, didn't you?
KAY
They deserved what they got.
YAZ
Why don't you say that to their
faces when you see them...
Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!!
Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!!
Reveal Jay, just fired the shot.
Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of
slime and alien guts.
He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly
pressed.
JAY
So I was thinking about making a
chart for each time I save your
ass. And when I do it ten times,
you buy me lunch.
13.
Kay lets out a long, weary sigh.
KAY
Will you settle for a drink?
Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers. Jay is
on his phone.
JAY
(INTO PHONE)
We're gonna need a cleanup on the
corner of Canal and Mott. And
bring a net. Biggest one you've
got.
Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal.
Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles
off another table and starts eating.
Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the
crime scene.
JAY (CONT'D)
(MOUTH FULL)
Why aren't you eating?
(GETS NOTHING)
So what the hell was that guy?
Kay's quiet. Ominously quiet. Weighing his words:
KAY
Yaz. Put him away a long time ago.
Biggest mistake I ever made.
JAY
Why? Was he the wrong guy?
KAY
No. Should've killed him.
JAY
Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I
took care of him.
KAY
That was too easy.
JAY
I make it look easy. That's the
problem with being my partner.
(MORE)
14.
JAY (CONTD)
You get used to my game. It's what
Dr. Phil would call taking for
granted.
KAY
You don't get it, hoss. This guy
is different. Worse than anyone.
He tried to blow up the Earth but I
stopped him. He developed a
dislike for me and for certain
behaviors of mine, such as being
alive.
JAY
C'mon, you know better {than anyone.
What does an MiB agent call it when
12 alien species try to kill him?
Tuesday.
Jay laughs at his own joke. Kay just stares.
KAY
Maybe.
(calling off to cleanup
GUYS)
Make sure you get all of him, I
mean it! He's an assembler!
CLEANUP GUY
Yes, sir, Agent Kay.
JAY
Seriously, man, those noodles'll
kill you before he does. I got
your back.
KAY
I know you do.
Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:
KAY (CONT'D)
I used to play a game with my
daddy. What would you want for
your last meal. Could do worse
than this.
JAY
Oh, yeah? I used to play a game
with my dad, too. Called catch.
I'd throw the ball, and then it'd
hit the house `cause he WASN'T
THERE.
15.
KAY
Do me a favor, don't badmouth your
old man.
JAY
Hard to badmouth someone you don't
know.
(CHECKS HIMSELF)
Alright, forget it. The past is
the past. And right now we have
something much more important to
talk about. Bowling Night.
KAY
I'm tired.
JAY
Tired? What -- you afraid I'm
gonna take that MVP trophy away
from you?
KAY
Petrified. See you later.
Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --
KAY (CONT'D)
And slick? Watch yourself. A guy
like Yaz can come after you when
you least expect it. Anywhere,
anytime.
Jay watches Kay walk away. Looks like he's carrying a heavy
load. Turns his attention to the clean up crew:
KAY (CONT'D)
What part of clean up everything
don't you understand? There's a
spleen on that car!
CLEANUP GUY
On it, sir.
DARK ALLEY
A glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of... Devil Girl!
She reaches down. We see -- a finger with the distinctive
Skull, inching its way along the road.
DEVIL GIRL
You okay, baby? Momma's got you.
now.
16.
MIB HQ - LATER THAT NIGHT
Jay at his desk -- papers and folders everywhere -- SEARCHING
FOR SOMETHING.
We see what he's looking through -- KAY'S OLD CASE FILES.
JAY
Yaz... Yaz... Yaz... Where are you,
Yaz...?
And he FINDS IT!
JAY (CONT'D)
Here we go...
Jay opens the YAZ INCIDENT REPORT
INSIDE:
- Pictures of Yaz
- A type-written report telling us YAZ APPREHENDED BY AGENT
KAY... JULY 16, 1969
- Farther down on the page, a CASUALTY REPORT: ONE
CASUALTY... HUMAN DEAD AT THE SCENE...
ZED (O.S.)
Ready to bring the pain?
Reveal Zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit.
BOWLING ALLEY - LATER THAT NIGHT
A sign says: CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT
We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into
Safely inside, the Bowlers remove their heads -- which become
their bowling balls.
It's the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS. MIB AGENTS
MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk.
We see shots of games in progress:
An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane,
it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins.
17.
The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow
them whole. A many-armed alien re-sets the pins.
A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul
line... and -- gutter ball! He gets mad and shoots the pins
with his laser-eyes.
We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM, NOT BOWLING BECAUSE
THEY'RE WAITING FOR KAY --
Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia.
ZED
Where's Kay? We either roll or
forfeit -- and I didn't put this on
to forfeit!
JAY
Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we
built you for.
Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those
white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is
better than Women."
ROBOT
(ROBOT VOICE)
This is my time to shine.
Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor. An awkward
beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors. Then a car
alarm.
ROBOT (CONT'D)
There goes my perfect game.
(ROBOT LAUGH)
Ha ha ha.
JAY
Guess it's on me.
Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards
the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is
too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a
STRIKE!
Jay and his teammates triumphant! The frame of a lifetime!
Jay looks around --
JAY (CONT'D)
Of course -- the one time Kay isn't
here...
18.
MIB HQ - TUNNEL VENT ROOM
Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody
who did some celebrating last night.
We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT, RIDICULOUS MIB
BOWLING TROPHY.
JAY
Check it out--
The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in
fact AN ALIEN.
TROPHY
We're number one! In your face!
Suck it!
JAY
Look who's league MVP.
GUARD
Big surprise, you win every year.
That's weird...
JAY
I... huh?
MIB HQ - HEADQUARTERS
Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the
office. The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash
talk.
JAY
Where are you, Kay? I think you
want to see this. It's the bowling
MVP trophy with MY name on it.
Jay works his way to his desk.
Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work,
his back to Jay.
JAY (CONT'D)
Maybe you want to think twice next
time you ditch me.
Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer.
JAY (CONT'D)
Kay?
19.
KAY (O.S.)
(back still to camera)
Yeah?
JAY
Yeah, I just wanted to show you
this so I could say--
(SEEING HIM)
Who the hell are YOU???
Reveal -- CLINT EASTWOOD
I'm agent Kay.
JAY
You new around here?
" KAY"
(LAUGHS)
Good one, partner.
JAY
Yeah, okay, but I need the other
Kay. You know, craggy old white
guy... well, DIFFERENT craggy old
white guy.
I got you something.
He hands over a "World's Best Partner" mug --
"KAY" (CONT'D)
Have I told you today how much I
appreciate working together?
JAY
What the HELL is going on here?
Why are you pretending to be Kay?
" KAY FR
You seem upset. Let's go get some
coffee and talk about our feelings.
JAY
How about instead, you go find me
THIS guy?
Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY. But
now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words:
KILLED IN ACTION -- JULY 16, 1969
20.
Jay stares at the photo --- in it, we notice Kay is NOW
WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION
JAY (CONT'D)
Killed? In 1969?
Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last
night -- but now everything is different.
We see -- the incident report stating ONE CASUALTY - AGENT
KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...
Jay can't believe it, he keeps reading...
Snatches of the typewritten incident report
The casualty report
ONE CASUALTY... AGENT KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...
A photo of Kay WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION.
Jay stares, struck by this --
JAY (CONT'D)
Kay's dead? How? Why?
The Men in Black Computer/Big Board sounds the alarm!
COMPUTER (V.0.)
Attention. Inbound missiles
entering solar system! Inbound
missiles entering solar system!
Zed enters, chuckling at the warning:
ZED
Well, must be a Tuesday. Okay,
computer [twins]. Give me a
trajectory and an ETA on those
puppies.
COMPUTER (V.0.)
Running impact simulator...
Everyone watches as we see an animated simulation: the
missiles smash into EARTH...
COMPUTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Catastrophic Earth impact imminent.
21.
ZED
Damn. Welp, looks like we're all
done for. Sorry, kid, it's been a
good ride.
A GENERAL FREAK-OUT ENSUES
Jay remains calm:
JAY
Whoa, what's everyone freaking out
about? We had one of these last
week.
"Kay" hides under a desk, weeping.
"KAY"
We're all gonna die!
JAY
Wait - what is everyone's problem?
What about that pan-galactic
missile shield thing?
ZED
Sure, great idea, if we had one.
COMPUTER (V.0.)
Now running pan-galactic shield
simulation.
We see the missiles being shot down.
COMPUTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Conclusion: 6.72 billion lives
saved. With shield...
(shows Earth saved)
without shield...
(shows Earth destroyed)
Sorry to say I told you so.
ZED
I wanted to build one years ago,
but Kay talked me out of it.
JAY
Kay talked you out of it? Kay
wouldn't do that. He's the most
distrustful person in the galaxy.
He personally set up that system to
defend our planet from the scum of
the universe.
22.
" KAY
I thought we didn't have any
enemies anymore. A stranger's just
a friend you haven't met.
JAY
Yeah, that's working out great.
Look, I don't know what's frying
everyone's brains, but I remember
the missile shield --- Kay -- the
real Kay -- loved that thing. He
wouldn't shut up about it. I mean,
that thing was all Kay.
(REALIZING)
But Kay's dead. He's been dead for
years. But I knew him yesterday.
Jay looks at the YAZ file. Gears turning. He grabs a
picture of Yaz --
JAY (CONT'D)
Where the hell did he.get an iPhone
in 1969?
EXTREME CLOSE UP ON PICTURE --
Peeking out of Yaz's jacket -- an iPhone.
Something clicks --
JAY (CONT'D)
(REMEMBERING)
Kay said Yaz can get you anywhere,
anytime. Any TIME. So Yaz killed
Kay in 1969 and now there's no
missile shield.
Jay realizes something and RUNS OFF
OKAY"
I love you, Jay!
JAY
You're definitely not Kay!
JAY RUNS THROUGH MIB
He runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end:
COMPUTER (V.0.)
Nine minutes to impact. I always
loved you, microwave...
23.
On the microwave -- it beeps plaintively.
Jay runs off with purpose...
STREETS OF NYC
July in the city. A perfect summer day. Kids eat ice cream.
Old ladies head to matinees. The streets of New York team
with humanity, blissfully unaware that they are about to die.
In other words, a Tuesday.
Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on
blankets.
Desperately looking for someone...
Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange
mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat.
As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and HE FLEES.
Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays
him out.
JAY
Where you going in such a hurry,
Obadiah? The past?
OBADIAH
What are you talking about?
He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a
telescope.
JAY
I know you've been time-travelling.
OBADIAH
No way, man. I've just been here,
totally legit, here in New
Amsterdam. I mean -- Manahatta ... n
I'm legit.
JAY
Yeah? What's this?
Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with
S.S. TITANIC on it.
OBADIAH
I swear, I'm out of that. That's
my grandmother's.
24.
JAY
What else you got here?
OBADIAH
Nothing, nothing man.
JAY
Oh, yeah?
Off a Dodo in a cage.
JAY (CONT'D)
Is that a dodo bird?
OBADIAH
Family pet.
JAY
I think he'd be happier free.
Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking...
OBADIAH
Oh, come on, man!
JAY
Interesting.
Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket. Featuring
chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire.
OBADIAH
That's pirated, man. That ain't
nothing.
Jay rips open his jacket --
JAY
And this?
Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence..
OBADIAH
Okay, okay, maybe I've been time
travelling a little -- just for
personal use, man, just enough to
GET BY--
JAY
Listen -- I'll look the other way
if you tell me who's selling time
travel these days. I just want
your supplier.
25.
OBADIAH
No way, man. You don't mess with
that guy. He'll kill you, me, and
then he'll go after our families!
JAY
Don't worry, he won't have time.
OBADIAH
What do you mean?
Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles.
JAY
Those hit the sun in 8 minutes.
You want to live out those minutes?
Or you want me to take you out of
your misery?
Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss --
off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.
OBADIAH
Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't
warn you, man. You just signed
your own death warrant.
JAY
I just want a name.
OBADIAH
Fine, but it's the last one you'll
ever hear.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON THE MOST NON-THREATENING FACE EVER
Think Michael Cera at his most geeky.
CERA
Hi, I'm Trevor!
Reveal -- we are in
APPLE STORE
And Trevor is an "Apple Genius"
TREVOR
Do you have an appointment?
26.
JAY
NO---
TREVOR
(CHIPPER)
Well, if you don't have an
appointment, you'll have to come
back tomorrow.
JAY
Yeah, well, the thing about
tomorrow is, we'll all be busy
being dead.
TREVOR
Excuse me?
JAY
Help me, or the world is gonna end.
TREVOR
Everyone thinks their computer
problem is the world coming to an
end.
JAY
Right. Take a look at this.
Jay directs Cera's sightline to the sky--
TREVOR
Ahhh! What is THAT?
JAY
That, is We're all dead in... Seven
MINUTES UNLESS---
TREVOR
Unless WHAT??
JAY
You start sharing the illegal time
travel tech you've been slinging.
NERD
Excuse me, can you tell me which
one of these batteries is better?
The 10-hour or the 12--
JAY
You only need seven minutes, get
the cheap one.
He grabs Trevor-
27.
JAY (CONT'D)
Where is it??
TREVOR
Okay, okay, I'll show you. But
this is incredibly powerful
technology, so it must remain
absolutely secret. Follow me.
Trevor LEAVES HIS POST --- Jay follows:
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Absolutely secret, do you
understand?
JAY
Yes, but we're running out of time--
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM
Hey! Excuse me!
TREVOR
With you in a second, ma'am.
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM
It'll only take a minute. You see,
my nanny's phone number got erased
from my favorites and I have to ask
her what my daughter wants for her
birthday.
Jay takes the phone.
JAY
Oh, I see the problem.
He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO
PIECES. She leaves in a huff.
TREVOR
I've always wanted to do that.
okay, so here's what you do...
Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information
on him...
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Okay, so go to the clock app. And
shake it.
JAY
That's it?
Jay does it.
28.
On the phone -- TIME TRAVEL BETA
TREVOR
Now you just type in the year you
want to travel to...
On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through
the phone is the image of the targeted time period.
JAY
Okay, thanks.
TREVOR
Now listen. This is highly
crucial: Time travel is nothing to
mess with. You can't change
anything, you can't use new
technology or all of space-time can
just -- kablooey!
JAY
(OFF MISSILES)
Yeah, well, is it ok if I change
THAT?
TREVOR
Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's cool.
Jay is about to "enter" time travel...
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Wait -- hold on a second. If you
go -- I'm just gonna stay... and be
dead?
JAY
Don't worry, I'll fix it. You'll
only be dead for a little while.
Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT...
Cera is left alone. The missiles get EVER CLOSER...
Trevor opens a "Voice Recorder" app:
TREVOR
(INTO PHONE)
Trevor's last words. Dear
posterity... Should anyone find
this, let history remember that
Trevor was a man of noble bearing,
quiet dignity --
(IMPACT!)
OH FUUUUUU-----
29.
And the world is vapor.
EVERYTHING GOES WHITE...
WHITE
Pure white.
Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all
time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes
focus.
Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white
environment -- Is this the afterlife?
The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH
The white resolves into
Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal. The
music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample
was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a
quarter.
Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,
the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.
OFFICE WORKER
What the heck, you're doing a great
job.
The kid leaves.
Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...
White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can
see -- like the office in the Apartment.
Jay stops in his tracks, taking in the 1969-ness of it all.
An officious guy, annoyed, runs up--
30.
OFFICIOUS GUY
You're late! Where's Mr. Watkins'
lunch?
JAY
OH--
OFFICIOUS GUY
Did his girl not put in the order?
The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s.
OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
(shoves a bill in Jay's
HAND)
Run down to Woolworth's -- Two
hamburger sandwiches, fries, egg
cream, and a pack of luckies. If
you're back in half an hour, you
can keep the change.
Jay looks at the SINGLE DOLLAR BILL.
OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
On the double, OK?
JAY
Yeah.
Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it. Pockets the
profits of the racist misunderstandings.
Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay
climbs in with a car full of older executives.
Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.
JAY (CONT'D)
Wow. 1969. You're all dead now.
Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses
him a set of keys.
BLONDE
The Big Man wants his caddy. Chop-
chop.
The doors close.
31.
A great NYC automat...
The kind of place you go when you like to be alone.
Loners and weirdos populate the tables, minding their own
business. Immigrants read foreign papers.
Jay follows Kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines
offering pies... pastries.., beverages...
JAY
Is this your favorite place? Makes.
sense. Zero human interaction.
Kay ignores him.
JAY (CONT'D)
So how old are you?
KAY
Twenty-six.
JAY
Really? Wow, you got some city
miles on you.
Jay laughs. Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine
offering "SPECIALS".
Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about
Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch.
37.
Jay looks at the date: July 14, 1969.
JAY (CONT'D)
The fourteenth. Then we have two
days.
Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich.
JAY (CONT'D)
Hey, look, I know your lunch is
important, but like I said, we only
have two days here.
KAY
Here we go...
Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his
selection. Jay reacts to it -- GROSS!
We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever. The meat
is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy. No
one in their right mind would buy this sandwich.
JAY
No way, man. I am not letting you
eat that. I didn't come all the
way here to have you die before I
can tell you--
Kay reaches for the button. Jay slaps his hand away.
A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--
JAY (CONT'D)
No way, man. No way the world ends
because you had to eat that thing--
Kay SUCCEEDS IN HITTING THE BUTTON and
FWOOOOOOPI
A SECRET DOOR instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay are
A cloud of smoke... It clears and reveals
Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe. It's
how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the MiB
offices.
38.
The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking. Aliens run
around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes. The
alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices.
The !liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege. Very
male and very white. Women are there to be secretaries and
eye candy.
Two many-armed aliens stock the automat. Kay tosses one the
sandwich, it goes right back into the automat.
Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins!
JAY
Hey! [long alien name] and Bob!
Don't worry, you guys get a big
promotion in, like, 20 years.
Kay takes Jay down an escalator. Quick atmospheric
establishing shots of MiB '69:
- A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the
times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix...
- A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very
high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a
secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their
martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible!
- Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool.
- Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go
clean something up.
- An MiB barbershop quartet practices.
MIB QUARTET
(SINGING)
The men in blaaaaaaack...
Jay can't help laughing --
JAY
What planet are they from?
KAY
The Hamptons. Let's go somewhere
we can talk.
JAY
Finally.
39.
Typical interrogation room table in the middle.
Kay pulls out a giant form -- it looks like 10 tax returns
stacked together. He fits sheets of carbon between the
pages.
JAY
Oh, we're gonna do the forms now.
Listen, Kay, I know you're gonna do
what you're gonna do, but we're
burning time here. When I got
here, you had 48 hours. Now you've
got 46.
KAY
Name, planet of origin and Galactic
ID NUMBER--
JAY
My name is Agent Jay, you gave it
to me.
KAY
(WRITING)
"Subject uncooperative." Purpose
of visit?
JAY
To save the Earth.
Kay looks at the form, there's a number of options to check:
"Create a new race... Steal Earth women... Offer life of
eternal youth... vacation... Save the Earth." He checks the
box.
KAY
Save the Earth... Congratulations,
you're the third one today... Maybe
you'll get a balloon.
JAY
Fine, don't believe me. But just
listen to what I have to say,
because it's going to save your
life and the life of everyone in
this galaxy.
It hangs in the air...
KAY
Are you currently pregnant or
preparing to spawn?
40.
JAY
There's a killer out there. Goes
by "Yaz." He's coming for you.
You told me your one regret was not
killing him when you had the
chance.
KAY
Never heard of any Yaz.
JAY
You will. Here's what to look for.
Long hair, leather, looks kind of
like a biker. You'll know him from
the skull ring on his pinky. He's
trying to blow up the Earth and you
get in his way somehow so he kills
you. This Friday. In Florida.
So, if you want to live -- do not
go to Florida.
KAY
Florida? I hate Florida. I hate
everything South of Virginia. If
that's what you came to tell me,
you're wasting your time.
JAY
Man, you're as stubborn as you
always were. I mean -- always will
be. Look, It's not just about you.
Because he kills you, you don't
live long enough to build the
defense shield. And without a
defense shield, the Earth gets
destroyed. You get it? He kills
you, the Earth gets destroyed. I
have to save you from him so we can
save the planet.
Kay stops writing.
KAY
Huh. Well. This is finally
starting to make sense.
Jay looks hopeful.
KAY (CONT'D)
Because you're crazy. Paranoia.
Delusions of self-importance--
A BOOMING VOICE INTERRUPTS --
41.
BOOMING VOICE
Agent Kay!
Door BANGS OPEN -- in walks THE BOSS MAN... and it sure
isn't ZED.
AGENT EX, flanked by junior agent underlings. EX is a well-
tanned WASPy jackass with a room-temperature IQ who probably
got this job from his daddy's country club connections. He's
good at tennis and not thrilled about this whole "civil
rights" fad.
Kay stands.
KAY
Hey, chief.
EX
Heard you got a mooner in here.
Don't take all day. We're not here
to babysit them, just figure out
where he's from and send him back.
KAY
Actually, still trying to sort it
out. He says he's human.
EX
Fortunately, we have the technology
here to test for that.
Ex steps up close to Jay. Looks him over. Then SWIFTLY
PUNCHES HIM IN THE STOMACH.
EX (CONT'D)
Gag reflex. Coughing. Eyes
watering. Human. Code 43 him.
KAY
Got it, chief.
THROUGH MIB
Kay walks Jay.
JAY
So what's code 43?
They pass through a set of double doors. Tilt up to reveal:
ROOM 43
42.
ON JAY AND KAY
Jay reacts to whatever he's looking at.
JAY
WHAT THE--
KAY
This little baby here is called a
Neuralizer.
REVEAL -- The 1969 Neuralizer fills an entire room. And we
ARE
It's manned by 60s labcoat technicians with sliderules and
punchcards.
The Neuralizer itself is a piece of 60s-tech-glory --
magnets, tubes, things that look like they belong in Dr.
Frankenstein's lab.
JAY
Whoa, whoa, what? You're gonna
neuralize ME? You can't neuralize
me. Haven't you been listening?
Two ALIEN ORDERLIES grab Jay.
KAY
Have a lay down, stretch.
The orderlies force Jay on a sort of gurney -- in the '69
Neuralizer, the "patient" is fed through the machine, like
for an MRI.
JAY
You erase what's in here, you erase
the whole world.
KAY
Don't worry. When it's over,
you'll forget all about this Yaz
and Florida and the end of the
world. I think it'll be good for
you. Calm you down.
JAY
I don't need to calm down.
43.
KAY
Don't worry, it's safe. We even
tested it on one of our own men.
Kay indicates Q, who wanders around like he's been
lobotomized.
KAY (CONT'D)
Hey, Agent Q!
Q waves back:
Q
Hey, agent Q!
KAY
No, YOU'RE -- forget it.
(back to Jay)
We're still.., fine-tuning it.
okay, strap him down.
TWO BIG-ASS ALIEN ORDERLIES force Jay down.
A TECH flips the machine ON -- TUBES POWER UP WITH HUGE NOISE
AND FANFARE.
Jay struggles as he gets closer and closer to the machine.
Jay manages to slide his key fob out of his'pocket -- uses
the edge to flip open the clamp on the straps -- and HE'S
FREE
TECH
How the hell--
Kay smiles -- Not bad, kid.
The orderlies rush him -- Jay knocks them out. The
scientists are fraidy-cats -- they hide.
It's down to Jay and Kay.
KAY
Nice moves. You'd make a good
agent.
JAY
I AM a good agent!
Kay takes a SWING at Jay -- Jay dodges it easily.
JAY (CONT'D)
That's right, you always lead with
your left.
44.
Kay pulls his weapon -- Jay ducks behind the Neuralizer --
now Kay can't shoot.
KAY
You're just making it worse for
yourself.
The following plays over a game of CAT AND MOUSE around the
giant structure of the Neuralizer -- like through the stacks
in a library.
KAY (CONT'D)
There's nowhere to run, slim. It's
just if we're gonna do it easy or
do it hard.
Jay runs into a dead end.
Kay and the orderlies are on him. The pissed-off orderlies
grab him roughly, force him onto the gurney. Jay keeps
flailing.
JAY
I know you, Kay, I can prove it...
(SEARCHES)
You love to bowl!
KAY
Bowling is enjoyed by more than 95
million people in more than 90
countries. You gotta do better
than that.
JAY
You've got a scar on the back of
your right hand!
Jay grabs Kay's hand. They LOCK EYES for a moment. Kay lets
Jay flip his hand over, big build-up, REVEALING...
.no scar.
JAY (CONT'D)
Damn. You will! I swear!
Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up.
And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine. This is
all about to be over. Jay thinks desperately for a way out,
THEN-- Eureka!!
JAY (CONT'D)
Kay! KAY!!! What about your girl
on Martha's Vineyard?
45.
Kay looks up. Jay sees an opening:
JAY (CONT'D)
You chose the job over her -- but
you never stopped thinking about
her. You can't forget her.
Kay grabs him.
KAY
How the hell do you know that?
I've never told anyone that.
A long look at this guy, who somehow knows things he
shouldn't.
And he hits the POWER OFF BUTTON...
But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAY'S
TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic
Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time,
inches away from him.
Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken.
JAY
You see, Kay? It's me--
But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him--
KAY
If you're gonna drag her into this,
you'd better be able to back up
your story. Because if you're
jerking me around, I'll make a
window out of your head.
JAY
Yeah, okay, um -- according to the
file, he should have entered Earth-
space in the last couple days. Did
you spot any unauthorized landings
in the last 48 hours?
Kay looks to a tech, who looks at a clipboard --
TECH
We did have something -- a landing
in New Jersey.
Kay and Jay look at each other.
46.
KAY
(TO JAY)
Alright, you're coming with me.
Jay grabs his key chain.
JAY
Can I ask how you're planning on
getting me out of here?
Kay leads a "LOBOTOMIZED" Jay through HQ.
KAY
'Scuse me, boys. Just did a code
43 on this one.
JAY
How's it going, fellas? Look, I
put on my pants.
He feels one of the agent's faces.
Kay leads him to the exit. He talks to Jay as if Jay is a
dim 3rd-grader who speaks little English:
KAY
You are a tourist from Kansas. A
city slicker took your wallet at
the bus station...
Kay leads Jay to a SET OF DOORS MARKED "EXIT to STREET" --
MANNED BY MIB AGENTS.
KAY (CONT'D)
Two out.
The agents nod to Kay and WAVE HIM THROUGH-THE EXIT...
Which deposits them in...
The peepshow megaplex from the bad old days of time square.
A creepy pervert sits in a booth. Puts money into the
machine.
The wall SLIDES UP -- and to his surprise, instead of a
peepshow...
47.
Jay and Kay climb out. Off the creep's reaction:
JAY
Aww. Did I spoil the mood?
On the New Jersey State Parkway --
KAY
You'd better not be wasting my time-
JAY
Yeah, yeah. Window out of my head.
But hey -- if I don't save you, I'm
dead anyway. So do what you want
to me -- just make sure you watch
out for yourself.
They pull up to...
Jay and Kay ride up...
KAY
That thing back at the party, what
was it? Some kind of game?
JAY
Not just any game, PONG. Game of
kings. But it wasn't invented
until 1974.
KAY
How do you know that?
JAY
Because I was the only kid on my
block who didn't have one.
KAY
Aw, what's the matter? Daddy
didn't buy you the toy you wanted?
JAY
Didn't have a daddy to not buy me
toys. Here's the only thing I ever
got from him--
He holds up his key chain.
63.
KAY
That's rough.
JAY
It gets worse. You're the closest
thing I have to a dad.
DOORS OPEN...
DOWN THE RATTY HALLWAY
Jay and Kay move carefully, ready for trouble.
They get to the door -- Apartment 12.
Jay points to the door -- THIS IS IT!
They see -- THE DOOR IS SMASHED IN, PUNCHED OFF ITS HINGES
And punched into the door -- THE IMPRESSION OF A SKULL RING
JAY
That's from Yaz's ring. He was
here. Or is here.
Jay SIGNALS KAY
KAY
Why do you keep doing that?
They move into the room on high alert...
But it's empty.
They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology
(including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of
wires hanging out) and lots of money.. LOTS of money...
Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF
MONEY. They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins.
JAY
So Yaz was never after you... he
was after the Archanans. You just
got in the way.
KAY
Which must make them damn
important. But what does he want
with them?
64.
JAY
'No sign of struggle. They must've
cleared out before he got here.
Like they knew he was coming.
KAY
And he's probably on their trail
now. But where the hell did they
go?
They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a
$100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.
JAY
Think this might tell us something?
On the $100 bill:
A strange series of words and numbers: 3 2... 5 1... 7 5..
KAY
Looks like some kind of code.
We'll take it to HQ, run it through
the computer. Figure out where
they went.
BACK THROUGH THE HALLWAY
Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway --
Yaz steps out of the shadows --
BACK IN THE CAR
Jay and Kay head back to HQ. Kay drives, Jay stares at the
$100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over --
JAY
How about bible verses?
Coordinates? Airplane flights?
Shoe sizes?
KAY
So this is how you do it in the
future, huh? You just keep
guessing until you figure it out?
JAY
(EUREKA)
Phone numbers!
They stop at a light.
65.
Suddenly -- WHAM! WHAM! Someone FRANTICALLY POUNDS on the
trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is
basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume --
hotpants, mary janes, halter top. There's something familiar
about her face...
HOT PANTS GIRL
For God's sake! Help me, would
you? There's some maniac after me -
JAY
Slow down -- who's after you?
HOT PANTS GIRL
He was like nothing I ever saw --
crazy eyes, and this freaky skull
ring.
Jay and Kay look at each other:
JAY
Get in.
HOT PANTS GIRL
Thank you so much. This is a
dangerous city for a girl.
The light turns green -- we're on the girl's face. Jay and
Kay looking straight ahead.
JAY
So where can we take you?
HOT PANTS GIRL
Just make a left up here.
Kay does it... There's a rushing noise...
In the back seat, Hot Pants Girl IS "INFLATING" AND BECOMING
DEVIL GIRL!
The car turns down a dark, deserted alley.
JAY
Are you sure? Seems dangerous.
DEVIL GIRL
Not for me.
Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form
-- DEVIL GIRL! The outfit is grotesque on her.
DEVIL GIRL ATTACKS
66.
SET PIECE FIGHT in the car. Employing cool MiB tech built
into the car.
Devil Girl subdued, locked into the trunk in a "CONTAINMENT
SACK" -- like what you'd use to stuff a raccoon into.
The fight's over, the guys slump against the car.
JAY
What the hell was that?
KAY
I don't know, but I'd bet you two
to one Yaz sent her.
Beat. Light bulb moment for Jay --
JAY
Say that again!
KAY
I think Yaz sent her.
JAY
No, the whole thing!
KAY
I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent
her.
On Jay, realizing--
He grabs the $100 bill --
JAY
I know where they are!
ON JAY AND KAY
Walking -- we hear sounds of crowds, of cheering, REVEAL we
ARE AT--
Jay and Kay watch through a glass wall.
Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a
table.
Ex paces, clearly talking ABOUT the Archanans to the other
agents.
Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus.
Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up.
Ex notices Jay for the first time --
EX
What's he doing here? Didn't we
just bust you?
KAY
That was someone else. All these
mooners look alike, right?
A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.
EX
Yeah... So look. We've talked
about it. And you are to be
commended, Agent Kay. You did a
fine job bringing these illegals
in. Now it's our job to get them
out of the city for containment.
Somewhere where if someone decides
to blow them off the map, the
collateral damage will be
insignificant. Toronto.
KAY
But they're in danger. One of the
most dangerous beings in the
universe is out to kill them--
(looks to Jay)
And if that happens, we're all
going with them, because they're
our only hope of survival.
EX
Christ, if we listened to every
Mooner who showed up telling us how
they were gonna save the world,
that's all we'd do. Do you know
why Earth is still standing?
(MORE)
74.
EX (CONT'D)
Why we're not a smoldering chunk of
nothing? Because we don't stick
our nose into other people's
business. Especially people in
danger, because they have enemies,
and those enemies destroy Earth.
Now. Are you going to execute my
order or not?
KAY
(COLD)
I thought we were supposed to be
the good guys.
EX
Careful, Agent Kay. That sounds
like insubordination.
Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE
KAY
It sounds like you need to cut some
eyeholes in your stomach, because
your head is so far up your ass,
that's the only way you could
possibly see.
EX
That's it. You're off this case.
Stick to dry ice. If I catch you
near them -- or him -- again, I'll
have your badge.
(to a bunch of other
AGENTS)
You four -- take the Archanans to
transpo.
One of the agents looks up--
YOUNG AGENT
Me? I'm just an accountant---
EX
Go!!!
(TO JAY)
And you... You just get out of
here!
The MiB agents GRAB the Archanans and hustle them out.
Kay leans in to them--
KAY
Don't worry, we'll--
75.
LAMA
Yes, we know.
Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him.
KAY
What?
JAY
I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna
lie down. So what's the plan?
KAY
You heard the man. We've got dry
ice to investigate.
GARBAGE COMPACTOR TRUCK
It's the truck that "compacted" Yaz. We follow it to the
MIDDLE OF
GIANT STATEN ISLAND DUMP
Where the truck dumps its load... Including YAZ...
Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE.
On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into
its natural shape.
Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER
OUT...
DUMP EXIT
Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of
something, disturbed.
We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back
together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong
place, the head at a weird angle.
He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself...
Pops out an eye, swaps an arm...
He unfurls his tongue, smells the air --
YAZ
Where did you go...
76.
SHOWWORLD CENTER
A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent... but four
agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his
peep show window.
One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:
ATTENDANT
(CHEERFUL)
You will die alone.
SLEAZY GUY
Yeah, I know.
The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest
emporium of sleaze.
The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to
Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot.
Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant!
They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner --
And it's just some Hare Krishnas.
KAY
Damn. Wrong freaks.
But Jay spots the Archanans...
JAY
Over there, Kay!
As they run off --
HARE KRISHNA
Perhaps you'd like to join us for a
vegetarian meal?
Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans --
The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs
warning WET PAINT!
The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through
a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING"
Jay and Kay follow...
Through the skinny half-painted door...
THROUGH THE.SKINNY DOOR
An EQUALLY SKINNY ESCALATOR descends 100s of feet. A
problem: it's going the WRONG WAY -- bringing incognito
aliens and MiB agents UP INTO GRAND CENTRAL.
Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of 'scuse me --
pardon me -- hey, don't grab that!
But once they power past the crowds, Jay's jaw drops as we
reveal...
78.
SECRET TRAIN STATION
A MUCH-BIGGER station under Grand Central, a secret hub for
sending aliens back and forth all over the country.
It's basically a series of GIANT PNEUMATIC TUBES --people-
sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere
in banks, offices, etc.
A mix of ALIENS and MIB AGENTS put on helmets and pads, board
the tubes and FWOOP off...
Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed
aliens... a newsstand with strange papers... The Beatles in
line for Liverpool with a blue meanie... Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar...
KAY
On your 2 o'clock.
They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO
CANADA.
TUBE TO CANADA
The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans.
They're about to load them into the tubes --
Jay and Kay approach:
KAY
Hold up.
MIB
You're off this case, Kay.
MIB 2
Yeah, but I heard there's some dry
ice in Queens. Magic show at a
kid's birthday party. Better
hustle, you can get there before.
the cake.
They all LAUGH at Kay.
KAY
Change in plans.
MIB
What? We didn't hear about any
change in plans.
79.
KAY
Yeah, Ex just gave us the new
orders -- check this out --
Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his
jacket pocket...
The MiBers lean in...
And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE
TUBE!
The MiB agents stumble, surprised --
The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the
MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube...
Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize... One last VERY
YOUNG agent is still standing there, wide-eyed:
YOUNG AGENT
Don't hurt me! I'm just the
accountant!
He reaches for his radio... Jay talks him down:
JAY
I know you're a little freaked out
and you want to call for backup,
but listen: When you've done this
job for a while, you realize
there's one rule -- things aren't
what they seem. These are innocent
beings that need our protection.
Are you gonna do the right thing or
are you gonna be a company man and
send them off to die in Toronto?
The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.
JAY (CONT'D)
Good, good. What's your name?
YOUNG AGENT
Agent Zed, sir.
KAY
You're gonna be okay, kid.
Jay can't help laughing --
80.
JAY
He's gonna be better than OK. I'm
not gonna give you so much shit
anymore.
The radio CRACKLES --
EX (V.0.)
(ON RADIO)
Zed, what's your status?
ZED
Detainees are on the tube to
Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over.
EX (V.0.)
Copy that, good work, Zed.
Zed crosses off...
JAY
Be nice to him. Trust me.
Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.
JAY (CONT'D)
Okay, you all wanted to go home.
Well here we are. So how do you
want to get off this rock? You
guys have the spaceport on Long
Island yet?
Kay just looks at him.
JAY (CONT'D)
That place is a dump anyway. Best
Margaritas in the Universe, my ass.
What about the one in Ohio?
The Archanans smile.
ATTENDANT
Here is the way home.
The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and
hands it to one of his attendants.
The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes
through all the attendants and then to JAY.
Jay gives it a look.
JAY
Here, huh? You're sure?
81.
LAMA
The only future that ends with life
begins there.
JAY
I'll take that as a strong "yes."
Okay, then. Follow me.
Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the
terminal. Kay catches up --
KAY
Where are we going?
Jay looks at him a beat.
JAY
Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the
biggest T-bone you ever saw when we
get there. So -- you head over to
the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help
these guys over here for a second.
But I'll meet you in a minute. By
the Omaha tube.
They stare at each other --
KAY
Sounds good. See you there.
Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and
reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --
KAY (CONT'D)
Omaha, my ass.
Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a
tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches.
KAY (CONT'D)
Let's go.
JAY
No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay.
KAY
That's what it says.
JAY
Don't you get it?
KAY
Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old
people drive slow.
(MORE)
82.
KAY (CONT'D)
We'll stay somewhere air-
conditioned and only drive after
three when they're at dinner.
JAY
This is why you were there. In
Florida. Because of them. You
were helping them and that's why...
that's why you get killed. Today,
July 16. I saw the report myself.
Agent Kay, dead at the scene.
Killed by Yaz.
KAY
You know what an MiB agent calls it
when he faces death? Besides I got
you to watch my back, right?
They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE
JAY
I just want you to know, I'm doing
this out of love, man.
KAY
Doing what?
He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.
JAY
You stay home and stay alive.
But Kay isn't down.
KAY
I told them I'd help them -- I'm
honor-bound to do it.
Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney.
Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus.
Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.
JAY
Damn, you used to have some abs.
They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:
JAY (CONT'D)
I can't let you go to Florida.
KAY
I make my own future! Besides --
I'm younger and stronger than you!
83.
They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time --
feet collide.
JAY
Bet you're sorry you taught me
that.
The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each
other...
And then Kay fakes a left ---
JAY (CONT'D)
You always lead with your--
But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down
hard.
KAY
Had enough yet?
On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of
strength to lift himself off that floor.
JAY
I can't let you go -- I love you!
Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY.
They CLINCH... it's a stalemate...
KAY
Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-
JAY
I'm not falling for that.
KAY
I'm not kidding --
Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see...
The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the
FLORIDA TUBE.
Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE!
THROUGH THE TUBES
Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of
pneumatic tubes.
84.
The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy,
moving gracefully, like fish through water...
Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything
clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air
luge"...
Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube
like a pinball...
They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern
seaboard...
Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff
astronauts in a G-Force simulator.
Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe:
JAY
(yelling over the wind
NOISE)
I have to know -- can I really
prevent Kay's murder?
LAMA
Yes.
JAY
Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to
hear.
LAMA
But where there was death, there
will be death.
JAY
What does that mean?
The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets
CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.
Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.
No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV
he never left... It all seems the same except for quick shots
of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee
cart...
Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to
everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.
He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.
A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on
winning the Bowling trophy... AGAIN.
Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.
KAY
Alright, everyone, give me and my
partner here a minute.
They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him
in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.
JAY
It's good to see you, man. So
good. I just... do you remember...
I mean, do you know what I've been
through?
Kay just stares at him.
KAY
You mean, do I remember that you
travelled back in time to save my
life and the world? Not bad,
slick. Not bad.
JAY
No problem. You'd do the same for
me. I just have one question...
(MORE)
106.
JAY (CONT'D)
When you disappeared... Why didn't
I forget you when everyone else
did?
KAY
Well, I don't know exactly.
Because I was dead. But in a
quantum reality, objects can exist
in contradictory states... So
multiple timelines with varying
probabilities can exist, and the
one you're closest to
MATHEMATICALLY--
JAY
Oh, you're talking about our
closeness... you're talking about
our love... Across timelines!
You're saying our love will go on!
Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.
Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it
out.
JAY (CONT'D)
He was a good man.
KAY
Yes he was.
JAY
I'm glad I know that.
KAY
So you travelled back in time, huh?
JAY
Yep.
KAY
Wow. And you didn't change
anything?
JAY
No.
KAY
You're sure? Because the littlest
thing can have huge repercussions.
JAY
I was very careful.
107.
KAY
Good man, good man. Well, let's
get you a uniform.
JAY
Excuse me?
We PULL BACK --
Revealing PRESENT DAY MIB IN ALL ITS KICKASS GRANDEUR.
Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and
all its inhabitants...
And every one of those agents wearing BLUE SUITS WITH SHORTS.
JAY (CONT'D)
Even I can't make that look good.
FADE TO BLACK.
