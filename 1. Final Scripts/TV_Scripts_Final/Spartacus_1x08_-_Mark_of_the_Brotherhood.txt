  FADE IN:


  EXT. ARENA - DAY

  A BLURRY, OUT OF FOCUS SHOT of a FIGURE running towards us 
  in SLOW MOTION. No sound except LABORED BREATHING. The 
  Figure comes into focus:

  SPARTACUS,

  bare chested, wielding two swords, his eyes glinting with 
  impending violence. The CROWD ROARS as we RAMP TO NORMAL 
  TIME. Spartacus slams into a HOPLOMACHUS, his swords 
  expertly slicing into the Gladiator s flesh. He slices open 
  the man s neck in a geyser of gore, the BLOOD WIPING US TO:

  A SERIES OF FIGHTS

  in the arena, spanning several months. One after the other, 
  building in speed and ferocity as Spartacus decimates all 
  who oppose him: A MURMIILLO gets his arm hacked off. A 
  THRAEX is run through the chest with both of Spartacus  
  swords. Throats are slit and limbs are lost as Spartacus 
  becomes increasingly splattered in the blood of his 
  opponents, culminating in

    A PROVOCATOR

  being decapitated by Spartacus. He uses a scissor-like move, 
  his two swords crossed then whipped outward, catching the 
    Provocator s neck in between.

  THE CROWD ERUPTS

  as the man s head topples to the sand, followed a moment 
  later by his body. Spartacus throws his swords up in 
  victory, a vicious smile bending his lips: he s actually 
  enjoying this. THE PULVINUS

  SLAVES fan the cheering PATRICIANS that crowd the pulvinus. 
  NAEVIA stands near BATIATUS and LUCRETIA, who sit with 
  ILITHYIA in the front row. Ilithyia barely hides her disdain 
  for Spartacus. SOLONIUS sits opposite Batiatus, trying to 
  ignore his gloating rival.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus, victor again! It is a 
                        marvel good Solonius has any men 
                        left!

  The Patricians laugh as they rise to exit, the games 
  concluded. Solonius forces a smile, fuming.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.
  CONTINUED:

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Must the Thracian appear in every 
                        primus? Does the House of Batiatus 
                        not deem another gladiator worthy 
                      of spectacle?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        They have no one else of note.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Crixus will return to glory 
                        presently.

  Solonius bows as he exits, not believing it.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      As you say.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        A welcome addition. I grow tired of 
                        seeing the Thracian and his 
                        victories.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Perhaps something of note to erase 
                        the tedium. I purchase a fresh 
                        batch of slaves at tomorrow s 
                        auction, to be trained as 
                          gladiators...

  He gives Lucretia a knowing look. She catches his plan, 
  initiates it.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      We would be honored if you would 
                        grace us at the unveiling.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                  excited)(
                        What sort of beasts shall you 
                        procure?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Only the most ferocious, to be 
                        displayed for your pleasure.

  He smiles, eyes twinkling as they exit, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. MARKET - CAPUA - DAY

  CAMERA PANS across a SLAVE BLOCK. SIX MEN stand shackled 
  before the gathered crowd. All are muscular, hard looking 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

  brutes. PLAQUES dangle from their necks, detailing their 
  names and nationalities. Off to the side are a cluster of 
  shackled FEMALE SLAVES, breasts exposed. ADJUST TO FIND

  BATIATUS

  approaching with DOCTORE and ASHUR in tow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fortune favors us! A fine 
                        selection, and enough coin to have 
                        our pick.

                                        ASHUR
                        Your competitor approaches.

  Ashur nods towards Solonius making his way through the 
  crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You give the man credit beyond his 
                        position.
                                (to Solonius, 
                                  loudly)
                        Solonius! My heart brims with joy! 
                        I had hoped to see you here, buying 
                      up more men for Spartacus to 
                        slaughter!

  The Crowd laughs. Solonius steps close to Batiatus, bowing 
  slightly.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Batiatus... now purse-proud and so 
                        potent with charm.

                                        BATIATUS
                        How quickly Fortuna shifts her 
                        blessings.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A fact that beloved Ovidius was 
                        unexpectedly made aware.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You speak truth. His murder was a 
                        deep tragedy.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Indeed. One can never know who is 
                        plotting violence, can they?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

                      Or when they will commit the act.

  Batiatus  smile curls, punctuating the thinly veiled threat. 
  Doctore interrupts.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The auction begins, Dominus.

                                        BATIATUS
                      To business, then.

  Batiatus moves closer to the auction with Doctore and Ashur. 
  Solonius glares after them, his hatred for Batiatus 
  expanding exponentially.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The Gaul Segovax demands expense.  
                        And perhaps the two German 
                        brothers, Duro and Agron.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The others?

                                          DOCTORE
                      Of little worth.

  THE SLAVE TRADER, a seedy peddler of human flesh, steps 
  forward to address the crowd.

                                        SLAVE TRADER
                        Good citizens of Capua! Behold the 
                        finest offerings of flesh and bone!

                        your house with quality wares! Let 
                      us begin with a Celtic Gaul of 
                        imposing virtues! I give you 
                        Segovax!

  SEGOVAX, an imposing Gaul, steps forward. Two barbaric 
  German brothers, AGRON and DURO, stand behind him. From the 
  looks on their faces, they don t care for Gauls.

                                        SLAVE TRADER(cont'd)

                        Who would claim such a man?! Bid!

  VIBIUS, mid 40s, thin and greasy yells out.

  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  OVERHEAD SHOT of CRIXUS making love to Lucretia. Slow and 
  methodical, a stark contrast to their usually explosive 
  sessions. We DRIFT DOWN to REVEAL Lucretia, her face barely 
  concealing her disappointment as Crixus climaxes. He rolls 
  off of her, regards an impassive Lucretia.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Have I not pleased you, Domina?

                        I fear you did not quake. 
                        Apologies. My wounds have yet to 
                        fully heal.

  Naevia enters.

                        Out. Quickly.

  Crixus stands, revealing the large unhealed scar that covers 
  his stomach. He quickly pulls on his subligaria and follows 
  Naevia out of the room. OFF Lucretia, unfulfilled, watching 
  him go with a worried frown...                                                                                    7.


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Naevia escorts Crixus through the villa. A tense silence 
  hangs between them. Crixus eyes her, uncomfortable.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  hushed)(

                        hopes she will lose interest.

  Naevia pauses at the door leading down to the ludus.

                        I am not angry with you. It is

                        you and Domina share what we have 
                        not. For some time.

  Crixus pulls her into a stolen kiss.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You alone occupy my thoughts.

  Guards approaching break the moment. Crixus moves through 
  the gate, sneaks a final glance at a saddened Naevia before 
    disappearing. OFF Naevia, heavy-hearted...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The SIX NEW RECRUITS are led in by GUARDS, loincloths 
  serving as their lone covering. REVERSE TO THE GLADIATORS, 
  shouting and jeering at the men, except for

  SPARTACUS,

  standing silent as he coolly observes the fresh meat being 
  lined up in the training square.

  CRIXUS

  slyly falls in behind Spartacus, having just returned from 
  Lucretia s bedchamber.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

  DOCTORE

  enters the square, whip in hand. The Gladiators respectfully 
  quiet. Doctore surveys the Recruits with blazing contempt as 
  he launches into his commencement speech.

                                          DOCTORE
                        What is beneath your feet?

  The men eye the sand in confusion, unsure how to reply. Duro 
  finally responds.

                                        DURO
                        Sand?

  The Gladiators ROAR. Doctore frowns in disgust. Agron, 
  Duro s brother, hisses to him.

                                        AGRON
                        Fucking idiot.

  Doctore CRACKS his whip, silencing the laughter.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Spartacus! What is beneath your 
                        feet?

  Spartacus steps forward. His words are delivered from a new 
  place of belief.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sacred ground, Doctore! Watered 
                        with tears of blood!

  Crixus seethes. Not being on top means it s no longer his 
  privilege to answer.

                                          DOCTORE
                                to Recruits)(
                        Your tears. Your blood. Your 
                        pathetic lives, forged into 
                        something of worth...

  VARRO slides up next to Ashur.

                        Five. On the fool.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus steps out, followed by Lucretia and a flushed 
  Ilithyia, who excitedly ogles the Recruits below. Naevia and 
  a few attending Slaves hover in the background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have been blessed! Each and

                        Republic!

  The Gladiators CHEER. Spartacus allows himself a grim smile. 
  Ilithyia glances at Batiatus, whispers to Lucretia.

                        Prove yourself, in the hard days to 
                        follow.  Prove yourself more than a 
                        common slave.  Prove yourself more 
                        than a man.  Fail, and die.  Either 
                        here where you stand, or sold off

  The Gladiators ROAR their approval. Doctore CRACKS HIS WHIP, 
  silencing the uproar. He surveys the Recruits with 
  dissatisfaction as he continues his  welcoming  speech from 
  ep. 102.

                                          DOCTORE

                        growing quite fond of this sordid 
                        business of gladiators.

  Batiatus and Lucretia share a glance, sensing opportunity.

  Ilithyia hesitates, a little girl presented with the option

                        Shit baking in the sun. Seems only 
                        yesterday we were of a similar 
                        position.

  Spartacus glances at the Recruits.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Much has changed.

  Varro s thoughts fall to his wife and her surprising 
  pregnancy.

                                        VARRO
                        Much. You became the fucking 
                        Champion of Capua. Your myth to 
                        echo for a thousand years. And I --

                      -- became a good friend.

  An uncomfortable beat, broken by RHASKOS calling from the 
  far corner. He shakes a pair of dice in his hand.

                                          RHASKOS
                        Varro! The dice call your name!

                                        VARRO
                        And Varro answers.

  Varro stands to leave. Spartacus shoots him a look.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You continue to gamble.

                                        VARRO
                        A few coins to pass the time. 
                        Nothing to concern yourself with. 
                        Friend.

  Spartacus watches Varro move off, not caring for the 
  response. WHAM! His attention is drawn to RECRUIT #4 as he 
  CRASHES across a table. Crixus has just shoved him back as 
  the Recruits enter to eat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You fucking wait until gladiators 
                        have filled their bellies. If there 
                      is any left...

  The Gladiators laugh as Crixus ladles huge amounts of stew 
  from the pot into his bowl.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Crixus.

  Crixus darkens as Spartacus approaches.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Let them eat.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  hissing)(
                        They must embrace pain and 
                        suffering to become gladiators. 
                        This is how it is done.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Not by you. Let them eat.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

  A tense beat. Crixus tosses his bowl into the pot in 
  disgust.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Spartacus the Kind and Gentle, 
                        offering hugs and warm kisses.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Do not mistake me, Crixus. I give 
                      no shit about these men. But you 
                        are no longer the Champion of 
                        Capua. You do not take lead here. 
                        You follow.

  The mess hall has gone quiet. Ashur chews on a piece of 
  bread, clocking the confrontation with interest. A tense 
  beat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The man who follows is forever at 
                        your back. Something to consider, 
                        Champion.

  Crixus moves off, his hatred of Spartacus all consuming.

                                        AGRON

                        Fucking Gauls.

  Agron tosses Segovax a withering look.  Segovax ignores him, 
  retrieves the bowl from the pot.

                                          SEGOVAX
                                to Spartacus)(

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Men should not die with empty 
                        stomachs.

  Spartacus truly doesn t care about Segovax or the other men. 
  He moves off, WIPING US TO --


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Ashur moves down the corridor with half naked SLAVE GIRLS, 
  escorted by GUARDS. He pauses at Rhaskos  cell.

                                        ASHUR
                        Rhaskos.

  Rhaskos appears with a grin.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                        End of the month already, is it?

                                        ASHUR
                        According to the calendar you 
                        cannot read.

  Ashur consults a sheaf of parchment with names and figures.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Your winnings amount to three and a 
                        half denarii. Preserve coin, or 
                        indulge yourself?

                        When do I ever favor coin over 
                        gash?

  Ashur nods to a Slave Girl, who enters the cell and 
  disrobes.

                                        ASHUR
                        I expect her ass to be returned 
                        free from blood.

                                          RHASKOS
                      My cock considers both holes equal. 
                        Find yourself lucky it does not 
                        favor yours.

  Rhaskos removes his subligaria as he ushers the girl into 
  his cell. Ashur continues down the corridor, Guards and 
  Slave Girls in tow. Crixus appears, having been passed by.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Ashur. You pass my cell by mistake.

                                        ASHUR
                        The mistake is yours. You do not 
                        fight, you are entitled to neither 
                        coin nor cunt.

  Crixus glares, his eyes filling with violence. One of the 
  Guard s hands drops to his sword, a gesture that does not go 
  unnoticed.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The Dominus shall hear of this.

  Ashur indicates his parchment.

                        yourself again among them, should 
                        your wounds ever heal.

  Ashur spots Varro further down the corridor.

                        Varro! A moment.

  He hobbles after him, leaving Crixus seething in his wake.

                        Your victories amass much coin.

                      Or would you prefer a small portion 
                        applied to more pressing concerns?

    A VOLUPTUOUS SLAVE GIRL smiles at Varro, liking what she 
  sees. OFF the temptation...


  INT. CORRIDOR/BARRACKS - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus, returning from a bath, moves down the corridor. 
  SOUNDS OF FUCKING echo off the walls as various Gladiators 
  copulate with SLAVE GIRLS. Spartacus slows as he comes upon

  VARRO,

  in his cell fucking the Voluptuous Slave Girl. Varro catches 
  the look... then guiltily turns away, thrusting even harder. 
  Spartacus continues on in disgust, passing the

  BARRACKS

  The Recruits are sprawled across the floor, exhausted from 
  the day s training. Agron and Duro eye Spartacus as he 
  passes.

  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NEXT DAY

  CLOSE ON the bloodied, dead face of Recruit #4 as his body 
  is tossed onto a table by Guards. No glory in the arena for 
  him. WIDEN TO REVEAL MEDICUS inspecting Crixus  wounds. 
  Crixus stands stoic, masking the pain. Batiatus tensely 
  awaits the news.

  Medicus hands Batiatus a list scrawled on a scrap of 
  parchment.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Crixus  crushing disappointment...


  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Batiatus walks with Ashur in tow. Ashur reviews the lengthy 
  list provided by the Medicus.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.
  CONTINUED:

                                        ASHUR
                                  rattles off)(
                          Mandragora... henbane... lye... 
                        thorn apple... hemlock... 
                          belladonna... Half a dozen more. A 
                        substantial list, requiring 
                        substantial coin.

  Batiatus frowns, fishes a purse of coins out of his robes 
  and tosses it to Ashur.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Procure the highest quality.

                                        ASHUR
                        A justified expense, should remedy 
                        result.

                                        BATIATUS
                        May the gods see it fucking so. 
                        Many days pass without progress.

                                        ASHUR
                        When Doctore suffered wounds from 
                        Theokoles... did they require equal 
                        time in the healing?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Considerably less.

  Ashur, always angling towards his benefit, presses.

                                        ASHUR
                        There may be a blessing hidden 
                        among such a curse. Talk of Crixus  
                        true condition surely has not 
                        escaped beyond these walls. Yet.

  Batiatus pauses.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your meaning?

                                        ASHUR
                        Inquiries for his purchase could be 
                        made in a delicate fashion. My 
                        visit to the market could serve 
                        dual purposes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Remove the thought. There will be 
                      no talk of selling Crixus.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.
  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus continues moving through the villa. Ashur limps 
  after him.

                                        ASHUR
                        I only fear for the future, 
                        Dominus. One that does not see 
                        Spartacus erased from it.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  angers)(
                        Straighten your fucking tongue and 
                        speak plainly.

                                        ASHUR
                        Yesterday I witnessed the hatred 
                        Crixus cultivates towards Spartacus 
                        grow beyond measure. If in his mad 
                        passions Crixus were to make 
                        attempt on his life...

  Ashur lets the implication hang heavy in the air. Batiatus 
  chews on it, frowns at the taste.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  reluctantly)(
                        Solicit numbers from Sextus Vibius 
                        alone. Word of Crixus  stunted 
                        recovery is not to spread. I wish 
                        only to discover his current value.

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        You would sell Crixus?

  Batiatus turns to find Lucretia approaching with Naevia by 
  her side.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would explore all avenues of 
                        reason.

  Batiatus waves Ashur away. Ashur nods compliance and moves 
  off, a slight bend growing on his lips as he exits.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Which has flown if you consider 
                        such a thing. Crixus will fight 
                        again.

  Batiatus tries to be gentle with his concerns.

                                        BATIATUS
                        But will he ever be the man he was?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    22.
  CONTINUED:

  That hits Lucretia hard, especially since she has had the 
  same concern since her last disappointing lovemaking session 
  with the man. Batiatus heads for his office. Lucretia 
  follows, refusing to give up.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Give him time to heal, Quintus. He 
                        bleeds when pierced, as does any 
                        man.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The crowds do not see a man. They 
                        see him a god, and we present him 
                      as such. Should that myth 
                        evaporate, so goes his worth.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Then we will find worth in another 
                        role. Surely his knowledge would 
                        aid instruction to the lower men?

                                        BATIATUS
                      We already have a Doctore. The 
                        finest in any ludus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  searching)(
                      He could work beside you, then.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus has no head for numbers. The 
                        sword is his only purpose.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He is part of this family, Quintus!

  Batiatus whirls, not caring for that.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He is a fucking slave!

  That stops her in her tracks. Batiatus composes himself, 
  continues in a more measured tone.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        This house, this family, is a 
                        business, Lucretia. As much regret 
                        results from selling a gladiator 
                        like Crixus, when the time arrives, 
                        and it fucking will for them all, 
                      it is a necessity that must be 
                        swallowed.

                        The decision has yet to be made. 
                        The man may still prove himself 
                        fit.

  He kisses her softly.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Turn your mind towards Ilithyia and 
                        her friends. Win their favor, and 
                        see our family name rise ever 
                        higher.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Lucretia, feeling the crushing weight of 
  possibly losing Crixus... and Naevia sharing the burden 
  silently by her side...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Gladiators and Recruits train under Doctore s ever watchful 
  eye. Wooden swords CLASH, nearly missing CAMERA as it SLOWLY 
  PUSHES through the action: Agron spars with Varro. Rhaskos 
  against Duro. Hamilcar and a ND RECRUIT. Segovax spars with 
  Spartacus (two swords, no shield). CAMERA finally escapes 
  unscathed to find

  CRIXUS,

  fuming on a table in the mess hall, glaring at Spartacus. 
  Aching to return to training, sword hand absently clenching 
  and unclenching into a fist.

                                        NAEVIA (O.S.)
                                    whispering)(
                        Crixus.

  He turns, spots Naevia standing in the shadows on the other 
  side of the gate.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  voice kept low)(
                        What are you doing?
                                (looking toward 
                                  square)
                        Doctore s gaze misses nothing.

                                        NAEVIA
                        A risk made necessary by 
                        unfortunate events.

  Crixus eyes her with concern.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

                        Did something happen to you?

                                        NAEVIA
                        I am ever safe. But Dominus... he 
                        considers selling you to another 
                        master.

  The words are as difficult to give as to receive.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You are mistaken.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Would that it were so. Ashur has 
                        been sent to market for herbs... 
                        and to question Vibius on his 
                        interest towards you.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Vibius?! Lanista of shits and 
                        mongrels! The glory I have earned 
                        this ludus, and here is my fucking 
                        reward!

  Naevia reaches through the bars and squeezes Crixus  arm.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You must prove to Dominus that your 
                        time has not passed. And prove it 
                        quickly.

  Naevia retreats, disappearing up the stairs to the villa. 
  OFF Crixus, smoldering...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The Gladiators and exhausted Recruits continue to spar. 
  Doctore strides among them.

                                          DOCTORE
                      To step upon the sands as a 
                        gladiator is the highest station a 
                        slave can pray for. Prove 
                        yourselves. Earn the mark of the 
                        brotherhood. And fight with honor.

  He passes Spartacus, glaring at him as he goes. Spartacus 
  ignores him, deflecting a series of blows from Segovax.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    25.

                        Good. But you lower your shield 
                        when you thrust. It leaves you open 
                        from shoulder to neck. Again.

  Segovax attacks, but his shield dips again. Spartacus cracks 
  him across the shoulder. Segovax grunts in pain.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You strike a solid blow.

  Spartacus turns to see Crixus approaching.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Against an ill-trained fool who 
                        taints the name of Gaul.

  Segovax glares. Doctore glances over, says nothing.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He may be a fool. But he is one 
                        that is fit to train.
                                to Segovax)(
                        Again.

  Segovax steels himself, but Crixus isn t done yet.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You doubt that I am fully healed? I 
                        would show you otherwise.

  Spartacus gauges Crixus, a faint smile bending his lips.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Doctore! Crixus offers a 
                          demonstration, to the benefit of 
                        the recruits! Shall I indulge?

  Doctore glances up to

  THE BALCONY

  where Batiatus has appeared, chewing grapes. Lucretia and

  Lucretia pushes aside her worry, her only concern preventing 
  Crixus from being sold.

                      As do I.

  Batiatus considers, then nods permission to Doctore, curious 
  of the outcome. TRAINING SQUARE

                                          DOCTORE
                        Segovax! Your sword and shield.

  Crixus grins as Segovax trots over, relinquishing his sword 
  and shield to Crixus. He relishes the feel of them: old 
  friends, reunited. Doctore cracks his whip.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Attend!

  All eyes turn towards Spartacus and Crixus. PUSH IN on 
  Spartacus as he extends invitation to Crixus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Show me.

  CRIXUS attacks with fierce determination. Spartacus is 
  surprised by the fluidity of the assault. It s as if Crixus 
  had never been injured.

  THE BALCONY

  Lucretia steps to the edge of the railing, her eyes dancing. 
  Behind her, Naevia takes in her lover s display, hope 
  swelling.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus deflects and defends, not attempting to strike 
  back. Instead he s letting Crixus overexert himself, much 
  like Crixus did to him in the arena in episode 103. Crixus 
  grunts from the effort, sweat springing from his brow. 
  SPARTACUS SUDDENLY COUNTERS,

  reversing the attack. Crixus is driven back under the 
  assault of Spartacus  twin swords. TIME SLOWS AND 
    ACCELERATES. Crixus swings his sword. Spartacus bends, the 
  blade contrailing the air an inch from his upturned face. He 
  answers the attack, brutally sending Crixus to the sand.

  THE BALCONY

  Lucretia reacts. Naevia barely conceals her concern.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

  To prove a point, Spartacus calls out Crixus  missteps (a la 
  Doctore in Ep. 102).

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                      He attacks boldly to hasten 
                        victory. Counter to proper 
                        training.

  Crixus brims with anger, surges forward. TIME SLOWS AND 
  ACCELERATES as Spartacus counters, sending him toppling once 
  more to the sand.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Defeat is delivered not only by the 
                        sword, but also the crowd.

                                  Crixus)
                        Fall from their grace, and you may 
                        never rise to former glories.

  Crixus grunts in pain as he rises. Blood seeps from his 
  stomach wound, having partially reopened.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        A true gladiator is taught to 
                        embrace pain and suffering. To 
                        fight until life flees from his 
                        worthless body.

  Crixus attacks, eyes wild with rage. Spartacus delivers a 
  lightning quick combination. Crixus  sword and shield tumble 
  from his grasp as he smashes to the sand, dazed, bloodied, 
  and humiliated.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Learn from this man. Or share his 
                        fate.

  Spartacus rears back with one of his swords, intent on 
  bashing Crixus  skull in.

                        Spartacus.

  Spartacus pauses, glancing up at Batiatus.

  Spartacus bows slightly, turning his back on Crixus as he 
  rejoins the Gladiators and Recruits. Crixus spits out a 
  mouthful of blood, tries his best to stand, but his 
  aggravated wounds are too much. He glances up to

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus holds his gaze for a moment, then turns away, 
  exiting into the villa. The crestfallen look on Lucretia s 
  face says it all: Crixus has just doomed himself. Lucretia 
  reluctantly joins Batiatus inside. Naevia shares a final, 
  pained look with Crixus before following.

  EXT. MARKET - CAPUA - DAY

  Ashur stands with VIBIUS.

                                        ASHUR
                        A fine offer, good Vibius. I shall 
                        hasten to present it to my master.

  Vibius nods, exits. Ashur spots Solonius approaching, tries 
  to avoid him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                to Ashur)(
                        A moment, slave.

  Ashur turns, masking his hatred with a practiced smile.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        You frequent the market absent 
                        Batiatus?

                                        ASHUR
                        I conduct important business on his 
                        behalf.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Regarding the former Champion of 
                        Capua?

  That catches Ashur by surprise. Solonius clocks the 
  reaction.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would, if found in similar 
                        position. Crixus is champion in 
                        name only. He is but limbs, 
                        dangling from a skewered trunk. 
                        Your master would be well served 
                        pawning him off on a toad like 
                        Vibius.

                                        ASHUR

                      My concern is not for him, but 
                        about him.

  Solonius produces a pouch of coins.

                        Are your ears receptive?

  Ashur eyes the pouch hungrily.

                                        ASHUR
                        I cannot stop a free man from 
                        speech.

                                        SOLONIUS

                        offenses he believes I have made, I 
                        would have warning in advance.

  Ashur considers that for a beat, bows slightly.

                                        ASHUR
                        I am a villain.

                        Loyalty can become a crushing 
                        weight, if not braced with proper 
                        support. When your back begins to 
                        break, you will find my shoulders 
                        broad and welcoming.

  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Crixus sits alone on the table, his reopened wounds dressed 
  with salve and herb. The fire has dimmed noticeably in his 
  eyes.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You overreach.

  Crixus glances over. Spartacus has appeared in the doorway.

                        And here is the result.

                                        CRIXUS
                      Do not address me as you would a 
                        recruit.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then do not act like one.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Words of import from the mighty 
                        Spartacus! Bringer of Rain! Slayer 
                      of Theokoles! As if you stood alone 
                        against him. Without my aid, you 
                        would have nothing. Not even your 
                        miserable life.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        True. Yet here I stand. And there 
                        you sit.

  A long beat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You know shit of being champion, of 
                        being a true brother. You are only 
                        playing at your part. And one day 
                        the game shall end.

                        Death comes to us all. Press me 
                        again, and you shall find yours.

  Spartacus exits, leaving Crixus to nurse wounds to body and 
  ego...                                                                                    31.


  INT. CORRIDOR/TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Lucretia leads Ilithyia, CAECILIA (20s, beautiful), AEMILIA 
  (20s, beautiful), and LICINIA (20s, blonde, tall and 
  striking, she could be Ilithyia s sister) through the villa. 
  The women are a force of nature. Think The Hills, circa 74 
  B.C.E. Licinia is obviously a step above in station -- and 
    intelligence.  Naevia and attending Slaves walk an 
  appropriate distance behind.

                        Gratitude for joining us this 
                        evening. Ilithyia has spoken so 
                        very highly of you all, I feel as 
                      if we are old friends.

                        You have us at disadvantage. 
                        Ilithyia neglected to mention she 
                        was acquainted with the wife of 
                        good Batiatus.

  Ilithyia intercepts with a laugh.

                        Yes, we all love each other and 
                        have orgies under the new moon.
                                to Lucretia)(
                        Now tell us stories!

                                        CAECILIA
                        Yes, tell us everything about this 
                        horrid place!

                                        ILITHYIA
                        She means the ludus below.

                                        CAECILIA
                      Do I need an interpreter?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Apparently.

                                          LICINIA
                      Do be quiet and let her speak!
                                to Lucretia)(
                        How do you live among such beasts?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My husband sees them well tamed.

                                          LICINIA
                        I pray not fully.

                        Licinia!

  The women laugh.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Some instinct remains. So they may 
                        yet unleash their savagery in the 
                        arena.

                                        CAECILIA
                        I would go insane here! Surrounded 
                      by these animals, high atop this 
                        mountain. Would you not prefer the 
                        city, surrounded by real people?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I find we are perfectly located. I 
                        need only step onto the balcony and 
                        all of Capua kneels before me.

                                          LICINIA
                        Well stated.

                                          AEMILIA
                        But are you not bored? Up here, all 
                        alone? Nothing but slaves and 
                        beasts, not even children to occupy 
                      --

  She freezes, shooting a glance at Ilithyia as she realizes 
  she spoke out of turn. Lucretia remains calm, tries her best 
  to ignore the remark. Ilithyia jumps in, steering the 
    conversation in a more productive manner.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Boredom? Impossible with so many 
                          distractions!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I stay quite occupied. Each day 
                        brings with it opportunity. 
                        Yesterday, in fact, six new 
                        recruits began their training. One 
                      of whom fights under Ilithyia s 
                        patronage.

  An uproar of giggles and shocked, titillated laughter.

                                          LICINIA
                        Ilithyia! Claudius gave you 
                        approval?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                                    conspiratorially)(
                      He does not know. A few coins, 
                        parceled from my allowance.

                                        CAECILIA
                      He will kill you when he finds out!

                                        ILITHYIA
                        And I will kill the first who 
                        tells!

  More shrieking and laughter. Ilithyia basks in the 
  attention.

                                          LICINIA
                        A gladiator of your own! May we see 
                        him?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      Of course, but he is not yet a 
                        gladiator. He must pass the final 
                        test before earning the mark of 
                        Batiatus.

                                        CAECILIA
                        Oh. He is only a slave, then?

  That dampens the mood. Ilithyia glowers. Lucretia realizes 
  her mistake, tries to cover.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        For the moment, but --

                                          AEMILIA
                        I would lay eyes upon a real 
                        gladiator.

                                          LICINIA
                        Yes! A champion! Bring Spartacus 
                        up!

                                        CAECILIA
                        Spartacus! Yes! You must!

  Lucretia turns to Ilithyia, not sure what to do. Ilithyia s 
  turn to force a smile.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Bring the Champion. Let us all 
                        revel in his presence.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

  Ilithyia sips her wine. OFF Lucretia, smiling politely as 
  her evening slowly crumbles...


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON Spartacus as he s scraped by a Slave. PULL BACK to 
  REVEAL other Gladiators receiving the same treatment. Lower 
  men and the Recruits scrape themselves. Spartacus glances 
  across the room at Varro, being scraped, eyes downcast.

                                          SEGOVAX (O.S.)
                        Gratitude.

  Spartacus glances over to find Segovax has appeared.

                                          SEGOVAX
                        For your aid in my training today.

  Spartacus ignores him, his eyes falling instead on Crixus as 
  he enters. He sits with a slight wince of pain, takes up a 
  scraper to attend his own skin. No special treatment for the 
  fallen.

                                          SEGOVAX(cont'd)
                        I would be eager to hear any 
                        advice, to further my cause.

  Spartacus replies, never taking his eyes off of Crixus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Your cause?

                                          SEGOVAX
                        Victories in the arena, and 
                        freedom.

  The men chuckle. Spartacus does not.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Forsake thoughts of freedom, and 
                        the life you once had beyond these 
                        walls. Accept your fate... or be 
                        destroyed by spectres of a past 
                        never to return.

  Crixus locks eyes with him. A Guard appears.

                                        GUARD
                        Spartacus. You are summoned.

  Crixus watches as Spartacus exits. He passes the glowering 
  Gaul, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    36.


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON a well manicured HAND as it slowly caresses a 
  broad, familiar chest.

                                          LICINIA (O.S.)
                      He stands as Mars, ready for war.

  WIDEN to REVEAL Spartacus, shackled, standing proud before 
  the awe-struck women. Licinia touches his chest with near 
  orgasmic wonder. Aemilia and Caecilia sip wine, loving their 
   display.  Lucretia eyes the women, pleased that they fawn 
  over Spartacus. Ilithyia stands off to the side, seething. 
  Several GUARDS are in the background.

                                          LICINIA
                      Is there truth to the legends? That 
                        gladiators share the blood of the 
                        gods?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The mighty Crixus, most certainly.

  Ilithyia sips her wine, knowing she s brought up a delicate 
  subject in mixed company.

                                        CAECILIA
                        Now there was a man! Truly blessed 
                      by the gods!

                                          AEMILIA
                        When will we see him in the arena 
                        again?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Soon.

  Lucretia tries to hide the pain of the lie.

                                          LICINIA
                        What of you, Spartacus? Are you a 
                        blessing to us?

                                          SPARTACUS
                      To some. To others, a curse.

  Spartacus shifts his eyes to Ilithyia. Lucretia tenses.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The duality of his kind. Admired as 
                        a gladiator. Yet despised as a 
                        slave.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.

  Licinia stands entranced.

                      He is much more than a common 
                        slave. You can feel it radiating 
                        from his flesh...
                                to Lucretia)(
                        I have heard tale of a champion s 
                        blood possessing many restorative 
                        powers.

                                          AEMILIA
                        A few drops in a glass of wine is 
                        said to make a man hard for days!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Such are the legends.

                                          LICINIA
                        I would test them for myself, if I 
                        could?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      Of course. We will send messenger 
                        with a vial --

                        I would have it now.

  Aemilia and Caecilia titter excitedly. Lucretia hesitates, 
  but knows to refuse the request would be unwise.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Guard. Your knife.

  A Guard comes forward and hands Lucretia his knife.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        May I have the honor?

  Lucretia hesitates, reluctantly hands Ilithyia the knife.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Take care not to cut too deep.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The legend does call for the blood 
                      of a dead gladiator, does it not?

  She traces the knife over his chest, almost erotically.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                        us. Spartacus will die soon 
                        enough...

  She moves the blade up to his neck. Lucretia tenses. 
  Spartacus doesn t even flinch. He won t give her the 
    satisfaction.

                      To the roar of the crowd.

  She moves the knife down in a quick motion, opening a cut on 
  his chest. She presses her wine cup to his flesh, capturing 
  the trickling blood.

                                          LICINIA
                        I do not believe he will ever fall 
                      in the arena. He is a god among 
                        men.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      He is nothing but a Thracian dog. 
                        His treachery dishonored Rome.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      It is your husband who bears the 
                        dishonor.

                                        LUCRETIA

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He abandoned defenseless women and 
                        children. Left to be raped and 
                        murdered.

                        Guards!

  She motions for the Guards to remove him.  The girls titter 
  as Spartacus is roughly escorted out.

                                          AEMILIA
                        What a bold tongue!

                        Were he my slave, I would have him 
                        crucified!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

  Licinia takes the cup of Spartacus  blood.

                                          LICINIA
                        For what? Speaking the truth? We 
                        have all heard the rumors about 
                        your husband.

  Ilithyia reddens. The girls titter.

                        One that begs a repeat soon.

  She kisses Lucretia on the cheek and exits with Aemilia and 
  Caecilia, both barely able to contain their laughter over 
  Ilithyia s embarrassment. Ilithyia watches them go, 
  seething.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Apologies.

  Ilithyia brightens, masking her anger.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        None required. You will soon learn 
                        that women of note have a rabid 
                        taste for the embarrassment of 
                        their friends.

                        I would not see mine treated so.

  Ilithyia smiles politely, her mind on other matters.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        May I have words with Segovax 
                        before I take my leave? I wish to 
                        bid my man good fortune in the days 
                      to follow.

                        Come.  I will see to it...

  As the women move off, their gowns WIPING US TO --                                                                                    40.

  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  DICE blast against a stone wall, followed by CHEERS. PULL 
  BACK to REVEAL Varro, Hamilcar, Rhaskos, and a knot of other 
  Gladiators enthralled in bones and dice.

                                        VARRO
                      My fortune returns!

  Varro scoops up his winnings.

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        Varro.

  Varro looks up to find Spartacus hovering above him. Blood 
  still trickles from the cut across his chest.

                                        VARRO
                        I am of a winning mind. Save your 
                        words of caution.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I am not here for words. I am here 
                        for dice.

                                        VARRO
                        You and dice?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I am of a mood tonight. I would 
                        have distraction. And coin.

  The men laugh. Varro indicates for Spartacus to sit.

                                        VARRO
                        The rules, then.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Should I need instruction, I will 
                        ask.

  Varro shrugs -- this will be easy. He hands Spartacus the 
  dice.

                                        VARRO
                        Roll, Champion.

  Spartacus does... and wins! The men explode into laughter.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

                        dropping shit!

  More LAUGHTER. Varro throws down another wager. OFF 
  Spartacus as he gathers the bones for another roll, intent 
  on taking all of Varro s money...


  INT. TROPHY ROOM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Segovax, in shackles, is led in by Guards. Ilithyia awaits.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Leave us.

  The Guards exit.

                        Apologies. I do not.

  Ilithyia circles him, her eyes appreciating.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I am your Domina. My coin pays for 
                        your training. Your water. Food. 
                        The very air you breathe. Survive 
                      to receive the mark, and you will 
                        become my gladiator. My champion.

                        Please me, and the rewards will be 
                        substantial. Wine... women... even 
                        freedom, perhaps.

  Segovax reacts. Ilithyia picks up on it.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        You desire such a thing? Freedom?

                                          SEGOVAX
                        Yes, Domina.

  Ilithyia considers that, wheels turning.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                        attended to, and your freedom will 
                      be secured...

  A dark smile bends Ilithyia s lips. OFF the moment...


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Batiatus rages through the atrium with Lucretia. Naevia 
  follows.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus should never have been 
                        summoned!

                        Ilithyia and the man must be kept 
                        separate. Throwing them together 
                        invites calamity.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The risk bore proper fruit. Licinia 
                        intimates another visit.

  That gets Batiatus  attention.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus her purpose?

                        Most certainly.

  Batiatus knows where this is headed, tries to avoid it.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

  Naevia averts her eyes, for fear her grief will expose her.

                        Crixus will fare better in the 
                        smaller venues, until he is healed.

                        extinguished beneath our roof.

  OFF Naevia in the background, the news a knife in her 
  heart...


  INT. GATE - MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Crixus stares in shock through the iron bars of the gate.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Damascus?

  ADJUST to find Naevia on the other side, fighting to hold 
  back the tears.

                        Dominus meets with Vibius tomorrow.

  Crixus tries to keep his composure. But the reality of his 
  last night in the ludus finally sets in, his last night with 
  Naevia. He forces a smile.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I have never seen Damascus. Do you 
                        think I shall like it?

                        The decision is made. Even Domina 
                        doubts me. I see it in her eyes.

  Crixus realizes what she s asking.

  Naevia touches his face through the bars, tears finally 
  cresting her cheeks. OFF the sacrifice...


  INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Varro sits alone, sullenly stabbing at his gruel. A POUCH 
  filled with coins lands on the table next to him. He looks 
  up to find Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The coin you lost to me.

                        Which makes it yours.

  Varro slides the pouch back to Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You are a fool.

                                        VARRO
                        And you have thrown dice before.

                        ago. For my wife.

  Varro knows the mention of Sura is not easily made. He turns 
  his eyes away, rising.

                                        VARRO
                        Then you are a better man than I.

  Spartacus grabs his arm.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                        You dishonor your family. You 
                        dishonor your own wife --

                      My wife is a whore!

  Varro wrenches his arm free. Gladiators at the other tables 
  turn at the outburst. A beat. The fire drains from Varro s 
  eyes.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)

                        She carries another man s child.

  Spartacus absorbs that.

                        How did this come to be?

                        A friend, from the marketplace. She 
                        claims he forced his way onto her.

  Spartacus hardens.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And you find fault with her?

                                        VARRO
                        She did not fight as she should 
                        have.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Had you not left to pay your debts, 
                        she would not have had to.
                                  a beat)(
                        She lives, Varro. You may yet hold 
                        her in your arms. A thought a 
                        decent man would cherish.

  Spartacus walks away, leaving the money. OFF Varro, 
    conflicted...                                                                                    46.


  INT. TROPHY ROOM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Lucretia waits in her robe, her face troubled by what s to 
  come. Naevia escorts Crixus into the room, behind her. 
  Naevia shares a worried, charged look with him before 
  exiting.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  without turning)(
                      My husband is at market, on 
                        business concerning you. He 
                        believes your day may have passed.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And you?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I pray he is mistaken.

  She turns to face him, eyes filled with regret -- and doubt. 
  He moves towards her, his strength growing with each step.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And the gods? Do they answer your 
                        prayers?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        They are silent.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Then let us crack the heavens... 
                        and gain their attention...

  He pulls her into a kiss, rough and hard. Lucretia gasps. He 
  spins her around, forcing her against the wall, his breath 
  hot against her neck.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Remove any doubt... that my day has 
                        passed...

  He RIPS OFF HER GOWN, pulling her hair back as he enters her 
  hard. She gasps in pain and ecstasy, her face twisting in 
  pleasure. MOVE OFF the animalistic display to find

  NAEVIA

  watching from the shadows at the entrance. She turns away, 
  tears staining her cheeks, knowing she s done the right 
  thing. Yet still feeling the sting of it. OFF her pain...

  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Crixus, uneasy from being with Lucretia, averts his eyes as 
  Naevia leads him back to the ludus. A long beat.

                                        NAEVIA
                        She seemed... pleased.

                        asked you to.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Dominus is already at market. 
                        Speaking with Vibius.

                        There is nothing that cannot be 
                        undone.

                        You are a good man. The gods will

                                        CRIXUS

                        They favor Spartacus now. They give 
                      no shit for me.

  He continues on. She watches for a moment, praying he s 
  wrong. She follows, WIPING US TO --


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  A few GLADIATORS exit, naked, leaving Spartacus alone. He 
  sits in his subligaria, gently scraping the wound he 
  received from Ilithyia. SLOW PUSH IN as he dips the scraper 
  in water for rinsing, puts it to his chest again. COME TO 
  REST close on Spartacus  face, concentrating on the task.

  A TOWEL

  suddenly drops around his neck and tightens, cutting off his 
  air.  REVEAL SEGOVAX behind him, muscles straining as he 
  pulls the towel taut.  Spartacus drops the scraper, 
  struggles,  manages to slam an elbow back.  The jolt stuns 
  Segovax, loosening his grip.  Spartacus stumbles to the 
  floor, gasping.  He spots


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  THE SCRAPER

  and lunges for it, but Segovax gets the towel around his 
  neck again before he can retrieve it. Spartacus struggles, 
  veins bulging, sputtering for breath.

                                          SEGOVAX
                                  soft, sincere)(
                        Forgive me, champion...

  Segovax tightens his grip even more. The rope digs into 
  Spartacus  neck, drawing blood. His eyes lose focus as he 
  weakens and -- WHAM! Segovax is slammed off him by

  CRIXUS

  who has just entered. Spartacus collapses to the floor, 
  choking, gulping air in ragged breaths.

  SEGOVAX

  recovers, snatching up Spartacus  fallen scraper and 
  attacking. Crixus attempts to avoid the makeshift blade, is 
  only partially successful. Segovax swings. Crixus blocks the 
  blow, catching Segovax s wrist. A test of strength ensues as 
  Crixus tries to force the scraper out of Segovax s grasp.

  SEGOVAX PUNCHES CRIXUS

  in his stomach wound, reopening it once again. Crixus grunts 
  in pain, but refuses to give in. The scraper finally 
  clatters from Segovax s grasp. Crixus  fists rain down on 
  Segovax. One last blow sends BLOODY TEETH flying. Segovax 
  crumbles to the floor.

  CRIXUS FIGHTS FOR BREATH,

  favoring his reopened wound. Spartacus, regaining his 
  senses, tries to speak.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You kill... a fellow Gaul... to 
                        save a man you hate?

                                        CRIXUS
                        I do not save Spartacus. I save a 
                        brother... from an unworthy end.

  Crixus draws himself up proudly.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

                        earned a glorious death... at the 
                        hands of a gladiator.

  OFF Spartacus, owing his enemy his life...


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  A boiling Batiatus sweeps through the villa with Lucretia. 
  Ashur and Naevia are in tow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I leave these walls for a moment

                        Spartacus?! Ilithyia s own fucking 
                        man?!

                        And he would have succeeded, were 
                      it not for Crixus. His day has not 
                        passed.

  Batiatus considers that with a frown, growls at Ashur.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Send notice to Vibius. Crixus is no 
                        longer for sale.

  Ashur struggles to mask his disappointment. Naevia, her joy.

                                        ASHUR
                        I fear terms were already agreed 
                        upon --

                        Fuck the terms! Crixus has proven 
                        his worth today. Should Vibius have 
                        issue, he may give reason to my 
                        cock.

  Ashur slinks away, passing Ilithyia being led in by Guards. 
  Batiatus hisses to Lucretia.

  A SHRIEK OF AGONY sounds from the training square outside.

                        For your man, yes.

  Ilithyia s eyes betray actual concern as Batiatus and 
  Lucretia lead her out onto the balcony.


  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Agron, Duro and the Recruits are constructing the training 
  bridge for the final test.  Ilithyia steps out with Batiatus 
  and Lucretia, her face decaying as her eyes fall on

  SEGOVAX

  in the training square, being NAILED TO A CROSS by Hamilcar 
  and Rhaskos.  Doctor, Spartacus, and the Gladiators bear 
  witness.  Segovax screams, the pain driving him to near 
  insanity.

                        cock. Did he give any sign of cause 
                        when you met with him last night?

  Ilithyia forces a smile, giving nothing away.

                        No. It is a mystery.

  She turns away. Lucretia eyes her, well versed enough in 
  lies to know when presented with one. THE TRAINING SQUARE

  Crixus joins Spartacus. They stand in silence, not looking 
  at each other as Hamilcar and Rhaskos raise the cross. 
  Segovax groans, nearly unconscious.

  CAMERA RISES over the back of the cross, looking down at the 
  two rivals. Separated by the vertical beam. Forever joined 
  together in death and brotherhood.


  BLACKOUT.
