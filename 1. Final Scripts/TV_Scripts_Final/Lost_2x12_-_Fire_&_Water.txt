                    I just...  I made some nappies for 
                    Aaron this morning.


www.pressexecute.comCHARLIEA moment.  A FLASH of something from Claire -- oh right.  
                            nt climate of awkwardness, she still LIKES 
      this guy.  She smiles as she takes the nappies from Charlie --

      the same thing we are -- Charlie s PALE.  Looks like SHIT.  
      And considering where we left him at the end of the TEASER?  
      We have a pretty good idea of WHY that is.
