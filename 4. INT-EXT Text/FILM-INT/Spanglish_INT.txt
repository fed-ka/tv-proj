A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's
back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular.
LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words
you would hear love confronted and considered in a very
specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is
hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the
first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red
fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes
beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part
massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb
probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his
ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --
and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for
another trip down his upper body...
MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles
with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30
minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and
rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting
tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The
unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a
single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand
complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as
TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring,
goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says
something in Spanish...important for us because it will
establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we
understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She
replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty
laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells
her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and
resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and
grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view
for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular
anger, "you said you would never push me around again. If you
do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own
back as high as you want." (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will
be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish
speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.)
For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue.
Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic
argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy.
This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord
and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of
their marriage.

Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school
bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road.
We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks
up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word,
2.
"Cristina." When the man protests her stopping she indicates
they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her
off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....

A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother
and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man
getting out. He nods in another direction calling our
attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman
does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the
child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is
disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially
when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks
from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman
now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so
she does not see what is transpiring.
NARRATOR
For my mother, that afternoon
eleven years ago was a watershed
not because of my father's

first day at school....

This room is directly across from the husband's room. The
woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show
the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches.
The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman
is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman
grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The
undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her
voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles
her daughter.
NARRATOR
There was never any pretense that
the gorgeous, vital, clever,
temperamental animal that was my
mother ever for a heartbeat
considered having any life of her
own. She ignored all her needs and
was alive only for me. It was
terrific.
(a long beat)
At the time.
ON MOM.
As she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter
begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a
glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the
action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the
window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing
to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a
shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her
daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is
an impressive charade.
FULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS.
And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing,
she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the
shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned
today..the daughter says she was taught a little English.
Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband
toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter
starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing
the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something.

As she clears her throat and says directly into camera.
GIRL
Hi.
The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the
back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the
perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they
just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her
child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the
police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear
starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are
about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power
pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in
Spanish.
MOTHER
Una lgrima...sola una sola...Haz
la mejor possible.
NARRATOR
"One tear..only one...so make it a
good one." This was my mother's
instruction to me.
ON CHILD.
Baffled by the edict..
ON MOTHER.
Holding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it.
ON CHILD..
As she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her
mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more
tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little
head...the eyes clear.

NARRATOR
My mother dealt with our
considerable problems of survival
by talking..Always she discovered
her own best thoughts by sifting
through her own words.
The mother stops talking in mid-sentence, realizing she has
just solved something and makes a note.

NARRATOR
Each night my mother promised me a
wonderful life.. Each night I
looked for a new expressive way to
tell my mother how much I loved
her.
The child is ardent..clutching at her heart...kissing her
mother.. Holding her mother's face, talking directly into her
eyes. The mother, enormously pleased, is nonetheless thrown
by the extremes of it.
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
I just played and did my lessons
and every time I looked up my
mother was in the process of saving
us.

The mother and daughter seating themselves. The mother is
enormously nervous with the prospect of flight. She sits,
the daughter ignores an empty seat and goes on her lap,
mother hugging daughter, daughter hugging the hug.

(to girl)
How you doing?
GIRL
(accented English)
Hi. How are you? I am fine..

English synonyms)
..happy, merry, joyful, glad,
contented, frisky.
As they taxi.
AMERICAN PILOT
(to mother)
Are you her mother, sister..what?
The mother says, "solo espaol"---"only Spanish." The
daughter starts to chatter excitedly about the imminent
flight. Her mother quiets her firmly in order to pray for
their safety.. As the plane continues to taxi...We HEAR the
mother's prayer in Spanish. She then nudges her
daughter..who, with this gentlest of prods, repeats the same
prayer.

THEIR POV.
DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits
dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life.
She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is
a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she
doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find.
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the "don't
hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific"
variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is
drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year
old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her
grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more
rolls of sod wait to be laid.
THE TWO LATINAS.
As they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next.
Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the
pool..as they start out..
THEIR EXIT.
Boink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open
after all. Monica hits first. The women at the pool react.
Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts to
join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of
it..too late in the day for sudden movements.
KITCHEN DOORWAY.
BERNICE
Gee whiz in heaven...How are you?
Please?
DEBORAH
(a bit hyper)
Don't worry..I'm not mad...I was
looking for decoration to put on
the glass so people would stop
walking into it and instead of
taking what they had in stock,
which was awful, I special ordered.
I'll design something myself which
I should have done in the fi...
Our heroine, seeing the blood flow from her aunt's nose,
gestures that Monica needs help not conversation.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
..and what difference does that
make when your nose is bleeding.
Shut up, Deborah.
BERNICE
Now you got it, Mom.
12.
Deborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the
freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the
kitchen..She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to
feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can
experience.
DEBORAH
Here, take these.
(second thought)
Was that strange to give you
money..I just felt badly that..
MONICA
It's okay.
She pockets the cash.

As John moves quickly through the downstairs, he puts the
tray on a counter where food servers are working.
JOHN
I brought some dessert.
As he moves on, we see in the background the workers unwrap
and react to a fantastic concoction. A caterer (who we may
notice looks at him like royalty) falls in beside him and
whispers to him.
CATERER
She came down to check on the party
and realized the gardeners hadn't
finished rolling the sod.
35
35
JOHN'S POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS.
Deborah is wearing a party dress. They are rolling out the
last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully
manicured backyard. It is hard manual labor involving
physical strength. The female caterers are complaining that
it's too heavy but Deborah is undeterred.
DEBORAH
(to catering women)
We can do it. Come on.
She falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and
they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down,
one losing pace.. Deborah,however, gains the upper hand. Yet,
even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(great exertion)
Why... do... I... care.. so..
much.. about.... CRAP?
And now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way
out and she jumps on the seam in victory. She is dirty,
spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual
experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half-
heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off.
She looks with mother's pride at the lawn. Then sees John.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Can you believe they left without
finishing?
As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at her..A
grin..half laugh.. He loves the dame.
20.
DEBORAH (BREATHLESS) (CONT'D)
Looks great, huh?.... You're not
looking.
JOHN
I was getting a kick looking at you
look at it.
Not the answer she wanted..
DEBORAH
I better get dressed again in case
anybody's just a half hour late.
She hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now
fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or
so....all details thought about and done to a "T". This is
the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half
acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. As she
looks at it all she has a wistful moment.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(a replenishing sigh)
Okay..We're okay here.
(then)
Why can't everything be like sod?
There's no wait, no dung, nothing
you have to do right and yet it's
perfect. It covers up all your
dirt and makes things immediately
pretty..then, the miracle, if you
just give it time, it roots and you
can't tell it from the real thing.
(a look to her husband)
No reaction. Nothing to say.
JOHN
Huh? Oh sure..I, uh..Well, no, I
don't have anything particular to
say.
DEBORAH
Oh, John why don't you just take
out a knife and kill me all
together.
Somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit.
JOHN
How'd you get there..Hey, wait a
minute..Deb..stop..come on.
(she turns)
I'd like to figure this one out.
What would have been the great
thing for me to say after you said
the sod sentence?..Really.
21.
DEBORAH
That's actually a good question.
JOHN
There you go. I surprise sometimes.
DEBORAH
I would have liked, if after I
compared the sod to life, if you
had said, "Exactly!"
She turns to leave.
JOHN
Yeah. But to say that and mean it
I'd have to think the same way you
do.
DEBORAH
(some sense of mischief)
It's worth a try...I had something
else to tell you...it'll come to
me..

Standing in a nicely decorated middle class restaurant,
Cristina, totally bilingual, speaks to the American hostess
with a pronounced and charming accent as her mother, standing
beside her, bounces with energy and joy.
CRISTINA
Could we have a table for two,
please?
Flor says something to her in Spanish..the daughter waves it
off and when the mother persists, she translates.
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
We're celebrating.
HOSTESS
Smoking or non-smoking?
Before her daughter can translate.
FLOR
Dancing!
The hostess laughs..They are seated at the two ends of a
banquette and each automatically picks up her place setting
and "scootches" closely together. Cristina picks up a menu
and points to the prices.
CRISTINA
Wow, expensive..
22.
Flor scoffs -- says she's making six hundred dollars a
week..then looks at the prices and does a take. The hostess
returns --- Cristina points to the menu.
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
This is just for the starter?
Flor, encouraging her daughter's spirit of adventure, places
her hand over the prices in the menu.
HOSTESS
Uh-huh..And those men would like to
buy you a drink.
The daughter translates...the hostess points out the early
30's, well dressed, quite nice looking businessmen. Flor
addresses the men who are several tables away. Cristina
moves uncomfortably but responds to her mother's nudge to
translate.
CRISTINA
(to men)
This is very embarrassing but--
"what's wrong with you? I'm with
my daughter for God's sake!"
Then hostess, Flor and finally Cristina laugh. Cristina
relishes getting back to ordering from the menu...in a moment
that is a bit noteworthy..
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
And I would like to begin with the
Jumbo Shrimp.

John enters his son's room..GEORGIE, age 9.
23.
JOHN
Okay...think SERIOUSLY about
getting up. You don't have to get
up yet but are you thinking
seriously about it?
GEORGIE
Yes.
JOHN
Okay.
39
39
Bernice is making French Toast, doing something novel with
the filling and the last cooking process. Some great idea
which will have us making a mental note to try it at home.
40
40
John opens Georgie's door again.
GEORGIE
Now?
JOHN
Yes..actual up..
Georgie gets up..
GEORGIE
Morning, Dad.
JOHN
Yeah, good morning.
GEORGIE
You as mad at me as Mom 'cause of
what happened?
John pauses..aware his answer will have repercussions but
integrity wins.
JOHN
No, Georgie, I'm not.
GEORGIE
Are you mad at me?
JOHN
Uh...okay, no..
41
41
As Flor enters from outside.
BERNICE
Morning, good to see you.
24.
FLOR
Morning. Good too.
She notices the French Toast.
BERNICE
Try some.
She demurs. Bernice holds out one slice on a spatula,
indicating Flor should just tear a piece off which she
does...One taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open
at this kid's ability to make something mundane
special..Bernice laughs.
BERNICE (CONT'D)
Thanks.
Her mother enters on her way upstairs. She is thoughtful,
tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her
current demon. She greets Flor and then shakes her head,
making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to
Flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker.
DEBORAH
Tough day.
Bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a
GOLDEN RETRIEVER named CHUM approaches Flor from behind with
a ball in its mouth. Flor is checking out the kitchen...
what's in each drawer, etc .....Deborah is impressed by the
self-starter display and indicates same to Bernice.
BERNICE
I had an idea for a breakthrough in
French toast so I made breakfast. I
don't want to be teased about it..
No sarcasm. No tough love. Just try
it and if by any chance you have a
positive reaction...
DEBORAH
Right..mean ol' me. I can't play
right now. I have to do something
about your brother.
BERNICE
I had an idea for a recipe. When
has that happened? I got up early
to do this. At least taste it, for
God's sakes!
She does..
DEBORAH
Oh, it's good...oh God, it's rich --
Oh God, it's good.
25.
DEBORAH
(sudden alarm)
By the way, you could do without
this.
The approval rug pulled out from under her, Bernice looks at
her mother. But Deborah is unaware of having hurt her
daughter because her attention has been diverted so that
Deborah AND THE CAMERA LOSE FOCUS ON BERNICE as the teenager,
distraught, moves from the room.
DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)
NO..NO! FLOR!....Never do fetch.
Chum is nudging Flor with the ball and Flor was about to
accommodate him by taking it before Deborah's warning shout
stopped her in mid-sentence.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
I mean it, NEVER!
ON Flor's stunned reaction to the outburst.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
I'm not mad. I'm thinking of you.
This is me being nice..
Then using her hands to demonstrate.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Just no taking ball from dog.
(broadly)
Trust me on that one.
CLOSE UP ON Chum going nuts with Deborah's hand passing in
front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
You and me. We are fine. Just a
tip.
(she gives her waist a
little squeeze)
Girlfriends.
(Flor is totally confused)
Could you make some coffee? Cafe?
FLOR
Yes.
Deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino
machine Italian overpriced artists ever devised.
42
42
Deb in the shower...you have never seen so many shampoos,
conditioners and bath balms...never seen so huge a
sponge..such fluffy towels.
26.
Skylight over the shower allows a beam of God's warmth. There
is a fireplace in the bathroom. The only significance of
this being that these people have a fireplace in their
bathroom. The woman who made it all happen is putting in a
contact lens..She is upset. We see that she has one blue eye
and one brown.
JOHN
This isn't an argument, honey.
DEBORAH
Yes. Yes it is. So stop being so
maniacally calm.
JOHN
(emphatically)
No..it's not. Because I understand
your side.
DEBORAH
I can't be wrong about that too.
This is a fight. We're having a
fight. Yo, I feel anger.
Deborah turns from the sink revealing one brown eye and one
blue. She blinks, realizes one lens is not in and turns back
to the sink.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Can I have a moment?
John exits into the..
43
43
As John awaits his wife...a beat and she enters with two blue
eyes. Even though she is attempting reason and self-control
her voice is filled with tension and goes from loud to
borderline yelling.
DEBORAH
Okay..Let's get someplace here.
44
44
As Flor works methodically - orienting herself..she is able
to hear their totally foreign words and though their volume
registers on her a bit - basically she remains blithe.
Loading a dishwasher, memorizing where everything is..
45
45
BACK TO SCENE:
DEBORAH
You, mister, are crazy making..I
can't take this calm thing you've
27.
DEBORAH
started doing. It's like this is
your way of letting me know there's
something deeply wrong with me
because I'm not calm.
JOHN
(calmly)
Let's not go all over the
place..Can't we...
DEBORAH
(shouted burst)
If you're going to talk to me
please have the decency to raise
your voice.
JOHN
(a beat then sudden
urgency and change of
tone)
Let's make a break for it.
DEBORAH
What are you talking about?
He signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large
but tentative step away from the spot where he was
standing...then additional faster steps. He gestures with
enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the
room. She eyes him suspiciously.
JOHN
Just for a second.
She walks to him...he puts an arm around her shoulder. And
gestures back to where they were standing. He talks in an
almost hushed, conspiratorial voice.
JOHN (CONT'D)
We don't have to be those people.
Nobody's watching. They've been
masquerading as us for a while
here..I'll distract them - you make
a break for it and I'll meet you
outside.
DEBORAH
You're ridiculing me because I care
about this.
JOHN
(firmly)
No. I'm not. I mean this..let's get
away from those two in case they're
as miserable as they look..
28.
JOHN
(urging..like a Southern
coach)
Come on, baby.
He is looking at her with wit and conviction..trying to
squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love. Deborah
looks up at him..intimacy of a different sort.
DEBORAH
Let me ask you a question..let me
change the subject..Forget for a
moment that you won't support me
with Georgie..
JOHN
(reasonably)
Well, I don't think...
She makes a noise of frustration to stop him..It
works. John
is rendered still and intimidated by her conduct
but he is
"man" enough for his jaw to set...to pause for a
beat as he
looks her straight in the eye..And walks back to
the spot
they occupied previously.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Go ahead.
DEBORAH
Here's the question. It's been on
my mind more and more. Do you do
that calm thing for the purpose of
infuriating me?
JOHN
(genuinely puzzled)
What? Why would ...
(on her exasperated look)
Why would anyone do something to
someone they love for the purpose
of messing them up?
DEBORAH
(unconvinced/distant)
Okay.
He hates that look of isolation on her face..He needs to make
her feel better.
JOHN
Deb, since high school we've been
able to read each other...take
advantage of it..The answer to the
question is,"absolutely not." Now
take a look and tell me if you
believe me.
29.
She looks at him..with a finger motion he directs her gaze to
his eyes..
CLOSE on JOHN'S EYES.
Open, smiling, trusting. Trying to get a laugh out of her.
CLOSE ON DEBORAH'S EYES.
Studying, questioning, probing, doubting, exhausted...
DEBORAH
I don't.. believe you. I think you
just want me to feel badly about
myself..Sorry, honey.
46
46
John enters - not seeing Flor - goes to the Sparkletts water
container and fills a cup...He is shaken..
JOHN
(to himself)
Great God in heaven save me.
Boy meets girl.
FLOR
Hi.
He turns with a start to see Flor smiling at him. Gorgeous
squared. His first word is inadvertent.
JOHN
Whoa...whoa...I didn't know Deborah
had found someone... You work here?
You're going to help with the house
and kids?
FLOR
Solo espaol.
JOHN
You work here and you don't speak
any English at all?
The sound of feet on the stairs..Deborah and Georgie enter.
DEBORAH
All she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and
press two for Spanish.
(even before she enters)
Flor...John.
(to John enunciating the
name)
This is Flor.
30.
JOHN
(pronouncing it perfectly)
Hi, Flor.
Deborah reacts, grabs some coffee and pushes Georgie along.
JOHN (CONT'D)
(to Deborah)
Look, I'll take Georgie to school.
DEBORAH
No. I'm doing it..show Flor the
ropes.
Flor is trying to figure out what's expected of her then
Deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and
come with her.

John cooking...the theory that nobody's sexier than when they
are seen doing what they do best applies here.. In the
BACKGROUND John's number two, PETER, the Sous Chef, being
bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and GWEN, who
spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection
for John. At the moment, John's work is a strange mixture of
art and cloddishness.....the hands blur with expertise...but
he keeps dropping items.....each time a Latin kitchen worker,
ALEX, 20, dives on the spillage..At one point they bump.
JOHN
Sorry...
PETER
(sharply to Alex)
Not the best place to stand, fella.
JOHN
(to Alex)
No. It's me. You're the new
helper, huh..
ALEX
I didn't mean to...
JOHN
No..no..it's okay. It's me being
bugged.
Two people head for John almost simultaneously. PEG, an arty
looking woman in her late 50's..wild, scraggly gray hair,
enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'.
PEG
You are going to be so happy..
The Maitre D' enters.
32.
MAITRE D'
I have something very important to
tell you.
John makes a no-brainer of a decision pointing to the woman
who promised happiness. She hefts her ice chest up on the
counter.
PEG
Perfect cod this is John -- John,
perfect cod..Best one I've seen all
season and he was swimming twenty
minutes ago.
The fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a
writer, the right brush stroke for an artist. You get it..
JOHN
Knockout.
(to Alex)
You want to learn something? You
want to pack it away?
The kid nods.. he picks up the fish.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Cradle it...Put it in the cooler
but not on its side.. In the same
position it swims.
(important added thought)
And check the ice pack..make sure
it can drain away..if it can't the
chlorine can hurt the flesh. Do all
that and nobody can put a fish in
the fridge better than you...and
that's a solid start.. First day
and you already did something
perfect.
KID
(smiling)
Yes, I understand.
MAITRE D'
Please. Now?
JOHN
Oh, sorry..I forgot.
He whispers in John's ear..
JOHN (CONT'D)
Damn.. "ohhhh damn."
PETER
What, buddy, what?
33.
JOHN
Victor spotted a food critic..
PETER
From?
VICTOR
The New York Times..I'll bet they
sent her out just for us.
(hands John a slip)
Here's what she ordered.
PETER
Look, if you're nervous take a
walk..
JOHN
I don't need a walk.
GWEN
I'll walk with you..I know a
breathing thing.
JOHN
What do you think I'm worried
about... how I'll cook? That's not
the problem..
(looks at slip/then to
Alex)
The lady wants fish. Get the fish.
He starts to prepare for cooking.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I worked in a kitchen once in New
York that got four stars. It was
like a line formed for the chance
to become an asshole. People's
accents changed. The heart went out
of the place. You understand.
PETER
No.
GWEN
(w/barely understated
passion)
I agree with everything you've
said. I admire you for your
feelings. I hope to adopt them as
my own....
ON JOHN.
As he works..Let's be clear here...this is that sequence that
either kicks out or doesn't..no food channel..no simple knife
stuff..something casually brilliant..meticulous...smart and
gifted as he prepares the critic's meal.
34.
He is talking quickly..almost to himself.
JOHN
I don't know what to root for.. the
thought of one star makes me
nauseous..but with four there's no
place to go but, "Oh my God, they
took away a star."
(musing)
Three..three and a half. That's
what you want..No. Wrong! Three and
a half you feel disappointed that
you just missed out on four. You
know what you want? Three and a
quarter..
(a eureka moment)
That would be perfect!!
(getting off on it)
It would mean you're good..but
you're not good enough to feel
disappointed that you just missed
out on excellent..but nothing truly
bad happened, you still got your
three and a quarter stars. Which
encourages you to try and
improve..And you still get enough
respect so that you can get good
people to work with you..Business
is good but not crazy. You're right
there underneath the radar where
you get to mind your own business.
That's a solid life.
He tastes a sliver of the food dish he is preparing.
JOHN (CONT'D)
(with professional honesty
and some regret)
Aw, man..this is amazing. No three
and a quarter here.
49
49
Evelyn, having a glass of white wine and a sandwich, is
talking to Bernice in the kitchen also including Flor though
she is only catching a word here or there..
EVELYN
Well, I'm in the vitamin section
and this little hip hop
girl..what's her name..Grammys -
adorable -- big voice..subtle
phrasing...oh, she's famous..the
kids know her...oh - little blue
shoes..darn me.
Flor looks concerned over Evelyn's displeasure with herself,
a fact picked up by the older woman...It is actually a small
35.
but resonant good-natured, affectionate moment between the
lush and the Latina.
EVELYN (CONT'D)
God Bless the language barrier, it
keeps you from being bored with me.
Spoken to directly like this, Flor is confused..
EVELYN (CONT'D)
Anyway, she said, "aren't you
Evelyn Wright?" First of all, that
she recognized me from the old
covers and then she .... Oh, please
her name..it makes the story so
much better...She said,
(genuinely stirred)
"Whenever I think everything is.."
(aside)
Pardon my French..pardon her French
(back to quote)
"a mother hmmmhmmm...I put on one
of your records.."
BERNICE
Awwww. How sweet....
Evelyn looks transparently vulnerable for a second. Flor
reacts. Bernie squeezes her grandmother's hand..Flor smiles.
EVELYN
Just such a lovely thing to come
from the blue....
Deborah enters, carrying a load of packages. With lightning
speed, her eye picks out...the glass her mother is drinking
from.
DEBORAH
Oh, Mother...It's not even noon.
EVELYN
(defensively)
It's almost two o'clock.
DEBORAH
God, where is this day going...Flor
could you come with me?
BERNICE
Grandma, tell Mom what happened.
EVELYN
(very deliberately)
No.
36.
Deborah leads the way out...but Flor stops before following
her out to give Evelyn a gesture of support and appreciation.
50
50
John is in Bernie's room - helping her with her homework.
They lay at right angles to each other..He is testing her.
JOHN
This is going to work.
BERNICE
I don't know anything.
JOHN
Free your mind...the president
whose policies many consider
responsible for the Great
Depression...
BERNICE
I don't know...
JOHN
Name a vacuum cleaner..
BERNICE
Okay. Yes..thanks.
JOHN
And this vacuum whooshed all this
money out of everyone's pockets.
BERNICE
Got it. I no longer know nothing.
JOHN
And Hoover was followed in office
by..
BERNICE
I'm just drawing blanks. I'm
embarrassed. It's my own fault I
spent my time on math, which I'm
lucky if I don't flunk anyway and..
JOHN
The guy we are looking for is not a
ruse..
BERNICE
What's ruse mean?
JOHN
Phony. So this president was not a
ruse..He was the real thing.
37.
JOHN
(she looks at him blankly)
Ruse??
BERNICE
(enjoying her father's
absurdity)
Rusevelt..If I'd ever heard of the
word before - that would lock it
in..It's so stupid it might work
anyway...
Deborah enters followed by Flor. They are carrying several
boxes of clothes...
DEBORAH
Surprise new clothes..
Bernie gasps..As she looks at a sweater..
BERNICE
What'd I do right?
DEBORAH
Warehouse sale..
Bernice tries on the sweater over her T-shirt..and mirth
ends..The sweater is tight...Bernice picks up a blouse and
then skirt and checks the size.
ON FLOR AND JOHN.
As they are COUPLED BY THE CAMERA ANGLE as each catches on
and is dumbfounded.
ON BERNICE..
Whose style, wit and grace should not have to be used to
deflect such trauma. But so be it, as, though mightily stung:
BERNICE
Thanks, mom..I'm glad you didn't
get here a little earlier or else I
wouldn't be able to tell you that
your gift is a ruse. Please, excuse
me..
She exits to her bathroom.
51
51
Flor one step behind John and Deborah who are moving quickly
down the stairs...John pissed..Deborah feeling the futility
of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it.
38.
DEBORAH
She's right between the two
sizes..I thought about it..what am
I supposed to do encourage
her...what is it? - DENIAL? Or
motivate her to get herself in
shape.
Flor tries to slide by..Something surreptitious in her
behavior..Deborah suddenly turns to Flor.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Flor..
She holds out her hand in a "we women understand" gesture.
Flor does not waver..just meets her eyes.
FLOR
Me puedo ir?..go..can go?
DEBORAH
(a bit nonplussed)
Sure. Go.
JOHN
I'll drive you to the bus stop.
And that fast they are gone.
52
53
As they drive down the canyon. He is wildly frustrated. Even
if Flor were not there, he would be talking to himself
anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I am running out of excuses for the
lady of the house.
Flor doesn't understand his words...yet fully agrees. But
then John takes rein of his emotions.
39.
JOHN (CONT'D)
But you know, you gotta watch out
for the times you think you're
absolutely right..But, man, Bernice
has finals tomorrow. She didn't
need this one..And just that look
on her face when she got the gifts--
(now his voice cracks; he
grows wet-eyed)
--like for a second she thought all
her problems with her mother had
been solved...
Flor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually
crying. At first her heart is touched by John but then there
is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the
macho meter can read that low. He looks at her and she faces
front quickly.
NARRATOR
My mother did not understand her
male boss. His heart was good and
he was rare in not flirting with
her. But they were starkly
different. Privacy and dignity were
the same word to my mother.
Naturally, when she found herself
sitting next to a man who cried
over his child's hurt she had no
idea how to process the event.
Meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the
canyon. Flor takes the opportunity to bolt.
FLOR
Gracias.
She opens the door and starts to get out though the car is
still rolling a bit...
JOHN
What are you doing? Let me take you
all the way.
Reluctantly she re-enters the car..It rolls another ten feet
to her bus stop and she gets out again.
JOHN (CONT'D)
How weird was this ride? Sorry.
FLOR
No es nada.
He doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a
little helpless gesture..
40.
54
55
As Flor enters -- kisses her daughter..distraught and
distracted. She walks immediately to the refrigerator and
takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk...she cuts a
huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled
daughter..in Spanish riding her on being too thin..the
daughter gestures at her mother's own slim figure.
NARRATOR
It was so unusual for my mother to
ask my help that I realized
immediately she was losing her
battle to be uninvolved with the
Claskys.
Flor asks her daughter how to say something in English.
CRISTINA
Try it on.
Flor asks again in Spanish...trying to find a precise
phrase.. The nuance important to her.
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
Please try it on?
Flor knows the word "please"..it's not what she wants...what
she wants is a way to say, "try it on" in a manner which is
not a request..or order, but is, rather, friendly and caring.
Her daughter works on the problem.
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
Just try it on?
FLOR
(thickly accented)
Just try it on.
CRISTINA
(small accent)
Just try it on.
41.
FLOR
(improvement each time)
Just try it on...just try it on..
She's got it.
NARRATOR
Our culture embraces fullness in a
woman. You, the women of the
admissions committee, as
intelligent as you are, have no
idea how casual and complete such
acceptance is back home, in the
land of the size 16 bikini.
56
58
The house asleep. Flor walks carefully up the steps.
NARRATOR
....a desire for the comfort of
fullness.
59
59
Bernie asleep on the bed...Kleenex abounds...the solid sleep
earned by a few hours of sobbing. She looks touchingly pretty
and decidedly round. Flor looks for, finds and carries out
the new clothes Deborah had given her daughter.
NARRATOR
And, when that desire is suppressed
for style and deprivation allowed
to rule...
42.
60
61
Flor at work on a sewing machine..opening seams, moving
buttons, even steaming where the buttons have been
changed..etc.
62
62
Flor is in the room...having put the altered clothes back in
place..Bernie's alarm clock rings..She wakes and sees Flor.
BERNICE
Hey..buenas dias, Flor..
Flor holds up the new clothes and indicates that they are
beautiful.
BERNICE (CONT'D)
(ruefully)
Yes..Well, taste she has..
Bernie starts her morning routine..her back to us when:
FLOR
(damn good English)
Just try it on.
43.
Bernie, though her back is to us, does a "take" then turns
grinning.
BERNICE
Hey!!!! When did you learn to...
FLOR
(cutting her off)
Just try it on..
BERNICE
Too tight..it doesn't fit.
Flor clearly doesn't understand..
FLOR
Just try it on..Hey?!
Flor extends a blouse and skirt.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Just..
BERNICE
Okay. I'll show you..
She steps behind a closet door to try the clothes on,
muttering pessimistically before she does so. CAMERA STAYS ON
FLOR..
BERNICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
Lovely way to start the day.
World's most trim Mexican learns
her first sentence and uses it to
watch me grrrrunt my way into...
And then....silence...Bernie, open mouthed, steps out wearing
the clothes which fit like a glove. Flor beams..then laughs
at Bernie's reaction as she keeps checking the waist and
looks into the mirror.
INTO MIRROR.
To see Bernie in the foreground as Flor looks on..nods
approval and leaves.
ON BERNIE..
The fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice..she
picks up another shirt..checks the size tag and then studies
it a bit.
CLOSE UP SHIRT..
As Bernie's fingers find the barely visible holes where the
buttons have previously been.
44.
63
63
Flor at work..Chum, ball in mouth, comes to her and nudges
her.
FLOR
(to dog)
Lo siento. No.
Chum, momentarily depressed, walks away..Bernie enters. She
is a bit overwhelmed -- her voice breaking a bit even with
one word.
BERNICE
Hey..
Flor turns..Bernie moves to embrace her.
64
64
As John comes down the stairs..He looks apprehensive..From
the den comes the sound of singing..it stops him from going
out the front door as he turns to check it out.
65
65
John finds Evelyn and Georgie in their night clothes. They
are singing an old song...something like "LUSH LIFE" -
something preposterous for a nine year-old boy..but you can't
knock the quality of the voices..world class. They see him
and stop.
EVELYN
Every time he has a nightmare, I
teach him one of my old songs. That
way the nightmares have a purpose.
GEORGIE
But I don't have to sing it for
anyone.
JOHN
Right. You're clear on that..
GEORGIE
How many did you sell of this song?
EVELYN
(embarrassed in front of
John)
He likes to know that stuff.
JOHN
(to Georgie)
She was huge.
45.
EVELYN
Seventy-six thousand..which is
great for a jazz album.
They resume harmonizing. As John leaves, the song lyric
making some comment on:
66
67
John enters..Georgie is going up the stairs..Flor putting out
breakfast food.
EVELYN
You okay?
JOHN
(strangely)
I am okay.
(to Flor)
Deborah around?
FLOR
She run.
John nods and heads upstairs.
67A
67A
He looks in Bernie's room. She is loading her backpack for
school..
JOHN
Hey, honey.
BERNICE
What's wrong?
JOHN
No..nothing...just that..
Georgie enters the scene..
GEORGIE
A kid offered me a trade..Let me
show you.
JOHN
Yeah..
46.
He starts to follow him to his room.
BERNICE
Dad!!! He can wait.
JOHN
No..It's okay..
BERNICE
Let him wait..Yours is obviously
important.
GEORGIE
You don't even know how important
the trade is..
JOHN
Let me just do Georgie.... Here.
He hands her the newspaper...
68
68
We MOVE with John and Georgie to Georgie's room where he goes
to his collectibles..He holds up a card..
GEORGIE
He says he'll give me any three
silvers for him.
JOHN
I don't know...This is the one you
started with..You really want to
give up your first card?
Note: this is an involved discussion on both their
parts..NOTHING in John thinks it is trivial.
GEORGIE
I know..that's why I needed you.
JOHN
..this is your favorite..
GEORGIE
I think he'd go higher.
JOHN
But it's not numbers..it's.....
They are interrupted by a never quite heard before sound of
exultation..
69
69
Flor and Evelyn jolted..they exit to follow the sound..
47.
70
70
As they enter holding the paper. She has been smacked in the
heart by gleeful and prideful emotions...It is disorienting
for her to experience the rush of pleasure.
JOHN
For God's sake..why did you...
BERNICE
WHY?!!? CRAZY FATHER, WHY?!? Why
aren't YOU screaming?..
JOHN
I'm getting there..just the stunned
thing has to get dealt with...
BERNICE
(reading from newspaper)
John Clasky, who at 25 made his
mark on the New York restaurant
scene when JAMMED lived up to and
survived its silly name, has re-
emerged as a young and confident
veteran taking chances with his
combinations in so subtle a
manner.."
GEORGIE
If he gave me six...
JOHN
(catching her excitement)
Wait a minute, your sister's
talking.
Evelyn indicates to Flor that the good news is about
John..and so she studies him a bit..
BERNICE
"...beginning with the succession
of appetizers, each one with its
own stunning and fully realized
agenda, is constantly yet casually
daring."
(emotional and earnest
aside)
Ah, Dad...this is so great...
(to others)
Now here's the thing...
She tears up...Evelyn rubs Bernie's back..looks at Flor and
taps her heart...Flor indicates she should leave and does.
Bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and
moment. John is taken with his daughter's delivery.
48.
BERNICE (CONT'D)
"Eating at this perfect smaller,
passionate restaurant inspires
one's own abandonment of caution.
To wit: John Clasky is the best
chef in the United States."
JOHN
(genuinely enthusiastic)
Look how great you read it.
BERNICE
(massive irony)
Perfect, Dad.
Evelyn and Bernice hug him..
EVELYN
John..John...Oh, my God you even
look different to me....
JOHN
What are you talking about?
BERNICE
I wonder what mom will do?
71
71
Deborah is ripping John's clothes off..buttons fly..shreds of
cloth..John is laughing - happy.
JOHN
What is this?
DEBORAH
I don't know.
She rips at her own clothes and then exclaims in passion.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Oooohhch!
72
73
Cristina, standing, translating the review into Spanish for
her mother...as she comes to the last sentence.
49.
CRISTINA
Wow..."John Clasky es el mejor chef
en Los Estados Unidos..
FLOR
(easily)
Ah, bravo...
74
74
The Claskys are engaged in sex. John's brief sounds are
exuberant..they shift position so that Deborah is on top
BRINGING DEBORAH INTO A CLOSE SINGLE. Suddenly her smile
fades - she hits the skids.
DEBORAH
Oh, damn it --- what am I going to
do? Everything seems so surely
pointless...
ON JOHN.
This IS WEIRD. And then the small, distinctive sound of Deb's
climax...then, in a relatively small voice.
DEBORAH'S VOICE
Okay here...okay there...good,
good, good.
She falls off him...an arm across her eyes, lying on her back
down the bed from him...
ON JOHN.
Puzzling over what just happened..a few false starts forming
his thought...then finally..hesitantly...
JOHN
Hey, Deb?
DEBORAH
(from the vortex of
depression)
Yeah?
He scoots to her side.
JOHN
You know, I guess I got used to you
getting a little blue after
intercourse...But DURING..??
DEBORAH
Something else I do wrong.
She grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom.
50.
JOHN
You've gotta stop walking away.
DEBORAH
(turning)
If I stay, I will say awful things
to you that I might not even
mean..You pick.
JOHN
See ya.
She exits to the bathroom.
75
75
Very upset as he drives. Then comes to the red light at the
end of the street and sees Flor walking with others. An
awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they
acknowledge each other..the light remains red..she confers
with another woman.
FLOR
(to woman)
Yo le la crtica buena.
The woman tells Flor how to say it in English.
FLOR (CONT'D)
(parroting woman)
I read your good review.
He nods..still the light doesn't change.
FLOR (CONT'D)
It's nice.
The light changes.
JOHN
Not so far...How you doing?
The light has changed - cars are beeping..she is about to let
him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer.
FLOR
I do fine.
He nods and drives off.
76
76
As he enters....the phone is going off the hook..As he passes
the maitre d's desk. Their conversation is strangely hushed
and very, very quick.
51.
VICTOR
Should I stop answering? We're
booked for two months solid.
JOHN
No, no, no, no, no....I want to
keep some walk-in business..I want
this to stay neighborhood.
VICTOR
Impossible. There would be
riots..You should hear the
desperation in their voices..Best
day of my life.
JOHN
We'll serve a full menu at the bar
then.
VICTOR
Then where do I put the people
waiting for a table? It won't work.
JOHN
Do this for me.
VICTOR
There's no way.
JOHN
Do this for me or I'll set my hair
on fire and start punching myself
in the face.
VICTOR
Huh?
JOHN
Yeah..you're right...that was an
unusual way for me to make myself
understood..But you'll do the bar
thing?
VICTOR
Yes, of course, John..
77
77
PETER
I need to talk to you.
JOHN
Ah, man..Okay.
They walk into the cooling room.
52.
78
78
Again there is a kind of strange rapidity to the conversation
sparked by John..
JOHN
What's up? What's wrong?
PETER
I've gotten a fantastic offer for
my own place..Everybody wants to
back me since the paper came out.
JOHN
What's your reaction?
PETER
Honestly? Because I've had this
very unusual reaction.
JOHN
Yeah.
PETER
I've had a hard on almost all day
and it won't go away. Like I'm
riding on the back seat of a bus
with bad shocks and every other
passenger is a gorgeous woman with
a yellow sports top whose leaning
over. It's like every dream I ever
had and some even I didn't have the
balls to dream..
JOHN
So you're considering taking it?...
(he looks at him)
Okay, here's the thing. I can't
lose you and still keep the hours
I'm keeping. I can't do my life
unless I can hold onto you.
(sudden thought)
I think I just gave you an
incredible bargaining position.
79
79
As John and Deborah lay next to each other.
DEBORAH
So you gave away twenty percent of
the restaurant without talking to
me about it.
JOHN
Yeah. If I didn't do it - I'd have
been coming home just to sleep.
53.
DEBORAH
(trying to make livid more
attractive)
Remember the other day when you
asked me the perfect response to
something I said?...I'm asking you
now..what would you like my
response to be to your giving away
twenty percent of the business
without asking me?
JOHN
(with great enthusiasm)
"You're ma man!"
DEBORAH
Okay! So that would be???
JOHN
My dream response from you, yes.
DEBORAH
(measured)
I'm not quite there..Actually, I
just had this flash that the reason
women in the old days used to faint
was to avoid doing acts of violence
against men.
(a beat then)
And I was all worried about
figuring out the timing just to
talk to you about renting a place
for the summer.
JOHN
Well, I think you got your timing.
80
84
As Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter. They carry boxes of stuff.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
I don't care if it's a rental..this
place is getting a fixing.
She leads Flor to a small bedroom.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(to Flor with gestures)
This will be yours..
Flor doesn't understand..certainly doesn't want to.
EVELYN
Did you ask her if she could live
in?
DEBORAH
Come on...there's no buses from her
to here. There's no question.
Double come on...
Deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like
the law vs. the bible then with heavy sarcasm.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
The Barrio - Carbon Beach..The
Barrio - Carbon Beach. What to do?
(to Flor)
Don't worry. I'm putting nicer
stuff in here too.
When Flor gives no indication of anything - just standing,
somewhat stupefied..Deborah takes her by the hand and leads
her out.
85
88
The two women in the truck and then..
89
89
As the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and
waves..Cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes
never leave her.
59.
She gasps frequently..MAJOR GIANT ORGANIC GASPS OF WONDER AND
PLEASURE..This is awe as an active physical exercise. The
MOVING SHOT dramatizes the crossroads of the mother-daughter
relationship as the TWO SHOT finds Flor becoming first
blurred then lost as we focus on Cristina exclaiming over
each new sight.
NARRATOR
(over this incidental
dialogue)
The first time one sees natural
beauty which is owned by others
confounds the senses.. I had never
imagined the word "money" could be
associated with anything but the
anxiety of not having enough. I
didn't know God had a toy store for
the rich.
90
92
Behind Flor and Cristina as they move toward the Claskys and
their destiny....Flor behind her daughter.
REVERSE - CLOSE ON CRISTINA.
As her eyes pop on seeing the Clasky beach house.
VERY CLOSE ON DEBORAH
As her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter
her home, haloed by the sun. Again, Flor less distinct in
the background.
Bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a
shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at Cristina and
emits a small, prescient moan.
DEBORAH
(to Flor)
Look at this child..Flor, you could
make a fortune at surrogate
pregnancy....
Flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what
Deborah said..
FLOR
Que?
Cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother.
JOHN
Hi. I'm John..It's good to see you.
(to Flor indicating
Cristina)
Great..
DEBORAH
(to Cristina)
Hi. This is my daughter,
Bernice..I'm Deborah..And out
there...are Georgie and.
61.
As she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, Evelyn has
almost reached them ..
EVELYN
I'm so glad to meet you. I'm a fan
of your mother's.
CRISTINA
I'm Cristina.
As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top
which is half tucked in.
BERNICE
(kidding around but right
on)
No comparisons, please, no
comparisons.
Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self-
deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish.
CRISTINA
My mother says it's best if we get
out of the way and put our things
away.
JOHN
Have you ever been to the beach
here?
CRISTINA
I've never been anyplace but Mexico
and Texas.....before today.
John goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with
beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards.
JOHN
Here's the most important place in
the house..grab this stuff whenever
you want.
CRISTINA
(delighted)
Thank you..thank you so much.
DEBORAH
Very little accent?
FLOR
(suspiciously)
Que?
CRISTINA
(to Flor)
Sin acento.
62.
Her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with,
nods.
CRISTINA (CONT'D)
(to Deborah)
Thank you..there's an A.P. total
fluency class where they work you
pretty hard at sounding American.
Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended
conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a
word.
FLOR
Cristina..
DEBORAH
Right. Settle in..
CRISTINA
Thank you. I am thrilled to be
here.
93
93
Deborah has re-decorated the room with casual
brilliance...Flor is tense..distraught...her daughter
giddy...excited over the sheets, the tv, the pile of
towels..a chaise..She goes to work on her mother to go
swimming....wanting her to appreciate the fun element of
being here...the spirit of the kid such that Flor relents....
94
96
As Deborah steps out on the deck and sees Cristina.
63.
DEBORAH
(in a loud whisper)
Hey, Cristina...hey...hey..What are
you doing up?
Cristina looks around -- then up..
CRISTINA
Oh, hi..so beautiful..I was just
excited.
DEBORAH
I know..Would you believe I had to
talk my husband into this?
(no reply/then more
pointedly)
Would you believe I had to talk my
husband into it?...do you hear me?
CRISTINA
Yes...I just ..
(awash..a shy laugh)
I didn't know what to say?
DEBORAH
(still calling down)
Do you want to come with me? -- I'm
going to the flea market.
CRISTINA
I don't know what that...
DEBORAH
It's the Rose Bowl... miles, actual
miles, of great things for sale for
God's sake...We can have brunch in
Pasadena.
CRISTINA
I don't want to wake my mother so
early.
DEBORAH
I'll leave her a note...I'll
97
97
As Flor wakes..looks around.
FLOR
Cristina?
She goes to Cristina's bed...atop the bed is a note. She
picks it up.
INSERT..THE NOTE
Dear Flor,
64.
I decided to steal your daughter for a bit.
LOVE,
DEBORAH
With great energy born of bottled fury, Flor begins to go
through her daughter's things...finding her backpack and
extracting a Spanish/English dictionary.
INSERT DICTIONARY.
As her finger points to:
"Steal...robar"
And then she flips some pages feverishly..Her finger
indicating:
"daughter .... hija"
98
100
John enters..
JOHN
Hey, Flor..
She turns..
JOHN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry..very sorry..
He indicates his watch -- then holds his fingers together.
JOHN (CONT'D)
They should be back soon..
Flor starts to cry. She sits in a chair..He sits not far from
her.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Hey, Flor..
Embarrassed, she says, in Spanish, to please leave her
alone..she turns from him..He walks to the wet bar and gets a
bottle of water...pours some..Her crying soft in the
66.
background...He walks to her, sits near her and offers her
the glass of water which she takes.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Deborah made a mistake. I
understand how you feel...Do you
understand me at all, generally? Is
simptico the word?
He pats her on the back..She looks at him..
CLOSE ON FLOR..
Is he coming on?..
HER POV..
His kind eyes.
FULL SHOT..
This is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people
finding real company for an instant. Without thought, she
duplicates his gesture and pats his back.
FLOR
Simptico, yes.
And when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she
is out of her chair..(This is as intimate as John has been
with another woman since he was married..) He calls out to
stop her.
JOHN
Un momento, huh?
She stops and turns to him.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I'm really sorry this is happening.
I just want you to know that. I am
real sorry.
He taps his heart as an indication of sincerity -- then a
flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I didn't mean..
He makes a gesture of ardent love..
JOHN (CONT'D)
I meant..
Makes a person to person innocent gesture..She finds herself
smiling.
67.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Well, the good thing about being an
idiot is that every once in a while
you cheer people up..Got to get to
work.
CAMERA STAYS WITH FLOR
As he exits...thinks about John's demeanor, smiles again,
shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for Cristina.
101
102
Evelyn, Bernie and Flor are gathered in the living room. All
staring at her.
DEBORAH
What? Something bad happen?
ON CRISTINA..
Enormously anxious on reading her mother's mood.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Cristina, tell your mother I just
played around with your hair..she
can put it back..no hurt feelings.
CRISTINA
Not right now.
Flor puts an arm around her shoulder, leading her off and
speaking to her forcefully in Spanish.
DEBORAH
What? --
EVELYN
You can't just take someone
else's.....
DEBORAH
Nuh-uh, Mom..don't go there..or
I'll go there and you know where
"there" is.
Evelyn stops on a dime. She leaves. Deborah crosses to
Bernice, who is highly concerned about Flor, and puts an arm
around her. A pleasant surprise..
68.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Can you believe what Flor is making
this into..Shoot me if I ever get
that hard to deal with.
Bernice, unseen by Mom, does a long, muted, mock scream.
103
103
MUSIC IN: Action, purpose, energy.. Flor is dictating in
Spanish as Cristina writes it down in English on a pad.
Cristina enormously uncomfortable.
INSERT - THE PAD.
The pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words. Cristina
winces with the words she records even while punctuating
perfectly.
PAD WRITING
You cannot take my child without my
permission..And, if you had asked
me I would not have given
permission. Is this why you did not
ask? Because you knew this. You
have no rights over my private
life.
ON FLOR..
Reaching a decisive conclusion.
PAD
If you have any disagreement with
this, I no longer wish to work
here.
ON CRISTINA'S LOOK
This is awful news.
ON FLOR.
For a decisive nod of affirmation. She adjusts her daughter's
hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits.
104
104
Flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out
to Deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. She
actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note.
DEBORAH
What's this?
Flor shakes the letter at her.
OTHER ANGLE..
69.
Showing Cristina hidden but looking on... like a stage
prompter in the wings.
FLOR
For you.
DEBORAH
From?
Flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own
chest.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
You are not yourself...This was
written in anger. You sleep on it
and then if you still want me to
have it -- fine..I don't think you
will once calm and rational thought
returns. Just sleep on it.
Deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door...leaving
Flor in the hall with the letter..Cristina reveals herself
and explains the situation to her mother. The last word we
hear before scene's end is "maana."
105
105
Deborah surreptitiously finishing putting on her running
clothes and is making for the door when the alarm clock goes
off and John awakens.
JOHN
She didn't even want us to know she
had a daughter - then, on the first
day, you take the kid without
asking. I think that's...
DEBORAH
(starting to lose it)
What!?! Insensitive? Elitist?
Irresponsible? Perverse? Dizzy?
JOHN
(slow and emphatic)
Dumb.
She looks at him...He has been atypical...Her immediate
emotional cocktail is panic, fury and deep, deep hurt. Her
words are slow...her voice ragged...
DEBORAH
When is anyone in this damn house
or this damn life going to consider
my feelings? I just tried to make
a lovely kid feel welcome. There's
no reason to rake it over...I let
it go..and gave Flor the room to
let it go. Which I'm sure she has!
It's over!! So get on board.
70.
She opens the door and almost runs into Flor who is standing
immediately in her way holding the letter.
FLOR
I slept.
106
106
Deborah stands over Cristina, who is writing in Spanish a
note Deborah is dictating. As John passes through the room.
DEBORAH
I am deeply and sincerely sorry to
have upset you. Especially in
light of the deep connection, as
women, I believe us to have.
EVELYN
(sotto to John)
And to think I was worried about
Flor living here with her kid?
107
110
Cristina arising..
111
114
Flor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears
John enter. She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor.
115
115
As she enters from the back room and sees that John is
walking into the kitchen. Her eye goes to the hall table on
which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it.
116
116
John enters the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will
be late. He is disappointed.
117
117
Not aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out
a thick wad of cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding
it..she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity...
FLOR
Cristina..
She turns...the wad of money in her hand..
118
118
The best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a
salve to his spirits. It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as
a culinary genius..This is a snack we will remember and
copy...John is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a
guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest...
119
119
He carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just
about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish
voices approaching. He looks up.
ANGLE ON FLOR AND CRISTINA
As they enter. Cristina translating her mother's words.
CRISTINA
My mother wishes me to represent
exactly what she says, nothing
else.
74.
And so, for the remainder of the scene, Flor will speak in
Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her
mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. It is
not only a translation but a reenactment.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
May I talk to you?
JOHN
You mean your mother....
Cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only
speaking for her mother...She faces him, her back to Flor.
JOHN (CONT'D)
(looking at Flor)
Sure you can talk to me..
Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish..
CRISTINA AS FLOR
I don't have to sleep first?
JOHN
What's wrong?
Flor waves the money..Cristina waves an empty hand as she
speaks for her mother.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
Did you give this money to my
daughter?
JOHN
I made this little deal..with all
the kids to...
CRISTINA AS FLOR
(interrupting)
Please..
Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now
translates from the background.
CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)
You don't tell or ask the mother
when you give a child a fortune for
looking on the beach for
stones..what is the word for this..
JOHN
Sea glass?
On hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated Flor
turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him.
75.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
No..not a name for the stones..a
name for the act..what you did..
ON FLOR..
As she spits out the word to her daughter.
FLOR
Engredo.
ON JOHN..
As his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear.
JOHN
Oh, no..engredo's going to be
rough.
ON CRISTINA..
Reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to
deliver the word.
CRISTINA
(briefly being herself)
It's hard to translate.
She takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
Smug.
John gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward Flor so
that now Cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she
translates for John
JOHN
I had no idea it would amount to
that kind of money..I thought ---
sort of tops fifty dollars.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
Fifty dollars is a lot of money..
JOHN
Okay. Right.
He has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females
look as he searches for the right thing to say..
JOHN (CONT'D)
(sighing to himself)
Ah, shit..
That fast Cristina translates.. Before Flor can react. John
talks directly to Flor..quiet,compassionate, a bit beaten.
76.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry....I get why you are
upset. It might not look it but I
am good at getting things. Doing
something about it is something
else..I was going to talk to you
before I actually gave her the
money..but maybe I should have
checked before I started the whole
thing.
(he smiles/they don't)
I know what it's like when you feel
your kid is being messed with..I
get the message. It won't happen
again. It's late..I'm sure we'd all
like...
Flor lets it out...her daughter hard pressed to keep up.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
To what..sleep? If this was small
enough to be helped by some little
apology, I would be a fool to bring
it up..I need to say more no matter
what the result. I need to be
impolite. You leave someone else's
child alone. It's simple, no? It
is too easy for children to feel
contradictions..It encourages
questioning their parents..and that
makes them less safe. Your wife
takes her for rides and changes her
hair..You give her money. Here..
(this next sentence
Cristina translates with
alarm and adds her own
question mark.)
Take back the money????????????
Flor hands John the envelope under her daughter's wrenching
gaze. They begin to exit..but Flor turns inadvertently
bumping into her daughter. Her voice softens.
CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)
I did not mean to be angry to you -
only emotional..
They turn to leave. John speaks with sudden volume and
muscle.
JOHN
What about hypocritical?
Cristina turns back..confused..her mother asks her for a
translation and she complies.. Flor then wearing the same
confused expression.
77.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Yeah, you heard me. It's not like
you didn't do the same thing...
FLOR
(hard on the translation)
No!
JOHN
Oh, yes. So go lecture
yourself..you won't need a
translator for that one...I mean
what am I lately... A recycling
bin?..just anyone dump in your
garbage and hope I make something
useful out of it...
Flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and
pointing a finger at her.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Yes, you did the same thing...you
think I didn't know about altering
those outfits for Bernie..She tells
me her stuff....So, am I missing
something? Is there a real
difference between that and what
you are complaining about?
Cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to
translate..but doesn't get one..Instead her mother is a bit
mortified and considerably humbled..the pie smack into the
face.
FLOR
Sin diferencia. Yo interfer.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
No difference. I interfered.
JOHN
Okay......I'm still not sure I did
the right thing keeping it to
myself. It felt disloyal to
Deborah..but my daughter really
needed someone to be kind to her
right then..so..so.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
I am very embarrassed. You are very
right. Hypocrisy..yes.
78.
JOHN
(something strikes him, he
softens, disoriented)
I'll tell you, it's pretty wild to
say something and have the other
person just concede the point. I'm
dazed here.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
I will leave whenever it is good
for you and...
JOHN
No..no..come on, man..
CRISTINA AS FLOR
But how can I work for you after we
talk like this?
JOHN
You can't quit even if you want to
and you know why.
FLOR
No..
JOHN
Yes, you do..
Flor is worried as John looks right at her..Is he coming on?
JOHN (CONT'D)
Because then Cristina will blame
herself for costing you the
job...and that guilt...I don't know
if you know about guilt..
Cristina doesn't have to check with her mother on this one.
CRISTINA
Culpa, guilt, s. We know. We are
Catholics.
FLOR
(after her daughter's
translation)
Culpa, si..Por Dios, Si.
CRISTINA
(on her own)
We know.
FLOR
(big nod)
We know.
John gestures that there is nothing to be done. Flor nods.
79.
JOHN
So, welcome back.
She smiles..gets up..extends her hand..they shake.
FLOR
Good night, Mr. Clasky..
CRISTINA
Good night As they exit..their
backs to John, daughter following
mother...Flor speaks to her
daughter.
FLOR
(an aside)
No te puedo tener haciendo esto por
mi. Ahora tengo que aprender
ingls.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
(over her shoulder to John
as they move)
I can't have you doing this for me.
I must learn English now.
FLOR
No, dije eso por ti - no por John.
That translates to "No, I meant that for you, not John." But
Cristina does not translate the line. Nor..
JOHN
You have a wonderful mother.
FLOR
Que?
CRISTINA
Nada.
120
120
A Spanish commercial for learning English in a hurry is on
television..Flor on the phone ordering it..
NARRATOR
Learning English would cost five
hundred and ninety nine dollars
down and 15 monthly payments of one
hundred and ten dollars...which
represents 48 percent
interest..Mexicans marketing
Mexicans. But not a penny was
wasted.
80.
121
122
Flor listening to the tapes as she does laundry.
NARRATOR
..as well as a totally committed,
obsessive work ethic, which blocked
out all else..She was her
daughter's mother.
As Flor silently mouths some English while listening to a
tape,Chum nudges her with a ball and, without thinking, she
takes it from his mouth and tosses it..Realizing, with alarm,
a beat too late that she has broken the rule.
DISSOLVE TO:
123
125
As John enters the house, clearly drunk.
There is the sound
of skittering paws as CHUM approaches.
JOHN
(cheering)
Hey, boy, I can use some up
company.
But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of
furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. John
follows, weaving a bit.
126
126
As John enters the room to find CHUM proffering the ball to
Flor who is watching one of video language tapes. She tosses
the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she
sees John standing there. He cheers, seeing her predicament.
81.
When she speaks English, at this point, her words are
halting.
JOHN
You gotta do something about
Chum..Your arm's going to go.
She waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of
his way. Chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. Flor
wearily throws it.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Don't you sleep anymore?
FLOR
No..You get more if you keep at it.
JOHN
You're doing fantastic.
FLOR
Now I am like a three year-old.
Your wife go out.
JOHN
She say where?
FLOR
No.
(on his reaction)
Sorry.
JOHN
Listen..I just forgot she was going
out..don't be a smart ass.
(jolted by his own remark)
Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate
mostly in apologies anyway..I'm
sorry. I should be whipped. I
should be stoned- it's been a while
- I meant to say, I think, don't be
smart, don't be kind, don't be
sensitive, don't be beautiful. I
meant to say, "hi, Flor, good night
Flor..that show you're watching is
going to be a hit."
He staggers out. Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and
then urgently gestures Chum to join him. Chum is reluctant,
but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master.
Flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of
John in the den. He is younger and smiling. She studies the
picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and
purposefully goes back to her lessons.
82.
127
128
As they get in..Deborah privy to the conversation now.
BERNICE
That you're better at everything
than I am...and I was thanking God
for there being this one thing
where I might have my nose in
front.
Deborah can't think of what single thing Bernice could
possibly feel superior about. She is genuinely puzzled.
DEBORAH
And that thing is???
Bernice deeply resents the question..She turns to her mother.
BERNICE
Sexual experience..
Cristina laughs.
BERNICE (CONT'D)
(ruefully to self)
That one even she knows is funny.
Cristina gives Bernice an appreciative push from behind.
Deborah, for some reason, feels she deserves credit for their
connection.
DEBORAH
Look at you girls.
129
129
Deb working an outfit..her mother eyeing her..
DEBORAH
Cristina's already read, on her
own, everything on Bernice's summer
reading list..And she's two grades
behind..Imagine if she went to
Bernice's school..And they'd kill
to give her a scholarship.
EVELYN
Talk to Flor...
DEBORAH
(sarcastic)
Yeah..she's so open to new things.
84.
130
131
This is the last day of the summer rental - many packed
cartons on the floor. Deborah, Flor and Cristina engaged in a
momentous conversation..(NOTE: Throughout the following, and
quite beside the point, we see Flor periodically make the
motion of throwing the ball. But we do not cut to Chum,
rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we
maintain focus on the momentous conversation.)
DEBORAH
Nuh-uh, Flor you are not pinning
this one on me. I've got to finish
packing up.
FLOR
(no longer sure of herself
or anything)
I just don't....Out of space this
school wants her to go for free?
DEBORAH
We ran into the school head. They
want diversity...Cristina knocked
her out...I had nothing to do with
it. By the way, the scholarship is
worth twenty thousand dollars. And
early registration is tomorrow.
FLOR
It is too far from our home.
DEBORAH
You could move in with us in town.
FLOR
Never, thank you...
DEBORAH
Okay, then don't..By the way..the
phrase is "NO, thank you."
132
132
Flor has her earphones on listening to her English tapes..but
she is enormously upset as she watches her daughter
passionately pray in English..soon taking off the ear phones.
86.
CRISTINA
Please, dear God..Enter my mother's
heart and make her understand what
this school would mean.
FLOR
Alright. I look.
CRISTINA
Amen.
133
135
Cristina sleeps. Flor sits on her bed - no thought of sleep.
136
136
John enters, home from work ... as he passes Flor's door it
opens and she steps out. Before she can continue on, she sees
Evelyn at the foot of the stairs, carrying a glass of port.
EVELYN
Hi, Flor, want some port?
FLOR
No, thank you, Evelyn.
EVELYN
(going up stairs)
Thanks for never judging me..Love
you. Love everybody. That's what's
killing me.. Sleep well.
EVELYN'S POV.
She sees Flor approach John. Evelyn looks thoughtful.
137
137
John is about to pour himself a stiff drink. Flor startles
him.
FLOR
May I talk with you?
87.
JOHN
Me?
(she nods)
Deborah will be home soon. I just
talked to her.
FLOR
I need real talk..Is it okay?
John does not answer immediately. The brief pause is noted.
FLOR (CONT'D)
No?
JOHN
Sure.
FLOR
Outside? Private?
JOHN
Sure.....
(as they exit to beach
with a nervous laugh)
You have me a little worried...
He glances back, hoping to have his fears assuaged, they are
not.
138
143
As John moves past Evelyn on his way to work. She looks at
him a little wild-eyed as they both stand in the doorway.
Straining a bit for breath.
JOHN
You feel okay?
EVELYN
No. I've given up drinking.
(he looks at her/she sadly
nods affirmation)
I had to do it John..I need every
brain cell to watch out for all of
us..given the current climate.
Anyway. John, I think you're great
and I'm going to act accordingly.
JOHN
(totally confused)
Good deal.
EVELYN
Let's hope.
144
144
Flor cooking alongside Monica --- a table is set for ten..A
banner proclaiming BIENVENIDA, MAM.
NARRATOR
My great Aunt Monica had finally
managed to get her mother to Los
Angeles and my mother was making a
party.
145
145
Bernice sitting amidst Cristina and two other golden girls as
they arrive at the Clasky home.
NARRATOR
I was with my friends who had
helped me understand real optimism.
As they pull in the driveway. Cristina and her friends exit
the car and squeal loudly at each other with the excitement
of having it all. Bernice exits last. She is not squealing.
95.
146
146
As Deb finishes dialing a call..Cristina looking on...her two
friends watching a movie in the family room. A clock
prominently reads nine p.m.
DEBORAH
(into phone)
Flor? Deb..Look, sorry to call you
so late, but they're still studying
and I'm going out but I promised to
get her back so if you want me to
cut off the school work,
fine...whatever you want me to do.
Well, okay..you think about it..
(she holds on to give Flor
time)
And hey, if you're tired, or want
to play, let her sleep here and
I'll get her back there tomorrow.
You still want to think about it?
Okay..
She hangs up...and exchanges a mischievous look with
Cristina.
147
147
As Flor hangs up..
NARRATOR
Though it is possible to judge
harshly my conduct toward my mother
in my first year at school; almost
all professional literature excuses
my behavior as developmental, since
I was entering an age where
rebellion and narcissism were to be
expected. And I was being mentored.
Monica and her newly arrived mother are there along with the
bride from an earlier scene and some of the girls who saw
Cristina off to Malibu..Women cooking in the kitchen..She
tells the girls, in Spanish, that Cristina may not make it.
They are disappointed...Flor thinks - then says something to
Monica who nods in agreement. Flor exits.

As Evelyn stands there...a little in the shadows..
HER POV...
Deborah somewhat dolled up moving through the interior of the
house..
96.
149
151
As John enters..Evelyn, in an adjoining room, moves to
intercept him.
EVELYN (CONT'D)
John, better wait a minute.
But John hears Deb's crying from upstairs..
JOHN
(concerned)
What the hell's wrong?
EVELYN
Nothing. In all futility, can I
urge you not to go up there.
But he is already moving quickly up the stairs..As he turns
at the top of the stairs WE SEE THE DOOR CLOSE TO BERNICE'S
ROOM.
98.
ON EVELYN..
EVELYN (CONT'D)
(to herself)
Denouement.
152
152
John enters the room on the double...passes Deborah without
knowing it..(she is partially obscured by the drape or some
such). As he passes....camera HOLDS ON DEBORAH..she is a
mess...goopy tear stains..seeing him and his concern brings
her grief to a higher ground...a sinner humbled by
goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability...
JOHN
Deb..Deb?..where are you?
He is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but
an instinct leads her astray once more.
DEBORAH
Here I am.
JOHN
Baby, what?
DEBORAH
"Baby?" Stay there, John...Sit
down..I suddenly get what I have to
do...I just have to get the guts.
JOHN
Is it absolutely necessary to make
it this...this scary..can you just
say it?
DEBORAH
Not so easy.
JOHN
(tender/ready for the big
healing)
Yeah..come on..it's me. We can
talk.
DEBORAH
Do I ever hope so...I've been
seeing another man for the last
eleven weeks and it was nothing and
I ended it tonight..At first it was
just keeping an eye on the real
estate market..Then it was...what?
Me being insecure and looking for
some ridiculous vali...
ON JOHN...
99.
A shock victim..he holds up a hand to stop her..
JOHN
Go -- hold on...hold on...I'm
missing what you're saying..You
can't just keep talking and expect
me to follow it when you start the
way you did.......
DEBORAH
Just what did you hear?
JOHN
Well there was the crack in the
planet. That was noisy...
She looks at him...a solid beat...
JOHN (CONT'D)
There's an actual noise in my
head.....no kidding..
Briefly he does the noise...
DEBORAH
(slowly)
I met him about...
John holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself
to hear this..She waits...and waits...as he waits he grows
flushed and stunned with dread. Finally a word..
JOHN
You..
She takes that as a cue to start..
DEBORAH
I met him..
He puts up his hand..
JOHN
If you talk that fast...I'll never
hear you..there's a lot going
through my mind....Have you said
yet whether you slept with him?
DEBORAH
So far I've just been talking about
a flirtation because the really
important thing for you to know...
JOHN
Have you said yet whether you've
had sex with someone else? Because
I really am missing most of your
words. So help me out here..
100.
DEBORAH
I've been trying to explain that
for the first ten weeks there was
almost nothing to ...
JOHN
(sincerely checking but
wild)
You still haven't said, right?
DEBORAH
Is this your way of...
JOHN
This is my way of...this is my way
of asking you whether..
He stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished
future.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Oh man, once I ask it...give me a
second.
(several beats then some
conversational good
manners for keeping her
waiting)
I'm just trying to figure out
whether there's any way to avoid
knowing..no, damn
(quickly closing this
argument with himself)
There's not...
(to her)
Okay, you're on..real short answer,
huh? Have you had sex with
another..
DEBORAH
I know you're very angry?
JOHN
(considering/then
repressed answer)
Ahhhh...I'm getting there, yes.
DEBORAH
(softly)
John?
(on his look)
I think if you let me tell you the
full everything of this we'd be in
a position to deal with it
better..because eleven weeks ago
when...
101.
JOHN
You don't believe that I miss your
words..I get three or four
tops...and then just see your mouth
moving with nothing coming out and
then I spin out and there's this
noise...But there's no way to miss
a "yes" or "no."
DEBORAH
(blurts)
Yes..
JOHN
(core simple/eight years
old)
Really?
DEBORAH
(this gets her)
I made up my mind that I would
answer every question you had..I'll
answer anything and everything and
more.
JOHN
(perplexed)
What other questions could there
be?
DEBORAH
Are you really that much nicer than
me?
JOHN
Well, you don't set the bar real
high.
He get up and starts to exit..
DEBORAH
No. Please, please, please..I
think if you listen to exactly what
happened and then do whatever you
need to...we'll..just let me tell
you everything..
The doorbell rings...it's quite late...Deborah wondering
what's up..she looks out the window.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
Oh, it's just Flor.
153
154
Flor sees Evelyn in the living room.
EVELYN
What are you doing here?
FLOR
I want Cristina. I want to talk to
Mrs. Clasky. I want to quit.
EVELYN
I don't think you can do any of it
right this minute..
FLOR
Oh, yes..Where's Cristina?
155
155
Deborah can barely look at him...
DEBORAH
...then, when I was driving back
tonight after I ended the whole
yuck thing..I was feeling human.
I'm done with what's his name..a
relief... ..and now it can be like
it never happened and then I
thought that the only hope was that
I own that it did happen and that I
take my medicine here..because if
I'm walking around with what I did
and you don't know what I
did..there is a real limit to how
close we can be..you're with me and
I'm this person who has this bad
secret and we aren't really on the
same page ever again..so the reason
I took this chance in telling -- is
because I want us to be good..I
want us to be close. I want to
feel like you're not nuts to be in
love with me..So what I think is we
should talk till we pass out ..
Talk till we're so sick of each
other that there's nothing left to
do but take the first step out of
hell..So please let's not leave
this room until you've heard and
said everything..please say, okay..
She awaits his answer..He has heard barely a few words..
JOHN
What?
103.
DEBORAH
John..
JOHN
I've got to get out of
here..because you keep talking.
(as she starts to follow
him)
Stay put!
She does. Just before he exits.
DEBORAH
You've got to say something.
JOHN
You are a terrible wife.
He exits.
156
156
Evelyn stands in the doorway with Flor..they are looking at
Cristina and her two friends sleeping together.
EVELYN
I don't think you want to wake her
when you're this upset and the
other kids are right there and...
Flor makes a noise of frustration and retreats from the room.
157
157
As they arrive at the interior entrance, John comes down the
stairs just as Flor opens the front door.
JOHN
Where you going?
FLOR
I'm leaving....I have finally..
JOHN
Me too..I'll drive you.
FLOR
No.
JOHN
Yes..come on...it's past midnight
here.
FLOR
If you truly don't know why I say
"no" let me at last say the reason.
At least that will be a relief.
Have you no idea that I....
104.
Before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the
floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's
snout..Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball.
OTHER ANGLE.
As Chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it
and returns.
JOHN
Look I have to get out of here
right now..
FLOR
Go..
John exits to driveway...Flor makes one last toss..these
tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Goodbye, Chum.
Another toss and Flor follows John out the door.
ON CHUM.
No longer happy. He has lost his only easy mark. He stares at
the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the floor.
158
159
Two pissed-off people..jaws set...breathing labored..As the
car starts and Flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and
explosive shout...
FLOR
(a quick and mighty vent)
Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii!
For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while..
JOHN
Yes! Exactly! Well put! Teach me
that word sometime. I can really
use it.
She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the
anger fires an immediate need..She leans across the seat to
deliver an urgent message to him. The words come out
exponentially too forcefully.
FLOR
I quit this job!
His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her..
JOHN
I quit this job!!!!!
As he turns onto Sunset.
106.
FLOR
That's the bus stop.
JOHN
I'll take you home.
FLOR
No. Drop me at a bus.
JOHN
Oh, shut up and stop telling me
what to do.
FLOR
Okay...then let's do something
besides driving me home where my
daughter isn't.
JOHN
Okay..we'll do something.
FLOR
And I'm supposed to figure out what
because I'm a housekeeper and you
don't have to think.
JOHN
Oh, don't do the class thing,
man..You don't know where I come
from.
FLOR
Alright, I know. But I can't be
responsible no more for making sure
nothing happens. That's another
terrible job I quit.
JOHN
What are you talking about? I take
responsibility for anything within
a block. You have nothing to worry
about. That's my job.
FLOR
Excellent. So you're going to
figure out what we do, right?
JOHN
Yes. Okay. Big man figure out!
FLOR
Stop there.
She points to a mall..He looks at her and pulls in.
107.
160
161
As Flor enters the market..She calls to the young shop girl
as Marine medics for morphine.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Maquillaje!
CUT TO:
The shop girl directs her to the make-up counter where she
starts shopping..lip gloss, blush, eye stuff..She starts
applying it at the check out counter.
162
163
As she enters, there is a fury to her which he almost
matches.
FLOR
This is me when I'm not working..
You have never seen me!
JOHN
Well, you look familiar.
FLOR
So,
(parodying him)
"man," where we heading?
JOHN
I don't think I can handle public..
FLOR
Yes, no...lots of people right now
is..
JOHN
I know.
FLOR
You were going to figure this out!
JOHN
My place!
108.
164
164
As they enter the main restaurant...
FLOR
I've never seen your place. Very
perfect.
He heads for the kitchen.
JOHN
I'm going to cook, Beautiful.
(on a dime correction)
I'm going to cook beautifully.
FLOR
Hey..please..
He turns.
FLOR (CONT'D)
We both were not normal because we
are angry and we act like we are
angry with each other and we are
not..I am not. I am glad to be with
you. It feels comfortable to be
with you. If I just left the job
and never spoke with you it would
have been sin. You understand?
JOHN
Ummmmmmmmm...Yes.
He stands next to her and, for want of a better physical
expression, pats her on her back..She eyes him, almost
critical about the lame extent of his aggression....He can't
quite look at her...He pats her again..
REAR ANGLE..THE PAT ON THE BACK.
The pat is becoming a rub..he cups her back..slides his
hand..she responds just a bit..
JOHN (CONT'D)
I think I'm inventing a horrible
new way of making out..
FLOR
Not so horrible.....
His hand keeps going..he now hugs her to him even though they
both still face front.. like a loving couple on a walk to the
market. His hand squeezes her shoulder.
JOHN
My hand is the only sane part of my
body..every other part wants to
jump off a cliff.
109.
FLOR
(digging this/almost
growing a sense of humor)
If the other hand could cheer up,
you could lift me up and carry me
off.
He laughs. He takes his hand from around her. It is a bit
awkward.
JOHN
I don't know how to handle that
one. I think I already broke my
record for smooth.
FLOR
I don't understand.
JOHN
It's me. I'm not making sense. But
I can get you fed.
He goes to the kitchen. She begins to explore a little. She
goes to a cabinet and opens it to find a CD player. She digs
in her purse and takes out a CD.
165
165
As John starts cooking up a storm...there is some velocity to
his cooking...he still seethes. Then reacts as Spanish Music
starts to play. He clears his throat as if he must make a
speech. Then does so again..some vocal spasm paying tribute
to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels.
166
166
Flor is lighting the candle at each of the twenty tables.
167
167
He is cooking..He is talking to himself.
JOHN
Nothing to be nervous about. You
are not on a date...
(calls out)
Hey, Flor?
FLOR'S VOICE (O.S.)
Yes, John.
JOHN
What are you doing?
She enters the room...dancing a bit..
110.
FLOR
Just lighting candles and picking
music.
(notices his cooking)
Oooh.
She gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet
dangling...sings along a bit in Spanish. He is uncomfortable
anew. The nervousness mounting.
JOHN
You want a drink?
She considers the question totally..He is busy cooking..not
realizing how weighty she considers his question...finally
aware she has not answered and looks at her..
JOHN (CONT'D)
Huh?
She regards him levelly..then makes her decision.
FLOR
No.
He gets out a bottle of vodka.
FLOR (CONT'D)
I, uh...don't think you should
either.
JOHN
Then excuse me, because if I had
the equipment I'd inject the vodka.
He starts to pour.
FLOR
Wait!
(he stops)
I think it is so important that we
are each clear-headed.
He looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. Flor
beams..we have not seen her smile like this for quite some
time.
FLOR (CONT'D)
It is very good that you did not
ask, "why?"
JOHN
(quietly)
Keep things real, right?
FLOR
(impressed)
I wouldn't have put it so well.
111.
168
168
They sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the
greatest late-night meal in the history of Western man.
FLOR
I will remember every
taste..forever.
JOHN
Tell you the truth..I wanted a shot
at cooking for you.
(shy/his heart)
I'm very glad you liked it.
FLOR
It's something watching you.
He looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a
very long time, if ever.. lit up by a man.
JOHN
Well, if it's anything at your end
imagine over here...scratch
that..the last thing you want to
hear is somebody going off on your
looks.
FLOR
Don't be crazy. Tell me every
detail.
JOHN
Okay, Flor, yes I will...They
should name a gender after
you..Looking at you doesn't do
it..Staring is the only thing that
makes sense..and trying not to
blink so you don't miss anything.
She squeals with laughter..He laughs a little himself and in
so doing loses his courage..He looks down at his
hands..shyness again belting him a good one..Still looking
down.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Look..forgive me..I'm.....It's just
that you are drop-dead, crazy-
gorgeous..so much so that I am
really considering looking at you
again before we finish up here.
FLOR
Soon, please.
And now he looks at her.
CLOSE ON FLOR..
112.
Utterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before
being swept away.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Right now....immediately..we have
to dance or kiss.
He stands. She stands..He kids just a bit, clowning at
weighing the two options and then:
HIS POV..
Her face..
JOHN
No contest.
They kiss.
FLOR
You sure you're not Mexican.
JOHN
(smiling/he likes this)
What do you mean?
FLOR
I meant you talk like a Spanish
song.
JOHN
You kiss like a Spanish fly..
(on her confusion)
Joking around. I don't know what
I'm talking about...
FLOR
Yes you do.
She breaks and heads for the dining room. John has a moment
to consider.. He does not have his wits about him..a
condition every bit as fearsome as liberating.
169
169
As Flor rummages for another CD, enjoying every minute. She
places the disk in the player and exits.
170
170
As she returns...
FLOR (CONT'D)
This song...You see what a good
thing to tell you how you talk like
a Mexican song.
113.
She begins to translate the lyrics.
FLOR (CONT'D)
When I kiss you, entire oceans rush
through my veins..
(he is wildly
uncomfortable)
Gardens of flowers blossom in my
body.
He starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past
the event..she shakes her head at him..driving the words --
pointing emphatically..she will not have her poetry laughed
at..
FLOR (CONT'D)
And you wander along my fertile
soil, picking its ripe fruit..A
nightingale undresses on my
tongue..And under its wings..
He laughs. She stops cold. Looks down..though just seconds
long, this still constitutes the first depression of her
life.
JOHN
I'm sorry. I don't know what I just
took out of you but tell me how to
get it back in there..I'm sorry.
Flor..I'm sorry.
CLOSE ON HER..
The downcast eyes rise to see him..
FLOR
Then respect this.
He looks at her...they kiss..It is a kiss without an author.
God at the controls. They break. There is a beat then..
JOHN
Here's something I never asked
anyone..Did nightingales undress on
your tongue?
Flor looks at him with enormous warmth. Her arms looped
around his neck..aware of the music.
FLOR
Did they on yours?
JOHN
(a long beat of
reflection/then sincere
and surprised)
Yeah...
114.
171
172
They are lying post coitally in each other's arms on a sofa
just inside the dining room..They are covered by a table
cloth. They hold hands above the cover...each private but
still somehow in contact.
FLOR
Oh, Johnny, why is everything so
damn confusing?
JOHN
Culpa.
Flor's pleasure zone is rocked. She smiles at his first
Spanish word. She is wrestling with large feelings of
pleasure and large ominous thoughts.
FLOR
(a beat)
Is your mind racing?
JOHN
I would say my mind has
evaporated...but that there are
remnants still standing waiting to
fall. It feels pretty good.
FLOR
Like happy?
JOHN
Like happy.
FLOR
You think that will last?
JOHN
It's already gone.
FLOR
I understand what you mean.
JOHN
I don't understand what I mean.
115.
FLOR
That it's getting late. That
responsibilities have entered your
brain. Don't hide that from me.
And really, one large reason we are
here is because you respect me as a
mother and I respect you as a
father..
He is looking at her...she is disconcerted.
JOHN
You're a great and wild mother.
FLOR
You are a beautiful father.
She looks at him..they kiss...tenderness..heat...intimacy.
FLOR (CONT'D)
When Cristina was young, I would
say I want to take any man who
wants me to the park and I will
tell whether I want him from the
way he is with Cristina. I wish
you had been in the park then.
(a beat)
Any reaction?
John considering and then the answer comes to him.
JOHN
Exactly!..
FLOR
You know, I always think about when
you...Oh, there's no point. I talk
too much...
(a bit of emotion)
...because I don't know if we ever
talk again.
JOHN
Hey, hey..How do you get there?
Wait.
FLOR
Yes you do. Be honest.
JOHN
I'm being honest.
(indicates their bodies)
Look at us - I think I call it
honesty.
116.
FLOR
What are we going to do -- go home,
let our hearts go back in our
bodies, see each other a few more
times. Make a tragedy out of us..
She kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a
small cooing sound.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Ahhhhhhh.
(sudden energy)
There are some mistakes you cannot
risk when you have kids...Please,
are you ready to go?
JOHN
(urgently)
No. I'm not. No.
(then)
Stay put for a second. Stay here.
Once our feet touch that floor, I'm
going to get too many brain cells
back. So don't be in such a hurry.
That floor, Flor, is going to eat
us alive.
(she settles back/he is
energized)
So you think it was a mistake up to
now.
(she nods "yes")
That's rough.
She nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot
touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him.
FLOR
The mistake....I love it.
173
173
Deborah's face is bleached from crying...the tear ducts of
her now brown eyes are parched dry..Evelyn sits eyeing her as
she looks through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of
Stone Canyon. In her current shape she would give pause to a
staff worker at Promises..a shock victim walking through the
rubble after the bomb has dropped. Deborah's voice is
scratchy when she speaks.
DEBORAH
Tell me again why I can't call him
on the cell.
EVELYN
Besides that he turned it off?
DEBORAH
Yes.
117.
EVELYN
Forty messages start to look needy.
DEBORAH
Mother, you're enjoying this.
EVELYN
No..Definitely not in the way you
think.
DEBORAH
(staggered)
You are enjoying it?!?
EVELYN
(rising/honest)
I am enjoying actually being of use
to my daughter. I am enjoying the
fact that I really know how to
advise you and the miracle that you
are so deeply disoriented that you
are gobbling up everything I say.
Deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a
somewhat new way..as if Evelyn were an actual person instead
of an upsetting extension of herself.
DEBORAH
(vulnerable)
There's one thing I'd like to say
to you about you and me.
EVELYN
You don't have to.
DEBORAH
I want to.
EVELYN
Okay.
DEBORAH
(quite vulnerable and
appealing)
You were an alcoholic and wildly
promiscuous woman during my
formative years so that I am in
this fix because of you. It is your
fault. I just needed..
(gestures heart to heart)
..that moment for us.
EVELYN
You have a solid point, dear. But
right now the lessons of my life
are coming in handy for you.
118.
DEBORAH
There's a car coming....
Evelyn moves to her.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
It's him...he's got to tell me
everything..
Evelyn shakes her head "no."
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(wild-eyed)
Yes!
EVELYN
Do you know that right now you are
your own worst enemy..that you
can't trust one thought in your
brain?
DEBORAH
Duh.
EVELYN
Then trust me and only allow
yourself to say one thing to
him..One thing..."I'm so glad
you're back."
DEBORAH
Huh?
EVELYN
Yes.
DEBORAH
(babbling)
But I've got to know whether he
touched her - where he touched her -
how he touched her - if they broke
a sweat --- what they said - who
made the first move - how they left
it -- if anyone loves anyone or has
an intention of making contact in
the future - what she wore - how he
felt afterwards - whether anyone
mentioned me..
(a wail)
..whether they held hands when they
left..
The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from
downstairs.
119.
EVELYN
Just those words I said. If you
want a prayer of coming out of
this.
DEBORAH
I know you're right..But..
EVELYN
But what?
DEBORAH
(a small voice)
I forgot the sentence you said I
should say.
EVELYN
"I'm so glad you're back."
DEBORAH
Okay..do I have to wait here?
EVELYN
No..he may not come up here..go to
him.
DEBORAH
Why wouldn't he come up here?
EVELYN
Just go.
DEBORAH
Do I need a little makeup?
EVELYN
You need a hose but you don't have
the time. It's fine that you look
like that. It's genuine..You can
use genuine.
DEBORAH
Thank you, mom.
She takes a breath exits...
174
174
She pauses at the top of the stairs..a breath..then unable to
help herself runs down them at breakneck speed.
175
175
John turning a light on when Deborah bursts into the room.
120.
DEBORAH
I'm so glad to see you
(correcting self)
..that you're back.
John looks up at her - not knowing what to say...he is
thrown. His demeanor has changed...deeper..serious..
JOHN
It's late, Deborah.
The wrong words start to form..she stops herself..
DEBORAH
Well, I just wanted to say.. what I
said..
She is on the stairway..he turns to go in the opposite
direction.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
(way too loud)
Uhhhh..
He turns back to her...she stops herself from straying into
untried words but gestures whether he is coming upstairs to
bed.
JOHN
(a beat then)
I can't sleep upstairs with you..
Just can't for now.
This rocks her..panicked she grabs at her life preserver.
DEBORAH
I'm just so glad you're back.
Deborah's suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest
of footings for them...He looks at her directly for the first
time since she told him.
JOHN
Yeah..okay.
She nods..then goes back up the stairs..
176
176
Evelyn, who has been standing close to the doorway, stands
clear to let her enter. As Deborah flies in wildly vulnerable
- her breath racing.
DEBORAH
I am literally choking on unsaid
words..seriously. If this were a
restaurant ten people would have
their knuckles in my sternum.
121.
EVELYN
The fact that you didn't just make
things worse should fill you with
hope..
In her current state, she has to process that one..and does.
Her breath slows.

The first time we've seen this room since Flor was working
the sewing machine...John enters. He is down, longing and
finality make for a brutal cocktail..He rubs his head and
sits near the sewing machine..He glances over and sees Flor's
Spanish/English dictionary..There is a knock on the door.
JOHN
Deb, I'm done tonight. I don't
think we can jam anything else in.
BERNICE'S VOICE
It's me, Dad.
He springs from the bed and opens the door.
JOHN
What's up, honey?
BERNICE
Just thought I'd check that you
were back and okay and all.
JOHN
(feigning innocence)
Because?
BERNICE
Mom was crying for six hours
straight and Grandma was in with
her all that time mostly saying,
"he'll be back..he'll be back."
I've got to get back to Georgie.
JOHN
I just hate that you had that kind
of a night.
BERNICE
It's good for me to worry about
something that really matters
instead of the stupid stuff that's
usually on my mind...
JOHN
Like?
122.
BERNICE
(a big grin)
Surviving.
JOHN
You're fantastic, Bernie...I love
you.
BERNICE
It's a slant...
(pause then)
Hey..I know there's a lot you went
through but I knew all along that
Grandma was right about you coming
back..I mean totally knew it so I
wasn't that worried. But still I...
(some emotion out of
hiding)
I really appreciate it, Dad.
Thanks....Stop staring at me..what?
You don't know what to say?
JOHN
Right. I don't know what to say.
BERNICE
Just what you taught me..You're
welcome.
JOHN
You're welcome.
They kiss.

As Flor enters...walks through a few empty rooms..then once
in the kitchen she sees the children and Evelyn are swimming
in the pool...she opens the glass door Monica bumped into on
interview day.

181
She stands waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head
to see into rooms, wondering if John is there. Finally, as
she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper
landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her
things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves off
to comply...then Deborah appears in the same spot.
125.
DEBORAH
Please stick your head in here for
a minute.
Flor nods and starts up the stairs...

Deborah holds open the door while Flor walks inside..then
closes it.
DEBORAH
What's with avoiding me, am I this
horrible person?
As Flor just looks at her.
DEBORAH (CONT'D)
I know. It's a ridiculous question
but sometimes I'm ridi...
FLOR
No. It's a good question. A fine
question. Complicated.
(beat then)
I was just thinking to answer.
DEBORAH
Oh stop.
Come on. Weren't we
close?
FLOR
(like a shot)
No.
DEBORAH
(truly hurt)
Well, I'm very, very disappointed
to hear that. It makes me feel like
a fool.
FLOR
(compassion forces a
crumb)
We weren't close..but we were
connected...in a bad way.
DEBORAH
(strangely soothed)
You know something, I think we're
saying the same thing...Look as
long as we're doing closure..What
did you and my husband, John, do
last night?
Flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined.
FLOR
I can only tell you what I did.
126.
DEBORAH
That will be sufficient.
FLOR
(these are tender
feelings)
I became sure of what an incredibly
lucky woman you are and I must make
myself not envy you which is hard.
No, it's not hard. It's impossible.
Now please..I am exhausted.
DEBORAH
Same here - believe me.
Deborah would hug..but it's only an eighth of a gesture
because Flor has turned to exit, calling for her daughter to
hurry as she goes.
FLOR
Cristina, aprate.

Almost empty - it's Saturday. Mother and daughter sit
together by the giant window in the center of the bus.
Cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak
with stoic dignity. The girl is becoming less inconsolable
and more in need of mothering.
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
For that reason should you choose
to grant me your scholarship my
mother, at my request, will be
relocating to the New York
Metropolitan Area so that she can
stay close during my time at
Princeton.
Cristina moves closer to Flor, who senses it immediately and
wraps her in her arms.. kisses her head.
NARRATOR (CONT'D)
I hope my essay has done her
justice. I love her with all my
heart.
FADE OUT.
