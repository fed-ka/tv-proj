                    Ow! -- Easy, jackass!

      Widen to find JACK sitting next to a reclining SAWYER, 
      removing his bandage.  Fresh gauze and tape lie beside Jack.

                                  JACK
                    You want it easy, quit moaning.  *
                    I ve got to change these bandages --

                                  JACK
                    Hold.  Still.

      Sawyer eyes Jack a beat as he continues easing off the tape.

                                  SAWYER
                    So, considerin  we pretty much hate *
                    each other, how d I score the house *
                    call, Dr. Quinn?*

                    Tryin  to ease your conscience?*

      And Jack does his best not to take that bait --*

                                  JACK
                    My conscience is fine, thanks.*

                      SAWYERJACK
      Yeah?
                                                  -- Yeah.

                                  SAWYER
                     Course -- what you got to feel *
                    guilty about?  You let that damn *
                    Arab torture me.  Stood by and 
                    watched.  So now you just patch me *
                    up and you get your ticket into *
                    heaven.  Only reason you re here *
                    is...*

                                  JACK*
                    I m here --*
                          (locks eyes with Sawyer; *
                            intense)*
                    Because no one else wants anything *
                    to do with you.

      Sawyer takes that in a moment, soberly.  Then...

                                  SAWYER
                    She does.

      Jack glances up at him on that.  Then, he stands and tosses 
      the fresh bandaging and tape he brought onto Sawyer s lap.

                                  JACK
                    Change your own damn bandages.

      He turns and goes.

      OFF SAWYER - glaring after him...

      CLOSE ON MEAT ON A SPIT, as a knife carves off slices.  WIDEN 
      to see LOCKE doing the butchering as he serves a few waiting 
      people, including HURLEY, holding airplane trays and whatever 
      else passes as a plate or bowl in this place.

      AN ESTABLISHING PAN ACROSS - We find the dozen denizens of 
      the valley, including MICHAEL and CHARLIE, eating their 
      dinners, tearing away the fatty grizzle.  While some may sit  *
      here quietly -- depressed -- others seem, considering  *
      everything, to be doing all right: some are talking. *

      CHARLIE, still going through late stage withdrawal, puts down 
      his barely touched food, clearly having no appetite as

      SHANNON walks by, holding an empty water bottle.  We follow 
      her as she crosses to the spring.  We find WALT there, 
      feeding pieces of meat to VINCENT who then starts lapping up 
      water in the pool.

      ON SHANNON, as she sees that.

                                    SHANNON

      Hurley passes by with two trays of boar meat.

      HURLEY shakes his head and continues on as VINCENT suddenly 
      hops into the pool, wading around to SHANNON s horror.

                                  SHANNON (CONT D)
                    Oh my God -- DO SOMETHING!


      ON JACK, examining the side of a shirtless SULLIVAN (late 
      forties, thin).  SUN is there, too, mashing aloe leaves in a 
      bowl, showing concern about all the yelling outside.  Hurley 
      enters with the food.  Jack glances at him.

                                  JACK
                    What s going on out there?

                                  HURLEY
                    Ah, you know, the usual... People 
                    yelling at each other over nothing.

                                  SULLIVAN
                    So, what do you think, Doc?  This 
                    rash... It s bad, isn t it?  Some 
                    kinda jungle disease... or--

                                  JACK
                    Hives.

                                  SULLIVAN
                    Hives.  What is that, like, a 
                    poison ivy--

                                  JACK
                    It s a common rash, Sullivan.  
                    Brought on by heat.  And stress.  
                    Just try to relax.  It ll clear up.

                                  SULLIVAN
                    You sure?  I mean... It really 
                    itches.  And... burns a little.

                                  SUN
                          (in Korean)
                    It s ready.

      Jack turns to Sun who hands him the bowl.  He nods gratefully 
      to her and she goes.  Jack passes the bowl to Sullivan.

                                  JACK
                    Here.  This should help with the 
                    itching.  And the burning.  Just... 
                    try to get your mind off it.

                                  SULLIVAN
                    Uh... O-okay.  Thanks.

      He turns and exits.  After he s gone, Hurley hands Jack a 
      tray of food.  As they move to sit...

                                  HURLEY
                     Get your mind off it?   What else 
                    is that dude gonna do but stress?

                                  JACK
                    I ve got enough on my plate without 
                    having to treat hypochondriacs.

                                  HURLEY
                    That s, like, my point, man.  We re 
                    all fried.  I mean, have you taken 
                    a look at those people out there?  
                      Everybody s way tense... y know, 
                    since we were in a plane crash?  
                    And Sayid splitting like that.
                          (then)
                    Plus... we got, like, no real plan 
                    to get off this island...

      Jack looks wearily at Hurley, who backs off a little.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    I m just saying... It d be sweet 
                    to have something to, y know... do.

                                  JACK
                    Look, I sympathize.  But we re 
                      surviving.  That s my main concern 
                    right now.  Keeping us alive.
                          (then)
                    Things could be worse.*

      Hurley considers that for a moment, then:

                                  HURLEY
                    How?

      DISSOLVE IN CLOSE ON SAYID as his eyes flutter open, 
      squinting against a BRIGHT LIGHT shining in his face.  His

      current accompanied by Sayid s grunts, until...

      ON FIGURE - as the wire is removed, the LIGHT brightens 
      again.  Sayid falls back onto the cot, short gasping breaths.

                    Hi.

      Hurley peers up at him, unsurely.  Then, at the bags.

                                  HURLEY
                    Yo.  What s this?

      LOCKE appears, dropping a third bag as Hurley stands.

                                  LOCKE
                    These were in the jungle.  Must 
                    have fallen from the plane.*

                                  HURLEY
                    Uh... What were you guys doing out 
                    in the jungle at night?

                                  ETHAN
                    Best time to hunt.*

                                  LOCKE
                    Ethan here s got some experience...

      ANGLE ON WALT, sitting up in his cubby, watching and 
      listening.  His father seemingly asleep next to him.

                    Spotted tracks we think might be 
                    rabbit or some other rodent.

                                  HURLEY*
                    Rodent.  Yum.*

                                  ETHAN
                    Figured people are starting to get *
                    tired of eating boar meat.
                          (raises his eyebrows)*
                    Variety is the spice of life.*

                                  HURLEY
                    Dude, you got that right.*
                          (then)
                    Okay.  I ll check out the bags.  
                    See if there s anything useful we 
                    can... y know... use.  Thanks.

      Hurley grabs a suitcase and starts going through it.  ON  *
      LOCKE and ETHAN moving out when they hear:

                                  WALT (O.S.)
                    Mr. Locke...

      Ethan moves on as Locke turns and sees Walt walking up,  *
      speaking quietly.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Are you going back out to hunt?

                                  LOCKE
                    For a bit.

                                  WALT
                    Well... Can I go with you?
                          (off Locke s look)
                    I mean, I wanna learn how to... *
                    Y know, hunt and--*

                    Walt -- !

      Walt, busted, looks back to see:

      MICHAEL, sitting up, looking at him.

                                  WALT
                    I was just... I was talking to Mr. 
                    Locke about--




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"         (PINK)         10/5/04        14.

                                  MICHAEL
                    I know what you re doing, man.  Not 
                    gonna happen.  Get back to bed.*

      Walt glares at his dad, embarrassed and frustrated.  He peers 
      at Locke for a moment, then stalks to his cubby as Michael 
      and Locke exchange a look.  Then Locke and Ethan turn and go.

      ANGLE ON HURLEY, emptying the contents of the open suitcase.  
      He holds up an impossibly ugly Hawaiian shirt, shakes his 
      head and tosses it aside.  Then he unzips the long vinyl bag.

      CLOSE ON HIM as he looks inside and reacts, eyes widening.

                                  HURLEY
                    Oh... Duuude...

      He looks up and a smile comes to him as he registers an idea.


      CLOSE ON SAYID, his eyes clenched shut, his body TENSING as 
      we hear the HUM of electricity.  To escape the graphic nature 
      of this, we illustrate it through the DIMMING of the BRIGHT 
      LIGHT, still focused on Sayid.

      ON THE FIGURE in the dark, as the wire is moved away and the 
      LIGHT BRIGHTENS.

                      FIGURESAYID
      Where is Alex?

                                  SAYID
                    A recording... a mayday -- a French 
                    woman... Repeating on a loop... for 
                    more than sixteen years...

      He stops talking  cause it s still so hard to do anyway...  *
      and after a long beat, he hears from the darkness:*

                                  FIGURE (O.S.)

                    tues.  Il les a tues tous... 

      Sayid stares as the FIGURE rises, slowly steps toward him and  *
      into the light.  A WOMAN, early forties -- attractive despite 
      lacking make-up; swimming in a stained, stretched out sweater 
      that hangs off her shoulder.  Oh yeah, and she s holding a 
      serious looking RIFLE, looking somewhat dazed.

                                  FRENCH WOMAN
                          (almost to herself)
                    ... sixteen years...?*
                          (beat)*
                    Has it really been that long?

      SAYID stares, disbelievingly.  He s found her.  The French 
      Woman.  Alive.

                                  SAYID
                    You...

      She looks hard at him now, with mounting anger...

                                  FRENCH WOMAN
                    You just... happened to hear my

      She turns the rifle around in her hands.

                    You re one of them!

      ON HER as she SLAMS Sayid in the jaw with the rifle butt, 
      sending us into...

                                        ACT TWO


      With sunlight streaming in through the top of the space, we 
      finally get a look at the surroundings.  A dug-out hole in 
      the ground, dirt walls, mesh ceiling, a ladder leaning 
      against one of the walls.

      CLOSE ON THE FRENCH WOMAN, manically rifling through Sayid s 
      things on a desk: empty water bottle, fruit, a beat up copy 
      of the Koran, an extra shirt; flashlight - which she turns on 
      and off... then she comes to the envelope of photos, she 
      looks through them seeing pictures of the Woman in Sayid s 
      flashback.  She compares that with the single photo she found 
      -- the one Sayid had looked at in the teaser.  She turns it 
      over to see SOMETHING IS HANDWRITTEN on the back - in Arabic.

      PAN OVER to SAYID, his pant leg is ripped open, his thigh is 
      bandaged, and there s dried blood on his chin from the rifle 
      butt blow.  ON HIS FACE as he slowly comes to and, hearing 
      noises, looks over at... THE FRENCH WOMAN, her back to him, 
      going through his things, unaware he s awake.

      SAYID s eyes scan across the room.  It s a cluttered mess.  
      Full of items salvaged from a ship.  He catches sight of...

      HIS POV - A TORN, FADED JACKET hanging on a nail.  A FADED 
      NAME is stenciled on it: ROUSSEAU.

                                  SAYID
                          (reading softly, aloud)
                       Rousseau... 

      Startled, ROUSSEAU whips around, glaring suspiciously.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    How do you know my name?

                                  SAYID
                    I- I read it.  There.  On the *
                    jacket.*

      Rousseau just STARES at him.  An odd moment.  The two  *
      studying each other.  Then --*

                                  SAYID (CONT D)*
                    What is this place?

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Yes.  What is this place?

      She turns away from him again to examine more of his things.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"         (PINK)         10/5/04        17.

      ON SAYID, as he spots...

      HIS POV - A bank of four large batteries, wires from it 
      running to his cot.

                                  SAYID
                    Those batteries... They wouldn t 
                    produce enough power to transmit 
                    your distress call all these years.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    The transmission.  It broadcasts...  *
                    from somewhere else.*
                          (long beat)*
                    But they control it now...*

                                  SAYID
                          (squinting)
                     They...? 

                                  ROUSSEAU
                          (turning and eyeing him)
                    You.  And the others like you.

      ON SAYID as he gets it.  This woman is unbalanced, paranoid.

                                  SAYID
                    I... I don t know who you think I 
                    am.  But I told you... I m not--

                                  ROUSSEAU
                     Sayid. 

                                  SAYID
                    What?  How do you -- ?

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    My name is on a jacket.  Yours is 
                    on the envelope you carry.
                          (then)
                    Who is she?*

      Rousseau suddenly thrusts out the PHOTO in her hand.

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)*
                    The woman.  In the photographs.

                                  SAYID
                    That s -- She s no one...

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    You carry photos of her.  She means *

    I don t --
                                                  -- Tell me!

      Sayid looks at her a moment, seeing some desperate need in 
      her to know.  Then finally replies...

                                  SAYID
                    Nadia.  Her name is Nadia...



      CLOSE ON THE PHOTO OF NADIA, clipped with some other photos 
      of her, to an open folder (the papers all in Arabic.)

                    We can t tie her directly to the 
                      bombing...

      CUT OUT to see Sayid perusing the folder as Omar briefs him.

                                  OMAR (CONT D)
                    But we know where her sympathies 
                    lie.  She s a known associate of 
                    Kurdish and Shi ite insurgents.

                                  SAYID
                    You think she knows who *
                      orchestrated the bombing.*

                                  OMAR
                    That, my friend, is exactly what *
                    you will find out.*

      Omar gives Sayid a friendly slap on the shoulder and moves 
      off as Sayid opens the door and enters...


      ON NADIA, her hands tied in front of her, her feet shackled 
      to a chair in the middle of the room.  Her head is down.

      Sayid crosses to a desk in the corner and leans against it, 
      staring at his prisoner.

      She raises her head and looks at him, evenly.

                                  NADIA
                    Nobody calls me  Noor,  Sayid.  You

      Sayid stares at her a moment, stunned she knows his name.

                    What, you don t remember me?

      Sayid narrows his eyes, as it comes to him.

                                  SAYID
                    Nadia.

                                  NADIA
                    And your mother would tell my  *
                    mother... And I would be in such 
                    trouble --  Why must you pick on *
                    little Sayid?  and I d answer: 
                     Because he ignores me. *

                                  SAYID
                          (after a beat)
                    You had enough attention.  With *
                    your family s wealth.  And your... *
                    charms.

                                  NADIA
                    Such things matter little to *
                      children.*
                          (she looks at him warmly)
                    But then you were always older than 
                    your years, weren t you, Sayid?*

                                  SAYID
                    Not old enough to understand that *
                    being pushed in the mud was a sign *
                    of affection.*



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST       "Solitary"      (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/4/04     20.

      They look at each other for a moment, before Sayid realizes 
      his place, his responsibility.  He breaks his gaze...

                                  SAYID (CONT D)*
                    And now you re a traitor to your 
                    country.

      ON NADIA - disappointed with the turn in the conversation.

                                  NADIA
                          (bitterly)
                    Traitor... Saddam is the traitor.  
                    And you blindly serve him... like a *
                    dog.  He s betrayed his own people, 
                      brutalized... murdered them --

                                  SAYID
                          (cutting her off, sharply)
                    Tell me what you know about the  *
                    bombing in Najaf...

      She wearily shakes her head and he leans into her.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    You know who was behind it.  Tell 
                    me -- or I swear I will hurt you.

      She stares hard at him.

                                  NADIA
                    Oh, I know, Sayid.  This isn t my *
                    first interrogation by the 
                      Republican Guard...

      She reaches up with her bound hands and pulls away the open 
      collar of her shirt revealing BURN SCARS near her chest.

                                  NADIA (CONT D)
                    This is where they burned me with

                    the whereabouts of a man I d met *
                    only in passing...*

      She holds out her hands, revealing small SCARS on her palms. *

                                  NADIA (CONT D)
                    They pierced my hands with a *

                     friends.   The people you swear 
                    allegiance to.

      Sayid stares at her wounds, shaken.  After a beat...

                                  SAYID
                    If you were innocent, I am sorry.
                          (then; hardening)
                    But this bombing is another matter.

      She looks away, not answering.

                                  SAYID
                          (with less conviction)
                    I m going to hurt you.

      ON NADIA -- she looks up at him with resigned sadness...

                                  NADIA
                    I know.

      OFF SAYID, registering regret and confusion.


      CLOSE ON A ROUGH SKETCH in progress... A series of 
        interlocking poles attached to a braced funnel-type object.

      REVEAL MICHAEL, by the spring, sketching on a found writing 
      pad with a broken pencil.  A long SHAFT OF BAMBOO leaning 
      against him.  WALT is balancing on the edge of nearby rocks.

                                  WALT
                    I m bored...
                          (Michael doesn t reply)
                    Can I take Vincent down to the 
                    beach?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Uh... I ll take you later, man.  *
                    I m in the middle of something...*

      He tosses down the pad, grips the bamboo pole, and studies 
      the end of it.  He sticks the back end of the pencil into the 
      nub of the shaft, scratching at it...



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"         (PINK)         10/5/04        22.

                                  WALT
                    But there s nothing to do around--

                                  MICHAEL
                    Well you gotta figure out stuff to *

                    gotta find a way to entertain *

      OFF WALT, looking perturbed.  Meanwhile, nearby...

      CLOSE ON HANDS, digging in a pile of various salvaged items.  
      WIDEN to see it s HURLEY, on a mission.

                                  HURLEY
                          (to himself)
                    C mon, c mon... I know I saw it...

      Behind him, JACK enters from the infirmary cave.  He sees 
      Hurley in his flurry of activity.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                          (finding it)
                    Yes!

      He brings up a broken thermos and removes the chipped plastic 
      cut on top.  Jack steps toward him...

                                  JACK
                    Hurley...

      But Hurley doesn t hear him as he spots

      HIS POV - Michael resting the bamboo pole against a wall as 
      he picks up his pad to continue sketching.

                                  HURLEY
                    Whoa...

      He gets up and hurries over to Michael as Jack continues to 
      watch.  Hurley grabs the bamboo pole and looks at Michael.

                HURLEY (CONT D)MICHAEL
      Dude, can I borrow this?
                                                  -- Uh... I m trying to--
      -- Thanks, Man.

      Hurley starts heading out, Michael looking after him.

                    Hurley -- !

      ON HURLEY as a big grin crosses his face and he gives Jack an 
        enthusiastic  Wait ll you get a load of this  look.  Then 
      turns and continues out...

      OFF JACK, squinting, uncertainly, at him as he goes.


      ON ROUSSEAU sitting on the cot, next to SAYID, as she 
      redresses his thigh wound.

                                  SAYID
                    There s no need to keep me chained 
                    up.  I can t very well run off with 
                    a hole in my leg.

      Rousseau notices something else on his leg...

      HER POV - A SCAR just about his knee, below the bandage.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    You have a bullet wound.

                                  SAYID
                    I was a soldier.

                    And are you still?*

      She looks at him oddly.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    What s the Gulf War?*

                                  SAYID
                          (realizing)
                    A lot has happened in the world 
                    since you... left.

      Rousseau ponders this.  Of course it has.  Then -- She shakes 
      it off.  Abruptly crosses to the desk and picks up Nadia s 
      picture again, gazing at it.  Sayid studying her...

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Alex.  Who is he -- ?

                          (ignoring him)
                    Tell me more about her.  This 
                    woman.  Nadia...

                        SAYIDROUSSEAU
      What is it you want---- You love her, don t you?  
                                                  She s everything to you.

      Sayid stares a moment before answering, difficult to admit.

                                  SAYID
                    Yes.

      Almost gratified to hear it, she turns the photo over.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    This writing on the back.  What 
                    does it mean?

                                  SAYID
                    It s... it s nothing.

      She hardens, irrationally frustrated.  She gets up, PACES --

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Still lying.

                    do with --

                      ROUSSEAUSAYID
      Lies... Like this  plane 
      crash .  That you survived... 
      You claim there were others--
                                                  -- More than forty, yes --*
      -- Then why are you alone?

      He looks at her.  After a beat...

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    I left them.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Why?

                                  SAYID
                    There was a --
                          (beat)
                    I did something.

      Rousseau eyes him, innately understanding, somehow.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Something you re ashamed of.

      Sayid looks at her a moment, before offering a small nod.

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)
                    And Nadia?  You left her, too?

                                  SAYID
                    She wasn t on the plane.

      Rousseau ponders that, then putting the pieces together...

                      ROUSSEAUSAYID
      So you heard my transmission -
    - Came looking for me -- for -- I didn t know you were

                                                  -- She s dead!

      Rousseau reacts, stricken.

      ON ROUSSEAU, looking at him with empathy as her eyes well up.  
      She reaches over and brushes her hand against his cheek.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    I m so sorry.

      Then, inexplicably, she bends down and kisses him on the 
      lips.  Sayid reacts with wary surprise, as she sits up.

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)
                    I know what it s like to lose 
                    someone you...

      She stops.  Can t bring herself to say the word.  Pulls it 
      together.  Abruptly stands --

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)
                    I want to show you something.

      SAYID continues to eye Rousseau as she moves off frame...


      CLOSE ON MICHAEL S SKETCH, fully worked out now.  As we hear:

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    ...See, this junction here reroutes 
                    some of the spring s waterflow into 
                    a couple of suspended basins...

      WIDEN to see Jack holding the pad, Michael next to him, 
      pointing at the sketch as he explains:

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Pop in some holes, we got showers.   *
                    That way we keep our drinking water  *

                    This is... You drew this?

                                  MICHAEL
                    Yeah, well, I was an artist in a 
                    previous life.

                                  JACK
                    Thought you were in construction.

                                  MICHAEL
                    I am.  I mean, I was.
                          (beat)*
                    Long story.  Maybe I ll tell you *
                    when we ve got some time to kill.*

      Jack smiles, a genuine moment between these two men before -- *

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    Hey, Jack!*

      They look as CHARLIE runs in, winded...*

                                  JACK
                    What s up?*

                                    CHARLIE
                    Dunno...  Hurley s all worked-up 
                    over something.  Says... Says we 
                    need to come see it.

      JACK moves off, Michael and Charlie right behind him...


      CLOSE ON A BEAT-UP, ANTIQUE MUSIC BOX, with a waltzing couple 
      on top, frozen in place.

                                  ROUSSEAU (O.S.)
                      Beautiful, isn t it?

      PULL OUT to see it s held by ROUSSEAU, sitting next to SAYID.

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)
                    It was a gift from my love...

                                  SAYID
                          (fishing)
                    You mean Alex?

      Rousseau s eyes drift off for a moment.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Robert.
                          (remembering)
                    He bought this for me in Singapore.  
                    For our anniversary.  It would play 
                    Chopin.*

                                  SAYID
                    I d... like to hear it.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    It s broken.  Has been for... a *
                    long time.*
                          (bittersweet)
                    It was such a comfort for me... the 
                    first few years here.

      She gets lost in thought, Sayid eyeing her.  After a beat...

                                  SAYID
                    I could fix it for you.

      She turns and looks at him.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    I could take a look at it... if you *
                    free my hands...

      She continues to eye him strangely, perhaps suspiciously, 
      then gets up and crosses to the desk, her back to him.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"         (PINK)         10/5/04        30.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    I m fairly good with mechanical 
                    things... I ll need my hands to--

      CLOSE ON ROUSSEAU S HANDS as she places the box down, slides 
    a LEATHER POUCH to her and removes an old, rusty syringe and 
    a corked vial of liquid.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    What is written on the back of your 
                      photograph?  Did she write it, or 
                    did you?

      ON SAYID, getting NERVOUS -- unable to see her actions.

                                  SAYID
                    What... What are you doing?

      She draws the liquid into the syringe, then takes a piece of 
      sandpaper and rubs the rusty needle.  She turns to face him.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Perhaps you won t tell me because 
                    it causes too much pain.

      ON SAYID, seeing the old, weather-worn hypo in her hand, as  *
      she approaches him, continuing to sand the needle.

                                  SAYID
                          (fear rising)
                      Rousseau... You don t have to do 
                    that.  Whatever it is... I only 
                    offered to fix your music box.

      She crosses back to the cot and sits, looking at him, sadly.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Some things cannot be fixed, Sayid.

      And she jabs him with the needle...

                                                                        BLACK OUT.

                                      ACT THREE


      CLOSE ON SAYID, lying face down on top of the cluttered desk, 
      as his eyes flutter open.  Raising himself up... WE WIDEN to 
      see he s seated in a chair, his feet chained to the bottom of 
      the desk, he registers his hands are free...

      ON SAYID as his eyes clear, the first thing he sees before 
      him is the MUSIC BOX, and a plastic container with several 
      tools.  He also notices other items pushed to the side...

      HIS POV - various maps (some hand-drawn) and schematics, as 
      well as a compass and other items.

      SAYID is about to reach toward the maps when he hears:

                                  ROUSSEAU (O.S.)
                    I m sorry.  About the sedative...

      ON ROUSSEAU, sitting in a chair, her rifle across her lap.

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)
                    It was the only safe way for me to 
                    move you.

      Sayid looks at her, nods wearily.  Almost resigned to it. *

                                  ROUSSEAU (CONT D)
                    You offered to fix my music box... 
                    After all I ve done to you.  
                    Striking you, shocking you... Why?  
                    Why aren t you furious with me?

                                  SAYID
                    There s nothing you ve done to me I 
                    didn t already deserve.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Perhaps you aren t still a soldier 
                    after all.

      Sayid eyes her, then takes a screwdriver from the container.

                                  SAYID
                    Do you want me to fix your music 
                    box or don t you?

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Yes.  Please.

                                  SAYID
                    Then I want to know your name.   *
                    Your first name.*

      She seems almost surprised by this.  By his interest in her.  
      After a beat --

                    Danielle.  My name is Danielle.

      He begins dismantling the music box.  As he works...

                                  SAYID
                    And how did you come to be on this 
                    island, Danielle?

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    We were part of a science team.

                    Our vessel was three days out of 
                    Tahiti when our instruments 
                      malfunctioned...  It was night -- a

                          (beat)
                    The ship slammed into rocks, ran 
                      aground...  The hull breached 
                    beyond repair.  So we made camp... 
                    Dug out this temporary shelter...
                          (to herself, wryly)
                    Temporary...
                          (then)
                    Nearly two months we survived 
                    here... Two months before...

      ...She trails off.

                                  SAYID
                    Your distress signal... the message 
                    I heard.  You said:  It killed them 
                    all...   Did you mean that... thing 
                    in the jungle?*

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    What  thing ?*

      ON Sayid.  How could she not...?

                                  SAYID
                    Then what -- ?

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    What killed them?  Oh, what killed 
                    them?  Yes, I suppose that s the 
                    question, isn t it?

      And now, PUSHING IN, any semblance of lucidity we found with 
      Rousseau is replaced by something... well, ELSE --

                    You think I m insane.

      DARKNESS, then the CLANGING of a steel door being unlocked 
      and swung open.  Light streaming in reveals NADIA, sitting on 
    a metal bench, in the windowless cell, looking tired, thin.  
      She squints up into the harsh light outside the cell to see

      SAYID, entering, holding a rolled up jacket.

                                  SAYID
                    Good morning, Nadia.

                    Is it morning already?

      Their manner now is casual, a comfortable routine they ve 
      fallen into.  Sayid sits next to her and produces a small 
      loaf of bread, which she tears into, hungrily.

                                  SAYID
                    I m sorry... it s all I could find.  
                    I ll try to bring you fruit, later.

                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST       "Solitary"      (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/4/04     37.




      CLOSE ON SAYID S HANDS as he tightens a screw on the bottom 
      of the music box.  WIDEN ON HIM as he rights the box up, and  *
      turns the key on the side.  MUSIC - a CHOPIN WALTZ emanates 
      from it and the waltzing couple spin.

      ON ROUSSEAU, in her chair, as the sound reaches her.  She 
      looks at Sayid who smiles and holds out the box for her.  Her 
      face brightens as she stands and crosses to him to take it, 
      putting NADIA s PHOTO down on the edge of the desk.*

                                  SAYID
                    You see?  Some things can be fixed.

      ROUSSEAU marvels at the waltzing couple atop the box, 
      laughing.  As she does ANGLE ON SAYID S HAND, palming the  *
      small screwdriver.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Thank you.  Oh, god... Thank you so 
                    much.  How long it s been since *
                    I ve heard music.  It is...*
                          (overcome)*
                    Thank you.*

      As she sways, dancing... Sayid watches her.  Then --*

                                  SAYID*
                    Danielle -- please let me go.*

      She slowly stops swaying as his request reaches her brain -- *

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Go?  Go where?

                                  SAYID
                    Back to the people I told you 
                    about.*

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    The ones you left behind?
                          (beat)
                    But you said -- you said you had to 
                    leave them.  That you were ashamed.

    A moment.  He IS ashamed.  But then he looks up, a sense of 
      OWNERSHIP OF THAT SHAME in his eyes.  And more importantly, 
      the desire to absolve himself of it.

                                  SAYID
                    That is why I have to go back.

      Rousseau is getting UPSET.  Doesn t like this AT ALL --

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    -- You can t.  You have to stay.  
                    It s not safe...

                                  SAYID
                    Not safe?  What s not --

                      ROUSSEAUSAYID
      You need me.  You can t 
      leave.-- Danielle, please --

      Suddenly, the ROAR of a large animal -- Bear?  Tiger?  
      Mammoth? -- is heard from outside, close by.  Most definitely 
      NOT our monster.  Their heads whip toward it.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    What -- What was --

      And BANG: wordlessly, ROUSSEAU s on the move... She quickly  *
      puts the music box down, sweeps the tools into the plastic 
      container and crosses with it to a cabinet in the corner.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

      She places the container out of the way and grabs her rifle. *

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    If we re lucky, it s one of the 
                    bears.*

                                  SAYID*
                    If we re lucky?*

                                  ROUSSEAU*
                    Dinner.*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"         (PINK)         10/5/04        41.
      (CONT'D) (2)2424


      She opens the cabinet revealing ANOTHER RIFLE, A HANDGUN, THE 
      MACHETE and BOXES OF AMMO.  She drapes an AMMO BELT across 
      her shoulder, shoves the pistol into her waistband, the 
      machete through a loop on the belt.  She s a fucking warrior. *

                                  SAYID
                    Free me -- so I can come with you.  *
                    Help you --

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    No.  You ll leave me -- Run off.  
                    You have to stay --*

      Armed to the teeth, she moves to the ladder.

                                  SAYID
                    Danielle, listen to me... It might 
                    be that thing out there.  The *
                    monster...

      She stops climbing and looks back at him, with a tender, 
      though almost patronizing look.

                                  ROUSSEAU
                    Poor Sayid... There are no such 
                    things as monsters.

      She climbs to the top, pushes up the mesh and exits.  Sayid s 
      eyes drift back to the cabinet, staring --

      HIS POV - SLOW PUSH IN on the OTHER RIFLE she left behind.  
      PUSH IN on Sayid, weighing what has to be done, as we hear:

                                  OMAR (PRE-LAP)
                    You have to execute her...


      ON SAYID, confused.

                                  SAYID
                    What --?

      WIDEN to see OMAR, reiterating the order.

                                  OMAR
                    The Jaseem woman has given us 
                    nothing.  This will be a message to 
                    others who will not talk --

                                  SAYID
                    I just need more time with her --

      And Omar says this like it s the most ordinary thing in the  *
      world to say --*

                                  OMAR
                    You ve had more than a month.  You *
                    failed, Sayid.  Now take her  *
                    outside and shoot her.
                          (off Sayid s hesitation)
                    Is this a problem?*

                                  SAYID
                    No.  It is not a problem.*

      OMAR nods and crosses off, leaving SAYID as the pain of his  *
      duty registers on his face.


      DARKNESS, again.  Then the noise of the door being unbolted 
      and swinging open.  Light falling onto NADIA, who peers up at *

      SAYID, in the doorway, holding something.

                                  NADIA
                    What did you bring me today --?

      Sayid takes a step in and Nadia sees an ARMED GUARD standing 
      next to him.  Before she can say another word...

      SAYID tosses a BLACK HOOD to her.

                                  SAYID
                    Put it on.

      NADIA stares at the hood, then looks back to Sayid.

                                  NADIA
                    Are you going to hurt me, Sayid?*

      CLOSE ON SAYID, stoic, but his eyes filled with regret.  And  *
      after a long, PAINFUL beat...*

      He nods.*

                                                                        BLACK OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR


      CLOSE ON A SMALL SCREWDRIVER, being worked around inside a 
      PADLOCK, when we hear a -- CLICK --

      WIDEN as SAYID pulls the lock open and frees his second leg, 
      the first already unshackled.  With effort, he pushes himself 
      up to a standing position, and makes his way to the cabinet.

      He takes the rifle, finds a box of ammo, then opens the gun 
      up to load...*

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH: *


      SAYID limps over to the ladder when something occurs to him.   *
      He turns back to the desk and hurriedly moves to it-- *

      He grabs his backpack, then the maps, schematics, compass and  *
      other items, shoving them all into his bag.  Then, he hoists  *
      the bag over his shoulder and struggles up the ladder...

      LOW ANGLE - As he moves the mesh and climbs out... TILT DOWN 
      to see NADIA S PHOTO lying on the ground where it has 
      fallen... Forgotten.


      TRACKING WITH SAYID as he leads the ARMED GUARD and HOODED 
      NADIA, her hands shackled, down a corridor.  As they come to 
    a connecting hallway, he halts and turns to the Guard.

                                  SAYID
                    I ll take it from here.

      They Guard eyes him for a beat, then offers a salute.  Sayid 
      returns it and the Guard goes.  Sayid takes Nadia s arm and 
      marches her down the other corridor.

      They eventually reach a steel door, Sayid stops again, and 
      checks the coast.  No one s around.  He reaches up and pulls 
      the hood off Nadia, who flinches, squinting from the light.

                                  NADIA
                    What -- What s happening?

      Sayid gets keys from his pocket and unlocks her restraints.

                                  NADIA (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

                                  SAYID
                    Forty meters out this door, there s *
                    a supply truck that will be leaving 
                    shortly.  They don t check them on 
                    the way out, only coming in... Get 
                    inside, cover yourself any way you 
                    can... They won t reach the city 
                    for thirty minutes... plenty of 
                    time for you to jump out and hide --

      Nadia REALIZES what this means.  Overwhelmed.  Then -- *

                                  NADIA
                    Come with me.*

                                  SAYID
                    -- I can t.  Desertion... they *
                    would kill my family.  I m sorry... *
                    I don t have your courage.

                                  NADIA
                    You have more than you know.*

    A MOMENT.  Under any other circumstance, it might lead to a  *
      kiss.  But then --*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST       "Solitary"      (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/4/04     47.

      NADIA SEES IT - HER PHOTO, protruding from the top of Sayid s  *
      shirt pocket.  A pen is clipped there, as well.  She reaches  *
      up and pulls out the photo.*

                                  SAYID*
                    What are you --?*

      She says nothing as she takes his pen, writes something on *
      the back of her photo. Sayid anxiously looks around --*

                                  SAYID (CONT D)*
                    Nadia... Please... You have to go.

                    Sayid!

      OMAR approaches, a look of confusion of his face.

                                  OMAR (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

      CLOSE ON SAYID, his mind reeling, trying to figure out what 
      possible answer he could give.

      ON OMAR, understanding now all too well what Sayid s doing.  
      His hand reaches down to his sidearm.  ON SAYID, seeing that. *

                                  SAYID
                          (quietly)
                    Omar... Don t --

                                  OMAR
                    Guar--!

      Sayid quickly draws his pistol and SHOOTS.

      OMAR is blasted back to the wall and slumps down dead.  ON  *
      SAYID, staring in shock.  Nadia behind him...

                                  NADIA
                    Sayid -- You have to come with me 
                    now.  They ll kill you...*

                                  SAYID*
                    No.  You escaped, stole my gun and 
                    shot him... And then you shot me.

                                  NADIA
                    What -- ?

      And Sayid suddenly SHOOTS HIMSELF in the leg.  He stumbles to  *
      the floor, enduring the pain.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST        "Solitary"         (PINK)         10/5/04        48.

                    Sayid!

      He peers up at her and holds out the gun.

                                  SAYID
                    Take it.
                          (off her hesitation)
                    Please, Nadia...

        Reluctantly, she takes the gun from his hand, replacing it 
      with her photo.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Now go!  GO!!

      Without another word, she turns and runs out the door.

      ON SAYID, hearing distant voices shouting:  What was that?  
       Gunfire --   He looks at Nadia s photo, then turns it over.  
      And as he reads what she wrote --
