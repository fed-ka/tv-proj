  FADE IN:


  INT. ND SPACE - NIGHT

  HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT of SPARTACUS laying on an examination 
  table, a shaft of light illuminating him.  Unconscious. 
  Bruises and scrapes from his gladiator battle tattoo his 
  skin, but his lacerations have been crudely stitched.  We 
  DRIFT DOWN, coming to rest TIGHT ON SPARTACUS.

  A DIRTY HAND

  reaches out from the darkness and touches Spartacus  face. 
  His eyes SNAP OPEN as he grabs it and yanks the offender 
  into the light, revealing

  SURA,

  his wife.  Dirty and bloodied from her ordeal.  His heart 
  soars.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sura...

  He pulls her into a desperate kiss.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        When the Romans... I thought I d 
                        never...

                                        SURA
                        Shhh.

  She kisses him, tears streaking her cheek.

                                          SURA(cont'd)
                        I will always be with you.  The 
                        gods themselves could not keep me 
                        from your side.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would kill them all for trying

  His lips find hers.  The kiss turns passionate as he pulls 
  her on top of him.  His hand slides up her thigh to reveal 
  THE PURPLE BINDING

  he tied there before he left for the war.  Sura eases down, 
  moving him inside her.  Their bodies writhe.  Breath 
  quickens.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.
  CONTINUED:

  SURA GASPS,

  nearing release.  Her back arches and her head whips back. 
  But instead of a moan of ecstasy, a sudden

  SCREAM OF PAIN

  erupts from her throat, BLOOD gushing from her mouth and 
  SPLATTERING Spartacus in the face.  SMASH TO --


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus JOLTS AWAKE.  Shackled to a table.  Wounds 
  treated. Sura is gone.  A fleeting dream.

  BATIATUS

  glances over, conferring with the MEDICUS, a bare-chested, 
  rotund man with a great unkempt beard.  Batiatus sniffs, not 
  caring for Spartacus  scent.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Medicus)(
                        Have him taken to the baths.  But 
                        first attend to all that fucking 
                        hair.

  Batiatus sweeps out.  The Medicus picks up a RAZOR SHARP 
  BLADE.  He nods to the GUARDS, who hold Spartacus down.  He 
  struggles as the Medicus descends on him and roughly begins 
  slicing off his hair.  A thick hunk of his mane falls to the 
  ground, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Batiatus strides across the Mess Hall, which is empty except 
  for a few SLAVES preparing porridge. He glances out into

  THE TRAINING SQUARE

  where 50 of his hardened GLADIATORS are finishing up another 
  day of punishing training. DOCTORE coils his whip as they 
  break off for food and the baths.

  A GUARD

  intercepts Batiatus with a SCROLL.

                                        GUARD
                        Dominus.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.
  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus takes it with a frown -- which brightens as he 
  quickly scans the scroll.  He hustles for the GATE 
  separating the Mess Hall from the stairs leading up to the 
  villa. ANOTHER GUARD opens it for him, closing it as he 
  disappears up the stairs.

  GLADIATORS

  move into the Mess Hall, laughing and shoving, their bodies 
  WIPING US TO --


  INT. VILLA - NIGHT

  Batiatus comes through the gate separating the ludus from 
  the villa.  TWO GUARDS lock it behind him as he moves up the 
  stairs and through his villa, a once grand monument now 
  fading into disrepair.  He reaches

  THE ATRIUM

  where his wife LUCRETIA stands frowning into a dried up pool 
  in the center of the room.  NAEVIA, her exotic young body 
  slave, is at her side.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The pool is dry.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We need rain.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Money would also see it filled.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We need that, too.

  He continues on through the villa.  Lucretia follows with 
  Naevia in tow

                                        LUCRETIA
                        How fares your new pet?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He breathes.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        His cost was enough to fill our 
                        pool for a month.  You paid beyond 
                        the asking.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I paid the man s worth, Lucretia.                                                                                    4.


  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS  VILLA - CONTINUOUS

  Batiatus and Lucretia enter.  Naevia follows, joining a 
  handful of other ATTENDING SLAVES.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Spartacus is a corpse yet walking.  
                        How long before he takes his place 
                      in the grave, dragging your 
                        investment with him?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Not before he serves his purpose.

  Batiatus produces a small SCROLL from his robes.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        From Legatus Claudius Glaber.

  That gets her attention.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        His intentions?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Nudging toward my desires.

  He hands her the scroll.  She unravels it, reads in 
  surprise.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        He s coming here?

                                        BATIATUS
                      To the ludus of Quintus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Two days hence...
                                  glancing up)(
                        The reason for his visit is absent.

  Batiatus begins undressing with the help of the slaves. 
  Lucretia follows suit, with Naevia attending.

                                        BATIATUS
                      In words, but the meaning shines.  
                      He comes to thank me.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        For what?  Paying too much for the 
                        Thracian?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus defied Glaber s attempt 
                      at execution in the arena.  The 
                        crowd demanded his freedom, an 
                          embarrassment to the Legatus.  I 
                        offered alternative, by purchasing 
                        him.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      At inflated worth.

                                        BATIATUS
                      If Spartacus survives to swear the 
                        oath, the arena will be his tomb as 
                        first intended.  If not, his 
                        passing becomes an early delight 
                        for the Legatus.

  Lucretia smiles as she stretches out on the bed.  Naked. 
  Powerful in her sexuality.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Desires well nudged.

                                        BATIATUS
                        There s yet more stroking needed.

  Batiatus glances down at his nakedness with a frown. 
  Lucretia signals a FEMALE SLAVE to prepare Batiatus for 
  lovemaking.  The Slave gets on her knees,  fluffing  him.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        A simple gesture of gratitude from 
                        him falls short.  Patronage is the 
                        reward we seek.  Nothing short of 
                        it.

  Lucretia s hand drops between her legs, preparing herself 
  for her husband.  Naevia fans her.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The Legatus as patron...

                                        BATIATUS
                        His coins... will fill our pool to 
                        overflowing.

  Batiatus grips the Slave Girl s head, thrusting harder.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        We ll need to prepare a feast.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        With wine.  And water.  Lots of 
                        water.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Just enough... to wet the tongue.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I ll sacrifice a bull.  To appease 
                        the gods in our venture.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Perhaps something smaller...?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        A ram, then.

  Batiatus pushes the Slave Girl away, climbs into bed.

                                        BATIATUS
                      To the gods.  May they bless us 
                        with good fortune...

  Batiatus GRUNTS as he slides into Lucretia.  Naevia s FAN 
  WIPES US TO --


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Naked Gladiators laugh and bathe, or, more accurately, 
  scrape.  Water is in scarce supply due to the drought, the 
  bath sitting empty.  Instead olive oil is applied to the 
  Gladiators, then scraped off removing dirt and blood.

  SPARTACUS,

  hair cut short and beard hacked to the stubble, is thrust 
  into the room by two GUARDS.  The room goes silent as 
  Spartacus stumbles to the floor.

  CRIXUS,

  a hard motherfucking Gaul, stares down at Spartacus.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Lick my hole.  The pig-fucker s 
                        still alive.

  The Gladiators laugh.  BARCA, a brute of a man carved from 
  solid granite, shrugs off PIETROS, a slim, pretty slave 
  attending him.

                                        BARCA
                        This is the one?

                        The Spartacus everyone s been

                      No one gives shit to who you were,

                        I give no shit to who he is.

  More laughter.  Spartacus eyes the scene, confused.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What is this place?

  ASHUR, a smaller man with a crippled leg and eyes that 
  radiate a calculating charm, chuckles.

                                        ASHUR
                        The afterlife, friend.  Or least 
                        outside its rusted gates.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You re now the honored guest of 
                        Batiatus, master of the greatest 
                        ludus in Capua.

  Spartacus stares in confusion.

                        Ludus?

  They snicker at his ignorance.

                                        CRIXUS
                        A school of training.  Where men 
                        are forged into gods, blood their 
                        ambrosia, the arena their 
                        mountaintop!

  Shouts of pride assault Spartacus.  His face darkens, the 
  explanation a sour taste upon his tongue.

                        The truest of brotherhoods!

                                        BARCA
                        Live the next few days, you and the 
                        other recruits will count yourself 
                        among us.  And bare our mark.

  Barca indicates a BRAND seared into his shoulder.  The mark 
  of Batiatus  fighters.  Every Gladiator at the ludus carries 
  the same.

                                        CRIXUS
                      In the mean, can we fetch you 
                        anything? Wine?  Food?  Scented 
                        oils for your feet?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Water.

  More snickers all around.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Slow this one, isn t he?

                                        BARCA
                        What do you expect from a Thracian?
                                  sniffs)(
                        Smells like fresh shit.

                                        CRIXUS
                        They all do.  Except for their 
                        women. They smell like piss and 
                        shit.

  Spartacus steps into the light.  More dead than alive.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What are you, then?

                                        CRIXUS
                        A Gaul, little man, the greatest of 
                      my kind.  Crixus, the Undefeated!

  The men laugh and cheer.  Spartacus half smiles, nods.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        A Gaul.  That explains why you 
                        smell like a woman.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    9.
  CONTINUED:

  The laughter dies out.  A tense beat, broken by a cool smile 
  bending Crixus  lips.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Tend to your wounds.  Eat.  Rest.  
                        When you ve gained your strength, 
                        we ll revisit that remark.

  Crixus moves off.  Barca follows with Pietros in tow.  The 
  men return to their conversations and laughter.

  TIGHT ON SPARTACUS  EYES,

  glaring in defiance.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL he s now standing 
  in --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The harsh sun of Capua blazes in the sky.  Spartacus and SIX 
  RECRUITS are lined up for inspection in the center of the 
  square, bare chests glistening in the heat.  Spartacus finds 
  himself next to VARRO,

  a handsome young slab of beef.  Varro stands out among the 
  slave recruits, intelligence and pride shining in his eyes.

  A HUNDRED MEN

  ring the square.  Hard.  Cruel.  Gladiators.  They laugh and 
  point, indicating the obvious shortcomings of the Recruits.

                                        ASHUR
                        Pile of shit.  Not a cock among 
                        them.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You should join them, then, you 
                        little cunt.

  Barca laughs.  Ashur chuckles good-naturedly, but we see in 
  his eyes a venom for Crixus.

  DOCTORE,

  the trainer, strides up with whip in hand.  Powerful and 
  commanding, the harsh Capuan sun deepening the VALLEY OF 
  SCARS marring half his imposing face. The Gladiators 
    respectfully quiet.  Doctore pins the Recruits with an iron 
  gaze.

                                          DOCTORE
                        What is beneath your feet?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.
  CONTINUED:

  The Recruits glance down in confusion at the sand.  All 
  except Spartacus, who holds his gaze on Doctore.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Answer!  What is beneath your feet?

  KERZA (Recruit #1), thuggish and not overly bright, 
  tentatively replies.

                                        KERZA
                        Sand?

  The Gladiators chuckle, knowing what s coming.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Crixus!  What is beneath your feet?

                                        CRIXUS
                        Sacred ground, Doctore!  Watered 
                        with tears of blood!

                                          DOCTORE
                                to Recruits)(
                        Your tears.  Your blood.  Your 
                        pathetic lives, forged into 
                        something of worth.  Turn your eyes 
                        from your gods and fix them upon 
                        me.  Listen.  Learn.  And perhaps, 
                        live.  As gladiators.  Now, attend 
                        your master!

  Doctore indicates

  THE BALCONY

  where Batiatus now stands with Lucretia, Naevia, and a few 
  attending slaves.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have been blessed!  Each and 
                        every one of you, to find 
                        yourselves here, in the ludus of 
                        Quintus Lentulus Batiatus! Finest 
                        purveyor of gladiators in all the 
                        Republic!

  The Gladiators cheer and laugh, proud of the heritage.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Prove yourself, in the hard days to 
                        follow.  Prove yourself more than a 
                        common slave.  Prove yourself more 
                        than a man.  Fail, and die.  Either

                      to the mines to perish forgotten by 
                        love or history.  Succeed, and 
                        stand proud among my titans!

  The Gladiators roar their approval.  Spartacus takes them in 
  with contempt and hatred.  Batiatus motions for Doctore to 
  continue.  Doctore CRACKS HIS WHIP, silencing the uproar.  
  He surveys the Recruits with dissatisfaction.

                                          DOCTORE
                        A Gladiator does not fear death.  
                      He embraces it.  Caresses it.  
                        Fucks it.

  The Gladiators chuckle.  Kerza the Recruit joins in.  
  Doctore zeroes in on him.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Each time he enters the arena, he 
                        slips his cock into the mouth of 
                        the beast.  And prays to thrust 
                        home before the jaws snap shut.

  Doctore whacks Kerza in the crotch with his coiled whip. 
  Kerza grunts, dropping to the ground.  The Gladiators laugh, 
  as does Batiatus on the balcony, enjoying the show.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        None of you stray dogs would last a 
                        fleeting moment.  Except for one...

  His eyes fall on Spartacus.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        This sad, battered Thracian stood 
                        against four in the arena.  
                        Condemned to die, given nothing but 
                        a sword to wager his life upon.  
                        They came at him!

  We SMASH to Spartacus in the arena, fighting the four 
  Gladiators from episode 101 (conveniently already shot).


  EXT. ARENA - CAPUA - DAY (FLASHBACK) - [ALREADY SHOT]

  Spartacus is surrounded by the four Gladiators: Murmillo, 
  Retiarius, Secutor, and Hoplomachus. The Hoplomachus thrusts 
  his spear out. Spartacus SNAPS his head out of the way, 
  SWEAT erupting from the force.                                                                                    12.

  EXT. ARENA - CAPUA - DAY (FLASHBACK) - [ALREADY SHOT]

  Quick FLASHES as the Gladiators assault Spartacus. * The 
  Retiarius sweeps in with his net, catching Spartacus  foot 
  and yanking him to the ground. * The Hoplomachus swings his 
  spear, the arc of the tip OPENING A GASH across The 
  Thracian s back. * The Murmillo slams into Spartacus with 
  his shield, sending him flying back in a spray of blood.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

                                          DOCTORE
                        The day was lost. But not for the 
                        Thracian! He refused Death! Fate! 
                        The gods themselves!

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  EXT. ARENA - CAPUA - DAY - [ALREADY SHOT]

  Quick FLASHES of Spartacus  bloody victory against his four 
  opponents. * Spartacus rips the side of the Murmillo open in 
  a SPRAY OF BLOOD and INTERNAL ORGANS. * Spartacus SEVERS THE 
  LEGS out from under the Retiarius. * Spartacus slams his 
  sword up through the head of the Secutor.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The Recruits gawk at Spartacus. Varro grins in admiration.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Gaze at this man! Study him. And 
                        realize... he is nothing.

  Spartacus locks eyes with Doctore.

                        A coward. A deserter from the 
                        Auxiliary. A frightened little 
                        rabbit.

  Kerza snickers, favoring his throbbing crotch.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

                        And his victory in the arena? As 
                        hollow as his courage. He fought 
                        against the ill-trained men of 
                        Solonius, your master s rival.

  Doctore spits in disgust. Batiatus laughs in agreement.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A mockery! Had Spartacus entered 
                        the arena with any Gladiator among 
                        these ranks, his head would have 
                        left well in advance of his body!

  The Gladiators laugh, cheering their agreement. Spartacus 
  glances up at Batiatus. Challenging. Defiant.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The Thracian disagrees. A 
                          demonstration, perhaps?

  Batiatus waves his permission.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Crixus!

  Crixus grins, taking his place front and center. He s going 
  to enjoy this. Doctore barks an order to Pietros.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Practice swords.

  Pietros grabs two WOODEN SWORDS from a rack of WEAPONS, 
  hustles over. He gives one to Crixus, the other to Doctore. 
  Doctore tosses the sword at Spartacus  feet.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Prove us wrong, Spartacus.

  Spartacus glares, then looks away. Doctore uncoils his whip.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Pick it up.

  Spartacus ignores him.

                        Spartacus!

  Doctore rears back with his whip. TIME SLOWS as the leather 
  CONTRAILS through the air. TIME RESUMES as Spartacus throws 
  his arm up at the last second -- not to defend himself, but 
  to catch it as it snaps around his wrist. BLOOD RISES

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.
  CONTINUED:

  as the leather digs into Spartacus  flesh. Veins start from 
  muscles. Spartacus glares at Doctore.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        That is not my name.

                        Your name -- your life -- is what 
                      we decide.

  Doctore suddenly yanks the whip. TIME SLOWS as Spartacus is 
  lifted from his feet. TIME RESUMES, crashing Spartacus to 
  the sand by the wooden sword.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Pick it up.

  A beat. Spartacus stands, kicking the practice sword aside 
  in defiance. Varro frowns. Not a smart move. Doctore snorts.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Perhaps the coward requires 
                        advantage to still his trembling 
                        knees.
                                to Pietros)(
                        Gladius!

  Pietros grabs a REAL SWORD from the rack, hands it to 
  Doctore. Doctore tosses it to land several lengths in front 
  of Spartacus. He glances at it... and looks away. Doctore 
  laughs in disappointment, turns to Batiatus on the balcony.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        I can do nothing with this one. 
                        Send him to the mines --

  Spartacus suddenly dives. TIME SLOWS and ACCELERATES as he 
  snatches the gladius up, rolls to his feet, and swings at 
  Doctore.

  CRIXUS INTERCEPTS,

  deflecting the blow with his practice sword. Crixus grins.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Feeling rested, are we?

  Crixus kicks him back. Spartacus stumbles, nearly loses his 
  footing. He regains it just as Crixus attacks. He s a marvel 
  of speed and grace, every movement a brutal poem. Doctore 
  circles, pointing out Spartacus  deficiencies for the 
  recruits.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

                      An attack must be grounded in 
                        proper footing. He attempts to 
                        press before regaining balance.

  Spartacus snarls, swinging savagely. Against a normal 
  opponent the tactic would ensure victory. Crixus avoids each 
  blow, the gladius WHISTLING inches from his flesh.

  CRIXUS SIDESTEPS,

  spinning to catch Spartacus in the back of the knee. 
  Spartacus goes down with a grunt of pain. The Gladiators 
  roar. Crixus laughs, enjoying the lesson.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Allow advantage to your back... and 
                        you are dead.

  Spartacus staggers to his feet and attacks. He drives Crixus 
  back with his fury. Crixus catches Spartacus  sword arm in 
  mid blow with his free hand, Spartacus the same. A test of 
  strength ensues, muscles straining in the sun.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Become entangled with a more 
                        powerful opponent...

  Crixus grins, then TOSSES Spartacus. Spartacus lands hard, 
  eats sand.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        ...and you are dead.

  Spartacus grits his teeth in rage. He rolls to his feet and 
  HURLS his sword.

  LUCRETIA

  gasps as TIME SLOWS, the blade rotating through the air at 
  Crixus.

  CRIXUS

  catches a GLINT OF SUNLIGHT reflecting from the blade out of 
  the corner of his eye. TIME RESUMES as he whirls around and

  DEFLECTS THE GLADIUS

  with his sword, sending the deadly projectile SLAMMING into 
  the skull of RECRUIT #2 standing next to Varro. He crumples 
  in a spray of blood, dead before he hits the sand. Spartacus 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                        you are dead. Again.

  The Gladiators howl. Spartacus, enraged, rushes Crixus. 
  Crixus spins and cracks Spartacus in the back of the head, 
  sending him crashing once more to the sand. Crixus plants a 
  foot on Spartacus  back, pinning him face down. Spartacus 
  struggles, can t break free.

  Doctore holds up his index and middle finger, slightly bent.

                        Beg for your life, little rabbit.

  Spartacus glares, face bloodied and bruised. Spartacus  hand 
  stirs -- only to clench into a defiant fist. Doctore grunts 
  in disgust.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)

  Crixus rears back with the wooden sword and --

                        Crixus!

  Crixus pauses, looking up. Batiatus waves him off. Crixus 
  bows slightly in deference and respect, stepping away from 
  Spartacus.

                                        CRIXUS

  Doctore nods in submission. He motions to Varro and Kerza to 
  help Spartacus up. He shakes them off, glaring at Doctore as 
  he resumes his place in line.

  THE BALCONY

  Lucretia eyes Batiatus, anger rising in her cheeks.

                        Glaber visits tomorrow. His 
                        intention towards the Thracian may 
                        include blood. Until his patronage 
                      is secured, I ll keep it warm and 
                        flowing.

  He glances up at the blazing sun.

  He moves off into the shade of his villa. Lucretia lingers, 
  her eyes falling on

  CRIXUS

  in the square below. He catches the look, his eyes 
  twinkling. She barely suppresses a lustful smile. Definitely 
  more to this relationship than simple master and slave.

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  A SERIES OF SHOTS as Spartacus, Varro, and the Recruits are

  cracks his whip.  Blows are exchanged with wooden swords and 
  shields.

  INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  TIGHT ON A DIRTY BOWL

  containing oily fish sauce and a stale crust of bread. 
  Accompanied by a small cup with a few swallows of water. 
  PULL BACK as they re handed to

  VARRO

  by a decrepit SLAVE COOK.  Varro grimaces at the 
    unappetizing meal as he navigates the mess hall.

  CRIXUS AND BARCA

  command one of the few rough-hewn tables, the remainder 
  crowded by the senior Gladiators.

  THE EXHAUSTED RECRUITS

  and lesser men are relegated to the dusty ground.  Varro 
  sidesteps Kerza and RECRUIT #4, who are fighting over some 
  imagined slight.  Varro settles next to

  SPARTACUS

  who eats by himself, lost in thoughts of vengeance and 
  escape.

                                        VARRO

                        the lot of them.

  Spartacus responds absently, not looking at Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Are we the better?

                                        VARRO

                        difference, Thracian.  Above this 
                        unfortunate collection.

                        consigned by his own hand.

  That gets Spartacus  attention.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Why would a man willingly condemn 
                        himself to this?

                        A small matter of debt, grown 
                        large.  The repaying of it proves 
                        difficult.  If the concern was only 
                      to me...

  Guilt and regret seize Varro s heart.  Spartacus knows the 
  look well.

                        Fight well, and you re rewarded 
                        with coin.  Enough even to balance

                        You are a fool.

  Varro smiles, feeling the truth of the remark.

  Batiatus moves through the ludus.  Doctore follows.

                        One or two show promise.  But the 
                        rest... My own mother would have 
                        them in the arena.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You have no mother.  You were 
                        belched from the cunt of the 
                        underworld.  That s why I favor 
                        you.

                        Better, yes!  Within the reach of 
                      my purse, no!  You stand 
                        questioning and complaining instead 
                      of setting yourself to the task!

  Doctore realizes he s overstepped, politely lowers his eyes.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I press to honor you, Batiatus.  
                        And this ludus.

  Batiatus calms.

                        Legatus Glaber visits tomorrow.  
                        With him the hope of renewed 
                        fortunes.  In the mean, these men 
                        are all the straw afforded.  Bake 
                        them into brick, or crumble them to 
                        the mines.

  Doctore bows slightly, exits.  Batiatus heads into --                                                                                    21.


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - CONTINUOUS

  A cluttered space in desperate need of organizing.  A desk 
  occupies a place of prominence, piled high with loose papers 
  and books.  OVIDIUS, an unassuming man in his early 30s, 
  stands waiting.  Batiatus brightens into salesman mood.

                                        BATIATUS

                      Or settle the debt as it stands.

  Batiatus forces a smile.

                        The day after.

  Ovidius bows, exits.  Batiatus seethes, his fist crushing 
  the bill in his hand as he follows, WIPING US TO:                                                                                    22.


  INT. BARRACKS - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus, Varro, Kerza, and the other Recruits sprawl on 
  the floor, exhausted.  Shackles bind their wrists and ankles 
  for the night.

                                        KERZA
                        I could have taken him.

                        The shit would be running down your 
                        leg.

  The Recruits chuckle.  All except Spartacus, who stares off 
  at nothing.  Kerza tosses a sneer in his direction.

                                        KERZA
                        Wouldn t have ended up on my belly, 
                        fucked like a dog.

                                        VARRO
                        Without training, the Gaul would 
                        have bested any of us, Kerza.  
                        Speaking otherwise is bloated air.

  Recruit #4 darkens with worry, showing the strain of the 
  ordeal.

                        I pray not to face Crixus in the 
                        final test.

                                        KERZA
                        Nothing to worry.  You ll never 
                        make it that far, cock hole.

                        All can make it to the test.  And 
                        beyond.

  Kerza snorts in contempt.

                        our chances?

  A beat.  The answer is a simple statement, tinged with a 
  hint of sadness.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You re all going to die.

  He closes his eyes to sleep.  CLANG!  The cell door swings 
  open.  Doctore and the Guards stand in the doorway.

  Spartacus rises, exhausted but his eyes cold steel.  The 
  motion of his body WIPES US TO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  The MOON bathes the square in silver.  Even at night, the 
  temperature is sweltering.

  SPARTACUS

  and the Recruits slowly plod through the sand, marching a 
    never-ending circle as they carry HEAVY LOG SECTIONS across 
  their shoulders.  Spartacus slows, legs straining and sweat 
  starting from slick, trembling muscles.

  DOCTORE S WHIP LASHES OUT,

  raising a bloody welt across Spartacus  back.

                                          DOCTORE

  worry etching his face.

  LUCRETIA

  roused from slumber.

  Her hand strokes the back of his head.  A familiar gesture 
  of love and affection.  He smiles absently, taking strength 
  from it.

                                        BATIATUS

  Spartacus and the Recruits still march with the logs across 
  their backs.  Muscles strain.  Sweat drips.  Doctore yells 
  out.

  works his shoulder, grimacing in pain.

                      to see the test?

  Varro casts a frown at Kerza and the remaining Recruits. 
  Half dead from the night s exertion.

                        Very little, by the look of them.

  The thought is a bitter thing in Spartacus  mouth.

                        The Roman way.  Lives for coins.

                        Some deserving more than others.  
                        I ve heard a certain Thracian was 
                        quite the price.

  Spartacus darkens with thoughts of revenge.

                        I would see the cost rise higher 
                        still.

  The Recruits reach the serving table where the Slave Cook 
  ladles PORRIDGE.  Barca appears next to him, beaming a 
  welcome to the exhausted Recruits.

                        I recall the hardship of The March,

  Barca shoves the porridge pot, spilling the contents on the 
  dirty ground.  Crixus and the other Gladiators roar.

  KERZA AND SEVERAL RECRUITS

  drop to the ground, desperately scooping porridge and sand 
  into their mouths.  Spartacus glances at Doctore, who views 
  the scene with disinterest.

                                          SPARTACUS

  Varro indicates the sad state of the once opulent ludus.

                        Look about.  The shit matters.

                                        VARRO
                        Value isn t worth.  He spends what 
                      he can, gambling to find another 
                        Crixus to excite the crowds and 
                        fill his empty purse.

  Varro works his neck, grunting in exhaustion.

  He moves off into the shade, stretches out.  Spartacus casts 
  a glance back to Doctore, but the man is gone.  Ashur 
  appears, a smile creasing his face.

                                        ASHUR
                        Apologies for the porridge.  Barca 
                        finds the jest amusing.  Least he 
                        didn t piss in it this time.  Adds 
                      an unpleasant bite.

  Spartacus ignores him.  Ashur ignores the ignoring.

  Ashur presses a small loaf of BREAD into Spartacus  hand.  
  Spartacus pauses, suspicious.

  Spartacus pins Ashur with a deadly glare.

                        Come to plain words.

  Ashur drops the friendly overtones, his eyes glinting.

                                        ASHUR
                        Simply stated, then.  In addition 
                      to other services, I offer odds.  
                        Will this man live?  That one die?  
                        How fast?  How slow?  On what day 
                      or hour?  Games to pass the time.  
                        And coin.

  Spartacus glances at the other Recruits.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And how am I fixed?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                                        ASHUR
                        Twelve to the one, favoring the 
                        mines. Higher towards your death.  
                        Crixus stands to lose a sum if you 
                        defy the numbering.  I would see it 
                        so.

  Spartacus considers the bread, locks eyes with Ashur.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Do not think me friend.

  Ashur smiles coldly.

                                        ASHUR
                        The thought is well removed.

  Ashur moves off.  Spartacus glances at Crixus braying with 
  Barca.  The bread could give him strength to silence the 
  laughter.  A warming thought.  Spartacus heads over to

  VARRO

  stretched out in the shade, eyes closed.  Spartacus tears 
  the loaf of bread, tossing half onto Varro s stomach.  Varro 
  creaks an eye open, annoyed at the disturbance.  His mood 
  brightens as he grabs up the unexpected meal.

                                        VARRO
                        How did you manage this?

  Spartacus rips a hunk of bread off with his teeth, chews.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      By playing the odds.

  Something catches Varro s eye behind Spartacus.

                                        VARRO
                        I fear they re about to worsen.

  Spartacus turns to see two Guards hustling up.  They descend 
  on him, WIPING US TO --


  INT. DETENTION CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Dark and filthy.  Dim shafts of light stab through the 
  gloom. A few rusted CAGES litter the floor, just large 
  enough to stuff a man into.  CHAINS hang from the walls.  
  Spartacus  wrists are shackled to a set.  SLOW PUSH IN on 
  him, landing on his FACE as he hears


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

  FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

  from the corridor.  The cell door grinds open.  Spartacus 
  tenses as he sees

  LEGATUS CLAUDIUS GLABER

  entering in all his Roman Glory.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Glaber.

                                        GLABER
                        You will address me by title of 
                        Legatus.

  Spartacus lunges at him, enraged.  The chains snap him an 
  inch short of his mark.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        Yet the animal.  The mark of your 
                        kind.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Where is she?

                                        GLABER
                        Who?  That little wife of yours?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Where?

                                        GLABER
                        Wherever I please!

  Glaber spits out his mocking response, his careful composure 
  cracking.  The Thracian has cost him dearly, driving him to 
  the brink.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She served you no grievance.

                                        GLABER
                        None.  But you...  You have grieved 
                        me. Stirring the auxiliary to 
                        desertion. Putting my command in 
                        question, imperiling my standing 
                        with the senate...And you grieve me 
                        again in the arena, by not knowing 
                        when to die.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      My life, then.  In exchange for 
                        hers.

                                        GLABER
                        Your life is no longer yours to 
                        bargain! If I wish it ceased, I 
                        need but whisper and good Batiatus 
                        will command it!

  Spartacus hardens.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then tongue the words in his ear.  
                        I will not beg.

  Glaber regains his composure, smiles warmly.

                                        GLABER
                        You mistake me, Thracian.  True, I 
                        sought death in repayment of your 
                        slights.  I see the error of that 
                        now.  Wishing for an end too quick.  
                        No.  My desires have turned to 
                        blood.  Spilled by the drop, over 
                        time, until you are drained.  As I 
                        told you before, the shadow of Rome 
                      is vast.  And you will yet die 
                        under it. Sliver by sliver, to the 
                        roar of the crowd.

  Glaber turns to exit, pauses.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        A parting kindness, to bind us.

  He produces a familiar PURPLE BINDING from his robes.  The 
  one Spartacus tied to Sura s thigh before heading off to 
  war. Spartacus stares at it, his heart rending.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        I took it from her thigh to 
                        preserve the scent.  Before my men 
                        stained it with theirs.

  Spartacus lunges again, straining to break his chains.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        She was a savage amusement.  When 
                        the fight ran from her eyes, I sold 
                        her to an unpleasant Syrian for 
                        half a coin.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.
  CONTINUED:

  He lets the binding fall to the ground.  Spartacus falls to 
  his knees, struggling against the chains to reach it.

                                          GLABER(cont'd)
                        The Thracian finally learns his 
                        place before me.  On his knees.

  Glaber sweeps out, his purpose realized.  Spartacus strains 
  for Sura s binding, drawing blood from where the shackles 
  circle his wrists.  He finally latches onto it, tears of 
  regret and rage streaking his anguished face.  He screams, a 
  primal, savage sound.


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Spartacus  anguish echoes through the corridor.  Glaber 
  allows himself the hint of a smile as he joins Batiatus, 
  waiting for him in the corridor with two Guards.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your visit with the Thracian was 
                        satisfying, then?

  Glaber continues down the corridor, paying Batiatus little 
  mind.

                                        GLABER
                        The man is of no more concern to 
                        me.

                                        BATIATUS
                      No concern whatsoever!  Let us talk 
                      of happier matters.  Come!  I ve 
                        had a feast prepared in your honor!

  Glaber waves the offer away.

                                        GLABER
                        I leave for Rome.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Rome?  Now?

  Glaber sweeps on ahead.  Batiatus calls after him, his hopes 
  of patronage quickly evaporating.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Perhaps something for your trip, 
                        then?  I offer the finest selection 
                      of delicacies in all of Capua!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  The Roman equivalent of a dining room.  TIGHT ON a silver 
  plate of ROASTED DORMICE.  PULL BACK to reveal Naevia and 
  the Slaves setting it out with the rest of a modest feast.  
  A far cry from Senator Albinius  opulent spread at the Cena 
  Libera.

  GLABER S WIFE ILITHYIA,

  dressed in expensive robes of the latest style, eyes the 
  food with a polite smile.  Lucretia stands with her, the 
  gracious hostess -- albeit less magnificently garbed.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        You really shouldn t have gone to 
                        the trouble, Lucretia.  These 
                        common dishes leave my stomach 
                        unsettled.

  She means no slight in the remark, but Lucretia can t help 
  being stung by it.  Of lower social status, she s forced to 
  laugh the feeling away.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Perhaps some wine, while we wait 
                        for your husband?

                                        ILITHYIA
                      Do you have any Sestian?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        No, but something of equal taste?

  Ilithyia frowns in disappointment.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Water, then.

  Lucretia motions to Naevia, who pours.  Ilithyia fans 
  herself.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        The heat and the dust.  Will it 
                        ever rain again?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        One can only pray.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.
  CONTINUED:

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Can t place foot to street in Capua 
                        without hearing someone pleading to 
                        the heavens for a sprinkle.  And 
                        the gods yet ignore us.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Perhaps we ve done something to 
                        offend them.

  Ilithyia smiles, her eyes twinkling with mischief as she 
  takes her cup.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I try to do a little something 
                        every day.

  Lucretia laughs, seeing the opportunity to become a co-
    conspirator.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      So you re the cause, Ilithyia.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I d stand a bit away.  Jupiter 
                        could hurl a bolt any moment.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        He ll have to choose between 
                        targets.

  Lucretia smiles, a tinge of the salacious behind it.  
  Ilithyia eyes her with new appreciation.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        And I thought I was in the presence 
                      of a proper Roman woman.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Proper is a word.  Forged by men 
                        who would enslave us with it.

  Lucretia exits to the balcony, her hook baited.


  EXT. BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - CONTINUOUS

  Lucretia looks out across the square.  Doctore puts the 
  Recruits (sans Spartacus) through combat forms, sparring 
  with wooden swords.

  CRIXUS

  and the senior Gladiators train apart from them.  Muscles 
  and sweat gleaming with temptation.  Ilithyia steps out next 
  to Lucretia, eyes wide at the sight.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Have you never been inside a ludus?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        No.  I ve always wanted to.  But my

  The subject is a painful one.  Lucretia tries to hide the 
  depth of it with a smile.

  Glaber appears with Batiatus, breaking the awkward moment.

                                        GLABER
                        Come.  We leave for Rome.

  She shoots Batiatus a questioning look.  Batiatus frowns. 
  He s tried his best.

                        Can t we stay awhile?  I want to

                        Another time.  Come.

  Glaber sweeps out.  Ilithyia pouts, surprises Lucretia with 
  a quick peck on the cheek before following Glaber.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Perhaps you should have sacrificed 
                        two rams.

  Batiatus fumes, heading after his honored guests.  Lucretia 
  turns back to the

  TRAINING SQUARE,

  a scorching breeze adding to her displeasure.  She squints 
  against the unforgiving sun, her eyes falling on

  SPARTACUS

  as he s led back out by the Guards.  The rage of his 
  emotions has left him drained.  Empty.

  DOCTORE

  studies him, noting the shift.  There is no judgement in his 
  eyes.  No malice.  Merely the gathering of information.

  Kerza halts his sparring with Varro, glances over.

  Kerza grins at the sight of his opponent, relishing the 
  chance to test the Thracian.

                        Yes, Doctore.

  Varro sees the state of Spartacus, frowns with concern. 
  Kerza picks up another wooden sword and tosses it to 
  Spartacus.  Spartacus snatches it out of the air just before 
  it slams into him, revealing

  SURA S BINDING

  wrapped loosely around his hand.  He looks to Kerza. 
    Dispassionate.  Barely registering the man.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Recruits!  Attend!

  The rest of the Recruits stop sparring, wiping the sweat

                        Attack!

  Kerza unleashes a quick series of practiced moves.  
  Spartacus counters, barely fending off the assault.  He 
  stumbles back, nearly falls.

  BARCA LAUGHS,

  nudging Crixus to alert him the Thracian is about to get his 
  ass handed to him again.  The rest of the senior Gladiators 
  take notice.  Ashur watches with particular interest.

                        Form two.  Attack!

  Kerza unleashes another volley.  Spartacus counters, eyes 
  narrowing to the task -- until they are pulled from the mark 
  at the sight of GLABER

  exiting with Ilithyia, Batiatus following in their wake.  
  TIME SLOWS.  PUSH IN on Spartacus, the sounds of the world 
  fading, his own breath filling his ears.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

  SPARTACUS SNAPS,

  his lips twisting into a snarl as he rushes Kerza, slamming 
  him to the ground.  BLOOD SPRAYS from Kerza s mouth and nose 
  as Spartacus  fists rain down on him.  The Recruits and 
  Gladiators explode, shouting encouragement.

  Spartacus ignores him, his eyes wild.  Sura s binding 
  partially UNRAVELS from around his hand, fluttering amidst 
  the violence.

  Doctore unleashes his whip.  TIME SLOWS as it CONTRAILS 
  through the air, LASHING AROUND SPARTACUS  NECK and yanking 
  him back.

  SURA S BINDING

  flies from his hand as he crashes to the sand.  He 
  desperately reaches for it, but the Guards are on him with 
  their clubs.  His hand almost reclaims the binding despite 
  the blows, but

                        were all of little cost.  Spartacus 
                      is more highly valued, his worth

  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Spartacus is led in by the Guards.  They shove him forward, 
  staying a respectful distance back.  Batiatus sits at his 
  cluttered desk, reviewing documents with a burdened frown.

  He makes a note on his document, takes a sip of wine, 
  stands.

                        hospitality.  Do you know why?

  Spartacus  eyes flick up to Batiatus.  The fire in them has 
  been deadened, but far from extinguished.

                                          SPARTACUS

                      Do you love her?  Of course you do.  
                        I can see it in the eye, the 
                        tensing of the jaw.  Love.  The 
                        wings that grant us flight.  And 
                        the shackles that ensure we never 
                        flutter off.  What would be the 
                        name of this delicate flower?

  A beat.

                        Most days, I don t.  I m just a 
                        simple Roman trying to make his way 
                        against the whim of the gods, 
                        politicians, and miscreants -- 
                        though often you cannot tell one 
                        from another.  But you.  You are 
                        the most dangerous of animals.  The

  Batiatus considers Spartacus, eyes narrowing.

                        skin, the taste of her lips?  Would 
                        you kill?

                        destroyed by it.

  Batiatus produces Sura s binding from his robes.  The blood

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  The fighting men of the ludus yell encouragement and insults 
  at

  VARRO

  who is trading thunderous blows with GNAEUS, one of the 
  senior Gladiators.  Real swords.  Real shields.  No helmets. 
  The battle rages atop a

  TESTING BRIDGE

  that has been erected in the center of the training square. 
  Six feet off the ground, twenty feet long, no rails, a ramp 
  on either side.  Gnaeus is largely unscathed. Varro grits 
  his teeth, bloodied and exhausted but refusing to give in.

  THE SENIOR GLADIATORS

  urge the combatants on as we ROTATE AROUND the bridge, 
  torches ringing the scene to illuminate the night.  Doctore 
  stalks, his eyes dissecting every stroke and counter for 
  future reference.

  SPARTACUS

  stands with Kerza and the other Recruits, waiting his turn 
  on the bridge.  Spartacus  face is unreadable.  Distant.  
  Haunted.  Continue rotating around to reveal

  BATIATUS

  watching from the balcony with Lucretia, Naevia, and other 
  privileged Slaves.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                        Cease!  Varro has stood to a draw!  
                        The test is passed!

  The Gladiators roar their approval.  Varro beams.  Gnaeus 
  greets him as a brother as they descend the ramp.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Barca!  Marcus!  Positions!

  Barca climbs the ramp.  Marcus, aka Recruit #4, mirrors on 
  the opposing side.  Sweat drips from his nervous face.  He 
  grips his sword, steeling himself for battle.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  Marcus lets loose a bloodcurdling cry as he attacks.  Barca 
  counters in one smooth motion and cracks Marcus in the 
  skull.  Marcus tumbles from the bridge, landing at 
  Spartacus  feet in a spray of blood.  Dead before he hit the 
  ground.

  THE GLADIATORS ROAR

  with laughter, delighted in the unexpectedly quick demise.

                                        LUCRETIA
                          Disappointing.

  Batiatus scowls at the comment as Doctore calls for the next 
  combatants.

                        Crixus!  Spartacus!  Positions!

  Spartacus steps over Marcus  body as he takes his place on 
  the bridge.  Crixus grins from the other side, eyeing the 
  Thracian like a meal to be devoured.

                                        CRIXUS
                        A final lesson, before I send you 
                      to the afterlife.

  Spartacus, lost in thought, doesn t meet his gaze.  Varro 
  notes this with concern.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  Crixus braces himself for the usual wild Thracian assault.  
  It doesn t come.  Spartacus stands motionless, seeing the 
  world through the haze of a heavy heart.  The Gladiators 
  murmur disapproval.  Varro sags.

                                        VARRO

  The Gladiators begin to laugh and catcall.  Ashur yells out, 
  his wager against Crixus in serious jeopardy.

                        Fight!  Fight, you Thracian bitch!

  Spartacus ignores him, his eyes dropping to SURA S BINDING 
  clutched in his shield hand.  FLASH TO --


  EXT. THRACE - CLEARING - DAY

  Sura stands naked in the clearing by the persimmon tree.  
  Perfect, golden, her hair fluttering in the warm breeze of 
  home, the PURPLE BINDING tied to her thigh.  A faint, sad 
  smile bends her lips.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Spartacus closes his eyes, a tear creasing his dirty cheek. 
  Crixus laughs.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Tears!  The rabbit is fixed to piss 
                        himself!

  Lucretia glares at Spartacus.

                        Expensive.  And worthless, all in a 
                        measure.

  Batiatus sighs.  Doctore was right.  The Thracian is 
  uncontrollable.  Batiatus motions for Crixus to attack and 
  end it.






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

  TIME SLOWS

  as Crixus rushes forward, sword rearing back for the death 
  blow.  Spartacus releases Sura s binding.  As it hits the 
  floor of the bridge TIME RESUMES.

  SPARTACUS DEFLECTS

  Crixus  attack at the last second, his eyes snapping open 
  with deadly focus.  TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES as they trade 
  blows worthy of the gods.

  THE GLADIATORS ROAR

  their approval.  Varro futilely attempts to keep his hopes 
  in check as Spartacus whirls and attacks.

  LUCRETIA TENSES

  as Crixus nearly tumbles off the bridge from the assault.  
  He regains his balance and counters, hammering Spartacus 
  with practiced brutality.

  SPARTACUS  SHIELD

  is knocked from his grasp.  Crixus presses, spins, smashes 
  Spartacus with his own shield.  BLOOD SPRAYS from Spartacus  
  mouth as he crashes to the floor of the bridge, stunned, his 
  blade falling from his hand.  Crixus looks to

  BATIATUS

  for approval to finish Spartacus once and for all.  Batiatus 
  hisses condemnation for Spartacus  entire race.

  He waves Crixus on to the matter.  Crixus grins, rearing his 
  sword back to cleave Spartacus  head open.  TIME SLOWS.  
  Through the blood dripping in his eyes Spartacus spots

  SURA S BINDING

  on the floor -- and Crixus  foot half upon it.  TIME RESUMES 
  as Crixus brings his weapon to bear.  Spartacus rolls out of 
  its path and grabs the end of Sura s binding, yanking with 
  all his strength.

  CRIXUS FLIES FROM HIS FEET,

  cracking his head as he tumbles from the bridge.  He hits 
  the sand hard, dazed, struggling toward his senses.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

                        The lesson is well learned.

  He rears back with an enraged snarl, intent on having the 
  Gaul s head.

                        Spartacus!

  Spartacus reacts to his new name for the first time.  He 
  pauses in his grim work, throwing Batiatus a wild look.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You have passed the test.  Stand 
                        down.

  A tense beat.  Lucretia s knuckles go white from gripping 
  the balcony.  Spartacus calms, lowering his sword -- and his 
  eyes -- in deference to Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Dominus.

  There is no venom in the word.  Merely acceptance.  Lucretia 
  remembers to breathe.  Batiatus smiles in satisfaction.  The 
  beast has been tamed.  The Gladiators roar. Ashur shouts in 
  triumph as Barca and Gnaeus rush to help Crixus.  Varro 
  grins in relief, rushing to Spartacus  side.

  PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS

  through the chaos, his eyes reflecting the choice he has 
  just made.  Hardship.  Slavery.  The arena.  All for Sura.  
  CONTINUE FORWARD, PUSHING INTO SPARTACUS  EYE as the tip of

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

  CHEER as he joins Kerza, also freshly branded.  Batiatus 
  turns to

  SPARTACUS,

  standing alone, the moon huge behind him over the mountains. 
  Batiatus returns the brand to the fire, heating it to 
  purpose.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spartacus.  Come forward.

  Spartacus complies.  Crixus, a cut creasing his brow from 
  his fall, attempts to glare the flesh from the Thracian s 
  bones.  Ashur catches the look, suppresses a satisfied 
  smile.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You have taken a small stride 
                        towards greater glory.  Your life 
                        now promises meaning.  Swear it to 
                        me.  Recite the Sacramentum 
                        Gladiatorum, and stand among my 
                        titans.

  Batiatus nods to Doctore, who steps forward.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Speak as I speak, and receive your 
                        mark.  I commit my flesh.  My mind.  
                      My will. 

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I commit my flesh.  My mind.  My 
                        will.

  LUCRETIA

  watches from the balcony with Naevia.  She turns away and 
  exits inside, having seen enough of the man that caused her 
  favored Crixus embarrassment.

                                          DOCTORE
                         To the glory of this ludus, and 
                        the commands of my master, 
                        Batiatus. 

                                          SPARTACUS
                      To the glory of this ludus, and the 
                        commands of my master, Batiatus.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

  CLOSE ON SPARTACUS  HAND

  as it clenches around Sura s binding, muscles rippling with 
  the strength gained from it.

                                          DOCTORE
                       I swear to be burned, chained, 
                        beaten, or die by the sword.  In 
                        pursuit of honor in the arena. 

  Spartacus  eyes harden into deadly resolve.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I swear to be burned, chained, 
                        beaten, or die by the sword.  In 
                        pursuit of honor in the arena.

                                          DOCTORE
                                to Batiatus)(
                        The oath has been spoken.

  Batiatus retrieves his brand, the tip once again glowing 
  red. His eyes dance with the possibility of Spartacus  
  future achievements in the arena.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Welcome to the brotherhood.

  Batiatus presses the brand into Spartacus  shoulder. 
  Everything FADES except the searing mark left in Spartacus  
  flesh.  It hangs on the SCREEN for a moment.  An angry, 
  wrathful thing.


  BLACKOUT.
