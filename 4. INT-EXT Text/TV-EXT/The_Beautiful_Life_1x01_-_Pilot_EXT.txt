      The street is alive with activity.  Groups of partiers, young 
      couples in love...  The Andrews family waits on a curb, 
      looking out of place, as A HANDSOME CAB trots up.

                                  DANIELLE
                    Can we ride back in the Handsome 
                    Cab, dad?  Please???

                                  BILL
                    No.

      At that moment, Chris comes jogging up...

                                  BILL (CONT D)
                    Where the heck have you been, we ve 
                    been waiting out here ten minutes.

                                  CHRIS
                    This guy wanted to talk to me about 
                      something.

                                  BILL
                    What guy?

                                  CHRIS
                          (beat, then)
                    What time does our plane leave tomorrow?

      And OFF Chris, his thousand watt grin revealing itself for 
      the first time-- 

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      Chris and Raina stand on the curb as a Cabbie fills the trunk 
      of the car with The Andrews  luggage.  Chris gives Danielle a 
      hug.  Danielle, pulls out her journal and a pen.  Aims them 
      at Raina.

                                  DANIELLE
                    Can I get your autograph?

                                  RAINA
                          (smiling sweetly)
                    Sure.

      Raina takes the book, signs, hands it back.  Danielle then 
      turns to her brother, holds the book out for him.

                                  DANIELLE
                    You, too.  Just in case.

      Chris grins takes the book, writes something.  Hands it back 
      to his proud little sister.  She reads what he s written:  
       You re the special one Dani, don t ever forget that.   Love, 
      Chris.  Tears well in her eyes, as she steps into the cab.  
      Bill steps up to his son.    "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    28.



                                  BILL
                    I can only hold your job one week.

                                  CHRIS
                    That s all I ll need, pop.  Thanks 
                    for everything.  

      Bill grumbles something like,  good luck,  gets in the cab.  
      Chris then turns to look at his mom, who s eyes are filled 
      with tears.

                                  CHRIS (CONT D)
                    C mon, don t cry.  

                                  KAREN
                    I m just so proud of you.

                                  CHRIS
                    Don t be.  Chances are I ll be home 
                    for Sunday dinner.

      Karen holds out a fifty dollar bill for him.

                                  CHRIS (CONT D)
                    Ma, I can t take this.  If dad 
                    found out, he d kill us both.

                                  KAREN
                    Who do you think asked me to give 
                    it to you?

      With that, Karen grabs her son in a mother-bear hug, gets in 
      the cab.  And as the cab pulls away, we can see that Chris is 
      emotional, himself.  Raina gives him a comforting smile.  

                                  RAINA
                    Come on.

                                  CHRIS
                    Where re we going?  

                                  RAINA
                    Shopping.

       Good Life  by Kanye West feat. T-Pain kicks in, and we...


      Chris and Raina outside Dolce and Gabana on Madison Avenue.  
      Raina is pointing at a male mannequin in the window, sporting 
      the latest in high fashion.  Chris makes a face, shakes his 
      head  no .  Raina nods,  oh, yes,  grabs his shoulder, pushes 
      him into the store... and as Kanye and T-Pain roll us into...   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    29.




      Swarms of people jostle around outside a trendy nightclub, 
      the Paparazzi is there, flashing and filming.  Find Chris, 
      wearing a very model-esque outfit, following Simon through 
      the crowd towards the red velvet rope.  Chris remains an 
      arm's length behind Simon, still not really sure what he s 
      gotten himself into.  The BOUNCER lets Simon right in, but 
      stops Chris before he can enter.

                                  SIMON
                    He s with me.

      The bouncer gives Chris a once over, makes up his mind what 
      Simon means by  with me,  unclips the rope...
