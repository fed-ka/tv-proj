  As members of the ABC Studios family, we all work very hard to create 

  quality original programming for our viewers. A very important aspect of 

  producing such programming is ensuring that certain information relating to 

  the series Revenge (the  Series ) remains confidential. In this regard, as 

  we begin work on the first season of this very exciting program, we would 

  like to emphasize that any disclosure of such confidential information to 

  third parties will have a serious and detrimental effect on the production 

  and the Series. As you are aware, ABC Studios has a strict policy 

  prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information. Accordingly, we 

  would like to remind each of you of your obligation to hold in strict 

  confidence, and not to disclose to any person (including your friends and

  including but not limited to any information about other cast and crew 

  members, upcoming episodes, the season finale, production schedules 

  and production methods. Steps should be taken to maintain the 

  confidentiality of scripts or any other confidential information to which you 

  are exposed, such as not discussing confidential information in public 

  areas or leaving scripts lying around unattended. As it is imperative that 

  we maintain the confidentiality of such information, ABC Studios will 

  investigate any unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and any

      EXT. EMILY S BEACH HOUSE - PORCH - DAY11

      EMILY sits on the porch swing watching the sunrise, wearing 
      her father s blue sweater, toying with an object in her hand. 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Believing in something when no one 
                    else will is a lonely proposition. 
                    Some call it faith. Others call it 
                    insanity.

      Emily holds the WATCH Victoria gave her father, flips it 
      over, reads the inscription:  DAVID, UNTIL FOREVER, VICTORIA 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    By the time my father was sentenced 
                    to prison, the world already 
                    believed him to be something he was 
                    not. I am just now beginning to 
                      understand what that feels like.

                                  DANIEL (O.C.)
                    Hey early bird...

      Emily snaps out of her reverie, discreetly slips the WATCH 
      into her POCKET. DANIEL joins her, hands her a cup of coffee. 

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    No swim this morning?

                                  EMILY
                    Just enjoying the sunrise. Sleep well?  

                                  DANIEL
                    Better than you, I m guessing. 
                    Heard you get up in the middle of 
                    the night again.

                                  EMILY
                    Sorry. Still getting used to having 
                    someone sleeping next to me. I ll 
                    try not to wake you next time.

                                  DANIEL
                    I don t mind. As long as you want 
                    me there...

                                  EMILY
                          (reaching for his hand)
                      I definitely want you there.          REVENGE EP 109 "SUSPICION" 2ND Blue ProdDraft  10/21/11 2.


                                  DANIEL
                          (he smiles, believing her)
                    Got any plans today?

                                  EMILY
                    You re looking at  em. Why?

                                  DANIEL
                    Grayson Global does this  Business 
                    by the Beach  thing every summer. 
                    Basically my dad flies in a group of 
                    obscenely rich people and tries to 
                    get them to invest with the company. 
                    Starts off with an employee 
                      volleyball game this afternoon. 

                                  EMILY
                    And all this time you thought you d 
                    hate this job.

                                  DANIEL
                    Well, jury s still out. But I did 
                    tell my dad I d at least give it a 
                    try, so... come back me up? 

                                  EMILY
                    Always.

      Emily kisses him, then glances over his shoulder at Grayson 
      Manor, noticing VICTORIA watching from her cupola. Emily 
      smiles, relishes torturing her nemesis.

      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - FOYER / LYDIA S ROOM - DAY22

      ASHLEY enters the front door on her cell phone...

                                  ASHLEY

      Ashley hears a determined voice from inside Lydia s room.

                                  LYDIA (O.C.)
                    Ashley-- 

      Ashley opens the doors, sees Lydia struggling to get from the 
      bed to her wheelchair. ALL OF LYDIA S BELONGINGS ARE PACKED 
      AWAY, THE ROOM IS SET UP FOR A LONG STAY...

                                  ASHLEY

                                  LYDIA
                    No. Help me look for my phone.

      Ashley wheels over the chair, but as Lydia struggles to get 
      in, she s stopped by-- 

                                  VICTORIA (O.C.)
                    Lydia? What on earth? The doctor 
                    was very specific about keeping you 
                    rested. 
                          (to Ashley)
                    I ll take things from here. 

                                  ASHLEY
                    Yes, Mrs. Grayson.

                    But I just confirmed all the -- 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Then un-confirm. As you see, it s

                          (go to hell)
                    Yes, Mrs. Grayson.

      Ashley shoots daggers at her employer and exits to...

      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - KITCHEN - DAY33

      Ashley enters to find TYLER in beach attire, grabbing a bagel. 

                                  TYLER

                    I would love to, but I have errands to

      EXT. MARINA - THE AMANDA - DAY44

      Jack hoses down the Amanda. AMANDA CLARKE approaches.

                                  AMANDA
                    That boat s almost as handsome as

                    More like a childhood crush. You

                    Nah. Found a motel not too far from

                    doing this. I remember what happened

                    exactly, do you remember?...

                                  LYDIA
                      I remember you told me that you d 
                    never accept me. That your hatred 
                    ran deeper than any apology I could 
                    make.  
                          (off Victoria)
                    And I don t blame you. I ve been a 
                    terrible friend. The shame I felt 
                    for betraying you is part of the 
                    reason I tried to kill myself the 
                    night of the gala.

      INT. GRAYSON MANOR - FOYER - DAY55

      Victoria exits Lydia s room to find A MAID allowing DETECTIVE 
      GUNTHER and a team of POLICE INVESTIGATORS into the house. 
      Victoria shuts Lydia s doors tightly behind her. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    Detective Gunther? What is all this?

                                  DETECTIVE GUNTHER
                    There s been a development in the 
                    Frank Stevens case. We have a 
                    warrant to search your home.

      Victoria takes the warrant, rattled. As the police disperse 
      with GPS trackers, Victoria stands guard by Lydia s door.

                                  VICTORIA
                    A friend is convalescing in there. I 
                    cannot have your men disturbing her.

                    tower picked up Frank Stevens  phone 
                    signal late last night. GPS tracked 
                    it to inside your property lines.

                                  VICTORIA
                    That doesn t make any sense. The 
                    last call Frank made to me was 
                      definitely not from inside this 
                    house.

                                  DETECTIVE GUNTHER
                    You re right, near as we can tell, 
                    his last call was placed near a 
                      gentlemen s club about a four and a 
                    half hour drive from here.
                          (off Victoria, baffled)
                    Mrs. Grayson, we know that you and 
                    Mr. Stevens had regular contact. We 
                    also know that your husband 
                    abruptly fired Mr. Stevens shortly 
                    before checking into a hotel the 
                    night of the murder. Would you 
                      characterize Mr. Grayson as a 
                    jealous man? 

      As Victoria processes that, a UNIFORMED COP approaches.

                                  UNIFORMED COP 
                    Sir, I think we found the phone...

      WHACK! Daniel dives to return a serve, keeps the ball in play 
      as it s bounced back to him for a SLAM over the net. Tyler, 
      on the opposing team, dives and misses. Emily and Ashley

      As Daniel is slapped high fives by his team mates, he passes

                    That s quite an opportunity, sir. 
                    And you ve made the job easy, your

                    again, Daniel may have a slight

      anyone. Then, with just enough bite:

                                  VICTORIA
                    Don t hurt my son, Emily. If you 
                    do, you ll live to regret it.

                                  EMILY
                    The last thing I want is to see Daniel 
                    injured in any way. Assuming you feel 
                    the same way, I think it s time you 
                    and I worked out our differences. 

                                  VICTORIA
                      I couldn t agree more. For Daniel s 
                    sake. 

      Victoria turns to leave. On her way out, she looks to the 
      stairs, stirring another FLASHBACK to the morning after the 
      rainstorm in 104, the night she took David s laptop.          REVENGE EP 109 "SUSPICION" 2ND Blue ProdDraft  10/21/11 20.


      INT. AMANDA S BEACH HOUSE - MORNING - (FLASHBACK)2323

      Young Victoria, in her white dress, walks down the stairs to 
      find DAVID searching for something.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Did you lose something?

                                  DAVID CLARKE
                    My PC. I could have sworn I brought 
                    it home...

                                  VICTORIA
                    Perhaps you left it at the office.

                    Amanda got to know you. She s a 
                    smart kid; I ve hated having to 
                    keep this from her.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I wish I could, but I still haven t 
                    told Daniel I m leaving his father, 
                    so... I m afraid we ll have to keep 
                    this a secret just a little while 
                    longer.

      And OFF Victoria, knowing that it s only a matter of days...

      Victoria snaps back. Emily eyes her, so sincerely --

                    Victoria, I m glad we had this 
                    talk. I d like to make things right 
                    between us. Especially since 
                    there s a chance we could be family 
                    someday.

      That thought sickens Victoria, she exits. Off Emily, very 
      aware she s turning the knife even deeper.

                                  EMILY
                    I m sorry, Detective Gunther asked me 
                    to go down and give a written statement 
                    about the night Frank was killed. I 
                    didn t want to ruin your fun.

                                  DANIEL
                    They need me to vouch for your

                    I don t think so. But thanks. Seems 
                    they ve moved on to other suspects.

                                  DANIEL
                    The fact that they even suspected 
                    you at all... I don t think I ll 
                    ever forgive my mother for putting 
                    you through that.

      Emily hands Daniel a glass of sparkling water.

                    can t continue to let her hold this

                    to forgive her.

      INT. NOLAN S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT2626

      Tyler hands Nolan his credit card. Nolan glares.

                                  TYLER
                    Thanks for the use of your card. A 
                    man s clothes speak volumes. 

                                  NOLAN
                    So do his actions. By my estimation, 
                    that makes you a common thief.

                                  TYLER
                    Then by the same logic, it also 
                    makes you a liar. You said you 
                    wanted to help me up the ladder. 

                                  NOLAN
                    You don t want to play this game 
                    with me, Ty. Or can it be that you 
                    actually think I m as stupid as the 
                    rest of the people you re conning?

                                  TYLER
                    No con, Nolan. I like you. I 
                    thought we had a mutually 
                      beneficial thing going here. You 
                    said yourself you have more money 
                    than you can wrap your brain 
                    around. Besides, I have every 
                    intention of repaying you... 

      Tyler moves in close. Nolan pulls away.

                    eyes. Without proof, what good is 
                    trying to tell her I m innocent. It ll 
                    only confuse her more. No. She s 
                    better off finding her way on her own.

                    emerges to get me out of here, when 
                    she s old enough to handle the 
                    truth, I want you to promise you ll 
                    deliver them to her. 

                                  NOLAN
                    I will. 

                                  DAVID CLARKE
                    You re like a son to me, Nolan. I m 
                    trusting you to take care of my 
                    only daughter. Swear to me that I 
                    can trust you.

                                  NOLAN
                    You can trust me. I ll treat her 
                    like a sister. I promise.

      Nolan downs the rest of his drink. Jack walks over.

                    outta here.

      Nolan rises. Just as he is about to head out through one 
      door, he notices VICTORIA entering from the other end. 

                                  NOLAN (CONT D)

      Nolan skulks off to the side, and out the door --

                    Then I believe you also know my

                    If it s all right I d like to have

      Victoria heads for the stairs. OFF Jack, WTF?

                    Uh... sure.

      Declan, whistling, exits the bathroom in a towel, then nearly 
      jumps out of his skin when he sees Victoria standing there.

      Off Declan, speechless.

      INT. NOLAN S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT3232

      Nolan attaches the WHALE CAM to his laptop. Opens a video 
      file of Tyler at Nolan s computer from earlier. Nolan looks 
      closer. Trying to make out what Tyler has in his hand. Nolan 
      clicks to enhance the image and turns it clockwise. Zooms in 
      on the fractured text and struggles to read:

                    I know, and I m sorry. I had a 
                    plan, but he turned out to be a 
                    little shiftier than expected. You

                    More likely he s planning to

      Emily punches the phone off, at wits  end. Looks in the 
      window, Daniel is giving her a concerned  you okay?  look. She 
      manages a semi convincing nod, then walks further down the 
      porch. This is the most concerned we ve seen her so far.

      The bar is closed. Jack fills a cooler with sandwiches and 
      drinks. Amanda, in beach wear, watches.

      The party is in full swing. The jazz trio vamps in the foyer. 
      A rainbow of INVESTORS mingle. SERVERS bring champagne and 
      hors d oeuvres. Tyler chats up a TYCOON. Across the room, 
      Daniel talks to a Japanese business man, SATOSHI TAKEDA, 
      communicating through his beautiful young translator, HIKARI.

      As Hikari translates to Satoshi, Emily steps up.

                    He says,  You are a lucky man. She

                    Perfect. You won t regret it.

      Through the window, Nolan sees someone approaching, so -- 

                                  NOLAN
                    Hello? A little thank you?

      Tyler realizes, goes to him. Puts on a smile.

                    Of course. Twenty million of them.

      Tyler plants a big kiss on Nolan. CRASH. Two full martinis 
      drop to the floor and shatter simultaneously.

                                  ASHLEY (O.C.)
                    Oh my god. 

      They turn to find Ashley standing in the entrance, empty 
      handed. Busted. Nolan waves and grins.

                                  NOLAN
                    Hey Ash, love the dress. 

      Ashley is dumbfounded. She gasps, then hurries out.

                                  TYLER
                    Ashley, wait! 

      Tyler follows after her. Once he s gone, Nolan quickly finds 
      the pants Tyler was wearing at his house. Nolan reaches in 
      the pockets and finds the taped together SPEECH. Bingo.

      Daniel goes upstairs. Once he s gone, Emily walks over to the 
      door. SHUTS THE DOWNSTAIRS LIGHTS OFF. But a KNOCK at the 
      front door stops her. She answers. To her surprise...

      INT./EXT. EMILY S HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT5454

      Jack stands on the porch. Emily steps out.

                                  JACK
                    Hey. Sorry to come by so late.

                    Something wrong?

                                  JACK
                    Not at all. Everything s great. Remember 
                    when I told you about the girl who used 
                    to live in this house with her father?

      Emily notices Amanda standing at the end of the porch. She 
      has to do her best to keep her composure.

                                  EMILY
                    Yes. Of course...

                    Well, that friend from Nolan s pool? 
                    She s that girl. Only she doesn t want 
                    anyone to know. Her dad wasn t exactly 
                    popular around here. Especially with 
                    your neighbors. I told her she could 
                    trust you. You mind if I show her the 
                    swing her father built? 

      Emily is floored. Barely able to speak.

                    Emily, this is Amanda. A very 
                    close, old friend of mine.

                                  EMILY
                    Nice to see you again, Amanda.

                    Jack has the nicest things to say 
                    about you. I m happy my house is in 
                    good hands. It was a very special 
                    place for me and my father.

      SLOW MO -- Emily notices as Jack grabs hold of Amanda s hand.

                    It s good to be home. 

      As Jack walks Amanda over to the swing, Emily burns.

5555INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK) 

      Teen Emily stands by the door with Teen Amanda, who is packed 
      and about to leave. Tears in both their eyes. A far cry from 
      the place they find themselves today.

                                  EMILY
                    Take care of yourself. And thank 
                    you again for doing this.

                                  AMANDA
                    I d do anything for you... 

      Amanda and Emily hug. Tightly. Like sisters.

                    Stay strong. Amanda.

                    You too, Emily.

      Emily smiles. Amanda exits. Emily, alone, shuts the door, 
      wipes her eyes. This is it, she s really on her own. Alone.

      IN HER DARK LIVING ROOM by the stair landing, WATCHING their

      Victoria comes down the stairs, enters Conrad s office.

      As she faces into the room and sips, her eyes fall on a half-
      open drawer. Curious, she moves closer and looks inside: 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    ...that we come face to face with

      VICTORIA S POV - a man s wallet in the drawer. Perplexed, she 
      sets her drink down and picks up the wallet. Slowly walks 
      towards the center of the room as she opens the wallet, 
      somehow knowing exactly what she s about to see: Frank 
      Stevens  driver s license, smeared with traces of his blood. 
      She stares at the face of the second man who s dead because 
      of her... Starts to tremble. She lifts her eyes and gazes out 
      to the darkness of the patio, the wind begins whipping the 
      trees as a summer storm approaches, thunder rolling in the 
      distance. And off Victoria, eyes wide, alone and unsettled: 
      Who s out there...?
