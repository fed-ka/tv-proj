               CU on FRANK PEMBLETON's face, etched with the righteous fury 
               of a man grievously wronged, as he takes a long, deliberate 
               drag on his cigarette, then slowly exhales the smoke.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Manuel, Manuel, Manuel. If I were 
                         you, I'd start talking. I'd start 
                         talking right now.

               PULL BACK to REVEAL MANUEL SAMPIER, terrified, sitting across 
               from PEMBLETON. TIM BAYLISS paces behind them, adrenaline 
               pumping.

                                     SAMPIER
                         I don't know where he is. I swear to 
                         God.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Glen Holton shot three Homicide 
                         Detectives. We know you're his friend. 
                         We know he was in your janitor's 
                         room at Penn Station last night.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Where did he go, Manuel?

                                     SAMPIER
                         I was working, then all of a sudden 
                         they're cops all over the place, you 
                         guys drag me down here -- I didn't 
                         see him leave. I don't know where he 
                         went.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Maybe he mentioned where he was going. 
                         Maybe in all the excitement you just 
                         forgot.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You've been around, Manuel. You're 
                         on parole. I don't have to tell you 
                         we got a situation here.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You gave Holton shelter. You know 
                         what that makes you? That makes you 
                         an accessory.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Harboring a fugitive. That's a serious 
                         crime. We don't even have to be 
                         talking to you.

                                     BAYLISS
                         What we could do is arrest you right 
                         now. Is that what we should so? Send 
                         you back to Jessup?

                                     SAMPIER
                         I can't do back there. I got a family.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Okay, okay. Let's help each other 
                         out. How about that?

                                     BAYLISS
                         We can tell you're not a bad guy, 
                         Manuel. We know Holton was into some 
                         kinky misdeeds, but we know you're 
                         clean now.

                                     SAMPIER
                         He just needed a place to crash. I 
                         didn't even know what he'd done, I 
                         swear I didn't --

                                     BAYLISS
                         Well, now's your chance to do the 
                         right thing. Now's your chance to 
                         redeem yourself.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Holton's no friend of yours. If he 
                         was, he wouldn't have come to you. 
                         He wouldn't have gotten you in trouble 
                         like this. You're gonna sacrifice 
                         your whole life, for him? He wouldn't 
                         do it for you. Holton'd turn you in 
                         in a heartbeat. I think you know 
                         that.

               SAMPIER looks at PEMBLETON, then back to BAYLISS.

                                     SAMPIER
                         If I tell you where he went, that's 
                         it? You'll let me go?

                                     BAYLISS
                         Technically, we have to charge you. 
                         But if you cooperate, we can work 
                         out a deal. You help us bring down a 
                         cop shooter? Hell, you'll be a hero. 
                         The Mayor'll probably thank you 
                         personally. We don't lock up heroes, 
                         do we, Frank?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         No, we don't. We don't lock up heroes.

               On PEMBLETON and BAYLISS, grim, SAMPIER wavering,

                                                                   FADE TO:

                                       MAIN TITLES

                                         ACT ONE

               FADE IN:


               Full Redball alert, chaos, double shifts working. THERESA 
               WALKER sits at Pembleton's desk, briefs MELDRICK LEWIS, who 
               sits at desk, MITCH DRUMMOND, who paces Squad Room, drinks 
               coffee, and JOHN MUNCH, who sits at desk.

                                     WALKER
                         Holton's psychological profile doesn't 
                         fit any stereotype. He's an organized 
                         offender, highly intelligent, yet 
                         he's shown instances of psychotic, 
                         uncontrolled behavior. He's violent. 
                         But he's also demonstrated 
                         characteristics of a fixated pedophile --

                                     MUNCH
                         So, where do we find this guy?

                                     WALKER
                         He's smart enough to know the police 
                         are after him. He's smart enough not 
                         to get caught, so far. What's he's 
                         not smart enough to do is control 
                         his impulses. He'll cruise for another 
                         victim.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         We've already staked out half the 
                         City.

                                     WALKER
                         The number one characteristic of a 
                         fixated pedophile is an attachment 
                         to their pornography collection. 
                         Pedophiles will never destroy 
                         pictures, magazines, videos. They'll 
                         trade them among themselves, leave 
                         them in their will to fellow 
                         pedophiles. Their collection is the 
                         most important thing they own.

                                     LEWIS
                         We only found a few magazine in his 
                         apartment. Some photographs.

                                     WALKER
                         My feeling is, he has to have a more 
                         extensive collection stashed away 
                         somewhere else. He's been doing this 
                         for fifteen years. We find out where 
                         his collection is, we'll find Holton.

               GIARDELLO emerges from his office, approaches.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         I just got a call from Higby at 
                         Holton's apartment. They found a set 
                         of keys -- looks like they belong to 
                         Holton. Munch, you get down there. I 
                         don't trust Higby. I don't want a 
                         screw-up.

                                     MUNCH
                         You got it, Gee.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Drummond, you go with him.

                                     MUNCH
                         I know we're all blessed to have the 
                         great Mitch in our midst, but I think 
                         I can handle this myself.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         I'm sure you can. But take Drummond 
                         anyway. The keys could be a lead to 
                         Holton. We need this break.

               MUNCH, not happy, shoots a glance at DRUMMOND, who slips 
               into coat.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Have you heard how Stan and the others 
                         are doing, Lieutenant?

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Stan's got a fracture skull, he's 
                         still unconscious. Beau's conscious. 
                         He was shot through the neck and the 
                         thigh, but there's no nerve or artery 
                         damage. Kay's in critical condition. 
                         She was shot through the heart.

               DRUMMOND nods, exits, followed by MUNCH. GIARDELLO turns to 
               WALKER and LEWIS.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         You think there's anything more we 
                         can get from Holton's mother?

                                     WALKER
                         I've talked to her twice since last 
                         night... I don't think she knows 
                         anything.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Let's try a third time.

                                     WALKER
                         Looking for a hat trick?

                                     LEWIS
                         Need some back-up?

                                     WALKER
                         Sure... If you don't mind my driving.

               As LEWIS and WALKER head out, on GIARDELLO, looking around 
               Squad Room Redball hustle and bustle,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               BAYLISS turns on ignition, backs car out of Parking Lot. 
               PEMBLETON looks out window.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Maybe we should call the hospital 
                         again. Check in.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I'm not going to call.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Maybe something's changed.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         If it's changed for the worse, they'll 
                         let us know.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You mean if they die. That's not 
                         going to happen.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         How can you be so sure?

               They drive in silence for a beat.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Stan and Kay could die. For that 
                         matter, so could Beau. Bullet wound, 
                         infection sets in, sepsis, you're 
                         gone in twenty-four hours.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You want to think that way, you go 
                         right ahead. I'm going to think 
                         positive. Nobody's gonna die.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Either way, there isn't anything I 
                         can do. So I'm not going to call in. 
                         I'm gonna do the only thing I can do 
                         right now, which is bring down the 
                         shooter.

               They drive in silence for a beat. PEMBLETON indicates fast 
               food joint up ahead on road.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Pull over.

                                     BAYLISS
                         What?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I'm gonna get some coffee. And a 
                         hamburger.

                                     BAYLISS
                         They don't have hamburgers this early. 
                         You won't be able to get a hamburger.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         This is America. You can always get 
                         a hamburger.

               As BAYLISS pulls over, on PEMBLETON, determined,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               WALKER drives like a maniac, weaving in and out of traffic 
               with the ease and confidence of a racing professional. LEWIS 
               hangs on for dear life.

                                     LEWIS
                         Jeez. You weren't kidding.

                                     WALKER
                         I'm not making you nervous, am I?

                                     LEWIS
                         No, no... No problem.

               They drive on for a few minutes, LEWIS looks at her.

                                     LEWIS
                         Sex Crimes. That must get to you 
                         sometimes, don't it?

                                     WALKER
                         Yeah. My boyfriend hates it when I 
                         bring the work home. But sometimes 
                         you just have to talk about it. No 
                         matter how depraved, you have to get 
                         it out of your system.

                                     LEWIS
                         You got a boyfriend?

                                     WALKER
                         Well, fiancee, really.

                                     LEWIS
                         Oh, yeah? What is he, a race car 
                         driver?

               WALKER looks over at LEWIS, smiles.

                                     WALKER
                         He's a paramedic.

                                     LEWIS
                         So's when the big day?

                                     WALKER
                         What do you mean?

                                     LEWIS
                         The wedding. He's your fiancee, right?

                                     WALKER
                         We haven't actually set a date yet.

                                     LEWIS
                         How long've you been engaged?

                                     WALKER
                              (mumbles)
                         Eight years.

                                     LEWIS
                         What?

                                     WALKER
                              (changes subject)
                         Here we are.

               WALKER pulls Cavalier up to the curb. SHE and LEWIS exit.


               FELTON sits up in bed, eyes open. BOB REARDON, Beth's brother, 
               appears in doorway, holding the hands of ZACK FELTON and 
               ALLY FELTON. REARDON addresses FELTON, awkward.

                                     REARDON
                         Hey, Beau.

               FELTON looks at his KIDS, breaks into a grin. As he holds 
               his arms open, SACK and ALLY run to him, jump on bed.

                                     REARDON
                         Ally, Zack, be careful.

                                     FELTON
                         It's okay.

               FELTON holds his CHILDREN in his arms, tight.

                                     REARDON
                         Beth asked me to bring the kids. 
                         How're you feeling?

                                     FELTON
                         Better, now.

               FELTON kisses his KIDS.

                                     ALLY
                         Daddy, you look ugly.

                                     FELTON
                         I look kinda tough, don't you think?
                              (makes a face at ALLY)
                         Kinda scary.

               ALLY shrieks with laughter, buries her head in blanket. ZACK 
               pulls on FELTON's arm.

                                     ZACK
                         Dad, when're you gonna come home? I 
                         wanna show you how good I can throw 
                         now.

                                     FELTON
                         You've been practicing, huh?

                                     ZACK
                         Yeah.

                                     FELTON
                         That's good, kiddo.

               FELTON gives ZACK a hug, gathering him and ALLY in his lap. 
               He turn to REARDON.

                                     FELTON
                         How's my partner, Kay Howard? Have 
                         you heard anything? The doctor's 
                         won't tell me.

               REARDON looks at ZACK and ALLY, gets change from his pocket.

                                     REARDON
                         Zack, take your sister down the hall 
                         to the snack machine. You can each 
                         get a candy bar.

                                     ZACK
                         Awh --

                                     FELTON
                         Hey, hey, none of that, alright? You 
                         do what your uncle says.

                                     ZACK
                         C'mon, Ally.

               ZACK helps ALLY down off bed.

                                     FELTON
                         Get a candy bar for me too, okay? 
                         The food in this joint's lousy.

               ZACK takes ALLY by the hand, they exit. FELTON turns to 
               REARDON.

                                     FELTON
                         Talk to me.

                                     REARDON
                         Kay's out of surgery... But she's 
                         still in critical condition.

                                     FELTON
                         Critical condition? What does that 
                         mean?

                                     REARDON
                         She had a bullet through her heart, 
                         Beau. She was in surgery for six 
                         hours. They don't know if she's going 
                         to make it.

                                     FELTON
                         What do you mean? Kay could die?

               REARDON looks FELTON in the eye, nods his head. FELTON leans 
               back.

                                     FELTON
                         She might die...

               As FELTON stares into nothingness.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               MUNCH, DRUMMOND, PEMBLETON and BAYLISS with UNIFORMS descend 
               on escalator.

                                     MUNCH
                         Looks like "Clockwork Orange" down 
                         here.

                                     BAYLISS
                         What?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         "Clockwork Orange". That's with Ronald 
                         Reagan in it, right?

                                     MUNCH
                         No, Mitch. Ronald Reagan is not in 
                         "Clockwork Orange". You're thinking 
                         of "Bedtime for Bonzo."

               They reach the ground floor and approach the locker area, 
               UNIFORMS fanning out, guns drawn. The Detectives search for 
               the locker number.

                                     BAYLISS
                         This is it. Seven-three-four-two-
                         nine.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Mitch, you got the key?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Right here.

               DRUMMOND takes key out of plastic bag, tries to open the 
               locker.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         It's stuck.

               DRUMMOND struggles as WALKER and LEWIS approach.

                                     LEWIS
                         The station manager said there's 
                         only one key to this locker.

               DRUMMOND struggles with key until locker pops open. There's 
               a duffel bag inside. WALKER slips on gloves, opens the bag. 
               MUNCH, LEWIS, BAYLISS, and PEMBLETON lean in.

                                     LEWIS
                         Awh, jeez. Look at this.

                                     WALKER
                         Holton's pornography collection.

                                     BAYLISS
                              (to WALKER)
                         You said this stuff is valuable to 
                         Holton. Valuable enough that he'll 
                         come back here?

                                     WALKER
                         Yeah, it's a good bet.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I want all the entrance and exits 
                         covered. I want every single janitor, 
                         ticket taker and passenger in this 
                         place to be one of our people.

               As the DETECTIVES get to work,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               MEGAN RUSSERT stands in doorway of office. Captain GEORGE 
               BARNFATHER sits behind desk, Colonel BERT GRANGER stands.

                                     RUSSERT
                         You wanted to see me?

                                     GRANGER
                         Come in, Megan.

               RUSSERT enters, sits in empty chair in front of desk.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         You're not going to like it, but we 
                         want you to review Giardello.

                                     RUSSERT
                         I don't follow.

                                     GRANGER
                         Three police officers were shot during 
                         what should have been a routine lock-
                         up. Was Giardello negligent? Was 
                         anything overlooked or omitted that 
                         should have been taken care of?

                                     RUSSERT
                         You're asking me to investigate 
                         Giardello?

                                     BARNFATHER
                         You're of equal rank. We wouldn't 
                         ask you to investigate.

                                     GRANGER
                         The shootings occurred on Giardello's 
                         shift. That makes him responsible, 
                         fault or no fault.

                                     RUSSERT
                         I don't think I'm the best person 
                         for the job.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         We need a full report and we need it 
                         as soon as possible.

                                     RUSSERT
                         I would prefer this be assigned to 
                         someone else.

                                     GRANGER
                         This isn't a request, Megan. Are you 
                         saying you're refusing to follow a 
                         department order?

                              (beat)
                         No.

               On Russert, conflicted,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               The Shooting Area is still taped off. Broken plaster and 
               holes pockmark the walls. Large dark stains of dried blood 
               paint the walls and carpet. MUNCH stares down at the floor 
               at the vague shape of a body outlined in blood. DRUMMOND 
               measures blood splatters on the wall, then pins lengths of 
               string to each stain.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Hold this up that hole.

               DRUMMOND hands MUNCH the end of a long piece of string, points 
               to a large shattered hole in the mortar of the wall.

                                     MUNCH
                         So this is like, what, pin the tail 
                         on the Crime Scene?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I'm gonna reconstruct what happened, 
                         so when we catch out good friend 
                         Holton, which we will eventually do, 
                         we got enough evidence to put him 
                         away.

                                     MUNCH
                         What're you talking about? I was 
                         here. I know what happened.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         You're an unreliable witness. 
                         Hysterical. Biased.

               DRUMMOND pins the other end of the string to a point on the 
               staircase.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Stanley was standing there.

                                     MUNCH
                         You're right, but how do you know 
                         that?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Because he took a shot to the left 
                         temporal lobe. The bullet grazed the 
                         skull and fractured it. Head wounds 
                         bleed like crazy. Wall's clean there 
                         above and below.

               MUNCH turns and looks at the wall. It is clean. He looks a 
               foot farther over. Another impact hole with a faded yellow 
               stain just below.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Blood always reacts in a given way 
                         depending on the weapon. Bullets 
                         spray blood faster and farther than 
                         a baseball bat would. Knife wounds 
                         drip more often.

                                     MUNCH
                         We went to the same Police Academy, 
                         how did I miss this course?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         You didn't. I just did some extra 
                         credit work. Went to the Corning 
                         Forensic Institute in upstate New 
                         York.

               DRUMMOND pins another string up over a smaller dark red stain.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Felton went down here.

                                     MUNCH
                         Why isn't there more blood?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         His wounds hit muscle and fat. They 
                         closed up fairly fast.

                                     MUNCH
                         He ain't no Mr. Macrobiotic, that's 
                         for sure. Being a little tubby might 
                         have saved his life. Howard suffered 
                         the most blood loss.
                              (pointing to floor)
                         That's where she went down. Felton 
                         grabbed the banister here.
                              (point out bloody 
                              handprint.)
                         Gotta hand it to him. He was probably 
                         trying to stand up and give back a 
                         little of what he got.
                              (looks at bloodstain)
                         That's Stan's blood, huh?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Blood is blood. Don't get emotional 
                         about it.

               DRUMMOND goes up the stairs and looks down at the scene. He 
               considers something and then goes up one more stair.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         The shooter was standing here.

               MUNCH looks up at DRUMMOND as he points imaginary pistols 
               down at him.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I'm scared. The cops are coming to 
                         bust me. I got nothing to lose. They 
                         see me. I got no choice. The first 
                         shot misses. Then I get the woman in 
                         the chest. Before she goes down -- 
                         her partner turns with his Glock. I 
                         pop him twice. The older cop's eyes 
                         get real big. He knows what's coming. 
                         I hit him in the head. I stop 
                         shooting.
                              (turning, looks 
                              upstairs)
                         And I run upstairs.

               He looks at MUNCH, who is both mesmerized and amazed.

                                     MUNCH
                         What in the hell must your dreams be 
                         like?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Usually my wife's just caught me en 
                         flagrante with Sharon Stone.

                                     MUNCH
                         And?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         She joins us.

                                     MUNCH
                         Stan never mentioned your psychotic 
                         libido.

               As Drummond shrugs,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               BAYLISS and PEMBLETON sit on bench, staking out Locker Area 
               across Station.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Can you think of any place more 
                         depressing than a subway station?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         A lot of people take the subway.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Yeah, I know, but, still.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Still, what? Taking the subway is a 
                         very economical, efficient way to 
                         get to work. When I lived in New 
                         York, I took the subway everyday.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Airports, they're kind of exciting. 
                         Train stations have a certain glamour. 
                         Even bus stations have some ambiance. 
                         Subways are just... drab.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You're telling me you're too good to 
                         take the subway?

                                     BAYLISS
                         I'm not saying that. I'm saying if I 
                         had a choice, I would take the bus. 
                         Or rent a car.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Well, you know, not everybody takes 
                         the subway because they've got no 
                         choice. Some people take the subway 
                         because they enjoy taking the subway.

                                     BAYLISS
                         I'm looking around here, Frank. The 
                         one thing I do not see is anybody 
                         having a good time.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You're a snob, you know that?

                                     BAYLISS
                         I'm not a snob.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Yeah, you are. And you're the worst 
                         kind of snob because you refuse to 
                         accept that you are a snob. You truly 
                         believe you're one with the common 
                         man. But I bet you'd rather walk 
                         than take the subway.

               BAYLISS' attention is caught by a YOUNG WOMAN, plain, anxious, 
               as she walks towards lockers, looks around.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Frank what do you think?

               They watch the YOUNG WOMAN stop at Holton's locker.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Is that him? Wearing a dress?

                                     BAYLISS
                         Sure, a disguise. Maybe.

               The YOUNG WOMAN pulls out a key, fumbles with it nervously 
               at the locker.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Where'd the key come from?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Holton made a copy. Let's go.

               BAYLISS and PEMBLETON move toward the locker, pulling out 
               their guns. More UNDERCOVER COPS materialize from the walls.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Hold it.

               PEMBLETON throws ALICE NANCE, the young woman, against the 
               wall. BAYLISS pats her down. They see her face. She is indeed 
               a young woman. Kind of pretty.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     NANCE
                         Alice Nance.
                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         You're hurting my arm.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You know Glen Holton?

                                     NANCE
                         Know him? I love him. He's my 
                         boyfriend.

               On BAYLISS and PEMBLETON, surprised,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               FELTON sits in bed. LEWIS appears in doorway, holding a 
               stuffed giraffe.

                                     LEWIS
                         Hey, Beau. How're you doing?

                                     FELTON
                         Good.

                                     LEWIS
                         That's good to hear.

               A beat, as LEWIS hands in the doorway.

                                     FELTON
                         Meldrick.

                                     LEWIS
                         What?

                                     FELTON
                         You can come in. What I got, it ain't 
                         catching.

                                     LEWIS
                         Right, sure.

               LEWIS, uncomfortable, enters, sits in chair next to bed. He 
               hands FELTON giraffe.

                                     LEWIS
                         I got this for you.

                                     FELTON
                         Thanks.

                                     LEWIS
                         It's from the gift shop downstairs. 
                         It was either a stuffed animal or 
                         wilted begonias.

                                     FELTON
                         This is great.

               FELTON holds giraffe.

                                     FELTON
                         Thanks for coming. I know everybody's 
                         busting their ass, looking for Holton.

                                     LEWIS
                         We're gonna get him. Soon.

                                     FELTON
                              (nods, beat)
                         I wanted to ask you a question.

                                     LEWIS
                         Shoot. I mean... Y'know what I mean. 
                         Anyway.

               FELTON fiddles with the giraffe, then looks up.

                                     FELTON
                         When Crosetti died... How'd you get 
                         over it?

                                     LEWIS
                         Awh, Beau... Kay's not gonna die. 
                         She's not.

                                     FELTON
                         I don't know that.

                                     LEWIS
                         You can't think about it.

                                     FELTON
                         Why not?

                                     LEWIS
                         Because you just can't.

                                     FELTON
                         Kay might die. I'm not gonna close 
                         my eyes and pretend that nothing 
                         bad's gonna happen. Because you know 
                         what? It already did. So you gotta 
                         tell me, what're you supposed to do 
                         when your partner dies on you?

                                     LEWIS
                         What you do is... You keep going.

                                     FELTON
                         What do you mean, you keep going?

                                     LEWIS
                         You get up, you do your job, you 
                         make it through every day... And you 
                         hope that one day you're gonna wake 
                         up and it won't hurt so much. Then 
                         the next day it will hurt a little 
                         less, and the next day, even less 
                         than that.

               LEWIS takes a beat, searches for the words.

                                     LEWIS
                         It's not like you forget them, you 
                         know? Your life is changed forever. 
                         It's not ever gonna go back to the 
                         way it was... But you get through 
                         it... You just keep going on.

               A beat, as FELTON contemplates this advice.

                                     FELTON
                         That's it? Keep going?

                                     LEWIS
                         That's it.

               FELTON looks at giraffe in his lap, then up at LEWIS.

                                     FELTON
                         Meldrick, that's the stupidest thing 
                         I ever heard.

                                     LEWIS
                         You're spitting on my advice. You 
                         call me down here, I open my heart 
                         to you, and now you're spiting on 
                         what I got to say.

                                     FELTON
                         Basically, yeah.

                                     LEWIS
                         Then gimme back the giraffe.

                                     FELTON
                         What? Forget it.

                                     LEWIS
                         You don't like my advice, you ain't 
                         getting the giraffe.

               On FELTON, stubborn, as he holds onto the giraffe,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               PEMBLETON, BAYLISS and WALKER interrogate NANCE.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Holton loves you, huh?

                                     NANCE
                         Glen. His name is Glen. Yeah, he 
                         loves me.

                                     WALKER
                         Alice -- Is it alright if we call 
                         you Alice?

                                     NANCE
                         Sure.

                                     WALKER
                         Alice, do you know where Glen is?

                                     NANCE
                         No.

                                     BAYLISS
                         How long have you been Glen's 
                         girlfriend?

                                     NANCE
                         We met at the Hollywood Diner. That's 
                         where I work. He used to come in all 
                         the time. He didn't tip so great, 
                         but he talked to me. He's very 
                         intelligent. Knows about cosmology. 
                         The stars and stuff.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Have you talked to him recently?

                                     NANCE
                         Sure. Yesterday.

                                     BAYLISS
                         I thought you didn't know where he 
                         is?

               Silence.

                                     WALKER
                         What did he tell you?

                                     NANCE
                              (pauses)
                         He said the cops are gonna kill him. 
                         He said you think he shot three cops 
                         and he was dead meat.

                                     WALKER
                         No one wants to kill him.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         What we want to do, Alice, is protect 
                         Glen. But we can't do that if we 
                         don't know where he is.

                                     NANCE
                         You want to protect him?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         What did he tell you would happen to 
                         him if he stayed on the street?

                                     NANCE
                         He said he's gonna get killed.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Did you believe him?

                                     NANCE
                         Everybody thinks he shot those cops. 
                         But he told me he didn't. And I 
                         believe him. That's why he came to 
                         me instead of his stupid, ugly mother. 
                         He knows I love him better'n anybody.

                                     BAYLISS
                         So you and Glen went out, dated, for 
                         how long?

                                     NANCE
                         Well, we never actually went out or 
                         anything.

                                     WALKER
                         Then how do you know he loves you?

                                     NANCE
                         I can tell. He would never say 
                         anything, but I can tell. He needs 
                         me.

               The DETECTIVES exchange glances.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You want Glen to be safe, alive?

                                     NANCE
                         Glen had a terrible childhood, you 
                         know. His stepfather abused him.

                                     WALKER
                         If you tell us where he is, Alice, 
                         he'll be off the street. He'll be 
                         safe.

                                     NANCE
                         You're gonna put him in jail.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         If he's in jail, no one's gonna kill 
                         him. We can watch over him.

                                     NANCE
                         You're gonna watch over him?

                                     WALKER
                         Yeah, we are. We're gonna watch over 
                         him. We're gonna make sure he's safe.

                                     NANCE
                         That's what he needs. Someone to 
                         take care of him. Someone to love 
                         him. Like that Beatles song: "All 
                         You Need Is Love".

                                     BAYLISS
                         If you love Glen, Alice, you'll tell 
                         us where he is. You'll protect him. 
                         You'll help us make sure he's safe.

                                     NANCE
                              (pauses)
                         His father was a carpenter. His real 
                         father, I mean. He died when Glen 
                         was five... He used to take Glen 
                         down to the shipyard, you know, where 
                         he worked on boats. Glen says his 
                         favorite smells in the whole world 
                         are sawdust and coffee and cigarettes, 
                         because they remind him of his dad.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Which shipyard, Alice?

                         Over by Proctor and gamble.

               As PEMBLETON stands and leaves, followed by BAYLISS and 
               WALKER,

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                        ACT THREE

               FADE IN:


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS enter. QRT Lieutenant JASPER is setting 
               up a stakeout post. Windows overlook a rundown section of 
               the old working harbor of the Patapsco Bay. The object of 
               the stakeout is a Freighter, tied to a pier. JASPER lowers 
               his binoculars as PEMBLETON approaches.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Any sign of him yet?

                                     JASPER
                         No. I sent two guys down into the 
                         ship an hour ago. They found a 
                         sleeping bag and some empty soda 
                         bottles.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You sure he's coming back?

                                     JASPER
                         Yeah. He's got a picture of his mother 
                         down there. He's calling this place 
                         home. If you want to, you can go 
                         back downtown and I'll call you when 
                         he shows.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         We're not going anywhere.

               As PEMBLETON and BAYLISS hunker down for the long wait,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               GIARDELLO walks in and sees RUSSERT sitting behind the desk.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Hello, Al.

                         Hello, Megan. I was just over at the 
                         hospital. Stanley's a little better. 
                         He's still unconscious, but the 
                         swelling's gone down in his brain.

                                     RUSSERT
                         That's good news. I hear Frank's 
                         staked out the shipyard over by 
                         Proctor and Gamble.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Yeah. Finally a break. I think I can 
                         send you and your people home for a 
                         well deserved four hours of sleep 
                         before your regular shift starts.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Al, we gotta talk.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         About what?

                                     RUSSERT
                         Barnfather and Granger asked me to 
                         write up a report. They want to know 
                         why three detectives we ambushed.

               GIARDELLO pauses; looks at RUSSERT, realizing what she's 
               just said.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         You're going to grade my homework?

                                     RUSSERT
                         They gave me no choice.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         You're a good soldier. You do what 
                         you're told.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Al, come on --

                                     GIARDELLO
                         So far this year, I had three of my 
                         officers shot down. I've had a 
                         suicide. This place is going to hell 
                         all around me and all I'm trying to 
                         do is keep things together. So why 
                         don't you tell me what you want to 
                         know?

                                     RUSSERT
                         Did you initial the arrest warrant?

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Yes.

                                     RUSSERT
                         You didn't notice that the secretary 
                         had transposed the numbers on the 
                         address?

                                     GIARDELLO
                         No.

                                     RUSSERT
                              (hesitates)
                         I'll need all your case folders, the 
                         paperwork requesting a warrant for 
                         Glen Holton's arrest, whatever you've 
                         got.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         I'll have Naomi take care of it.

               RUSSERT stands, walks out. As GIARDELLO sits down, agonized,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A NURSE pushes FELTON, who lies on a gurney, back to his 
               room. FELTON'S eyes are open, his neck immobilized. They 
               turn a corner as WESLEY HOWARD see them and approaches.

                                     WESLEY
                         Detective Felton?

               The NURSE stops a moment.

                                     WESLEY
                         I'm Kay Howard's father.

                                     FELTON
                         Oh. Hi. I'm sorry... about Kay.

               WESLEY walks next to the gurney as they continue on.

                                     FELTON
                         How's she doing?

                                     WESLEY
                         She's stable. She's maintained a 
                         steady body temperature for eight 
                         hours now. But she hasn't woken up 
                         yet. How are you?

                                     FELTON
                         Better. Waiting to see if the swelling 
                         does down around my spinal cord. 
                         Waiting to see if I get the feeling 
                         back in my legs.

               THEY get to Felton's room.


               The NURSE sidles the gurney up next to the bed.

                                     WESLEY
                         Let me help.

               WESLEY and the NURSE lift FELTON off the gurney. FELTON 
               touches WESLEY's arm for steadiness. They lay FELTON back 
               down in his bed. WESLEY pulls the covers back up to keep 
               FELTON warm. The Nurse leaves. WESLEY pulls a chair over to 
               the bedside.

                                     FELTON
                         Kay... She'll be alright?

                                     WESLEY
                         I hope so.

                                     FELTON
                         Funny...

                                     WESLEY
                         What?

                                     FELTON
                         All my life I've thought I was bullet-
                         proof. Now I'm lying here... And the 
                         only person I'm missing is the 
                         sonofabitch who left me when I was a 
                         kid. My dad. Instead, it's my 
                         partner's father sitting by my side.

               FELTON smiles.

                                     WESLEY
                         His loss.

                                     FELTON
                         I'm just hoping my kids are still 
                         young enough that they won't 
                         understand how scary this is...

               FELTON is struggling to get something out.

                                     FELTON
                         I'm sorry. About... for what happened 
                         to Kay.

                                     WESLEY
                         You didn't pull that trigger.

                                     FELTON
                         I know, but I... opened the door for 
                         her to walk in first.

                                     WESLEY
                         Chivalry.

                                     FELTON
                         It got her shot.

                                     WESLEY
                         You seen her yet?

                                     FELTON
                         No. I can't. I've tried a couple of 
                         times, but I can't. It's my fault 
                         she's in there.

                                     WESLEY
                         Let me tell you something... If you 
                         hadn't opened that door for Kay, she 
                         would have opened it herself.

               FELTON manages a weak smile. WESLEY stands, pats FELTON on 
               the hand, then walks out. As FELTON looks outside,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS, binoculars in hand, are looking all 
               over the are outline and the pier leading up to the old 
               Freighter. BAYLISS stops in mid-pan. He taps PEMBLETON.

                                     BAYLISS
                         He just came home.

               PEMBLETON takes another look through his binoculars POV 
               THROUGH BINOCULARS: HOLTON walking up the gangway leading 
               into the ship. PEMBLETON turns to JASPER.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I'll call my people.

               On Pembleton,

                                                               TIME CUT TO:


               QRTs and DETECTIVES scramble through the dark, dank cabins 
               and storage areas looking for Holton. Flashlights dance strobe-
               like across the screen and then whip-pan down long menacing 
               companion ways.


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS make their way deeper into the ship 
               and enter one of the holds. PEMBLETON motions toward a corner 
               of the hold and spots his flashlight on a bag of fast food. 
               PEMBLETON looks at BAYLISS. PEMBLETON quietly speaks into 
               his radio.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         He's in here.

               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS keep moving.


               MUNCH, WALKER, DRUMMOND, and LEWIS move quietly down another 
               cramped companion way following a QRT OFFICER. MUNCH hears 
               something. He turns his flashlight into the darkness of a 
               nearby cabin. HOLTON scrambles away out of the flashlight's 
               beam and runs down another companion way. MUNCH talks into 
               radio.

                                     MUNCH
                         I found him. He's running toward the 
                         stern.

               As the entire ship explodes in SCREAMING VOICES of QRT 
               OFFICERS and DETECTIVES,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               HOLTON, terrified, slides down the railing of the ladder. 
               FOOTSTEPS running out of the darkness behind HOLTON turn out 
               to be PEMBLETON and BAYLISS, who come racing behind.


               QRT OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are swarming down companions 
               ways and stairs, closing in for the kill.


               The engines are solid hulks of rusting iron. HOLTON comes 
               running in and darts behind one of the old turbines. MUNCH, 
               WALKER, DRUMMOND, LEWIS and SIX QRTs come running in after 
               him. PEMBLETON and BAYLISS enter from another door. PEMBLETON 
               holds his flashlight and his pistol up.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Don't move.

               HOLTON's trapped like rat in the beam of Pembleton's light. 
               BAYLISS grabs HOLTON, who struggles. BAYLISS hits him with 
               his fist. Stops himself. Gazes at PEMBLETON, wired, adrenaline 
               pumped. Beat. BAYLISS cuffs HOLTON.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Glen Holton, you are under arrest 
                         for the attempted murder of three 
                         Baltimore City Police Officers.

               As PEMBLETON continues to Mirandize HOLTON,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               BARNFATHER sits at his desk as RUSSERT lays a file folder 
               and report in front of him. BARNFATHER reacts to the thin 
               folder and few pages of report.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         This is it? Your full report?

                                     RUSSERT
                         Yes, sir. It's all there. Al was 
                         extremely forthcoming.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         And?

                                     RUSSERT
                         This was a routine arrest of the 
                         suspect who never demonstrated any 
                         proclivity for use of firearms. Our 
                         people had more than adequate back-
                         up. They were wearing their vests. 
                         The administrative assistant who 
                         typed the arrest warrant transposed 
                         the apartment number. Instead of 
                         knocking on two-one-oh and thereby 
                         facing the stairway where the suspect 
                         was lying in wait, the detectives 
                         turned the other way to knock on two-
                         oh-one.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         Why didn't Al double check the 
                         specifics? Why didn't he catch the 
                         transposition?

                                     RUSSERT
                         He's a busy man...

                                     BARNFATHER
                         Megan, did Al initial the orders to 
                         arrest?

                                     RUSSERT
                              (hesitates)
                         No.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         No?

                                     RUSSERT
                         No.

               GIARDELLO comes into the office, faces BARNFATHER.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         If you want to ask me any questions, 
                         ask them directly.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Al, it's okay, we're almost done --

                                     GIARDELLO
                         I review and initial all warrants. I 
                         reviewed and initialed the warrant 
                         for the arrest of Glen Holton. I 
                         screwed up.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         That's not what Megan told me.

               GIARDELLO understands quickly that RUSSERT must have just 
               lied for him.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         Megan?

                                     RUSSERT
                         If you had allocated funds for a new 
                         computer system, it might have slowed 
                         down the endless piles of paperwork 
                         Al and I have to deal with. As a 
                         result of those piles, we sometimes 
                         have detectives out making arrests 
                         before we can initial the warrants.

               BARNFATHER considers this.

                                     BARNFATHER
                         It was Granger's idea to save money 
                         by not buying the new computer system. 
                         I'll remind him of that. Al, Megan.

               Dismissed, GIARDELLO and RUSSERT walk out the door, leaving 
               BARNFATHER to stare at the files.


               GIARDELLO and RUSSERT walk away from Barnfather's Office. A 
               moment of silence before GIARDELLO speaks.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         You didn't have to do that.

                                     RUSSERT
                              (innocent)
                         What?

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Lie for me.

                                     RUSSERT
                         I probably misunderstood the question.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         The truth is, I should have caught 
                         that mistake.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Bull.

               GIARDELLO stops, looks at RUSSERT.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         You shouldn't have lied, but thanks.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Lying to those guys? They're only 
                         getting what they give.

               LEWIS appears, looking for them.

                                     LEWIS
                         We got the shooter, Gee.

               As GIARDELLO and RUSSERT hurry after LEWIS,

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                     END OF ACT THREE

                                         ACT FOUR

               FADE IN:


               Three dozen or so OFFICERS and DETECTIVES, including 
               GIARDELLO, RUSSERT, WALKER, DRUMMOND, MUNCH and LEWIS, are 
               looking over at "The Box", trying to glean some hint of how 
               the interrogation is going. MOVE IN toward the window as 
               PEMBLETON closes the blinds.


               PEMBLETON closing the blinds, turns to HOLTON. HOLTON is 
               handcuffed to the interrogation table. There is a welt on 
               his right cheek. His lower lip is split. PEMBLETON leans 
               across the table hovering inches above HOLTON. BAYLISS leans 
               against the wall directly behind HOLTON.

                                     HOLTON
                         What? You guys gonna bash me around 
                         some more? Where's my lawyer?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Do you need a lawyer? What are you 
                         guilty of?

               HOLTON smirks, leans away from PEMBLETON.

                                     HOLTON
                         I don't have to be guilty of anything 
                         to have a lawyer. I know the routine, 
                         awright?

               HOLTON strains to look back at BAYLISS.

                                     HOLTON
                         Do you gotta stand in back of me?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         What, my partner makes you nervous? 
                         Why would you be nervous? You haven't 
                         done anything. What I think and why 
                         you're nervous are two separate items. 
                         I know the routine, too, okay?

                                     BAYLISS
                         Why are you so nervous?

                                     HOLTON
                         I heard about that kid who was killed 
                         last week.

                                     BAYLISS
                         And that makes you nervous?

                                     HOLTON
                         I had nothing to do with it.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Who here says you did?

                                     HOLTON
                         Then why am I here?

                                     BAYLISS
                         You shot three police officers.

                                     HOLTON
                         I didn't shoot anybody. I ain't even 
                         got a gun. I don't like guns.
                              (to BAYLISS)
                         I don't like people standing behind 
                         me, either.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Why, it reminds you?

                                     HOLTON
                         I just don't like it, awright?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Anyone doing time up at Jessup, they 
                         know about someone standing in back 
                         of them, don't they? It's a kind of 
                         instinct you develop, huh?

                                     HOLTON
                         I didn't do anything to that kid and 
                         I didn't shoot any cops.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You're going for one or the other. 
                         Take your pick.

                                     BAYLISS
                         The cops are still alive. The kid is 
                         dead. Your choice.

                                     HOLTON
                         I didn't do anything.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         They why were you on the run?

                                     HOLTON
                         Gimme an aspirin. I got a helluva 
                         headache.

                                     BAYLISS
                         If you're innocent, why run?

                                     HOLTON
                         I was scared, awright?

                                     BAYLISS
                         About the three cops, huh? You knew 
                         if you were caught, it'd be your 
                         ass, right? But you're here now and 
                         nothing wrong can happen to you.

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (to BAYLISS)
                         If it was me, I'd cop to shooting 
                         the three detectives. In Jessup, I 
                         might be given a little space. A 
                         little respect.

                                     BAYLISS
                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         All of those guys in Jessup, they 
                         didn't put themselves in there. A 
                         cop who put 'em in there and someone 
                         who shoots three of them, jeez, 
                         there's someone with special light 
                         on him. There's someone with a 
                         different energy.

                                     HOLTON
                         There's no way I'm copping to either 
                         of these deals, fellas. Where's my 
                         lawyer, huh?

                                     BAYLISS
                         We're just thinking out loud, awright?
                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         If I killed that kid, I'd demand to 
                         be put in isolation. I'd need 
                         protection.

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (to BAYLISS)
                         But then who could you trust? Who 
                         else is in protective isolation with 
                         you?

                                     BAYLISS
                         I'd be there with special guards.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         But I wouldn't trust them. They'd be 
                         the last guys I'd trust.

                                     BAYLISS
                         They have families, too, don't they?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         They have kids. Anyone with kids, I 
                         wouldn't want them guarding me.

                                     BAYLISS
                         I see your point. Mistakes are made 
                         all the time.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Someone turns their head for a second. 
                         Some guard leaves a security door 
                         unlocked for a moment. Real wrong 
                         things can happen.

                                     HOLTON
                         How 'bout you two don't think out 
                         loud anymore, awright?

               On HOLTON, looking miserable,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               FELTON struggles to move his injured leg. DR.RODNEY FRENCH 
               stands at the foot of Felton's bed. A NURSE applies an ice 
               compress to FELTON's shoulder.

                                     FELTON
                         I'm telling you, it's the foot, not 
                         the shoulder.

                                     FRENCH
                         Your shoulder is awright?

                                     FELTON
                         It's my foot. I can't move it.

                                     FRENCH
                         Any pain in the foot?

                                     FELTON
                         My whole damn leg is on fire.

                                     FRENCH
                         Good sign.

                                     FELTON
                         Pain is a good sign? You make a living 
                         for saying things like that?

               RUSSERT enters, watches from doorway. FRENCH reads chart.

                                     FRENCH
                         All of the tests on your leg show 
                         there's been no damage to the major 
                         arteries or to the bone structure.

                         Then why the hell can't I move it?

                                     FRENCH
                         It's psychological pain.

                                     FELTON
                         Hey, here's my head, there's my leg. 
                         My head is fine, awright? What did 
                         anatomy classes get canceled when 
                         you were in school?

                                     FRENCH
                         Naw. I just flunked 'em. That's why 
                         I'm your doc instead of someone else.
                              (to NURSE)
                         I'm scheduling Detective Felton for 
                         therapy on his neck and shoulder 
                         starting tomorrow.

               FRENCH and NURSE walk out. RUSSERT comes to Felton's bedside.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Hi.

                                     FELTON
                         Hi.

                                     RUSSERT
                         You'll be dancing soon.

                                     FELTON
                         Any day.

                                     RUSSERT
                         Where's Beth?

                                     FELTON
                         She can't stand to see me, weak or 
                         strong. Hard to blame her, really.

               RUSSERT sits down.

                                     FELTON
                         You know, I've been lying here... 
                         thinking... not my strong point, 
                         but... You tend to see things clearly 
                         when you think your life is ending... 
                         And what I know is... Beth and I 
                         don't love each other anymore. We 
                         shouldn't be together.

                                     RUSSERT
                         You're not in the best condition to 
                         be making major decisions, Beau.

                                     FELTON
                         My parents tried to stay together as 
                         long as they could for the sake of 
                         my brothers and me. And it was the 
                         worst kind of screwed up thing they 
                         could have done to us. Because all 
                         the while they played kissy face all 
                         we heard was yelling, all we saw was 
                         fighting.

               RUSSERT doesn't know what to say.

                                     FELTON
                         I don't want my children to ever 
                         hear me yell at their mother again. 
                         I don't want my children to ever lie 
                         awake late at night and hear me 
                         crying... I just pray she doesn't 
                         use custody of the kids as a weapon.

                                     RUSSERT
                         You've told her?

                                     FELTON
                         On the phone. Today.

               RUSSERT pours a glass of water from a pitcher on the bedside 
               table and holds the cup to FELTON's lips. As FELTON drinks,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               BAYLISS remains, like a vulture, behind HOLTON. PEMBLETON 
               throws his hands in the air.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Alright. That's enough. We got him 
                         on the killing of Borkin, let's just 
                         charge him.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Frank, what're you talking about?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         We have the Indian-beaded belt from 
                         the Borkin kid. We found it in his 
                         closet. We know the kid was in his 
                         apartment.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Well, you got the point. This way, 
                         he goes up for murder.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Exactly. Murder. We convict, he goes 
                         away for life. Maybe even gets the 
                         gas chamber.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Let's do it.

               PEMBLETON stands.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         On your feet, Holton.

                                     HOLTON
                         Hold it, hold it.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         What?

               HOLTON falls silent. PEMBLETON sits back down. BAYLISS leans 
               over HOLTON's shoulders.

                                     BAYLISS
                         We're all human. Fear makes us crazy.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You didn't want to shoot those cops, 
                         did you, Glen?

                                     BAYLISS
                         You were scared.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Fear makes us do strange things. 
                         Things we wouldn't do if there wasn't 
                         all this weight pounding down out 
                         brains. All this terror.

                                     HOLTON
                         You know.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I do.

                                     HOLTON
                         I don't do crazy things, but 
                         sometimes, it's out of my hands. I 
                         don't have control, y'know.

               BAYLISS finally comes around to face HOLTON.

                                     BAYLISS
                         How'd it get out of control, Glen?

                                     HOLTON
                              (pauses)
                         It just did.

                                     BAYLISS
                         I'm trying to understand.

                                     HOLTON
                         I just come out of my apartment. One 
                         of the cops, he sees me, he calls me 
                         to stop.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Which guy?

                                     HOLTON
                         I don't know. The first guy. I figure 
                         I've got nothing to lose, so I run 
                         up to the roof and they come after 
                         me. I'd heard about that kid and I 
                         knew they'd be pissed.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         So before you get to the roof, what 
                         happens?

                                     HOLTON
                         I'm scared of heights, fellas, and I 
                         got nowhere to go.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You're not on the roof, Glen.

                                     HOLTON
                         I'm on the roof.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You're still in the hallway.

                                     HOLTON
                              (pauses)
                         I know where I was. You're trying to 
                         screw with me.

               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS exchange a glance. HOLTON notices the 
               glance.

                                     HOLTON
                         These three cops had their guns aimed 
                         at me.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You saw this.

                                     HOLTON
                         Three of 'em.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         On the roof.

                                     HOLTON
                         You go up there. You take me there. 
                         I'll show you exactly where I was. 
                         Right by the drainpipe. And they had 
                         their guns and they weren't saying 
                         "stop" of anything to me. They had 
                         this look in their eyes.

                                     BAYLISS
                         So you pull out a gun, huh?

                                     HOLTON
                              (pauses)
                         I don't remember. I think I had my 
                         gun already out.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         But you don't like guns. You're scared 
                         of 'em. How do you end up with a 
                         gun?

                                     HOLTON
                              (pauses)
                         All's I know is I have this gun --

                                     BAYLISS
                         -- What kind of gun?

                                     HOLTON
                         A gun.
                              (beat, grimaces)
                         One of those guns you get on the 
                         street.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         One gun?

                                     HOLTON
                              (beat, smiles)
                         Why do you keep screwing with me? 
                         Yeah, one gun.

                                     BAYLISS
                         And you shoot the three detectives.

                                     HOLTON
                              (pauses)
                         It happened so fast. I don't know. 
                         And then I ran back down the stairs.

               BAYLISS leans into HOLTON's face.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You didn't shoot anyone.

                                     HOLTON
                         No, I'm saying I shot the cops.

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (frustrated)
                         You're lying. You killed Borkin. End 
                         of story.

               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS get up, exit "The Box".


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS emerge, address GIARDELLO.

                                     BAYLISS
                         He's not the one.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         What?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Holton didn't shoot Bolander, Howard 
                         and Felton.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         If he didn't, then who did?

               On PEMBLETON, BAYLISS and GIARDELLO, upset,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               MUNCH sits in a chair, elbows on knees watching BOLANDER, 
               who breathes with the assistance of a machine. DRUMMOND walks 
               in and pulls up a chair across from MUNCH on the other side 
               of Bolander's bed. They look at each other over BOLANDER's 
               body.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Just got off the phone with Giardello. 
                         Holton wasn't the shooter.

                                     MUNCH
                         What?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         He's just been charged with he murder 
                         of the kid. He's didn't pop Stan or 
                         the other two.

                                     MUNCH
                         What the hell.  So somewhere there 
                         tonight the real killer's having 
                         some buffalo wings and the beer and 
                         laughing his ass off.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         No one died.

                                     MUNCH
                         He shot to kill. That makes him a 
                         killer.

               DRUMMOND looks at BOLANDER.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Look at him. He's a damn vegetable.

               MUNCH laughs. DRUMMOND looks up.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         That cracks you up?

                                     MUNCH
                         Stan hates vegetables. Carrots 
                         especially. He breaks out in hives.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Your partner is lying here, maybe 
                         never to open his eyes again and 
                         you're laughing? How the hell do you 
                         do that?

                                     MUNCH
                         He's always said I have a sick sense 
                         of humor.

               MUNCH looks at BOLANDER.

                                     MUNCH
                         He never liked me as much as he liked 
                         you.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I'm not sure that's anything to 
                         regret.

                                     MUNCH
                         He ever make you eat sour beef and 
                         dumplings at Rollos?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Yeah, all the damn time.

               MUNCH manages a smile.

                                     MUNCH
                         He never took me.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Really?

                                     MUNCH
                         Not once.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Then he does like you, John. He made 
                         me eat that slop three times a week.

               They consider BOLANDER. Beat. MUNCH stands.

                                     MUNCH
                         Want to... get a beer, or something?

               DRUMMOND stands.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Sure.

               As DRUMMOND and MUNCH walk out together,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               CU on "The Board". As "B-O-R-K-I-N" in RED is erased and 
               rewritten in BLACK under Howard's name,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               HOLTON is eating a sandwich and having a carton of milk off 
               a stainless steel tray. As he eats, he's humming "Pop Goes 
               The Weasel". The GUARD outside the cell just watches him and 
               shakes his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A twelve-year old BOY, in a leg-cast, in a wheelchair with 
               an IV hooked up, is watching an old "Starsky and Hutch" 
               episode on TV. FELTON, in wheelchair, slowly wheels himself 
               in and looks up at the TV. He watches for a moment, then 
               looks over at the BOY.

                                     FELTON
                         Are you enjoying this?

                                     BOY
                         No. But I can't reach the remote.

               They both look over at a shelf where the remote lies. And 
               then look back at each other knowing neither of them can 
               reach it.

                                     FELTON
                         Cool car they drive anyway. Red and 
                         white seventy-four Gran Torino.

                                     BOY
                         Yeah, but it's so fake. Real cops 
                         don't drive like maniacs all over 
                         the place, acting scared.
                              (turns to FELTON)
                         Real cops don't get scared.

               They sit in silence for a moment while bad tough-guy dialogue 
               wafts from the old television set. FELTON turns, wheels 
               himself out.


               FELTON pushes his wheelchair down the hall.


               HOWARD lies still, her breathing even and getting stronger. 
               A shadow spills in from the doorway. It's FELTON, in his 
               wheelchair. He slowly pulls into the room. As he gets closer 
               he sees that her eyes are open and she's looking right at 
               him.

                                     FELTON
                         How you doing, Kay?

                                     HOWARD
                              (beat; with great 
                              difficulty)
                         Better.

               He reaches for HOWARD's hand and gently holds it in his. As 
               the two PARTNERS look at each other in the darkness,

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
