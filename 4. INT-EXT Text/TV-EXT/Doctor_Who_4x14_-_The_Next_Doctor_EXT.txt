      FX: a quiet corner; wheeze & grind, and the TARDIS appears.

      THE DOCTOR steps out.  It's snowing.  He likes snow!  He
      strolls out of the quiet corner, into...

      A STREET MARKET.  Working class London, busy and bustling. 
      Vendors, cocky lads, working girls, crones, braziers,
      beggars in doorways, hot chestnuts, smoke, steam, the works.

      The Doctor walking through.  Smiling.  He's loving it, the
      colour and bustle and noise; this is what he travels for.

      Throughout all this, a CAROL can be heard; a new Murray
      Gold Christmas Carol.  Jolly & sinister, like the best
      hymns.  The Doctor passes the CAROLLERS, stops for a listen. 

      Then he wanders on, calls out to an URCHIN:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You there, boy, what day is this?

                    Christmas Eve, sir!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    In what year?

                                      URCHIN
                    You thick or something?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Oy!  Answer the question!

                  The 
                    Right.  Nice year.  Bit dull -

      Suddenly, a woman's voice, a distance away, yelling -

                                      ROSITA OOV
                    Doctor!

                    Doctor!!!

      Big grin!  And he's running - !

      TRACK with him, racing through the snow, exhilarated -
      he's actually glad to hear someone calling his name -

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VERY HIGH WAREHOUSES on all sides, with barrels & stuff.  *
      Falling snow, but lighter.  THE DOCTOR comes running in - *

      In the middle: ROSITA, serving-girl, mid-20s, black, feisty.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Right then, don't worry, stand
                    back, what have we got here then..?

      Because Rosita is facing a big WOODEN DOOR.  Which has got
      SOMETHING TRAPPED BEHIND IT.  Trying to get out!  The door
      shudders, at regular intervals, as though being hit by
      something powerful -  Boom!  Boom!  Boom!

      The Doctor & Rosita wary of the door throughout dialogue:

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                      ...ohhkay, I've got it!  And
                                                          Tale
                      whatever's behind that door, I
                    think you should get out of here -

                                      ROSITA
                          (yells off)

                    No, I'm standing right here, hello! 

                                      ROSITA

                    I'm the Doctor.

                  The 
                                      ROSITA
                    Doctor who?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just, the Doctor.

                                      ROSITA
                    Well there can't be two of you!
                          (to the MAN)
                    Where the hell have you been??

      As the MAN comes running into the courtyard - he's lively,
        exhilarated, in frock coat & waistcoat, ever-so-slightly
      dandified.  He sees the door boom!, and loves it (all
      dialogue stays mindful of that about-to-break door) -

                    Hold on, who are you?!

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    I'm the Doctor.  Simply, the Doctor. 
                    The one, the only, and the best.

      - then a bigger boom! makes the Other Doctor face the door.

                    Rosita!  Give me the sonic

      Rosita hands him a screwdriver (no CU on it).

                    If you could stand back, sir - 
                    this is a job for a Time Lord!

                                  Writer's 
      BOOM! - PRAC SPLINTERS fly, the door bursts open - !

      And framed in the DOORWAY is a CYBERSHADE!  It has the
      face of a Cyberman, like a mask; but the rest of it seems
      more supernatural, swathed in black robes, a black hood,
                  The 
      the whole outfit trailing off into back rags; it's a
      Cyberman crossed with a Dementor.  The only other signs of
      metal are its two METAL HANDS, more spindly and witchy
      than a Cyberman's.  Both Doctors (and Rosita) gobsmacked:

                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)OTHER DOCTOR
        That's different!Oh, that's new!

      The CYBERSHADE rears up, with a hissssss, about to attack!

      2-SHOT, both Doctors lift their screwdrivers.  Heroes! 

                                    THE DOCTOR/OTHER DOCTOR
                    Allons-y!

        CLIFFHANGER, INTO TITLES.

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 14 - Pink Amendments - 03/04/08       page 4.




      This dialogue to play into sc.4 Cyber-screens only, from

                    good fortnight, now step back, sir -

      SCENE 5 STARTS:

      CYBERSHADE turns left, crouches down...

      Then it LEAPS UP, out of shot -*

      FX: landing 6 ft up on the wall to the left of the Doctors
      & Rosita - it clings to the wall, like Spider Man, staying
      in this position (ie, for these leaps, CYBERSHADES exist
      as CG models also; again, like Spider Man.)

      CU Cybershade, turning its head round and hissing at them.

      THE DOCTOR, OTHER DOCTOR & ROSITA looking up, boggling -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Some sort of primitive conversion,
                    like they took the brain of a cat
                    or a dog...

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Talking's all very well - Rosita!

                    I'm ready!

      And she hands the Other Doctor a coil of rope, tied at one
      end in a lasso - he readies it -

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Now watch, and learn -

      He throws the lasso -

      The Cybershade's reaching out one arm to claw at them, so
      the lasso loops around its arm & opposite shoulder -

      The Other Doctor wraps the rope around his wrist, tight -

                                  Writer's 
      trapped), scrabbling against the wall, his feet finding
      purchase on the brickwork, so he's like an abseiler -

      CU Cybershade - it's stopped again, looking down, hissing -

                  The 
      HIGH ANGLE looking down at the Other Doctor in that
      position, the Doctor & Rosita below him -

                    I think I might be in a little bit

                    Nothing changes.  I've got you - !

      The rope's long - the Doctor grabbing hold of the trailing
      end, wrapping it round his wrist -

      FX: CYBERSHADE scuttles further up the wall, fast -

      CU on the Other Doctor, yanked up - 

      PRAC SHOT - and the Doctor's yanked upwards - !

      SIDE-ON SHOT of the Doctor, as he's yanked up into shot,
      hits the wall, a few feet up, finds his feet, scrabbling
      into the abseiling position.

      CU Cybershade, stopped again, looking round, calculating... 

      CUT TO ground level, ROSITA grabbing hold of an AXE, which
      is lying around with all the crates & junk -

      then the Doctor, abseiling below him, this intercut with
      PRAC: LOW ANGLE, looking up at Doctor, Other Doctor above *
      him, then the Cybershade above both.  Also covered with
      normal, non-FX side-on CUs of the Doctors.  As they have a
      perfectly normal conversation:

                    Perhaps if you could pull..?

                    social calendar - whoa!

      CU on the Other Doctor pulled up out of frame again -
                  The 
      CU on the Doctor, being yanked up -

      FX: CYBERSHADE scuttling up, then a CG leap up, through a
      high-up window (no glass, just a gaping space).

      HIGH ANGLE, both Doctors holding on to the rope and
      abseiling in reverse, running up the wall, both yelling -

                    Well.  Not as young as you were
                    when you were me.

                    Not at all.

                    Then again, painless.  Worse ways
                    to go.  Depends on the brick.

                    No, I'm, uh, I'm just... Smith!
                    John Smith.  But I've heard all
                    about you, Doctor.  Bit of a legend,
                    if I say so myself.

                    Modesty forbids me to agree with
                    you, sir.  But yes!  Yes I am.

                    A legend with... certain memories

      He runs across the road.

      He glances up, falters.

      A FIGURE is walking towards them, through the MIST & SNOW. 
      A SILHOUETTE.  The Vicar perturbed, tries to carry on:

      But he looks up again.  Can't believe what he's seeing.

      Other mourners turn to look.

      The silhouette taking shape...

      The mourners now open-mouthed with shock.

                    upon the poor.  While I scrubbed

                    I must insist that you depart -

      In the distance...

      Stomp, stomp, stomp...

      Mourners looking round...

                                    MISS HARTIGAN
                    Cybermen.

      And suddenly -

      THREE CYBERSHADES leap out from behind GRAVESTONES, close
      to the GRAVE - squatting, threatening, hissss!

      And it's instant panic - MOURNERS running, terrified - !

      FX: MAN #2 being zapped!  (NB Cybermen do NOT grab anyone
      by the neck.  No throttling.  They clamp their hand down
      on the shoulder, or forehead, and zap.)

      FX: MORE CG CYBERSHADES bounding across the graveyard, in

      Those four men scared - but they dare not move, the 3
      CYBERSHADES surrounding them, as guards, crouching, hissing -

      CUT TO mourners, fleeing, desperate - stumbling through

      MAN #7 being pulled towards a Cyberman by a Cybershade -

      WIDE SHOT, men running all over the place, CYBERMEN

      FX: A BALLOON.  Like a hot-air balloon, though it's the
      wrong age for that, this is a gas balloon, but it looks
      practically the same; a basket with sandbags attached,

      JED's a cheery Factory Lad, 25. The Other Doctor gives him
      a pound note, peeling it from a big bunch of notes.

                    I can depart, in the Tardis, only
                    once London is safe.  And finally,

      They stand, blank-faced.  As she talks, reveal that they
      all have DEVICES around their ears, metal, more discreet
      than Ear-Pods, like hearing-aids, blinking away.

                    And bring them to me.

      Quieter, now, though with a few crones and lads; hot food
      and gin still being sold from some of the stalls.  THE
      DOCTOR runs into the street, stops, looks for something,
      anything.  Then, at the far end of the street, he sees...

      Long lens, a blur, at first.  PEOPLE, walking.  Lanterns.

      ROSITA runs up, joins the Doctor.

                    What is it, what's happening..?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Someone's on the march.

      The figures resolving...

      MR COLE.  Blank-faced.  Marching with CHILDREN, down the
      middle of the road.  Workhouse kids, looking miserable and
      cold, in their Workhouse rags.  All glum and servile. 
      Some as young as possible, some OLDER BOYS at the front,
      trudging along, holding lanterns.  A formal procession.

      Some bystanders bemused, laughing.

                                    LAD
                    Nice night for it, sir!

                    I'll buy one for a farthing!

                    That's Mr Cole, he's Master of the
                    Hazel Street Workhouse.  Maybe
                    he's taking them to prayers.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Ohh, nothing as holy as that.

      Because Mr Cole is passing by.  And the Doctor sees:

      His ear-piece, light blinking.  The Doctor runs to join
      him, then trots alongside him...

                    Cole, you seem to have something
                    in your ear.  Now, this might hurt

      He's getting out the sonic.  But he hears a hisss...

      Looks up -

      On the rooftops, a good distance away, a CYBERSHADE.  Not
      attacking, just ready to, staring down, twitching.

      The Doctor stops, lets the procession carry on, passing
      by, as Rosita runs up to him.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    They're on guard.  Can't risk a
                    fight.  Not with the children.

                                      ROSITA

      a dead-end (if possible) with a set of BIG WOODEN DOORS,
      which now swing open, under the power of...

      TWO CYBERMEN.  They step out to stand guard, either side
      of the doors.  Beyond the doors: blackness.

      Children stop, terrified.  Mr Scoones turns, faces them:

                                    MR SCOONES

      THE DOCTOR & ROSITA appear at the corner of the far end of
      the street, a good distance back, staying hidden.

      Their POV: children & Cybershades go into the darkness. 
      The two CYBERMEN step inside, swing the doors shut, slam,

      Stop dead.

      Standing centre: MISS HARTIGAN.  Flanked by TWO CYBERMEN. 
      She's still got her parasol.  (These streets need to feel

      The Doctor, Jackson, Rosita running off into the distance...

      The Cybershades scuttle up to Miss Hartigan, helping her

                    That stronghold.  Down by the river. 
                    I need to find away in.

                    I'm ahead of you!  My wife and I
                    were moving to London so that I
                    could take a post at the University. 
                    And while my memory's still not
                    intact, this was in my luggage -

      Rosita keeps going, brave.  Runs up to the quayside, with
      the noise of bubbling & boiling reaching a crescendo...

      just black night (no city visible, nor the surface of the
      Thames, since Rosita's edge is a good distance above water
      level).  And THE FULL CG CYBERKING RISES!  In all its glory,
      water cascading down its body.  It is a VAST machine, 200ft
      tall, roughly in the shape of a Cyberman, though far more
      stocky and simplified.  All in Cyber-Victorian design;

      Inlaid: MISS HARTIGAN & HER PHALANX OF CYBERMEN & SHADES;

      massive Cyber-eyes (not visible previously, out of the top

        Cyber-ear-handles.

                      remarkable mind this world has

                    No, but such a mind deserves to
                    live!  The Cybermen came to this
                    world using a Dimension Vault, I
                    can use that device to find you a
                    home.  With no people to convert! 
                    But a new world where you can live
                    out your mechanical life.  In peace.

                    to stop you.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      It's infectious!  EVERYONE looking up.  And all of them
      yelling, cheering, whistling, waving, up at the balloon!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      PEOPLE cheering, thunderous!

      CLOSER ON JACKSON.  Roaring his delight.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE DOCTOR hearing the cheering.  Not revelling in it. 
      But tired, he smiles.  Gives a wave.

      FX: WIDE SHOT as the BALLOON drifts gently on its way, in
      the night sky, the sound of cheering all around...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Later.  It's snowing again.  Signs of recovery; a MAN
      throwing water over the last PRAC FIRE.  TWO MEN helping a
      limping WOMAN along.  A circle of CRONES laughing, sharing
      tales of their survival.  And through this...

      THE DOCTOR & JACKSON LAKE walk along together.  Old friends. 
      In the distance, the Christmas Carol can be heard again, a
      quieter version, gentler, more of a lament.

                                                          Tale
                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    The City will recover.  As London
                    always does.  Though today's events
                    will be history!  Spoken of for
                    centuries to come!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yeah.  Funny that. 

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    And a new history begins for me.  
                                  Writer's 
                    I find myself a widower.  But with
                    my son, and with good friends.

      They look back.

                  The 
      A distance away, ROSITA's with FREDERIC, and JED.  Rosita
      looks at the Doctor.  She waves; a thank-you.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Now take care of that one, she's
                      marvellous.

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    Frederic will need a nursemaid, I
                    could think of none better. 
                          (they walk on)
                    But you're welcome to join us.  We
                    thought we might all dine together,
                    at the Traveller's Halt, a Christmas
                    feast, in celebration, and in memory
                    of those we have lost...
                          (trails off)
                    You won't stay.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Like I said.  You know me.

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    No, I don't think anyone does.
                          (seeing:)
                    Oh!  And this is it!

      The TARDIS, the real one, standing in the snow.

                                      JACKSON LAKE (CONT'D)
                    If I might, Doctor..?  One last
                      adventure?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Be my guest.

      The Doctor unlocks the door, lets Jackson enter first.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Still snowing, the Christmas Carol still singing, gently,
      far-off, as JACKSON leaves the TARDIS, stands a few feet
      back.  THE DOCTOR staying in the doorway.

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    Gracious.  That's quite enough.
                          (pause; quieter)
                    I take it, this is goodbye.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Onwards and upwards.

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    But tell me one thing.  When I saw
                    those facts and figures about the
                    Doctor's life...  You were never
                    alone.  All those bright and shining
                      companions!  But not any more..?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No.

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    Might I ask, why not?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    They leave.  Because they should. 
                    Or they find someone else.  And
                    some of them... some of them forget
                    me.  I suppose, in the end...
                          (pause)
                    They break my heart.

      Silence.  Then:

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    That offer of Christmas dinner. 
                                                          Tale
                    It's not a request.  It's a demand!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...in memory of those we have lost.
                          (pause; big smile)
                    Ohh, go on then!

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    Really?!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                                  Writer's 
                    Just this once.  You've actually
                    gone and changed my mind - and not
                    many people can do that!  Jackson,*
                    if anyone had to be the Doctor,*
                    I'm glad it was you.*

                    The one, and the only! *

                                    THE DOCTOR*
                    Oh yes!*

                    walk with me!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                      I certainly will!  Merry Christmas
                    to you, Jackson.

                                      JACKSON LAKE
                    Merry Christmas indeed, Doctor!

      And the Doctor joins him, claps his arm around Jackson's
      shoulder, as both turn away. 

      The carol soars up to full volume, and the snow tumbles
      down, as both men walk away, together.
