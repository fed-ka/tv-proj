Next to book shelves and an upright piano, with sheet music
on the stand - CHOPIN. There is also a dining room table with
leftovers from an abandoned meal - strawberries and cream.
MONTH LATER - a warm night, the MAN is asleep with the same
WOMAN, now pregnant, no sheets on the bed. The MAN is
restless and wakes. A distant RUMBLING, indistinct - the MAN
swings his feet off of the bed and goes to the window,
anxious.
The MAN is in his shorts, sweating, putting a plug in the
bath and turning on the taps as far as they will go. The
WOMAN appears in the doorway in a nightdress and leans
against the door frame watching, blearily, cradling her
pregnant belly.
WOMAN.
Why are you taking a bath?
MAN.
I'm not.
The WOMAN takes off her nightdress and goes to the bath.
WOMAN.
You'll sleep better.
He looks at her, surprised she's misunderstood.
MAN.
I'm not! Put your clothes back on.
She sees he's looking out the window now - there's an eery
rose-colored glow of distant fire through the glass - and
distant shouts and screams...

WOMAN.
What is it? What's happening?
END OF FLASHBACK:
TITLE: THE ROAD.
Three pairs of FEET wearing different shoes - a man's shoes,
a woman's shoes, and a CHILD's sneakers - hang above three
carefully placed chairs.
MAN.
Don't look.
The BOY looks at the ground.
MAN. (CONT'D)
You don't need to see this.
The BOY takes a few steps, exploring, he eyes the empty hay
loft but avoids looking at the hanged bodies.
BOY.
There could be something here.
There could be corn or something.
MAN.
No, they ran out of food.
BOY.
Maybe we could find some hayseeds
in the hayloft?
Now the BOY goes over to the swinging CORPSES, oddly curious.
MAN.
It's not what-you think. They
committed suicide.
BOY.
What does that mean?
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
You know what that means.
The MAN GOES outside while the BOY thinks about it a moment.
FLASHBACK - the WOMAN is sitting by the window, staring out
at the garden which is barren now, the sky gray but tinged
with the same fireglow seen earlier, a film of gray ash
covers dead lawn and shrubs and inside the paintwork is grimy
and colorless now, a lot of the furniture gone. A pile of
broken up furniture and pieces of the piano are-stacked up
next to the fireplace. In the fireplace the scorched, ashen
remains of piano keys. The WOMAN is now heavily pregnant. The
MAN sets down chipped old plates and spoons, spoons beans
from a pot and sits to eat.
As the WOMAN starts to eat she winces and freezes with a look
of horror, spoon halfway to her mouth. She looks down and
SEES:
POV WOMAN - water and blood running down her legs.
WOMAN.
Oh no. Oh no.
MAN.
It's okay, I'll help you. Just like
we said.
WOMAN.
No no no...
MAN.
I'll heat water. We can do it.
As he goes out she MOANS in despair.
The MAN rushes in and opens a drawer in the sideboard.
Instead of cutlery it contains a pair of kitchen shears, a
bottle of antiseptic, worn but clean towels and a pair of
worn out yellow rubber dish gloves, all laid out in
readiness.
The WOMAN appears at the door, blood running down a leg.
WOMAN.
We don't have to.
MAN.
Well, I think we probably do.
WOMAN.
What kind of life is this?
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
It's life. It's the only thing
left.
He takes the WOMAN back into the other room.
TERRIBLE SCREAMING. The WOMAN lies on the dining room table
SCREAMING as she has her first contractions. The MAN is
wearing the rubber gloves, one gloved hand resting on the
WOMAN's leg, about to deliver his own baby. He wipes his brow
and leaves a smear of blood as the SCREAMING goes on.
WOMAN.
I can't.
MAN.
It's coming.
END OF FLASHBACK.
Inside a badly damaged trailer home, one wall half fallen
off, a pan of water boils on a small fire. The BOY sits
shivering in a blankets as he eats beans from a tin, scraping
around for the last one or two. The MAN opens his knapsack by
the fire and produces a packet of COCOA. He fixes a cup of
cocoa for the boy. He hands the BOY the cup of cocoa and as
the BOY examines it and drinks, the MAN surreptitiously pours
himself a mug of water and sits blowing on it. The BOY
realises the MAN has left him all the cocoa.
BOY.
You promised not to do that.
MAN.
What?
BOY.
You know what, Papa. I have to
watch you all the time.
MAN.
I know I'm sorry.
BOY.
If you break little promises you'll
break big ones. That's what you
said.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
The MAN relents, pouring the hot water back into the pan and
taking some of the BOY's cocoa into his own cup. The BOY
wipes his finger around the inside of the empty bean tin and
licks his finger.
MAN.
Watch your finger.
BOY.
You always say that.
MAN.
That's because you always do it.
The MAN spreads bits of a worn out road map on the boards and
studies them.
BOY.
What are you doing?
MAN.
We have to keep moving. We have to
go south to the coast.
BOY.
Why?
MAN.
It'll be better at the coast.
BOY.
Why?
MAN.
Because we're going to freeze here.
He picks up the map pieces carefully.
The MAN has his arm around the boy as they push the cart
cautiously ahead, acutely aware of all that's around them.
They pass footprints in the dried sludge on the ground. Ash
and litter blowing about and a handful of MUMMIFIED DEAD
REFUGEES appear along the sides of the tunnel, sitting and
lying on camp stretchers, their bags and supplies long since
looted. They are shrivelled and drawn like latterday bogfolk,
shoeless, a couple of men, a woman a small child and a DOG.
The MAN stares at the group.
The BOY stares at the small child and then at the mummified
DOG, transfixed. The MAN puts out his hand for the BOY to
take - the BOY takes his hand and the MAN moves him on.
MAN.
Just remember that the things you
put into your head are forever.
BOY.
But you forget some things don't
you?
MAN.
You forget what you want to
remember and you remember what you
want to forget.
Now the BOY's hand rests on the MAN's chest as he sleeps. The
MAN breathes stertorously, wheezing a little and the BOY'S
small hand goes up and down on his chest.
Suddenly the MAN wakes and rolls onto his side, listening,
the revolver lying beside him. He slips his hand onto the
revolver and raises his head slowly. He looks around -
nothing but the sound of a distant DIESEL ENGINE. He looks at
the BOY fast asleep. When he looks back at the tunnel he sees
a nightmarish vision:
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
POV MAN - Exiting the tunnel, shuffling through the ash, a
group of HOODED MEN, some in gas masks and filthy biohazard
suits, slouching along, coughing, casting their heads from
side to side and swinging clubs and lengths of pipe - a ROAD
GANG. The MAN listens to the sound of a DIESEL TRUCK behind
the gang.
MAN.
Quickly. Quick...
The BOY jolts awake as the MAN shoves his pistol in his belt,
grabs the boy by the hand. They slide out of the car and
crouch on the ground, the BOY is frozen with fear.
MAN. (CONT'D)
It's all right. It's all right but
we have to run. Don't look back.
Come on.
Their backpacks are still left in the back of the car...
MAN. (CONT'D)
Run... run...
The flat bed truck RUMBLES into view, MEN from the GANG
standing on the flat bed looking around, some holding rifles.
The BOY falls and the MAN pulls him to his feet with such
force he lifts him clean off the ground and has to dangle him
back down again.
MAN. (CONT'D)
You okay? It's all right... come
on...
They rush down the embankment into the trees alongside the
turnpike.
FLASHBACK - Now the house is in considerable disrepair, no
furniture, the skirting boards falling away, large cracks in
the walls, cornices and lamp fittings pulling away from the
ceilings, water marks from rain, the windows covered with
corrugated iron sheets. The MAN and the WOMAN are sitting
across from each other with a lamp illuminating the dark.
Between them lies the revolver seen earlier. The WOMAN picks
up the gun and swings open the magazine. There are two
bullets in it, she takes them out and places them on the
table, one after the other.
WOMAN.
That's all that's left. I should
have done it when there were more
bullets in the gun.
The MAN shuts his eyes, unable to take it. In the corner, the
BOY is standing in the background, drawing on the walls.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
WOMAN. (CONT'D)
Sooner or later - no listen - they
will catch up with us and they will
kill us. They will rape me -
MAN.
NO -
WOMAN.
And they will rape him
MAN.
Please no - just - no
WOMAN.
They are going to rape us and kill
us and eat us and you won't face
it. You'd rather wait for it to
happen.
MAN.
Please.
WOMAN.
Stop it.
MAN.
I'll do anything.
WOMAN.
Such as what?
She picks up the revolver and puts the TWO BULLETS into the
chamber.
WOMAN. (CONT'D)
I thought about not even telling
you. Just doing it. I'd empty every
godamn bullet into my brain and
leave you with nothing.
MAN.
Don't say that. Don't talk this
way.
WOMAN.
There's nothing left to talk
about... my heart was ripped out of
me the night he was born...
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED: (2)
MAN.
Please don't do this. I won't let
anything happen. We'll survive.
WOMAN.
I don't want to survive! I'd take
him with me if it weren't for you.
You know I would. Why can't you
face it?
MAN.
Will you listen? You're talking
CRAZY -
WOMAN.
It's not crazy and you know it.
It's the right thing to do.
They glance at the BOY.
WOMAN. (CONT'D)
Other families do it.
She goes to the BOY, strokes his hair, kisses him, makes a
reassuring display of being motherly.
WOMAN. (CONT'D)
Time for bed, there's a good boy.
She picks him up in her arms and carries him off to bed.
END OF FLASHBACK.
He looks around at discarded detritus, old magazines and
trash. He checks behind the seats where there is a mattress
on a bunk and calls out.
MAN.
Come up here.
SNOW continues to fall on the dusty WINDSCREEN. Outside, all
around snow falls, silently, covering the truck and the
bridge, transforming it. They are both still awake, unable to
sleep, staring at the transformed world, carpeted by snow.
BOY.
I'm hungry.
MAN.
I know. So am I.
BOY.
Can I ask you something?
MAN.
Of course.
BOY.
Are we going to die?
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
No. Sometime. Not now.
BOY.
And we're still going south?
MAN.
Yes.
BOY.
So we'll be warm?
MAN.
Yes.
BOY.
And there might be food there?
MAN.
Everything depends on reaching the
coast.
BOY.
Okay.
The MAN draws a blanket around him and kisses him goodnight,
it is now pitch black.
MAN.
Go to sleep.
BOY.
I wish I was with my mom.
They are silent a moment, until:
MAN.
You mean you wish you were dead.
BOY.
Yeah.
MAN.
You mustn't say that. It's a bad
thing to say.
BOY.
I can't help it.
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED: (2)
MAN.
I know but you have to. You have to
stop thinking about her. We both
do.
BOY.
How do I do that?
The MAN is silent, lost in thought.
They climb through the window onto black and white marble
tiles and the MAN carefully shuts the window a little so it's
the same as when he found it. They regard the room,
binoculars set up on a tripod sit next to an arm chair. An
elaborate staircase in front of them, William Morris wall
paper, water stained and sagging, plaster moldings and
cornices sagging from the ceiling.
They cross back to the other side where there is a great hall
of a drawing room, high ceilings, huge fire place with raw
brick around it where the wood has been stripped, a pile of
warm-weather clothing, boots and backpacks on the floor by
the hearth.
BOY.
Papa?
MAN.
Shh.
They creep in and find blackened pots and pans, a cord with a
bell for servants, trash piled on the floor and work tops, a
rusted sink covered in mould, bare cupboards. In the floor is
a hatch with a lock set in a steel plate. The man examines it
while the BOY tugs at his arm, frightened.
BOY.
Papa, let's go.
MAN.
There's a reason this is locked.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
The BOY is now panicky, hopping about, close to tears.
BOY.
Don't open it - don't!
MAN.
I need something to pry it open.
BOY.
No!
The MAN goes out abruptly and the BOY follows, wringing his
hands in fear.
The spade chops into the wood around the lock on the hatch.
The MAN hacks away, then prizes up the hatch, lock and all,
revealing a gap of darkness.
BOY.
Papa...
MAN.
Listen to me. Just stop it. We're
starving. Do you understand? I have
to do this. I don't have any
choice.
The MAN opens the hatch fully and lies it on the floor.
MAN. (CONT'D)
Just wait here.
BOY.
I'm going with you.
MAN.
Okay. Just stay close to me.
Nothing's going to happen.
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
They descend the rough wooden steps.
There is a terrible stench and they have to cover their
mouths and noses with their parkas. The MAN gets out his
lighter, lights it and tries to light the way.
POV MAN - BLACKNESS except the small area illuminated by the
lighter as the MAN searches: part of a stone wall; then a
clay floor; an old mattress with dark stains. The glow of the
flame crawls across the floor to a corner as the MAN steps
closer, then plays the lighter along from the corner to
REVEAL:
Huddled against the wall, all trying to hide, shielding their
shining eyes from the light, NAKED MEN and WOMEN, thin as
skeletons like inmates in a death camp. The BOY jumps,
shocked and the MAN freezes, staring, dumb struck by:
On a mattress on the floor lies a NAKED MAN with his legs
gone to the hip, their stumps blackened and burned,
cauterized. The BOY covers his eyes.
MAN.
Jesus...
The MAN on the MATTRESS turns to them and WHISPERS, a low
indistinct murmur at first.
MAN ON MATTRESS.
Help us... please help us...
MAN.
Christ... oh Christ...
The others join in, an eerie chorus of WHISPERING, "Help
us... please help us..." The MAN turns and grabs the BOY and
rushes for the steps.
MAN. (CONT'D)
Hurry... go... move!
The MAN drops the lighter as he tries to push the BOY up the
steps. Out of nowhere a BEARDED FACE appears at the foot of
the stairs, blinking.
BEARDED FACE.
Please... they're taking us to the
smoke house.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
The BEARDED FACE reaches out and feebly tries to grab the
MAN's arm but he breaks free and concentrates on getting the
BOY up the steps, following in a blind panic, fumbling and
missing his footing.
MAN.
Hurry - hurry!
They scramble up the steps towards the light of the hatch as
the BEARDED FACE reaches out and tries one last time to grab
at the MAN's feet but he kicks free.
The MAN scrambles out, slams the door shut and drags a solid
table over the door. He looks around for the BOY.
MAN.
Christ. Run!
The BOY is near the window, dancing up and down in terror,
pointing out the window to:
The MAN stares a moment, frozen with horror, then grabs the
BOY by the hand and jerks him away.
MAN.
Run. Run!
They tear through to the front door, the MAN fumbles to get
it open but it has a well-maintained deadlock on it. He
stares out the window next to the door and sees:
POV MAN - The WELL-FED PEOPLE are climbing the steps of the
porch. The MAN Grabs the BOY and they rush through into
kitchen.
In the kitchen the hatch is being lifted from underneath and
the table elevating inches. They rush back out again.
37.
As they reach the stairs, a key turns in the lock and the MAN
picks up the BOY in his arms and they sprint to a door under
the stairs. As they get through the door the front door
swings open and the WELL-FED PEOPLE drift inside.
They are in a small rest room under the stairs, just a toilet
and a basin. The BOY's face is level with the basin and while
the MAN is holding the door shut the BOY comes face to face
with the contents of the basin:
POV BOY - bloodstained clothing soaking in bloody water and
tallow in the basin. Around the basin are bloody red hand
prints on the white porcelain.
POV MAN - through a thin crack he sees the WELL-FED PEOPLE on
the far side of the foyer, chatting casually. He is not close
enough to hear everything they say, but close enough to see
that the MEN's beards are trimmed and they wear well-repaired
clothes.
WELL FED WOMAN.
I'm going to freshen up.
BEARDED MAN.
I need a drink.
WELL FED WOMAN 2.
I'm going up to change.
He hears one of the WOMEN STOMPING across the old floorboards
and up the stairs to change while the other WOMAN takes a few
steps towards the rest room, then turns back towards the
window as the conversation lurches on.
BEARDED MAN 2.
Who left this window open?
WELL FED WOMAN.
I leave it open for the smell.
BEARDED MAN 2.
What smell?
WELL FED WOMAN.
You don't smell it anymore?
BEARDED MAN.
Who wants a drink?
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
They hear the sound of the WINDOW BEING CLOSED and LATCHED.
As all this goes on, the MAN is frozen, eyes wide with fear,
he slips the pistol from his belt, cocks it and squats on his
haunches so he's close to the BOY, desperate, unable to
decide what to do, unable to think straight with fear.
The BOY is staring from the door to the pistol to the
bloodied basin as if hypnotised, in shock, babbling somewhat.
BOY. (MUMBLING, TO SELF.)
Bad guys... bad men...
MAN.
Shh, shh...
There are FOOT STEPS outside the door as the WELL FED PEOPLE
drift closer and then away again. The man starts to cough but
he has the revolver in one hand and the BOY's hand in his
other. The MAN tries to stifle his cough but can't. Then the
BOY notices and holds his own small hand to the MAN's mouth,
stifling his coughing as the talk goes on outside:
WELL FED WOMAN.
Will you help me with the dirty
dishes?
BEARDED MAN 2.
I'm hungry.
As the coughing subsides a little the MAN takes the BOY's
hand from his mouth and pushes the revolver into it.
MAN.
Take it.
The BOY tries to resist, shaking his head, terrified, mute.
MAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D)
Take it.
The MAN puts his left arm around the BOY's tiny, thin
shoulders and holds him close.
MAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D)
Don't be afraid. If they get hold
of you, you're going to have to do
it just like everybody else. Do you
understand? Shh. No crying. Do you
hear me?
The WOMAN turns from the window and one of the BEARDED MEN
pours whiskey and hands her one.
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED: (2)
The BOY is weeping and shaking his head as the MAN shows him
again what to do with the gun.
MAN (WHISPERS.)
Stop crying. You have to be a brave
boy. You know how to do it.
BOY (WHISPERS.)
I think so.
MAN (WHISPERS.)
Say "Yes I do Papa."
He stares down at the little BOY who just holds the gun
feebly... he realises the BOY won't use it. After a moment of
torturous contemplation, the MAN very gently takes the gun
from the BOY's hand and the BOY sits forlornly, staring down
at his hands, afraid to look at the MAN now. When the BOY
looks up again he is staring down the barrel of the pistol,
the MAN aiming the large revolver at the BOY's forehead.
BOY.
What are you doing?
The MAN's hand shakes, his thumb trembles on the hammer as he
cocks it...
BOY. (CONT'D)
Papa?
MAN.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
BOY.
Will I see you again? When will I
see you?
The MAN's finger trembles on the trigger as he slowly
squeezes it... At that moment there's a loud THUMP from the
kitchen and the WELL FED PEOPLE stop and listen, then rush
through to the kitchen, and immediately there's a commotion
as they see the state of the hatch with the table over it.
BEARDED MAN 2(O.O.V.)
What the fuck do you think you're
doing? Huh? What the fuck do you
think you're doing...?
WELL FED WOMAN (O.O.V.)
Don't look at me like that. What
are you doing?
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED: ( 3)
The MAN gathers his wits and opens the door a crack.
MAN.
Follow me, take my hand, don't let
go.
The MAN bursts out of the rest room with the BOY and they
make a dash for the open window. He sticks his gun in his
belt and wrestles with the window, an old colonial style
frame which sticks.
From behind the closed kitchen door they hear muffled GRUNTS
and SHOUTS until the MAN wrenches the window open, stuffs the
BOY through and follows.
The MAN and the BOY have set up camp in the mall, outside the
SEARS entrance. The MAN is building a big fire. The BOY
stares through the glass at the deserted department store.
Nearby, strewn across the doorway are bunches and bundles of
cash in notes and coins... the BOY looks closer and finds
expensive items of jewelry still in their boxes, LOOTED from
the store and discarded.
The BOY sits, he looks like he's given up, and then:
BOY.
Papa? Papa, we wouldn't ever eat
anybody would we?
MAN.
No. Of course not.
BOY.
No matter how hungry we were. Even
if we were starving?
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
We're starving now.
BOY.
Because, because we're the good
guys?
MAN.
Yes.
BOY.
And we're carrying the fire.
MAN.
Yes.
The MAN takes the BOY in his arms. In a moment the BOY starts
blinking sleepily and drifts off to sleep and the MAN strokes
the sleeping BOY's hair and kisses him on the forehead.
The MAN and the BOY trudge the empty aisles, only litter
remaining, the once brightly-colored packaging strewn around,
it's contents long since looted.
In the empty gun section there is a deer's head mounted on
the wall. The BOY stops and stares, mesmerised while the MAN
searches the empty shelves for ammo, finding only empty
boxes.
The MAN glimpses a woman's face staring dolefully from an
aisle - an emaciated, dead beat SCAVENGER watching them,
vanishing as quickly as she appeared.
On their way out they come to a pair of vending machines
tipped over, the sodas looted, coins scattered around in the
ash. The MAN sits beside one and feels inside the gutted
machine, eventually producing a single unopened can of COCA
COLA.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED:
BOY (EXCITED.)
What is it, papa?
MAN.
It's a treat for you. Here. Sit
down.
He helps the little BOY off with his knapsack and sits him
down and opens the can of COKE ceremoniously. The BOY looks
startled and sniffs the fizzing can as if it's the strangest
thing he's ever seen in his life.
MAN. (CONT'D)
Go ahead.
The BOY takes the can.
BOY.
It's bubbly.
MAN.
Go ahead. Drink it.
The BOY takes a sip and considers.
BOY.
It's really good. You have some,
papa.
MAN.
No. I want you to drink it.
BOY.
But I want you to have some.
The MAN reluctantly takes the can and has a tiny sip, hands
it back to the wary BOY.
BOY. (CONT'D)
It's because I'll never get to
drink another one, isn't it?
The MAN doesn't know what to say.
The pine panelling is stripped from the walls, there is some
broken furniture but much has been taken for firewood. They
go over to the fireplace and the MAN examines it. He runs his
fingers along the mantle where there is an old drawing pin
still stuck in the wood, nostalgia overcoming his fear.
MAN.
This is where we used to have
Christmas when I was a boy. We'd
hang our stockings right here.
The MAN examines the yellow tiled surround. The BOY watches
the MAN as if he's gone mad.
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
MAN. (CONT'D)
My mother scrubbed these every day.
It's still spotless.
Much of the woodwork and the floorboards have been stripped
and taken for firewood - there are gaping holes.
By the fireplace is a small pile of bones - and--in the grid
are more burnt bones and the skull from the family cat. The
MAN takes it all in sadly but the BOY is unmoved.
BOY.
Papa? I don't think we should do
this.
MAN.
You want to wait outside?
The BOY nods vigorously.
MAN. (CONT'D)
All right.
He takes the BOY's hand and leads him out.
The floorboards CREAK horribly, swollen from rain or ripped
up, as he creeps into the living room. The timber cladding is
stripped from the walls, the ceiling plaster is collapsed,
beams exposed. The MAN pads through to the kitchen.
The kitchen is similarly dilapidated, the cupboards stripped
bare. On a shelf by the window are dusty jars of fruit,
preserved. He grabs a jar, prizes open the lid and finds a an
oily slick of black mucus floating in the top, like rotted
mushroom spores. He sniffs it suspiciously, holds it up to
the light.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
In the light small black fish hook-shaped spores drift from
the top of the jar to the bottom. He replaces the lid,
appalled.
The MAN is in the looted pantry. He finds some shrivelled
raisins that haves spilt and hidden in the back of the shelf.
He puts them into a handkerchief, folds it and pockets it. He
HEARS:
BOY. (O.O.V.)
Stop - stop!
The MAN freezes, then charges out.
They try to get comfortable in the leather seats, the MAN
spreading the blankets over them and tucking the BOY in. They
are quiet a moment as they watch darkness start to fall.
THEN:
MAN.
I got you something
The MAN produces from his pocket one of the tiny hard brown
apples and holds it up to the remaining light.
BOY.
What is it?
MAN.
It's an apple.
(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:
He hands it to the boy who examines it curiously. The MAN
takes out a pocket knife, takes the apple back, cuts the
apple in half to reveal a woody brown interior. They regard
the mahogany apple uncertainly, the MAN is the first to take
a bite, with some difficulty. The BOY bites his half and
makes a face.
MAN. (CONT'D)
Suck it a while and it'll soften.
They sit sucking and chewing the ancient apple.
BOY.
Did you ever have any friends?
The MAN eyes the BOY - curious at the sudden question.
MAN.
Yes. I did.
BOY.
Lots of them?
MAN.
Yes...
BOY.
Do you remember them?
MAN.
Yes. I remember all of them...
BOY.
What happened to them?
MAN.
They died.
BOY.
All of them?
MAN.
Yes. All of them.
The MAN is in the bedroom looking around for useful things -
it has been stripped, the wooden frame gone from the window,
the bureau ransacked and chopped up - only a summer dress on
a wire hanger on the back of the door remains. He glances at
empty drawers on the floor and a cupboard before turning his
attention to the bed.
He blinks and sways a moment, trying to focus on:
POV MAN - underneath the filthy, dusty blankets a thin, dried
head pokes out, the blankets pulled up to the chin. On the
pillow are long hunks of rotted hair.
MAN. (V.0.)
Every day is a lie. But I am slowly
dying. That is not a lie .I am
trying to prepare him for the day
when I am gone.
He takes hold of the lower hem of the blanket and tows it off
the bed, revealing a desiccated corpse. He ignores it,
shaking the blanket out and folding it under his arm. He
notices the BOY at his side, watching wide-eyed.
MAN. (CONT'D)
Nothing you haven't seen before.
They go out.
The MAN opens and shuts empty cupboards, slamming the doors,
increasingly desperate, close to tears of frustration now.
Eventually he feels dizzy and has to sit on the floor. He
just sits there, alone on the kitchen floor, clenching and
unclenching his fists, his head in his hands, when he hears:
BOY. (O.O.V.)
Papa!
The MAN draws his pistol and goes out, alert again.
The BOY is staring at himself in a dusty, flyblown full
length mirror. As the MAN comes in he sees the BOY's
reflection and his own and jumps.
BOY.
It's us.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
The BOY stares at his reflection - he looks like an alien,
skinny with giant staring eyes on shaky legs.
BOY. (CONT'D)
We look skinny.
MAN.
We are skinny.
The MAN puts the blanket around the BOY's shoulders. He
notices an old upright piano, covered in ash and dust. The
BOY stares as he goes to it, lifts the lid and plays a chord.
The BOY's eyes light up and he is magnetized, instantly
coming over and waiting for the next note. The MAN plays
another chord.
BOY.
What is it?
MAN.
It's a piano.
BOY.
What's it for?
MAN.
For making music. This... (HE
PLAYS.) is music. Your mother
played very well.
BOY.
I don't remember.
MAN.
Before you were born. We had one
just like it. It was beautiful.
BOY.
What happened to it?
MAN.
Chopped it up for firewood.
He stares into space, slumps suddenly, overcome with emotion
as he remembers:
FLASHBACK - Just the MAN and the pregnant WOMAN alone in the
house, just before the BOY was born. Some of the furniture
has been broken up for firewood - there are broken pieces by
the fire and a huge axe propped on the hearth.
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
The WOMAN stands at the piano and tries to play. She plays
for a moment and the MAN cracks a rare smile - the piano is
out of tune and she stops. She plays a bit more but soon
starts to bang the keys atonally in frustration. The MAN just
lets her get on with it until she's spent.
WOMAN.
I used to worry what would happen
if there was a fire. What would I
save? What could I bear to lose?
There used to be so many things, so
many beautiful things. Things
people made. Things nature made.
Who knew we would lose it all?
MAN.
I'll strip the floorboards.
WOMAN.
You can't live without a floor.
MAN.
You can't live without a piano.
She starts to dismantle the piano, opening the lid, taking it
off it's hinges, it's heavy, she hands him the heavy lid and
he reluctantly dumps it on the floor.
WOMAN.
It's my piano.
MAN.
I bought it for you.
WOMAN.
It needs tuning. Who's going to
tune it? Can you tune it?
They look at each other sadly. They take the front piece away
and dump that. The WOMAN picks up the axe and hands it to the
MAN. He swings it at the frame.
END OF FLASHBACK.
The little BOY CLATTERS down the steps. The MAN is busy
lighting up candles.
BOY.
Papa? What did you find?
MAN.
Everything. I found everything.
(CONTINUED)
61.
CONTINUED:
Stored in the bunker are crate upon crate of canned goods:
tomatoes, peaches, beans, apricots, canned ham, corned beef,
hundreds of gallons of water in ferry cans and in boxes paper
towels, toilet paper and trash bags stuffed with blankets.
The MAN takes the BOY's hand and helps him down, then goes
back up the steps and draws the door shut and jams a pair of
metal pliers through the heavy inside hasp to stop the door
being opened. He goes back down the steps to the BOY and
holds up a candle to illuminate the shelves.
MAN. (CONT'D)
Can you see?
BOY.
What is all this stuff?
MAN.
It's food! Can you read the labels?
The BOY stares at the brightly colored packaging, he's never
seen anything like it before. The MAN hands the BOY a tin.
BOY.
"Pears." It says "pears."
MAN.
Yes! It does! Oh yes it does!
Pears!
They inspect the shelves: chilli, corn, stew, soup, spaghetti
sauce, the BOY's eyes are like saucers.
BOY.
Is it real?
MAN.
Oh yes, it's real all right.
The MAN pulls a box of butane lighters from the shelf and
tests one, it doesn't work. He tests another which works, it
has a large flame - he uses it to read the labels.
BOY.
Why is it here?
MAN.
Because someone thought it might be
needed.
BOY.
But they died.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED: (2)
MAN.
Yes. What would you like for
breakfast?
BOY. (THINKS.)
Pears.
MAN.
Pears it is.
The MAN claws open a box and pulls out a tin of pears. He
gets paper bowls from a stack, plastic forks and spoons, lays
them out. He finds a camping lamp. He puts a butane cannister
in and lights up the lamp. He finds a can opener and opens
the pears while the BOY watches silently, wrapping a blanket
around himself and sitting on the soft bunk bed.
BOY.
Is it okay for us to take it?
MAN.
They'd want us to.
The MAN dishes up two bowls of pears and they sit side by
side on the bunk with spoons and pears.
MAN. (CONT'D)
These will be the best pears you
ever tasted. The best. You just
wait.
They eat in silence. They lick the spoons and drink the syrup
from the bowls. The MAN feels inside his mouth with his
fingers - the sugar irritating a sore tooth.
MAN. (CONT'D)
Too sweet.
The BOY smiles, amused, and the MAN opens another tin.
Ham and powdered eggs frying in a pan on the camping stove.
The kettle is boiling on another ring of the gas stove. The
BOY just stares at the bubbling food as the MAN cooks.
Nearby a breakfast table is set out on a stack of boxes
acting as a breakfast bar: biscuits, a plate of butter,
condensed milk, salt and pepper plates and utensils.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
The MAN brings the pan over and forks over chunks of ham onto
the pates, then spoonsfull of scrambled eggs from a second
pan, then baked beans from a small pot. The BOY just stares,
as if drugged, uncomprehending, the food alien to him.
MAN.
Go ahead. Don't let it get cold.
BOY.
What do I eat first?
MAN.
Whatever you like.
The BOY eats a hunk of ham as the MAN pours coffee.
BOY.
Is this coffee?
MAN.
That's right. Careful it's hot.
He hands him coffee.
BOY.
We did good, didn't we Papa?
MAN.
Yeah, we did good.
The MAN puts the BOY to bed in a bunk and smooths his filthy
hair tenderly, smiling with relief, until the BOY shuts his
eyes and nods off. He covers the BOY with a blanket and
kisses him. He just sits watching the BOY sleep, suddenly on
the verge of tears.
The MAN folds the BOY's tiny clothes, noticing the bulging
pockets of his pants. He empties them, creating a small pile
of collected artefacts: a smooth stone, a marble, an old
house key, bottle tops, a smooth, hand made Indian arrow
head, fashioned from stone, lastly a broken piece of a
woman's mother of pearl hair comb.
By the BOY's bunk he unfolds the crayon drawing he's been
working on and examines it, deeply moved:
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
POV MAN - an eccentric, childlike drawing of the WOMAN,
skinny like a stick figure but, inexplicably, with a brightly
smiling face and big laughing eyes, labelled simply "mom" in
spidery scrawl.
Stirring classical music fades up and into:
FLASHBACK - Close in on a pair of LEGS in stockings, a summer
dress, a WOMAN's hands holding a MAN's hand in her lap. The
MAN feels the tops of the stockings with his fingers.
WIDER - the MAN is with the WOMAN in a concert theatre, at a
recital. The WOMAN wears the mother of pearl hair comb. The
seats are velvet, gold scrollwork adorns the boxes, an
illustrious, fortunate world.
END OF FLASHBACK.
The BOY wakes blearily and immediately notices his collection
of artefacts turfed out by the bed.
Nearby the MAN is dressing as the BOY starts gathering up his
collection crossly, especially protective of the arrow ahead -
or just embarrassed. They look at each other.
MAN.
What?
BOY. (TEASING BUT INDIGNANT.)
Don't touch my stuff.
They empty the jerry cans into the huge pot, light the stove
and put the pot on the stove to heat the water.
65.
The BOY is in the bath, filthy and scrawny, as the MAN bathes
him, rubbing him with soap, scrubbing an oily film of scum
from his dirty neck to reveal clean pale skin underneath.
MAN.
What do you think?
BOY.
Nice and warm.
He washes the BOY's hair, lathing water over him with the
pot. He has a sudden thought:
CUT TO:
FLASHBACK - the MAN watches unseen from the doorway as the
WOMAN tenderly washes the BOY's hair - he is perhaps a year
younger than at the start of the film - she appears lost in
the task, enjoying it, chatting away to the BOY, momentarily
unburdened. She sticks a finger in the BOY's ears, giving
them a good soaping, which he likes.
WOMAN.
You could grow potatoes in these
ears...
END FLASHBACK - now the MAN is in the tub, also scrawny and
filthy, lost in thought as he soaps up - the BOY helps.
The MAN trims his beard off with scissors in a mirror. He
lathers up with shaving cream and starts to shave with a
plastic safety razor. When the MAN is done he turns to the
BOY, wiping away the foam.
MAN.
How do I look?
BOY.
Weird. Won't you be cold?
Now the MAN is cutting the BOY's hair with kitchen scissors
and a plastic comb.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
The BOY has a towel around his shoulders and long locks of
hair decorate it. The MAN finishes, takes the towel off,
wipes the BOY's neck and face with a flannel, holds up a
mirror for the BOY to see.
BOY.
I look funny.
They sit on the bunk bed with a checkerboard between them
sipping thick hot chocolate made with condensed milk from
plastic mugs and concentrating on the board, their worn out,
wet blue jeans drying on a drying rack in the back ground.
They are both wearing new sweaters too big for them,
plundered from the stores. The MAN watches the BOY fondly,
absorbed in checkers.
A shiny new quart of whiskey is slipped from its paper liquor
store bag and opened with a soft CRACK. The whiskey is poured
into a glass with a satisfying GLUG.
WIDER - another feast is laid out, ham and powdered mash
potato and biscuits and gravy. The BOY is eating while the
MAN pours a whiskey. The BOY stops eating to watch the MAN
drink the whiskey. The MAN's eyes glaze as he sips the strong
liquor, dizzy already.
BOY.
Can I try some?
MAN.
No. You won't like it. Makes you
feel funny.
The BOY stares, curious, wanting it.
MAN. (CONT'D)
You think I come from another
world, don't you? Filled with all
these strange things you've never
seen.
BOY.
Sort of.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
Well, I do I guess.
The MAN listens to the PATTER of rain and hears another
sound... something or someone RUSTLING around the mattress
above. He hears the sound of the MATTRESS being DRAGGED off
of the door. He hears SCRABBLING and SCRATCHING on the door
and freezes, staring at the lock, waiting for the
inevitable... He quietly picks up the revolver. He looks
across and sees the BOY is now wide awake too, staring, wide-
eyed.
BOY.
What is it?
MAN.
Shh.
BOY (WHISPERS.)
Maybe it's a dog.
MAN (WHISPERS.)
It's not a dog.
BOY. (BARELY MANAGING TO WHISPER.)
It is! It's a dog! A dog!
The MAN listens anxiously as the pawing and scratching
continues, the wood over the bunker amplifying the noise. He
cocks the revolver and positions himself under the hatch,
ready.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
If it's a dog it'll be with
someone.
BOY.
Who?
MAN.
I don't know.
After a torturous moment the sounds die away.
MAN. (CONT'D)
I'm not waiting to find out. Come
on. Let's get out of here.
BOY.
I don't want to go.
MAN.
I know but it's not safe anymore.
The MAN grabs his gun and cocks it, rushes about turning out
all the lamps, and they sit anxiously in the darkness.
The MAN starts loading cans and packets into a carton. He
gathers a couple of large jerry cans of water. The BOY helps.
BOY.
What are we going to do with all
this stuff?
MAN.
We'll just have to take what we
can.
BOY.
I wish we could live here. And we
could keep the dog and the dog
could catch food for us.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
Look, there is no dog, okay? I'm
sorry but there just isn't.
BOY.
Well what is it!
MAN.
I don't know what it is!
BOY.
Please Papa.
MAN.
No.
BOY.
Just say it's going to be all
right, Papa. Say it. Just say it,
please.
The MAN doesn't know what to say, losing patience.
MAN.
Listen, trouble comes when you
least expect it. So maybe the thing
to do is to just always expect it.
BOY.
Do you always expect it? Papa?
MAN.
I do, yes.
BOY.
You always think bad things are
going to happen but we found this
place. Maybe we'll find another
place like this at the coast.
MAN.
Maybe.
The MAN dumps the carton of food on the floor and packs
another, organising jerry cans of water.
The MAN and the BOY are camped inside an old church, dusty,
faded stained glass is the only colour, startling after all
the monochrome. The MAN and BOY are wrapped up in blankets, a
small fire going. The BOY is asleep but the MAN is awake,
coughing. He sits up, still coughing. He gets up and walks
outside, trying to stifle the coughing.
He wanders into an antechamber, coughing uncontrollably,
falls to his knees in a shroud of morning mist flooding the
church - and coughs up a gob of something dark and nasty,
spits it into the misty ground.
POV MAN - the mist before him clears to reveal a spattering
of dark blood on the pale ash. He stares, shocked, knowing
what it signifies.
The BOY opens his eyes, he hasn't been asleep, listening to
the MAN cough, worried. The MAN returns and eyes the worried
BOY.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
What's wrong?
BOY.
I had a bad dream.
MAN.
What about?
BOY.
I don't want to tell you. Just you.
MAN.
What happened to me?
The BOY's face crinkles up, he starts to sob.
The MAN coughs again and the BOY shoots out a hand, puts it
over the MAN's mouth to staunch the coughing.
MAN. (V.0.) (CONT'D)
I tell him: When you dream about
bad things happening it shows
you're still fighting. You're still
alive. It's when you start to dream
about good things you should start
to worry.
He limps up the stairs of the old warehouse as quickly as he
can, flare gun at the ready, arrow in his leg.
He bursts into the main room and trains the gun. At the far
end a WOMAN is sitting with the prone form of the ARCHER. The
floor is burnt in a huge patch left by the flare and is still
in flames.
ARCHER'S WOMAN.
You son of a bitch!
MAN.
Who else is up here?
ARCHER'S WOMAN.
You fucking asshole!
The MAN looks down, his leg is bleeding heavily now and the
arrow is still sticking out.
MAN.
Where's the bow?
ARCHER'S WOMAN.
I don't have it.
MAN.
Why are you following us?
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
ARCHER'S WOMAN.
We're not following anybody. You
were following us!
The MAN stares at the WOMAN, looking her up and down, she
looks sick and thin and desperate. He looks at the ARCHER,
lying there dead, his chest and one arm and his face burnt,
still smoking. The WOMAN covers his face with the blanket and
the MAN doesn't know what to say, ashamed. He goes.
One wall of the CAFE is merely a pile of rubble, opening out
to the sea. The opposite wall is a photographic mural of lush
green woods. The MAN tries to pull the arrow out but just
pulls the wooden stem out. He takes off his bloodied trousers
and examines the gaping wound with a flap of flesh and the
arrow head, made from a SPOON, buried inside.
MAN.
See if you can find the medical kit
from the boat. Quickly.
The BOY rummages in the trolley, finds the kit and hands it
over. He stares as the MAN slowly extracts the spoon, wincing
in agony. The MAN dowses the wound in antiseptic from the kit
and searches through the kit for a needle. He finds a suture
needle in a sterile envelope, rips it open with his teeth
and, using the light coming in through the parlour windows he
threads some silk thread into the needle. He starts to suture
up the wound, grimacing in pain as the BOY watches in
silence, until eventually offering:
BOY
Does it hurt?
The MAN just looks at him in disbelief - beat.
MAN.
Yes! It hurts!
BOY.
What does it feel like?
The MAN eyes the BOY, amazed at this inopportune chat.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
MAN.
At least you're talking to me now.
They have a campfire in the cafe by the jetty and sit
overlooking the bay, through the missing wall, silent until:
MAN.
Do you want me to tell you a story?
BOY.
No.
MAN.
Why not?
BOY.
Your stories aren't true.
MAN.
They don't have to be true. They're
stories.
BOY.
In the stories we're always helping
people. But we don't help people.
We just shoot people. And in the
stories good things happen but we
just get sick.
The MAN thinks about it - stuck for an answer.
MAN.
We're still here aren't we? Doesn't
that mean anything?
