ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops
up beside her.
YOUNG ANNA
Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.
Elsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.
YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
YOUNG ELSA
(grumbling)
Anna, go back to sleep.
Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.

FROZEN - J. Lee
YOUNG ANNA
(drama queen-ish)
I just can't. The sky's awake, so
I'm awake, so we have to play.
YOUNG ELSA
...Go play by yourself.
Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.
Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets
an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's
eyelids.
YOUNG ANNA
(mischievously)
Do you want to build a snowman?
Elsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles.
Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.
YOUNG ANNA
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited.
The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.
YOUNG ANNA
Do the magic! Do the magic!
Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly
burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.
Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out
and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching
flakes in her palms and mouth.
YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
This is amazing!
YOUNG ELSA
Watch this!
Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna
slides off, laughing.

FROZEN - J. Lee
PLAY MONTAGE:
-Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman
together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.
YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
(goofy voice)
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
Anna jumps up and hugs him.
YOUNG ANNA
I love you, Olaf.
-Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually
propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.
-The girls slide down snowbanks together!
-Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.
YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
Catch me!
Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna.
YOUNG ELSA
Gotcha!
Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic.
YOUNG ANNA
(jumping faster)
Again! Again!
YOUNG ELSA
(struggling to keep up)
Slow down!
Elsa suddenly slips.
Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles
down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.
YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
ANNA!
Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of
Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.
YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
MAMA! PAPA!
The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.

The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight
of the room.

The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.
ELSA
It was an accident. I'm sorry,
Anna.
QUEEN
(about Anna)
She's ice cold.
KING
...I know where we have to go.
SLAM CUT TO:
The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book
inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles
to a page with an ancient map.
We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the
window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes
down the hall.
Anna knocks on Elsa's door and SINGS.
"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"
YOUNG ANNA
DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?
COME ON LET'S GO AND PLAY.
Anna peeks under the door.
YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)

YOUNG ELSA (O.S.)

YOUNG ANNA

-BEHIND THE DOOR -- DAY. Elsa sits at the window looking out,
longingly. Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.
-LATER. The King slips leather gloves onto Elsa's hands.
KING
The gloves will help.
He pats her gloved hand.

ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
Hang in there, Joan.
ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY

But then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather

Anna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum.
ANNA (9) (CONT'D)

The entire wall is frozen behind her.

Pulls a hair from her mouth.

Elsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation. She
takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a
candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter.
ELSA (CONT'D)

MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE

The candlestick and ornament ice over. Elsa gasps, slams them
back down onto the table. She tries to reassure herself.
ELSA (CONT'D)
BUT IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY.
We cut between Anna's excitement and Elsa's nerves.
ANNA
IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY!

IT'S AGONY TO WAIT.

I KNOW IT ALL ENDS TOMORROW,

`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER!

-Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE!
She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off
of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the
horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.
ANNA (CONT'D)
(frustrated)
Hey!
HANS
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?
The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal.
ANNA
(gentler)
Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.
HANS
Are you sure?
ANNA
Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I
was going. But I'm okay.
He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.
ANNA (CONT'D)
I'm great, actually.

FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS
Oh, thank goodness.
He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps
her to her feet.
HANS (CONT'D)
(bowing)
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
ANNA
(curtseying)
Princess Anna of Arendelle.
HANS
Princess...? My Lady.
He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too,
curling his hoof up and out of the boat.
The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.
ANNA
Hi...again.
The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.
Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.
HANS
Oh boy.
ANNA
Ha. This is awkward. Not you're
awkward, but just because we're--
I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.
(did she just say that?)
Wait, what?
Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.
HANS
I'd like to formally apologize for
hitting the Princess of Arendelle
with my horse...and for every
moment after.
ANNA
No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT
Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my

FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA (CONT'D)
(to Hans)
But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.
HANS
Just you?
Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She
doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's
handsomeness.
ANNA
...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I
better go. I have to...I better go.
She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Bye!
As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves
too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.
HANS
Oh no.
The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down
in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.
CUT TO:
Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She
peeks out to the audience.
Hans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes.
The crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are
presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them.
BISHOP
(a whisper)
Your Majesty, the gloves.
Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves,
places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb
and scepter, then turns to the people.

The scepter and orb start to freeze over.
BISHOP (CONT'D)
...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
CROWD
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Just in time. Elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back
down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice. She picks
up her gloves and slips them on. She made it.
CUT TO:
Springy music fills the Great Hall. Guests dance. Eat. Laugh.
TRUMPETS SOUND.
KAI

Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Elsa enters, poised and looking surprisingly content. She
stands under a formal awning.
KAI (CONT'D)
Princess Anna of Arendelle!
Anna runs into the room, waves awkwardly. Kai ushers her over
to stand right next to Elsa.
ANNA
Here? Are you sure?
She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other.
ELSA
...Hi.
ANNA
Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.
ELSA
...You look beautiful.
ANNA
Thank you. You look beautifuller. I
mean, not fuller. You don't look
fuller, but more beautiful.
21
FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA
Thank you.
They look out at the celebration.
ELSA (CONT'D)
So, this is what a party looks
like?
ANNA
It's warmer than I thought.
ELSA
And what is that amazing smell?
They both close their eyes and inhale.
ANNA AND ELSA (TOGETHER)
...Chocolate.
Their eyes pop open. They laugh.
Elsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She
wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start.
Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts.
KAI
Your Majesty. The Duke of
Weaseltown.
DUKE
Weselton. The Duke of Weselton.
(to Elsa)
Your Majesty, as your closest
partner in trade, it seems only
fitting that I offer you your first
dance as queen.
The Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and
a deep bow.
DUKE (CONT'D)
(whispers to himself)
One, two, three. Jump.
As he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward.
Anna giggles. Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself.
ELSA
(to the Duke)
Thank you...only I don't dance.
22
FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE
(offended)
Oh...?
ELSA
But my sister does.
ANNA
What?
DUKE
Lucky you....
ANNA
Oh, I don't think--
The Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can
protest.
DUKE
If you swoon, let me know, I'll
catch you.
Anna looks back at Elsa, desperately.
ELSA
Sorry.
OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but he's just
awful. Anna tries to make the best of it.
DUKE
Like an agile peacock... CLUCK-
CLUGGLE-CLUCK!
He lands on her feet.
ANNA
Ow. Ow.
DUKE
Speaking of, so great to have the
gates open. Why did they shut them
in the first place? Do you know the
reason? Hmm?
He gets in her face, suspicious.
ANNA
...No.
23
FROZEN - J. Lee
DUKE
Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't
call me the little dipper for
nothing.
He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely
hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks.
DUKE (CONT'D)
(groove fully on)
Like a chicken...with the face of a
monkey...I fly.
JUMP CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER...
Anna limps back to Elsa.
DUKE (O.S.)
Let me know when you're ready for
another round, M'Lady.
ELSA
Well, he was sprightly.
ANNA
(rubbing her sore feet)
Especially for a man in heels.
ELSA
Are you okay?
ANNA
(loving Elsa's attention)
I've never been better. This is so
nice. I wish it could be like this
all the time.
ELSA
(sincere)
Me too....
But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away.
ELSA (CONT'D)
But it can't.
ANNA
Why not? If--
ELSA
It just can't.
24
FROZEN - J. Lee
Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional.
ANNA
Excuse me for a minute.
She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened.
Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's
butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches
her. He smiles perfectly.
HANS
Glad I caught you.
ANNA
Hans.
He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts
her up and leads her in a romantic dance.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER: Anna and Hans drink and chat.
ANNA (CONT'D)
I often had the whole parlor to
myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.
She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs.
DISSOLVE TO:
-THE CASTLE DOORS: Anna and Hans stroll out of the castle.
ANNA (CONT'D)
...Your physique helps I'm sure.
DISSOLVE TO:
-THE ROSE GARDEN... Hans notices her white streak.
HANS
(about her white streak)
What's this?
ANNA
I was born with it, although I
dreamt I was kissed by a troll.
HANS
I like it.
DISSOLVE TO:
25
FROZEN - J. Lee
Anna pushes through the crowd towards Elsa, Hans in tow.
ANNA
Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just
get around you there? Thank you.
Oh, there she is. Elsa!
Elsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly.
ANNA (CONT'D)
I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um.
May I present Prince Hans of the
Southern Isles.
HANS
(bowing)
Your Majesty.
Elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey.
ANNA
We would like--
HANS
--your blessing--
ANNA
--of--
ANNA/HANS
--our marriage!
ELSA
Marriage...?
ANNA
Yes!
ELSA
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
ANNA
Well, we haven't worked out all the
details ourselves. We'll need a few
days to plan the ceremony. Of
course we'll have soup, roast, and
ice cream and then--
Wait. Would we live here?
ELSA
Here?
30
FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS
Absolutely!
ELSA
Anna--
ANNA
Oh, we can invite all twelve of
your brothers to stay with us--
ELSA
What? No, no, no, no, no.
ANNA
Of course we have the room. I don't
know. Some of them must--
ELSA
Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers
are staying here. No one is getting
married.
ANNA
Wait, what?
ELSA
May I talk to you, please. Alone.
Anna sees Hans's worried face. Hooks arms with him.
ANNA
No. Whatever you have to say, you-
you can say to both of us.
ELSA
Fine. You can't marry a man you
just met.
ANNA
You can if it's true love.
ELSA
Anna, what do you know about true
love?
ANNA
More than you. All you know is how
to shut people out.
ELSA
You asked for my blessing, but my
answer is no. Now, excuse me.
31
FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS
Your Majesty, if I may ease your--
ELSA
(flustered)
No, you may not. And I-I think you
should go.
Elsa walks away. As she passes the Royal Handler--
ELSA (CONT'D)
The party is over. Close the gates.
ANNA
What? Elsa, no. No, wait!
Anna grabs Elsa's hand. She pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa
gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.
ELSA
Give me my glove!
Anna holds the glove away from Elsa.
ANNA
(desperate)
Elsa, please. Please. I can't live
like this anymore.
Elsa fights tears.
ELSA
(weak)
...Then leave.
Elsa sees Anna's hurt face. It's too much. She can't hold it
in. She turns and rushes away.
ANNA
(heartbroken)
...What did I ever do to you?!
The party goes silent as everyone watches the sisters.
ELSA
Enough, Anna.
ANNA
No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!
Why do you shut the world out?!
What are you so afraid of?!
ELSA
I said, enough!
32
FROZEN - J. Lee
Ice shoots from Elsa's hand, spikes across the floor! Guests
cry out in shock, back away.
DUKE
(ducking behind his men)
...Sorcery. I knew there was
something dubious going on here.
ANNA
Elsa...?
Elsa rushes out of the room.
CUT TO:
Snow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd.
CROWD WALLAH
Snow? It's...snow...in July.
34
FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS
...Are you all right?
ANNA
(in shock)
No.
HANS
Did you know?
ANNA
No.
Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright.
DUKE
Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!
The Queen has cursed this land! She
must be stopped!
(to his thugs)
You have to go after her.
Anna rushes up to the Duke.
ANNA
Wait, no!
The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna.
DUKE
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?
Are you a monster, too?
ANNA
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.
HANS
That's right she is...
(realizing how that
sounds)
...in the best way.
ANNA
...And my sister's not a monster.
DUKE
She nearly killed me.
HANS
You slipped on ice.
DUKE
Her ice!
35
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
It was an accident. She was scared.
She didn't mean it. She didn't mean
any of this.... Tonight was my
fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one
that needs to go after her.
DUKE
Yes. Fine. Do.
HANS
What?
ANNA
(to the Royal Handler)
Bring me my horse, please.
HANS
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.
ANNA
Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring
her back, and I'll make this right.
The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak.
HANS
I'm coming with you.
ANNA
No, I need you here to take care of
Arendelle.
He sees the desperation in her eyes.
HANS
...On my honor.
She throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse,
coronation dress and all.
ANNA
(to the crowd)
I leave Prince Hans in charge!
HANS
(before letting her go)
Are you sure you can trust her? I
don't want you getting hurt.
ANNA
She's my sister; she would never
hurt me.
36
FROZEN - J. Lee
She snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her.
The snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a
blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves...
Anna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen
butt and knocks her into the center of the shop. She looks
around, sees only summer supplies.
OAKEN (O.S.)
Hoo hoo.
Anna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind
the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip.
OAKEN (CONT'D)
Big summer blow out. Half off
swimming suits, clogs, and a sun
balm of my own invention, yah?
ANNA
Oh, great. For now, how about
boots. Winter boots...and dresses?
40
FROZEN - J. Lee
OAKEN
(slight disappointment)
That would be in our winter
department.
The winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a
lonely pair of boots.
ANNA
Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has
another young woman, the Queen
perhaps, I don't know, passed
through here?
She brings the clothes and boots to the counter.
OAKEN
Only one crazy enough to be out in
this storm is you, dear?
The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a
man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF.
OAKEN (CONT'D)
You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo.
Big summer blow out.
Kristoff walks right up to Anna.
KRISTOFF
(in her face)
Carrots.
ANNA
Huh?
KRISTOFF
Behind you.
ANNA
Oh, right. Excuse me.
Anna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of
carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the
place, gathering other supplies.
OAKEN
(to Kristoff)
A real howler in July, yah? Where
ever could it be coming from?
KRISTOFF
The North Mountain.
41
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
(to herself)
North Mountain.
Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on
his fingertips.
OAKEN
That'll be forty.
KRISTOFF
Forty? No, ten.
OAKEN
(sweet as pie)
Oh dear, that's no good. See these
are from our winter stock, where
supply and demand have a big
problem.
KRISTOFF
You want to talk about a supply and
demand problem? I sell ice for a
living.
Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of
ice on his sled, covered in snow.
ANNA
Ooh, that's a rough business to be
in right now. I mean, that is
really...
(he shoots her a look)
Ahem. That's unfortunate.
OAKEN
Still forty. But I will throw in a
visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!
Hi, family.
Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through
the window of the steaming sauna.
NAKED FAMILY
Hoo hoo!
KRISTOFF
...Ten's all I got. Help me out.
OAKEN
(isolating the carrots)
Ten will get you this and no more.
Kristoff seethes. Stalemate.
42
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
Okay, just tell me one thing; what
was happening on the North
Mountain? Did it seem magical?
Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.
KRISTOFF
Yes! Now, back up while I deal with
this crook here.
Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.
OAKEN
What did you call me?
Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he
squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again.
OAKEN
(teddy bear)
I'm sorry about this violence. I
will add a quart of lutefisk, so
we'll have good feelings. Just the
outfit and boots, yah?
43
FROZEN - J. Lee
Anna looks between Kristoff's supplies and the door.
CUT TO:
Kristoff, now unfrozen, relaxes on a bed of hay, playing his
lute and singing to (and for) Sven.
"Reindeer(s) are Better than People"
KRISTOFF
REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE.
SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?
KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
(throwing his voice)
YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE
YOU & CHEAT YOU.
EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU.
(speaking)
Oh, thanks, Buddy.
(singing, as Kristoff)
BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN
REINDEERS.
SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?
(As Sven)
THAT'S ONCE AGAIN TRUE,
FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU.
(As Kristoff)
YOU GOT ME. LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.
(As Sven)
GOOD NIGHT.
(As Kristoff)
DON'T LET THE FROSTBITE BITE.
The door opens. Anna enters.
ANNA
Nice duet.
Kristoff sits up with a start...sees who it is.
KRISTOFF
Oh, it's just you. What do you
want?
ANNA
I want you to take me up the North
Mountain.
44
FROZEN - J. Lee
KRISTOFF
I don't take people places.
He lays back down, closes his eyes.
ANNA
Let me rephrase that...
A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.
KRISTOFF
Umph.
He sits up. Looks in the bag.
ANNA
Take me up the North Mountain....
Please.
He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Look, I know how to stop this
winter.
He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.
KRISTOFF
We leave at dawn.... And you forgot
the carrots for Sven.
A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.
KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
Ugh!
ANNA
Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I
didn't--
(catching herself)
We leave now. Right now.
She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed,
Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff
has a bite, contemplating.
SLAM CUT TO:
Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The
hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks
them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes.
ANNA
I never knew winter could be so
beautiful.
Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that
voice OLAF.
OLAF (O.S.)
YEAH...It really is beautiful,
isn't it? But it's so white. You
know, how about a little color?
Must we bleach the joy out of it
all? I'm thinking like maybe some
crimson, chartreuse...
While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the
source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually
be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in
branches, just as baffled as they are.
In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind
them.
OLAF (CONT'D)
How `bout yellow--no, not yellow.
Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.
He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him.
How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Am I right?
53
FROZEN - J. Lee
Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head,
sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms.
OLAF (CONT'D)
(cheery, to Kristoff)
Hi!
KRISTOFF
You're creepy.
Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a
game of hot potato.
ANNA
I don't want it!
KRISTOFF
Backatchya!
OLAF
Please don't drop me.
ANNA
Don't!
KRISTOFF
Come on, it's just a head.
ANNA
No!
Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.
OLAF (O.S.)
All right, we got off to a bad
start.
ANNA
Ew, ew, the body!
Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down. Olaf
smiles happily, then looks confused.
OLAF
Wait, what am I looking at right
now? Why are you hanging off the
earth like a bat?
ANNA
(sympathetic)
...Okay. Wait one second.
Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head.
54
FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF
Oooh! Thank you!
ANNA
You're welcome.
OLAF
Now I'm perfect.
She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.
ANNA
Well, almost.
She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as
Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the
way through his head.
OLAF
Woo! Head rush!
ANNA
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was
just.... Are you okay?
Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his
eyes. He lights up.
OLAF
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!
I've always wanted a nose.
(going cross-eyed to look
at his tiny nose)
So cute. It's like a little baby
unicorn.
Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking
out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.
OLAF (CONT'D)
What? Hey! Whoa.
(seeing his now big nose)
Oh, I love it even more! Hah....
All right, let's start this thing
over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I
like warm hugs.
Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It
takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.
ANNA
Olaf?...That's right, Olaf.
55
FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF
...And you are?
ANNA
Oh, um...I'm Anna.
OLAF
And who's the funky-looking donkey
over there?
ANNA
That's Sven.
OLAF
Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?
ANNA
...Sven.
Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused.
OLAF
Oh. They're--oh, okay....
(accepting it)
Makes things easier for me.
Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss
my nose.
(gushes)
I like you, too!
ANNA
Olaf, did Elsa build you?
OLAF
Yeah. Why?
Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies
it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.
ANNA
Do you know where she is?
KRISTOFF
(studying the arm)
Fascinating...
OLAF
Yeah. Why?
56
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
Do you think you could show us the
way?
OLAF
Yeah. Why?
KRISTOFF
(bending the arm)
How does this work?
Olaf's dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.
OLAF
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus
here.
(to Anna)
Yeah, why?
KRISTOFF
I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to
bring back summer.
OLAF
(shocked)
Summer?
(sinking into wistfulness)
Oh, I don't know why but I've
always loved the idea of summer,
and sun, and all things hot.
KRISTOFF
Really? I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat.
OLAF
Nope. But sometimes I like to close
my eyes and imagine what it'd be
like when summer does come.
DISSOLVE TO:
OLAF'S FANTASY WORLD -- PERFECT SUMMER DAY
Olaf walks through a grassy meadow with the sun shining
behind him. He SINGS.
"In Summer"

OLAF (CONT'D)

-Olaf and another snowman drink hot chocolate in a hot tub.
OLAF (CONT'D)
THE HOT AND THE COLD ARE BOTH SO

-Olaf tap dances with a gaggle of seagulls.

-Olaf bounds down a grassy hill.
OLAF (CONT'D)
WINTER'S A GOOD TIME TO STAY IN AND

He stops at a puddle, looks down at it. Smiles. Hops over it.
58
FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF (CONT'D)
HAPPY SNOWMAN!
-Olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out. He
relaxes and stares at the blue sky.
OLAF (CONT'D)
WHEN LIFE GETS ROUGH I LIKE TO HOLD
ON TO MY DREAM / OF RELAXING IN THE
SUMMER SUN JUST LETTING OFF STEAM!
Sven, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf have a picnic.
OLAF (CONT'D)
OH THE SKY WILL BE BLUE / AND YOU
GUYS'LL BE THERE TOO / WHEN I
FINALLY DO WHAT FROZEN THINGS DO IN
SUMMER!
KRISTOFF
I'm gonna tell him.
ANNA
Don't you dare.
OLAF
IN SUMMER!
Olaf sings the final note. We swing around him and return to:
REALITY. He then straightens up and smiles.
OLAF (CONT'D)
So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's
go bring back summer!
Olaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain.
ANNA
(laughing)
I'm coming!
Sven hops along, happily following them. Kristoff watches all
of them like they're nuts.
KRISTOFF
Somebody's got to tell him.
DISSOLVE TO:

FROZEN - J. Lee
Anna walks into a great foyer. The place is beautiful, but
also eerie.
ANNA
Elsa? It's me...Anna?!
Anna slips. Steadies herself.
ELSA (O.S.)
Anna.
Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony. She sees Anna,
looks to her longingly.
Anna can't help but be struck by Elsa's beauty.
ANNA
Elsa, you look different.... It's a
good different.... And this place
is amazing.
66
FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA
(cautious, polite)
Thank you, I never knew what I was
capable of.
Anna starts to climb the stairs.
ANNA
...I'm so sorry about what
happened. If I'd known--
Elsa backs up, away from Anna.
ELSA
(on guard)
No, it's okay. You don't have to
apologize.... But you should
probably go, please.
ANNA
But I just got here.
ELSA
...You belong in Arendelle.
ANNA
So do you.
Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more.
ELSA
No, I belong here. Alone. Where I
can be who I am without hurting
anybody.
ANNA
...Actually, about that--
OLAF (O.S.)
58...59...60.
ELSA
Wait. What is that?
Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves.
OLAF
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
ELSA
(shocked)
Olaf?
Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated.
67
FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF
(bashful)
You built me. You remember that?
ELSA
(astonished)
And you're alive?
OLAF
Um...I think so?
Anna kneels down beside Olaf.
ANNA
He's just like the one we built as
kids.... We were so close. We can
be like that again.
Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her.
FLASH CUT TO:
FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by Elsa's powers.
YOUNG ELSA
Anna!
Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her.
FLASH CUT TO:
THE PRESENT: Elsa's face sinks in pain.
ELSA
No, we can't.
Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps.
ELSA (CONT'D)
Goodbye, Anna.
ANNA
Elsa, wait--
ELSA
(calling back)
I'm just trying to protect you.
Elsa continues to flee. Anna pursues.
ANNA
You don't have to protect me. I'm
not afraid. Please don't shut me
out again.
68
FROZEN - J. Lee
Anna SINGS.
"First Time in Forever, Reprise"
ANNA (CONT'D)
PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR
DISTANCE ANYMORE.
`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
FOREVER,
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND.
WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN
TOGETHER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR.
`CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
FOREVER,
I WILL BE RIGHT HERE.
They arrive on the top floor, Elsa's main living space. Elsa
turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined.
ELSA
Anna,
PLEASE GO BACK HOME.
YOUR LIFE AWAITS.
GO ENJOY THE SUN
AND OPEN UP THE GATES.
ANNA
Yeah, but--
ELSA
I know!
YOU MEAN WELL,
BUT LEAVE ME BE.
YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND
FREE.
Elsa opens up the balcony doors.
ELSA (CONT'D)
JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE
FROM ME.
ANNA
ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT.
ELSA
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT?
69
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?
ELSA
WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?
ANNA
ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP
SNOW.
ELSA
What?
Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains.
ANNA
You kind of set off an eternal
winter...everywhere.
ELSA
Everywhere?
ANNA
It's okay, you can just unfreeze
it.
ELSA
No, I can't. I don't know how.
ANNA
Sure you can. I know you can.
Snow starts to swirl around the room.
ANNA (CONT'D)
CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
ELSA
(panicking)
I'M SUCH A FOOL!
I CAN'T BE FREE!
ANNA
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.
ELSA
NO ESCAPE
FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME!
The snow picks up. Anna tries to fight through it.
ANNA
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER.
70
FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA
I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE!
ANNA
WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE
MADE.
ELSA
ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT
WORSE!
ANNA
DON'T PANIC.
ELSA
THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR!
ANNA
WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.
ELSA
YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!
ANNA
WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...
But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening
blizzard taking over the room.
ELSA
NO!
ANNA (O.S.)
WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER,
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...
Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.
ELSA
I CAN'T!
Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and
then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.
Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in
pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees.
Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff
rush into the room to Anna's side.
KRISTOFF
Anna. Are you okay?
71
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
I'm okay.... I'm fine.
Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.
ELSA
(scared)
Who's this? Wait, it doesn't
matter. You have to go.
ANNA
No, I know we can figure this out
together--
ELSA
(desperate)
How? What power do you have to stop
this winter? To stop me?
Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows
creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.
KRISTOFF
Anna, I think we should go.
ANNA
(close to tears)
No. I'm not leaving without you,
Elsa.
ELSA
(heartbroken but decisive)
Yes, you are.
Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman.
We'll call him MARSHMALLOW.
SLAM CUT TO:
Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself.
ELSA
(mantra-style)
Get it together. Control it. Don't
feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!
She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a
sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow
up the wall, taking over the castle.
DISSOLVE TO:

FROZEN - J. Lee
They guards burst through the ice doors.
Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue.
They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.
ELSA
(scared)
No. Please.
One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last
moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches
from her face.
The thugs reposition to take another shot.
ELSA (CONT'D)
Stay away!
Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and
continue the attack.
THUG
Get her! Get her!
Elsa fights for her life.
BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls
away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices
Marshmallow's leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles
back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not
before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge.
REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and
they rush into the ice palace.
Elsa is surrounded. It's do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa
traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.
The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against
the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK.
OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug
is pushed to the edge. He's inches away from falling to his
death.
BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and
the thugs near death.
90
FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS
Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster
they fear you are.
Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened,
moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans,
overwhelmed, frightened.
The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice
spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage
and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back.
Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the
arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging
directly above Elsa.
The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN.
Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast.
All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the
sound of it shattering as it rings out.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE IN ON:
Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open.
She sits up. She's surrounded by stone.
Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's
pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves.
She's chained to the wall.
Elsa strains to looks out a window...
INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting
further buried under the ice and snow that is falling.
ELSA
No....What have I done?
Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door.
ELSA (CONT'D)
Why did you bring me here?
HANS
I couldn't just let them kill you.
91
FROZEN - J. Lee
ELSA
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get
Anna.
HANS
Anna has not returned....
Elsa looks to the storm with worry.
HANS (CONT'D)
If you would just stop the winter,
bring back summer...please.
Elsa meets his eyes, desperate.
ELSA
Don't you see...I can't.
Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes.
ELSA (CONT'D)
You have to tell them to let me go.
Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.
HANS
I will do what I can.
He opens the door and leaves.
Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her
shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up.
CUT TO:
Hans stands with the dignitaries and guards.
HANS
I'm going back out to look for
Princess Anna.
FRENCH DIGNITARY
You cannot risk going out there
again.
HANS
If anything happens to her--
SPANISH DIGNITARY
If anything happens to the
Princess, you are all Arendelle has
left.
Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to
depend on him. Is he really all they have left?
Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna.
KAI
He's in here. Prince Hans.
HANS
Anna.
94
FROZEN - J. Lee
Hans rushes to Anna. She falls into his arms.
HANS (CONT'D)
You're so cold.
ANNA
(weak, but desperate)
Hans, you have to kiss me.
HANS
What?
ANNA
Now. Here we go.
She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in
his arms.
GERDA
We'll give you two some privacy.
Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.
HANS
What happened out there?
ANNA
Elsa struck me with her powers.
HANS
You said she'd never hurt you.
ANNA
I was wrong.
Anna crumbles, weak.
HANS
Anna.
Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.
ANNA
(shivering more)
She froze my heart and only an act
of true love can save me.
HANS
(understanding)
A true love's kiss.
He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile.
He leans in slowly...gently...
95
FROZEN - J. Lee
Then he stops.
HANS (CONT'D)
Oh, Anna. If only there was someone
out there who loved you.
ANNA
What?
Hans gets up, leaving her there.
ANNA (CONT'D)
...You said you did.
He goes to the window and shuts the curtains.
HANS
As thirteenth in line in my own
kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I
knew I'd have to marry into the
throne somewhere--
ANNA
What are you talking about?
HANS
(putting out the candles)
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of
course. But no one was getting
anywhere with her. But you-
ANNA
Hans?
HANS
You were so desperate for love you
were willing to marry me, just like
that.
Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table
and goes to the fireplace.
HANS (CONT'D)
I figured, after we married, I'd
have to stage a little accident for
Elsa.
Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire.
Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak.
ANNA
Hans. No, stop.
96
FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS
But then she doomed herself, and
you were dumb enough to go after
her.
ANNA
Please.
HANS
(chuckles)
All that's left now is to kill Elsa
and bring back summer.
Hans approaches Anna.
ANNA
...You're no match for Elsa.
He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time
not so gently.
HANS
No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on
the other hand, am the hero who is
going to save Arendelle from
destruction.
She wrenches her face out of his hands.
ANNA
(anger)
You won't get away with this.
Hans rises and crosses to the door.
HANS
Oh, I already have.
Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna
struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.
ANNA
(hoarse and weak)
Please, somebody help.
The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the
floor.

FROZEN - J. Lee
The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He
rubs his arms and shivers.
DUKE
It's getting colder by the minute.
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.
Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face.
SPANISH DIGNITARY
Prince Hans.
HANS
Princess Anna is...dead.
VARIOUS DIGNITARIES
What...? No.... Mon dieu.
Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair.
DUKE
What happened to her?
HANS
She was killed by Queen Elsa.
DUKE
Her own sister.
HANS
(really putting it on)
At least we got to say our marriage
vows...before she died in my arms.
He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.
DUKE
There can be no doubt now; Queen
Elsa is a monster and we are all in
grave danger.
SPANISH DIGNITARY
Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to
you.
Hans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do
it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas.
98
FROZEN - J. Lee
HANS
With a heavy heart, I charge Queen
Elsa of Arendelle with treason and
sentence her to death.
The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is
devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.
GUARD (O.S.)
She's dangerous. Move quickly and
with resolve.
Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door
busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men
duck out of the way.
Hans pushes his way into the room...sees...
The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the
floor. Elsa is gone.
CUT TO:
Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking
the ceiling.
The door handle suddenly jiggles. Stops. Jiggles again.
ANNA
(barely a whisper)
Help.
CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and
hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back
on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.
OLAF
Anna. Oh no.
He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood,
including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues,
before striking a match and relighting the fire.
100
FROZEN - J. Lee
ANNA
Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.
OLAF
Whoa! So this is heat....
(considering)
I love it.
He reaches a twig finger toward the flames. It catches on
fire.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Ooh! But don't touch it!
He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to
the fire.
OLAF (CONT'D)
So, where's Hans? What happened to
your kiss?
ANNA
I was wrong about him. It wasn't
true love.
OLAF
(confused innocence)
Huh. But we ran all the way here?
ANNA
Please Olaf, you can't stay here;
you'll melt.
OLAF
I am not leaving here until we find
some other act of true love to save
you.
He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against
hers and thinks.
OLAF (CONT'D)
...Do you happen to have any ideas?
ANNA
I don't even know what love is.
OLAF
(confident)
That's okay, I do....
Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder.
101
FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF (CONT'D)
Love is...putting someone else's
needs before yours, like, you know,
how Kristoff brought you back here
to Hans and left you forever.
ANNA
...Kristoff loves me?
OLAF
Wow, you really don't know anything
about love, do you?
His face starts to melt.
ANNA
Olaf, you're melting.
OLAF
(sweet and reassuring)
Some people are worth melting for.
But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow
back in place.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Just maybe not right this second.
Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Don't worry, I've got it!
Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut
but struggles with the second panel.
OLAF (CONT'D)
(determined)
We're going to get through--
(distracted)
Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting
something.
He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope
and sees...
Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain.
OLAF (CONT'D)
It's Kristoff and Sven! They're
coming back this way.
ANNA
...They-they are?
102
FROZEN - J. Lee
OLAF
Wow, he's really moving fast.
Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I
guess Kristoff doesn't love you
enough to leave you behind.
Anna tries to get to her feet.
ANNA
Help me up, Olaf. Please.
He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the
chess set and water jugs.
OLAF
No, no, no, no, no. You need to
stay by the fire and keep warm.
ANNA
I need to get to Kristoff.
OLAF
(clueless)
Why...?
(realizing)
Oh, oh, oh, I know why.
He hops around in an excited display of hope.
OLAF (CONT'D)
There's your act of true love,
right there, riding across the
fjords like a valiant, pungent
reindeer king! Come on!
The walls crack under the ice pressure.
OLAF (CONT'D)
Look out!
They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.
Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and
block their path.
OLAF
We're trapped.
Anna looks around desperately for a way out.
