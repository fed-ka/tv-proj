A racing SQUIDDIES
reaches the hull
and latches on,
striking up its
cutting laser and ripping into the hull.
The wing
of DEFENDERS
makes short
work of
the squiddies.
The half
dozen clinging to FREEDOM'S hull
are picked off by well-placed
laser
shots
that
turn
the
squiddies into
curdling
balls
of
slag. The
squiddies that survive turn tail and run.
The tarmac
is a
busy, crowded
military airport,
with hovercraft of
different
sizes
spread
across
the
lot.
Its
housed
poorly
lit,
houses in a cave so huge
the ceiling is out of site.
Crewpersons run
around,
servicing
battle-damaged
vehicles.
Munitions
are
carted
across the tarmac on
robot rolling racks. No
one
pays the NEB
and
its battered crew any mind.
Nearby, the SEPHORA and FREEDOM
are parked. Their engines shut
down,
and their powered hatches are open. The crewmembers are spilling out.
NIOBE hurries to MORPHEUS' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but
their
military manner
is quickly
restored, though
they can
barely
contain their grins.
MORPHEUS
"Niobe..."
SHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down.
"M."
MORPHEUS
"Thanks for the rescue."
THEY close for a kiss, when the FREEDOM'S captain suddenly jumps
between them.
It's CHOI - the NEO's supposed neighbor and hacking financier.
Exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in MORPHEUS' face.
CHOI
"Brough, you us your asses! We saved you so hard core you don't even
know!"
NIOBE smiles at Morpheus and fades back as BOOTH shouts his own
praises. Morpheus turns to his less-mature peer.
CHOI
"So, you think you finally found The One, huh? Another One?"
DUJOUR, CHOI'S LIEUTENANT, pushes into their conversation, looking
offscreen.
DUJOUR
"Idiot, we helped him find him. Hello, Morpheus."
CHOI
"Huh?"
He looks at what she's seeing. His gaze halts on NEO. He's
concentrating on TANK and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be
consoling him. He turns to see CHOI and DUJOUR, does a double-take,
and his jaw drops open.
NEO
"You?"
CHOI is quick to resume his cool.
CHOI
"In the flesh, so to speak."
DUJOUR
"Welcome to the real world, Neo. I'm glad you're here."
CHOI
"What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?"
DUJOUR
"Definitely."
CHOI
"Morpheus?"
MORPHEUS turns from Niobe and
a Zion officer. He addresses
Trinity,
glancing at the others.
MORPHEUS
"Go on ship's liberty. Meet me in the Dead Duck at 21:00 hours, drunk
or sober."
It's like a
valley floor running
between two gigantic
walls of rock
that are
nearly vertical,
coming together
in an
elongated archway.
Carved into the street level
are innumerable stores and shops,
above
them,
apartments and
balconies that
rise to
the top
of the
arch.
People
flow
through the
street.
Their clothes
are
homespun wool,
denim, and leather. Dyes and
color are absent. Carved into
the solid
granite
walls,
between
homes
and
around
windows
and
doors, are
intricate and beautiful carvings.
NEO is lead down
the street by CHOI,
DUJOUR, and TRINITY, and
a few
other rebels. The push through a mult-culti crowd of people,
humanity
melting into one race.
CHOI
"See, man? This is home. This is the main street. One of em, anyway.
Almost everyone is a fighter. Sometimes, even the kids.
THEY pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small
machines.
CHOI
"Our energy as a people is directed toward liberation. Check it out,
here are some newcomers."
A group of frail, buzz-cut androgonites pass by them. They look at
NEO, recognizing him as one of them, a new comer.
NEO
"Where did they come from?"
CHOI
"Energy plant we raided on our last mission. There were some
survivors."
NEO
"How are their minds freed from the Matrix?"
TRINITY
"With difficulty."
DUJOUR
"If at all."
They step into a club, Dead
Duck. Its a sailor joint. Lots
of wood,
beer on tap, and rum. Crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels,
greeting them, as they eye Neo.
They take a booth in the
corner. The
waitress arrives.
WAITRESS
"Welcome home, brothers and sisters. First day back?"
CHOI
"Yes, lovely."
WAITRESS
"On the house, then. Four rums?"
TRINITY
"Make it eight."
The waitress smirks and leaves. TRINITY turns to CHOI.
TRINITY
"Any casualties?"
CHOI lights up and takes a drag.
CHOI
"Two. Sidewinder and Left-right."
DUJOUR
"I cant believe Cypher turned. Bastard."
CHOI
"He who loses faith..."
DUJOUR
"Neo, we monitored your fight. Did you really gain enlightenment?"
NEO shrugs.
NEO
"All I know is I kicked Smiths ass."
CHOI
"Fuckin finally, Jesus Christ. Its about time we iced that bastard."
DUJOUR
"Yeah, we finally won against an agent?"
CHOI
"I guess 1 n 298 isnt a bed record, huh?"
The drinks arrive. Tall glasses of rum.
CHOI holds his glass aloft. They raise their glasses to toast.
CHOI
"Live free or die."
ALL (save NEO)
"Live free."
They slam the rum back, and
slam empty glasses on the table.
NEO can
barely manage to sip his.
NEO
"God, how do you do that?"
TRINITY
"Youve never drank before."
DUJOUR
"Not for real."
CHOI
"You want to know what being The One means?"
NEO
"What?"
CHOI
"One drink and youre toast."
DUJOUR
"Neo, you know what else youve never done?"
She glances at
Trinity, who falls
back against the
seat, turning to
suppress a smile. Choi cracks up.
NEO
"Yeah."
DUJOUR
"Yeah, youve never done it."
CHOI
"And virtual doesnt count, man, doesnt fucking count."
NEO
"Well. Ill drink to that."
CHOI
"Here, here."
This time, NEO follows the others and slams back the entire glass.
He
coughs and sputters as his friends and bar patrons cheer him on."
The lights are dim, and only a few late night revelers stagger through
the
streets
on their
way
back home.
Walking
straight and
calmly
through the stragglers are MORPHEUS and NIOBE.
MORPHEUS
"So, how do you like having your own command?"
NIOBE
"Its good. But trying. The responsibility..."
THEY stop before the entrance to the DEAD DUCK.
MORPHEUS
"You must be both mother and father to your crew."
NIOBE nods, and looks into the bar. Inside, the crews are raging drunk
and loud.
NIOBE
"Who will you be now? The mother, or the father?"
MORPHEUS peers in on the scene and grins.
MORPHEUS
"As long as they dont get out of line, Ill just be a brother."
The FREEDOM hovers
slowly, silently, like
a submarine as
it cruises
through
the murky
depths. It
suddenly comes
to a
quiet stop,
and
descends. The engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the
cave.
A quartet of
SQUIDDIES slips by.
We follow as
they worm their
ways
through
the
twisted passageway,
watching
as they
pass
the bubble
cockpit by mere feet.
FREEZE on the cockpit. Within the shadows we see Morpheus and Choi
at
the controls.
TRINITY sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock. It
looks like it sits on the rooftop of the world. All around her, as far
as the eye can see, lie mountains. Their snow-capped peaks are pink in
the sunset light.
She looks into the sunset. Heavy thoughts weigh on her mind.
A hand appears on her shoulder. Its NEO. How he got on the finger
of
rock is anyones guess.
NEO
"Boo."
TRINITY grins slightly and pulls on his arm. There is only enough room
for one on the end of the rock, so he sits down behind her.
TRINITY
"Dont lose your balance."
NEO
"It doesnt matter if I do."
TRINITY
"So, you can fly."
NEO
"Yes."
TRINITY
"Do you think I can?"
NEO
"I think you can do anything you want, if you believe."
TRINITY
"Like you?"
NEO
"I dont know. I dont know exactly what I can do."
TRINITY half turns.
TRINITY
"Will you teach me to fly?"
NEO
"I dont know if I can."
TRINITY
"Free your mind of doubt."
NEO stands, and steps in front of TRINITY. Hes on the very, very edge
of the rock.
He extends his
hand down to
her. She grabs
it, and he
hauls her up. Her eyes dart to the ground, thousands of feet below the
finger.
TRINITY
"In this construct program, the ground can kill."
NEO
"I wont let you fall. Ever."
THEY look
into each
others eyes.
Despite the
trauma theyve
been
through, and not even truly knowing one another, theres a connection.
NEO suddenly backs away. He walks on the air with perfect traction, as
though hes on an invisible plane of glass. He leaves TRINITY standing
precariously on
the edge,
wobbling a
bit as
she maintains
balance
against
nerves.
She
breathes
deep,
and
looks
back
up
at
NEO,
maintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle.
NEO stands a few
feet away from her,
completely at ease as
the high
altitude winds ruffle his hair.
NEO extends a hand to her.
NEO
"Its not real, Trinity. Youre not standing there. Step out. I can do
it. You can, too."
With one last
glance at the
infinite drop, she
steadies herself and
stares straight into his eyes. Blue meet brown. Breathless, she
steps
straight out.
She takes one step in the
air. For a breathless second, as
she steps
off the edge,
she is stable.
When she takes
her foot off
the edge,
though, she sways,
and her foot
slips, as though
shes on a
greasy
surface bobbing up and down. She corrects herself, tries another step,
sags further.
TRINITY
"Shit."
SHE glances down, then locks eyes with NEO. Then drops like an anvil.
NEO
"Whoops."
HE
dives down,
shooting like
a missile.
TRINITY is
calm, falling
backwards, watching NEO
come for her.
The rocky ground
looms behind
her. She makes no effort to reach for NEO as he draws close to her. HE
reaches for her with all his might.
NEO
"Grab me!"
TRINITY makes no effort to save herself, even as collision is
seconds
away. She stares at him intently.
NEO
"Grab on to me!"
SEEING she is doing
nothing, he goes beneath
her and scoops her
up,
Superman
style.
He
barely accomplishes
this
before
he slows
and
settles onto the rocky ground.
They are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains.
NEO
"What the hell were you doing?"
TRINITY smiles slightly. Her madness has a purpose.
TRINITY
"Showing you, Neo."
NEO
"Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart attack."
TRINITY
"I want you to know how much faith I have in you."
NEO
"Oh. And this requires acts of insanity?"
TRINITY smiles. She looks him up and down. She moves intimately close.
"So, you really are Superman."
NEO
"Only when Im plugged in."
TRINITY steps away. NEO grabs her shoulder and turns her to him. He
attempts a
kiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek.
NEO
"What?"
TRINITY looks at him, then up at the sky.
TRINITY
"Its not you. Just, not here."
NEO doesnt understand. TRINITY rolls her eyes.
TRINITY
"Theyre watching us, you big dope. Do you know how horny computer
geeks get?"
TRINITY grabs NEO by the arm.
TRINITY
"Over here."
SHE leads him into the shadows.
IN the blue twilight shade, NEO and TRINITY kiss tentatively,
slowly,
then quicker as
they give in
to their feelings
for one another.
WE
move around them slowly, then pan into the shadows, a natural fadeout.
FAR OFF
in the
distance, the
glow of
motorcycle headlights
racing
toward us. As we zoom out and focus in, they are already too close
to
avoid.
They
rip
by
us, thundering
explosions
and
men
and women
cheering.
THE pack of about ten bikers and their women dont wear helmets.
They
fly down the highway using both lanes, drinking and driving with total
abandon.
ANGLE ON the lead
motorcycle, a massive, custom-made
Harley. GREGORY
LOWFIELD, Thomas J. Anderson without
a desk job, without cares,
revs
his bike and locks
the accelerator. He hands
his beer to the
blonde
who rides behind him, then, in one swift motion, jumps up on his seat,
leaning into the slipstream.
The feat is IMPOSSIBLE.
HIS GIRLFRIEND,
CHANDRA, screams
at him
as she
grasps the seat and
lowers herself to the bike.
CHANDRA
"Greg, are you fucking crazy?"
GREG
"Yes. But dont worry."
She clings to
his legs as
they barrel down
the highway. They
blast
pass a darkened cruiser.
GREGORY is facing us as he
drops back into his seat, taking
his beer
on cue from CHANDRA. Behind them, the cops lights flare up.
GREGORY
"Oh boy. Stop, stop, lets have some fun."
THE cruiser comes to
a stop mere inches
from GREGORYS leg. The
COP
bursts out of the door.
COP
"What the hell are you doing?"
GREGORY
"Well tell you when to stop, little man. Not the other way around."
COP
"Fuck."
HE DIVES back into his cruiser, reaching for the radio. GREGORY
pulls
a huge silver .44 from his jacket and FIRES. The cruisers antenna
is
blown off at the
base, and the nine-foot
whip flips onto the
ground
with a metallic clang.
The cop comes out with his hands up.
COP
"Whaddya want with me?"
GREGORY
"I dont know. I just thought Id find out what you wanted without you
shooting at me. So, what do you want?"
THE COP is a tough one. Far taller than GREGORY, muscular and serious.
COP
"Youre all under arrest."
THE PACK explodes with laughter. GREGORY walks up to the policeman and
circles him, keeping the gun pointed in the business direction.
GREGORY
"This is your lucky day, officer. Were gonna give you a night off."
CHANDRA walks up to him. Seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard
liquour.
CHANDRA
"Drink."
WHEN
he
pauses,
GREGORY
places
the
gun
against
his
temple.
Reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol.
GREGORY lowers the gun. He and CHANDRA return to their motorcycle.
GREGORY
"You never even saw us, man."
CHANDRA
"Keep the bottle."
THEY start their bikes and are gone, like ghosts, into the shadows
of
the road.
CUT TO:
A CAMPFIRE blazes only a few
feet away from the high tide.
A billion
stars shine overhead as GREGORY and his biker gang, including the cop,
sit or
lie around
the fire.
A few
people are
still awake, and one
picks drunkenly at a guitar.
GREGORY stands,
throws a
blanket over
his shoulder,
and scoops
up
CHANDRA. They make their way into the dunes.
GREGORY
and
CHANDRA
lie
on
the
blanket,
staring
at
the
sky.
Inexplicably, GREGROY holds a hand toward the sky.
GREGORY
"Which one do you want?"
CHANDRA
"Any one. It doesnt matter."
WITH his hand pointed lazily at the sky, a single star starts
glowing
stronger
and stronger.
It vibrates,
then fades
suddenly and
comes
loose from the sky, and becomes a meteorite, burning across the sky.
CHANDRA draws closer to him, enraptured by his power.
CHANDRA
"How do you do it, Gregory?"
GREGORY
"I dont know. Sometimes it feels like... Im reaching beyond the
world."
HIS hand drops and his head turns. He sits up, startled by something.
CHANDRA
"What is it?"
GREGORY holds up a hand for her to be silent.
GREGORY
"They found us. Cant you hear it?"
CHANDRA
"What? I dont hear anything."
GREGORY
"We can only rebel so long. We can only push until they will hit
back."
CHANDRA
"They? The Men in Black?"
CU on GREGORY. In the distance, the faintest sound of a helicopter can
be heard, growing louder.
GREGORY
"Fuck! Get to the bikes."
GREGORY bursts over the hill, holding hands with CHANDRA as they
run.
Hes only had
time to through
on his boots
and boxers and
grab his
.44. Chandra is
dressed only in
her underwear and
Gregorys leather
jacket.
GREGORY
"Wake up! Get on your bikes and fucking ride!"
HIS gang burst to their feet. They scramble through the dunes, heading
for their bikes.
A HELICOPTER, seen only by its massively strong search lamp, and
the
wind from its
rotors blowing sand
everywhere, flies up
and over the
dunes, buzzing the running pack, blowing some off their feet.
GREGORY mounts his bike and CHANDRA jumps on back. WITH A WAVE OF
HIS
HAND, all
the bikes,
his included,
drop into
neutral and
rev into
start. Their
headlights blaze
as the
helicopter returns,
joined by
another.
CHOPPER LOUDSPEAKER
"THIS IS THE POLICE, STOP YOUR VEHICLES AND SURRENDER!"
SUDDENLY, automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters. A
bullet
trail stitches its way
across a pair of
bikers, sending them to
the
ground as the helicopters fly overhead.
GREGORY cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead.
THE pack splits
up in two
directions as the
distant choppers circle
back. GREGORY cuts the lights on
his bike and follows the highway
by
starlight.
GREGORY is pasted down to the
tank of his bike with CHANDRA
gripping
him for her life. The slipstream pulls his lips open and tears
streak
from his eyes as his bike redlines in fifth gear. The helicopters grow
smaller behind them. They break chase.
CHANDRA looks back and sees the lights turn away. She screams over the
wind and the roar.
CHANDRA
"Theyre gone!"
GREGORY is staring down a dark highway.
GREGORY
"Cant see shit."
HE turns the headlights
back on, just in
time to see a
ROADBLOCK of
heavy duty military trucks. In front
of the trucks is a sandbag
wall
manned by soldiers. The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if
one
looks closely enough, they
can see a pair
of AGENTS standing to
the
side.
THE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they
run
frantically to get
out of the
way of the
bike, 800 pounds
of metal
flying at 150 miles per hour.
GREGORY
plows
into the
sandbag
wall, directly
between
two parked
trucks. The wall parts in
an explosion of sand and
sandbags. THEYRE
THROUGH, but the bike scissors
uncontrollably, until it rolls and
we
drop into bullet-time.
AS the bike goes
over, we watch from
the side as GREGORY
dismounts,
grabbing CHANDRA as he
steps over onto the
safe side of the
bike. A
massive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a
bullet
falling
through syrup,
and
GREGORY keeps
walking
over the
rotating surface, using
the bike to
protect him and
CHANDRA against
the flesh-ripping concrete.
THE bike is coming apart
as its bashed against the
concrete. Pieces
rise slowly into the air -
the front wheel, the forks, the
mufflers,
and a million flakes
of metal, until the
body bounces into the
air,
carrying GREGORY
and CHANDRA
up. Holding
her to
him - shes barely
conscious of the lightning-fast
crash, GREGORY rides the
flying body
with one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into
real
time.
THE
bikes body
streaks along
the highway.
The sparks
fade as
it
slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them.
They
stop,
crouching
atop the
body,
with
GREGORY crouching
over
CHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them.
STUNNED,
not quite
understanding how
or what
he just
did, he
and
CHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND
them is a blurry wall of
red
and blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder.
THEY start running down the
highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA
to a
stop.
GREGORY
"Split up, into the desert, go!"
THEY split.
CU on CHANDRA. In bare feet, she sprints for the side of the road. The
highway is
littered with
pieces of
the bike,
and she
stomps on
a
twisted piece of metal
that impales her bare
foot. She falls to
the
asphalt with a scream.
GREGORY turns
and rushes
back to
her, even
as a
police cruiser is
bearing down on them, its V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD.
GREGORY drops
to her
side, only
to look
up into
the blinding high
beams. He
drops over
CHANDRA, ducks
his head
and extends
his hand
toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME.
THE CRUISER
runs into
his hand
and stops
as though
it hit a steel
post. The hood crumples
in the center, pushing
the grill in even
as
the front quarter
panels of the
unibody continue around
GREGORY and
CHANDRA.
THE CRUMPLED DOOR is knocked out
of the frame. WE SEE a
black loafer
step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps
out
slowly.
WE rise
up from
the loafer.
As the
other cruisers
catch up to the
scene of the accident, AGENT BROWN watches. He looks into the desert.
A POLICE lieutenant approaches BROWN.
LIEUTENANT
"Sir, should we pursue?"
AGENT BROWN
"Withdraw your men and pursue the others. We have our own plans for
this one."
FROM FAR AWAY, we see GREGORY and CHANDRA hiding under the only bit of
shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock. We sail in
and
cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto
CHANDRAS
feet, clad in Gregorys boots, up her sun-scorched and scratched legs.
Shes collapsed onto Gregory. Hes in equally bad shape. Gregory leans
with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he
drifts
in and out of sleep.
GREGORY POV
He
stars at
the horizon
and the
mirages of
water reflecting
the
jaundiced yellow sky. In the
shimmering distance, a man appears,
but
Gregorys lids
shut and
we see
darkness. When
he reopens them, the
figure is more clear. Its a man, dressed in a black suit. Even in the
distance we can recognize him. We want it to be him.
GREGORY
can
barely come
to
his senses
as
the figure
approaches.
CHANDRA doesnt even wake.
We follow the figure at waist heigh as it approaches GREGORY. It comes
to a stop just in front of him.
GREGORY is fully
awake, but he
thinks hes dreaming.
He reaches out
and pokes the black-clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him
- a man who doesnt sweat even in the sauna heat. He looks up, but the
glaring sun obscures the face.
GREGORYs voice is raspy as he starts to speak.
GREGORY
"Oh my God. Its... The Man."
MAN IN BLACK
"Ive been searching for you for a long time, my friend."
GREGORY lowers his head.
MAN IN BLACK
"We need you, Gregory."
GREGORY
"What for?"
MAN IN BLACK
"To save our world."
GREGORYS FACE
RAISES, THE
MAN IN
BLACK eclipses
the sun
with his
head, making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all-too familiar face:
AGENT SMITH.
GREGORYS head drops back down. He strokes CHANDRAS hair.
GREGORY
"Its too late. Were dead."
AGENT SMITH
"Do you want to live?"
GREGORY
"What for?"
AGENT SMITH
"A better life for all. Life for her. And for you, a chance for
revenge."
GREGORY raises his head.
AGENT SMITH grins. He turns away, and the desert landscape before them
turns into a soothing, cool,
crystal forest lake. Smith takes
a step
toward it, then turns and extends his hand.
AGENT SMITH
"Interested?"
GREGORY
is
mystified.
Speechless, he
drags
himself
to his
feet,
hoisting Chandra, and steps toward the lake.
GREGORY
"This cant be real."
HE steps forward, only to have the image recede.
AGENT SMITH
"You this, dont you?"
GREGORY
"Yes."
AGENT SMITH
"Will you help us?"
GREGORY
"Anything."
CU:
SMITH
extends his
hand.
GREGORY grasps
it.
He lets
go,
and
collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge.
THE
DESERT
is
gone,
replaced by
forest,
though
still
under the
poisoned sky of the Matrix.
GREGORY laps
the water
up, and
pulls CHANDRA
in, rubbing the water
over her face. Calmly, AGENT SMITH stands on the lake shore.
CU:
AGENT SMITH.
The humans
are reflected
in his
perfectly still
glasses.
CHANDRA
stirs and
awakens, though
she doesnt
seem to
see
SMITH.
GREGORY,
revitalized, looks
around at
the miracle,
and up
at the
mystery man.
GREGORY
"Who the fuck are you?"
SMITH grins devilishly.
AGENT SMITH
"Im nobody. A Smith. Whats more important, is you. We need you,
Gregory."
GREGORY stares. He pulls CHANDRA ashore and stands to look AGENT SMITH
in the eyes.
GREGORY
"First you try to kill me. Now you need me."
AGENT SMITH
"Two years ago, Gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist
attack in the heart of the city."
THE words spark something nasty in GREGORY.
GREGORY
"So what?"
AGENT SMITH
"The terrorists were led by a certain individual."
GREGORY
"I know who it was."
AGENT SMITH
"We need you to kill him."
GREGORY laughs he turns to CHANDRA
to check on her. Shes passed
out
on the smooth grass.
GREGORY
"What a bunch of bullshit. The whole government cant kill him, so how
can I?"
AGENT SMITH
"No one in the government can do what you can."
GREGORY
"Fuck you."
AGENT SMITH
"I believe we have a deal."
GREGORY stands and puts his face next to SMITHS
"You know, Ive always wanted to fuck the devil on a deal. And this
looks like a once-in-a lifetime opportunity. So, FUCK YOU!"
SMITH frowns. GREGORY looks him up and down. Hes got a few inches and
pounds on the smaller agent.
GREGORY
"What are you gonna do, little man? You looking for a trip to the
fucking hospital? Fuck with me and youll be looking for some plastic
surgery, you - "
SMITH delivers a
chest punch that
sends GREGORY sailing
back twenty
feet. He tumbles to a stop, coughs, and stares in disbelief at
SMITH,
standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away.
CU: SMITH. HE removes his glasses calmly.
CU: GREGORY. He was stunned, but hes
not out of the fight. Not by
a
long shot.
GREGORY
"No man can beat me."
SMITH
"Bring it on, pussy."
Pull back as he CHARGES SMITH
SMITH is ready to deflect the
blow, but GREGORY dodges and bowls
him
over, barroom style.
With SMITH pinned
below him, he
slams his palm
downward. SMITHS head dodges the blow that pummels the ground.
GREGORY is
screaming as
he smashes
downward with
the palms
of his
heels. Every blow misses the mark.
GREGORY
"Mother fucker, what the fu -?"
SMITH bucks up, throwing GREGORY into the air. He flips onto his
back
as GREGORY returns. The
sheer force of his
street-forged roundhouses
knock SMITH around
as he blocks.
Growing irritated at
the untrained
attack, SMITH turns a block into a palm-heel that hits GREGORY in
the
forehead with
the force
of a
cannon blast.
Momentarily stunned, he
steps back enough for SMITH to perform a roundhouse kick. Its like
a
helicopter blade, smashing into GREGORYS head and sending him to
the
ground in a heap.
SMITH
"Ready to change your mind?"
CU: GREGORY
HE cant
respond very
well. Blood
fills his
mouth and
his face is
mashed. A huge welt grows under
the loafer mark left by SMITH
on the
right side of his face.
SMITH crouches down by GREGORY
SMITH
"I can teach you to beat me, you know."
THIS interests GREGORY.
SMITH
"Help us, and both you and her will be free afterward."
GREGORY
stares
at the
ground,
then gazes
past
SMITH at
CHANDRA.
Finally, he starts to rise. SMITH offers a hand, and GREGORY takes it.
SMITH
"You know it, dont you? That theres more to your world than what you
can see, what you can rationally explain?"
GREGORY
"Yeah."
SMITH
"Im going to teach you how to use the powers you cant even imagine.
But first, you need to learn to fight."
SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece. GREGORYS eyes close and his body
SPASMS. He falls to the ground, breathless, and when his eyes open, he
stares up at SMITH.
GREGORY
"Holy shit. What the -"
HE stares at his hands. He sits up, and watches his hands, amazed,
as
he goes through a series of
block-punches. He stops and stares up
at
SMITH.
GREGORY
I know Kung-Fu."
SMITH grins.
THE five
of them
exit. They
blend into
the crowds
on the
street,
anonymous and
quiet. MORPHEUS
looks back
as NEO,
taller than most,
heads down the street.
NIOBE pauses next to him.
NIOBE
"What is it?"
MORPHEUS shakes his head.
MORPHEUS
"Whats going to happen? If this is it, right now? The end?"
NIOBE
"I cant even imagine."
HE grins
and starts
to turn.
As he
does, his
profile matches
the
profile on
a WANTED
poster stuck
to the
wall. Its
a dark, grainy
picture of him, alongside photos of Neo, and Trinity.
POSTER: INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS
MORPHEUS glances at it, and continues on.
NEO walks
calmly, observing
the people
that filter
by. Men, women,
children, all oblivious to their true nature.
A dirty homeless whino, nose
explosion red with burst blood
vessels,
is
staggering
along
the
edge of
the
crowd,
unseen
and ignored.
Somehow, he catches NEOs eye.
HOMELESS
"Spare a quarter, buddy?"
NEO shakes his head, but still stares.
ANGLE on
the HOMELESS.
He mutters
something, and
reaches into
his
shopping cart to
open a garbage
bag. Its filled
with twenty dollar
bills, thousands of them.
NEO
"How bout a quarter mil?"
THE homeless
man is
astounded. As
he stands,
speechless, NEO fades
back into the crowd.
SMITH and GREGORY fight in the glade. SMITH is always one step
ahead.
HE is a cruel
sensei, and doesnt pull
punches. But with every
blow
GREGORY takes, he rebounds and attacks again.
FINALLY, just as
he seems to
be gaining on
SMITH, he takes
a rapid
fire series
of blows,
and collapses
to the
ground, breathless
and
beaten.
GREGORY
"Fuck."
SMITH circles him.
SMITH
"Pain is only weakness leaving your body. When you are sufficiently
strong, you will feel no pain."
GREGORY
"Tell me about what is happening. Whats wrong with the world?"
SMITH
"Get up and fight."
GREGORY gets to his feet and takes a stance. SMITH stares at him
from
a relaxed poise. He slaps at GREGORY, who deflects the blow and
takes
a jab, nearly hitting SMITH on the chin. They circle.
SMITH
"The world is not for you."
HE slaps, has it deflected, dodges a blow.
GREGORY
"What do you mean?"
SMITH
"Youre not human, Gregory. Thats why you dont fit in. Thats why
you have certain powers."
GREGORY takes a swipe. They engage, then push off one another.
GREGORY
"What, am I from planet Krypton?"
SMITH
"Not quite. But as humans continue to evolve, some are developing
capabilities beyond those of the average man. Reality-altering
abilities. I have them. Others in the Agency have them. And you have
them, too. Were all that stands between law and order, and a
terrorist dictatorship lead by the one called Morpheus."
THEY stop fighting for a moment.
SMITH
"We need you to stop the terror. We need you to save our world."
IT sinks in. GREGORY is starting to believe.
SMITH
"We need you, because youre better than me. Now push past your
abilities. You can turn you imagination into reality. See your hands
striking me, see yourself overcoming me. Fight, boy!"
SMITH comes at him, and GREGORY responds. Their fists and kicks are
a
fast, then turn
into a blur.
GREGORY cant believe
his own actions.
SMITH misses
a block,
and GREGORY
blows him
backward with
a chest
punch.
SMITH, recovering, looks up. GREGORY looks around. CHANDRA is gone.
GREGORY
"Where is she?"
SMITH stands. From behind his back he produces a baseball sized
glass
ball. He tosses it to GREGORY.
SMITH
"Here."
GREGORY looks in the ball.
Its a window to an
apartment overlooking
the city. Chandra is in bed, waking up.
SMITH
"She doesnt remember our encounter. Shes fine. Dont worry."
THE BALL disappears.
SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece.
SMITH
"Ill be there. Execute the defense plan."
SMITH turns to GREGORY.
SMITH
"Come with me. But only watch. Youre not ready to engage in a fight
with the enemy."
GREGORY
"Why not?"
SMITH
"Because if you havent defeated me yet, you wont defeat them."
SMITH snaps his fingers.
GREGORY
finds
himself
alone
on
the
top
of
the
MAKARAO
hotel,
overlooking METACORTEX PLAZA.
The METACORTEX building stands across
the street. NEO has been
along
this road a thousand times, but in another lifetime.
NEO raises one hand, palm pointed toward the building.
CUT TO:
NEOS
POV:
The
building
is
a
massive
tower of
glowing
shimmering energy, no more real than a three-dimensional polygon.
MORPHEUS and NIOBE
stand atop a
building a few
blocks away, looking
toward the Metacortex building.
ANGLE on NEO
HE FIXES his gaze on the building, then lowers his head and closes his
eyes.
THE building tremors slightly, like
a heat mirage. Slowly, it
starts
moving downward.
ANGLE ON: the first
level. The exterior glass
disappears, vaporizing
in a million crystal shards that melt into the air, exposing the
hive
of office cubicles and corridors within.
The walls, desks and cubicles vaporize, leaving a few hundred
people
- office
workers, security,
maintenance men,
standing with
nothing
between them.
The massive LOAD BEARING MEMBERS vaporize.
CUT TO: the bottom of the building. One can look straight through
the
entire
building.
WE go
through
the empty
building,
passing dazed
people, until we pass out the other side, and come to NEO.
HE looks up. The office
building is supported by nothing.
Slowly, it
descends on the stunned people. They rush, screaming, some laughing in
hysteria, before the ceiling can come down on them. The last few
flee
just before
the ceiling
touches the
ground. The
second floor melts
away just like the first.
NIOBE and MORPHEUS
stare on in
amazement as the
building collapses,
floor by floor.
NIOBE
"Hes doing it."
MORPHEUS
"I knew it."
CHOI and
TRINITY look
up in
the air
at the
roof of the METACORTEX
building, standing beyond
a block of
buildings. It sinks
toward the
ground as a flood of people come screaming around the corner.
CHOI
"It cant be this easy."
TRINITY
"Its not over yet."
MANS VOICE (O.S.)
"Not by a long shot."
CU: TRINITYS FACE. SOMEONE plants the barrel of a silver Desert Eagle
.45 against her temple. TRINITY
whips her head backward as
it fires.
We drop into BULLET TIME as the flame and concussion blossoms in front
of her face, ripping her sunglasses off as she drops backward, pulling
a pair of MAC-10 Uzis from under her jacket.
THE MANS VOICE belongs to AGENT BROWN
CHOI turns,
pulling a
short weapon
from under
his coat. Its boxy,
with a short barrel the size of a soda can. He plants it in the
small
of BROWNS back and pulls the trigger.
A CONE
OF FIRE
burns straight
through brown,
blowing steam, flame,
smoke, vertebrae, and viscera out a massive hole in his stomach.
CU on the weapon. It recoils on tension coils, discharging a shell the
size of a 12-ounce soda can.
REAL TIME
What remains
of BROWN
flies forward.
CHOI helps
TRINITY up and the
retreat into the building and
take cover under a window.
Through the
window, we see military trucks, filled with troops, charging down
the
street, toward the Metacortex
plaza. After the trucks
come rumbling,
black-painted M1A2 ABRAMS tanks. A black APACHE HELICOPTER flies
over
the convoy.
CHOI looks through the window as he reloads his hand cannon.
CHOI
"Holy fucking shit."
TRINITY
"Weve stirred up the hornets nest now."
MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare from the rooftop.
The air rumbles as the building continues to gently collapse. The
sky
flashes, and massive streaks of
lighting blast across it like
cracks
in reality.
CU: SOLDIERS
They line their weapons on NEO. They are nervous
PRIVATE
"This is impossible. Whats going on?"
SERGEANT
"Just keep him in your sites, soldier."
CU: AGM-65 HELLFIRE GROUND-TO-AIR-MISSILE
The missile drops from its release claws and ignites, accelerating off
screen.
POV: HELLFIRE NOSE CAM
The missile flies
horizontally over the
plaza, then pitches
up, and
back down at NEO. He looks at it, and at the last second the nose goes
back up.
The missile swoops up over him, leaving him in its exhaust smoke.
POV: HELLFIRE NOSE CAM
THE missile banks,
panning across the
city, until it
locks onto the
helicopter from which it originated.
ITS BLOWN to
fiery pieces, and
comes tumbling down,
landing on the
street as soldiers and civilians flee.
WE drop into bullet time as a cone of fire - bigger than the tank
and
the shape of a
pine tree, blows out
of the barrel, pushing
the tank
back. From the fire streaks a
HEAT round, white hot, leaving a
laser
like tracer as it bears down on NEO.
REAL TIME
THE TRACER stops in front of NEO, and out of the air the HEAT round
appears. Suspended in air, it shakes with violence. It accelerates
backwards, flying straight back into the tank barrel.
The tanks explodes like a
60-ton hand grenade, plowing soldiers
onto
their faces, consuming the unlucky ones close to it, and throwing
the
30-ton turret straight up, 10 yards into the air. It rotates,
aflame,
and comes crashing down on a nearby commander and his radio man.
MORPHEUS answers his phone.
MORPHEUS
"Send through ghosts to confuse their lock."
RAZOR
"Got it."
THE mirrored glass of Smiths office wavers, then explodes towards us.
SMITH jumps, and we pan down to follow his descent. He smacks into the
pavement on his feet in front of NEO.
SMITH STANDS, facing NEO, about two fighting distances away.
NEOs
concentration is
broken. The
METACORTEX building
comes to
a
shuddering halt.
NEO
"Youre back."
CU: SMITH
He nods.
NEO
"And you have a ponytail now."
AS we concentrate
on NEO, and
he concentrates on
SMITH, we can
see
more black suits marching up behind him.
NEO attacks SMITH. SMITH backs away slowly, blocking against a
losing
battle and taking hits. Meanwhile,
the MEN IN BLACK converge
on NEO.
Just as NEO
lands a smashing
blow on SMITHS
chin, three voices
at
once shout:
"HEY!"
NEO turns,
and SMITH
pushes him
hard in
the opposite
direction to
face:
THREE SMITHS! They attack at once, one going low and hard with a
knee
breaking sweep kick, the other punching NEO in the face, and the third
breaking to the
side and putting
his toe into
NEOs stomach with
a
vicious side-kick.
They attack
is in
perfect synch,
eight arms
and eight legs working
like clockwork, striking
their target without
getting in the
way of
each other. The attack slams NEO back, right into the first,
bloodied
SMITH. NEO slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he
backed
into a
brick wall.
AGENT SMITH
grabs him
and holds
him in
a FULL
NELSON, exposing him
to his three
copies. The copies
shift position
and attack again. Two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with
their combined arms slam NEO in the face, then step apart as the third
comes in. The THIRD
grabs the shoulders of
the other two and
flips,
walking his loafers up NEOs
body, and kicking him from
below, right
up into
the chin
of his
jaw! It
snaps NEOs
back with
a spray of
blood.
MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare on as the fight rages.
MORPHEUS grips
the edge
of the
brick wall
edge. The stone crumbles
under the tension.
MORPHEUS
"We can only watch."
THE ASSAULT on NEO continues. He struggles, unable to concentrate long
enough to find a way to fight back.
A
BIRD flying
by NIOBE
and MORPHEUS
slows its
flight, slows
its
flapping, and freezes.
CU: MORPHEUS. A pink lightning
bolt freezes as it streaks
across the
sky, sealing the worlds light in an a light rouge.
Near the
plaza, panicked
civilians slow,
and fall
to the ground as
though theyre passing out.
MORPHEUS is on the phone
MORPHEUS
"What the hells going on?"
The passed-out people stand, and one by one, MORPH into AGENT
SMITHS.
It happens over, and over,
until dozens, then hundreds, are
marching
on the plaza.
NEO reaches back and puts his hands on either side of SMITHS head. As
hes
being pummeled
from the
front, he
squeezes and
screams. His
screams are mixed with SMITHS. The agents head deforms as were hear
a sickening
crack. Suddenly,
the body
reverts back
to that
of the
original owner, a security guard, and the head simply EXPLODES.
THE
hold broken,
NEO stumbles
back over
the body,
with the
three
SMITHS in pursuit. He somersaults, comes up on his feet, and jumps
to
the left, putting one Smith in front of the other two. He attacks, his
killing blows destroying SMITH, smashing through his blocks. He falls,
and NEO takes on the other two, giving a kick jump that knocks both of
them away in one shot.
As he comes
down, a wall
of Smiths converges
from all sides.
They
stop, leaving a circle around him.
WE PAN BACK to view a sea of black-suited SMITHS flooding the plaza.
CU: NEO
AS
his hand
passes over
his face,
it is
refreshed, anew,
perfect
again. He surveys the wall-to-wall SMITHS.
SMITH talks with his voice, times a thousand.
SMITH
"NEO, leave the Matrix. You know not what youre doing."
NEO
"Well, is that right?"
HE turns
to the
METACORTEX building.
Its repairing,
growing steel
girders and concrete skin.
NEOs face darkens.
NEO
"No!"
REALITY SHIMMERS as
his anger strikes
out at the
building. The tops
floors burn, and then explode.
The explosion rips down the
building,
slowing, slowing, then stopping.
THOUSANDS of SMITHS
are gazing up
at the building,
concentrating on
combating NEOs attack.
GREGORY sees the building exploding,
and runs. He smashes through
an
access door.
THE building is frozen, mid-explosion.
TONS of pieces hanging in
the
air, suspended only by frozen tendrils
of fire and arms of smoke
and
debris.
THE SMITHS attack NEO. They fight
in a massive melee, dying in
mass.
Meanwhile, the METACORTEX building pulls back together, the damage and
flame disappearing as time/space around it is reversed.
CUT TO:
CU: AGENT BROWN
With
his hand
on his
ear piece,
he comes
out the
elevator door,
slowly. Pistol drawn, he looks around the corner.
MORPHEUS and NIOBE stand there, their backs to him.
Without hesitating, he advances on them, blasting away with impunity.
THE BODIES of MORPHEUS and
NIOBE are wracked by gunfire
and collapse
in a heap of bullet-ravaged flesh.
BROWN
walks
up
to the
corpses
and
kicks one
with
his
shoe. It
shimmers, and then disappears, followed by the other.
MORPHEUS looks
at the
phone and
redials. RAZOR
comes through,
his
voice digitized and distorted.
RAZOR
"Theyre cutting comes, get to the access point on Laxe - "
THE line goes dead.
MORPHEUS signals to NIOBE. They exit the roof as he dials TRINITY
HE exits into the street. The scene is one from HELL.
UNDER the neon
sky, fires are
frozen and smoke
columns hang in
the
air, still, like massive tree trunks.
The battle rages and surges,
a thousand SMITHS pouring onto
one NEO.
All around, nearly covering the ground, are corpses, destroyed
bodies
abandoned
by the
agent. Men
and women,
of all
ages and
designs,
smashed, decapitated and broken.
CU: NEO
THE SMITHS overwhelm him
with sheer numbers. NEO
is a blur, a
human
chainsaw now,
crushing or
smashing them
all, but
they crowd on all
sides. The bodies pile up as they fall, and NEO finds himself stepping
up the rubbery mass of corpses. A few more smashed SMITHS fall,
morph
back into their stolen forms, and NEO is KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD.
He cant take it. Choking, NEO struggles to free himself. SMITHS climb
up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously. NEO
stalls,
in shock, his eyes
locked with the lifeless
blue eyes of a
woman he
just killed. She looks amazingly like TRINITY.
Perhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences
of
this war, and his mind seizes as the Smiths pummel him.
NEO goes
berzerk! SCREAMING
and fighting,
he claws
his way out and
surges into the wall of agents. They throw him back, and he cant kill
them fast
enough. HE
leaps upward,
trying to
fly away,
but Smiths
cling on to him, and cling on to each other.
NEO struggles to
fly, and as
he does, hes
pulling a stalagtite
of
black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet.
CU: NEO
HIS face
is wide
with fear
and shock.
He cant
climb anymore, and
looks back down at the mountain
of agents hes pulling into the
air.
His face
clenches shut
as a
scream wells
from deep
within him. He
starts to glow, and we jump back to see:
A MASSIVE orange, spherical shock
wave blasts away from his
body. It
rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts
the
Smiths away, leaving him clean.
EVERYTHING slows down
as NEO, exhausted,
tumbles out of
the sky. On
his way down
through the neon
light, he passes
bodies flying upward
from the
concussion. NEO
hits the
ground, bounces,
and lies still,
sprawled,
as people
drop all
around him,
piling up,
like Satans
snowfall.
THE sky and Matrix are still
frozen. TRINITY and CHOI make their
way
along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. They pause
behind
a dumpster, and
just before looking
out, theres the
sound of metal
tapping metal, twice.
TRINITY looks in
the direction of
the sound. MORPHEUS
and NIOBE are
standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. TRINITY
AND
CHOI make their way to them.
TRINITY peeks
cautiously around
the edge.
On the
other side of the
street is a phone booth.
TRINITY
"Is it clear?"
MORPHEUS
"I smell an ambush."
NIOBE
"Me too. Too quiet."
CHOI grips his gun and grimaces.
CHOI
"Too quiet? The world is frozen. Ill go first."
NO one likes the idea.
REAL-TIME suddenly returns.
The lightning bolts
in the sky
suddenly
re-animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them
jump
out of their skulls. The sounds of the city suddenly flood back.
ON THE street, people stir to
their feet. Everyone is confused as
to
what happened.
ITS a sea of the dead. From its center, NEO emerges, soaked in blood,
gagging and
gasping for
breath. He
stumbles over
them. Shocked and
crazed, he glimpses the Metacortex building. Its in one piece
again,
unharmed.
He falls against
a smashed corporate
art sculpture. He
picks a cell
phone up from the ground and dials.
NEO
"Morpheus, pick up."
We hear nothing but static.
Disgusted, NEO throws the phone
away. He
falls against the sculpture and looks up. Coming around the corner
of
the building is a group of agents and soldiers.
NEO
sinks down,
staring at
his hands.
He catches
his breath
and
concentrates.
The
blood
disappears,
and he
dons
the
suit
of an
anonymous soldier in black. His face, too, seems to change.
HE stands and walks away. We only see his back.
THEY weigh their options. Finally, MORPHUES gives the nod to CHOI.
MORPHEUS
"Go."
CHOI checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat. There are
lots
of people on the streets now. Everyones in shock over what
happened,
and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city.
CHOI
"And remember, kids, when youre in a war, never volunteer yourself!"
HE walks out
onto the street,
eyeing the phone
booth and everything
else. A
gorgeous Asian
businesswoman stumbles
into him. Recognition
lights up her face and she stops him.
WOMAN
"Choi? Oh my God, I havent seen you for months."
CHOI keeps looking around, making his way to the booth.
"Oh yeah, sorry about that."
SHE turns angry.
"Sorry about that? What kind of an asshole are you?"
TRINITY is looking around the corner. She pulls back into the alley.
TRINITY
"Casanova just ran into an old flame."
WOMAN
"No. Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can come and go when you
please?"
CHOI is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as
she
is having a fit. Tears are welling in her enraged face.
"Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - "
Inexplicably, CHOI
hangs his
trench coat
on the
side of the booth.
Standing behind it, he reaches
around with his arm, keeping
the coat
between his body and the phone. The WOMAN doesnt even notice the
web
of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering
the
inside of the jacket.
WOMAN
" - youll tell me why you dont call, why you, you, what are you
doing?"
CHOI
"The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss
me for luck."
HE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.
CU: PHONE
His hand grabs the phone. We hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one
of the
numbers of
the keypad.
The number
tone rises
in pitch to a
crescendo. WE pull back and:
THE BOOTH EXPLODES. CHOI and the woman are bowled over by the flame.
They take
cover from
the blast
as people
all over
the street
are
knocked flat.
THE PHONE BOOTH is obliterated.
Miraculously, CHOI and the woman
are
still under the cover of
the jacket. THROWING the smoking
jacket off
them, CHOI screams in agony as
he grasps the smoldering stump of
his
right shoulder. The arm is history.
THE WOMAN looks on,
her eyes as wide
as dinner plates. Shaking,
she
falls back, still staring.
CHOI
"You werent lucky."
MORPHEUS, NIOBE, and TRINITY rush to him, picking him up on his
feet.
CHOI is
screaming and
laughing. Someone
grabs his
smoldering coat,
dragging it along. CHOI stares at the ex-flame as they cart him
away.
His eyes are crazy.
CHOI
"You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!"
AS they struggle down the street, CHOI starts to walk more on his own.
PEOPLE run from the scene, screaming.
CU - the four of them.
MORPHUES looks
at something
off-screen and
frowns. HE
pulls to the
left.
MORPHEUS
"This way."
TANKS and
TROOPS are
filling into
the street
ahead of them, coming
from around the corner.
THEY turn onto a different
street. This street, too, is
filling with
troops. Worse, its being lead by AGENT BROWN.
NIOBE
"Tanks, or agents?"
TRINITY
"Tanks."
CHOI
"Yeah, tanks a lot."
They break. CHOI stands on his own, and they run back onto the
street
with the tanks.
CU: TANKS
THREE ABRAMS stop in the
street. Their turrets swing into
place with
terrifying quickness and precision.
AT ONCE,
they open
fire with
their main
cannons and machines guns.
FIRE FLOWERS blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of
lead
down the street.
Troops filed between
the tanks pull
their triggers
and dont let go. Everything in the street is shredded and blown away,
as though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose.
WITH UNEARTHLY
SPEED, EVERYONE
BREAKS for
the sides
of the street,
except for CHOI. He stands amid
it all as the tracers come
closer to
his body. He raises his machine
gun with his good arm, and
lays into
the enemy.
TRACER rounds kick away from
his gun, ripping straight back
into the
wall
of soldiers.
His rounds
deflect off
the sloped
armor of
the
tanks, recoils pile into the flesh
of troops. He rakes his fire
into
the enemy bodies.
CU: CHOI
TRACERS zoom in on
him. A tank round
blasts by, and the
wall of air
kicks him to his side. He continues to fire even as a bullet, followed
by
another, blasts
through the
middle of
his body.
More and
more
bullets smack into
him, blasting chunks
of meat and
viscera out the
back.
TRINITY and NIOBE
take one side
of the street,
running and shooting
simultaneously. THEY reach
the buildings on
the side and
NIOBE goes
STRAIGHT UP THE FAADE OF THE BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover to
cover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets.
ON
THE
OTHER side
of
the street,
MORPHEUS
goes straight
up
the
building
faade
and
starts
running
sideways,
completely
defying
gravity, firing downward at the soldiers.
CU: CHOI
HE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his
body
apart piece by piece. Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck,
and
torso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving his
machine gun, barrel
smoking, spinning in
the air, firing
still. The
arm is still attached and finger
clenching on the trigger. It is
the
last piece of CHOI to fall.
MORPHEUS climbs
as he
runs. In
mid-stride he
changes magazines and
stops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground.
On the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing
at
the mass of troops with two
guns that never cease. THERE is
no cover
and
no reprieve
from the
DOUBLE DEATH
from above.
Most are
still
firing down the street, or over toward TRINITY.
TRINITY runs
up the
side of
the street.
Her guns
go empty and she
dives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her.
CU: SOLDIER
In slow motion, he
pulls a spoon from
a grenade. Somehow, the
metal
ring reaches TRINITYS ears.
CU: TRINITY
She slaps a magazine into her
pistol, pulls the action and comes
out
from under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade.
She fires, hitting the grenade. IT explodes directly over the group of
soldiers, flattening them to the ground.
A
BULLET smacks
through TRINITYS
wrist, and
the hand
comes off,
popping like the head off
a dandelion. Blood spurts from
the severed
arteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip.
ABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND
NIOBE leap for one another.
They catch
each others arms, fifty feet
above the surviving enemy, and
spin in
place, firing away. The tank commanders in their copulas blast
upward
with their
machine guns,
but the
rounds miss
the spinning
couple.
MORPHUES and NIOBE concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down.
THEY land amidst
the carnage. TRINITY
emerges, shaken, pressing
her
coat to her arm.
The other end of the street fills with soldiers, and AGENT BROWN.
CU: AGENT BROWN
HE surveys the
scene, and immediately
draws and fires,
running full
bore for the rebels.
MORPHEUS, Niobe and TRINITY are too close to the tanks to be fired on,
but the nearest one lunges at them. They climb up over concrete stoops
and over
the side
of the
tank. They
sprint down
the street as the
tanks turn their turrets behind them, searching.
MORPHEUS
"The garage, hurry!"
THEY dive behind a corner as
a tank fires. Morpheus throws the
woman
forward as the tank round hits
the edge of the building, blowing
the
concrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder. Perhaps a
ton
of rubble falls on Morpheus legs. He drags himself forward. Niobe and
Trinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble. Niobe shoots the
lock off a steel door, and they pile into the building.
AGENT BROWN
and his
men rush
into position
around the building the
rebels are hiding in.
Suddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine
starts, and as we stare
at
the
garage door,
it explodes
outward. A
jet-black, hyped
COUNTACH
explodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw up
smoke. It cuts through a few
soldiers, hitting them in the knees,
as
it rips up the street, the throttle going way too high.
Soldiers pick themselves up
just in time to
hear another engine -
a
super powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen.
A wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the
rear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel. There isnt
even time to take a shot until shes gone.
NIOBEs bike sizzles down the highway, insanely lane splitting at over
100 miles
per hour.
The wheely
bar is
folded up
against the
rear
wheel. A dual
stream of vehicles
spit by her
like giant machine-gun
bullets. She zooms out of view.
GREGORY slows from a run. He looks back as police cars and
ambulances
race toward
the Metacortex
building. He
cant shake
what hes just
witnessed. He looks forward, only to run into:
AGENT SMITH
GREGORY freezes, then bursts into questions.
GREGORY
"What the fuck just happened?"
SMITH
"We need you, Gregory. Will you help us stop this?"
GREGORY is perplexed. Resolve comes over his face.
GREGORY
"I can stop this?"
SMITH
"Yes."
GREGORY
"Alright. But how can I fight him?"
SMITH
"I will give you the power you need."
NEO and GREGORY SMASH through the roof, flying upward, like a missile,
past us.
CU: NEO
HIS FACE is contorted in rage as he rockets upward. GREGORY is
barely
conscious. Seeing this, NEO stops, and flings Gregorys body violently
earthward.
NEO looks down as
the body falls toward
the city, thousands of
feet
below. He turns away,
just as the distant
GREGORY is falling out
of
sight. Just before he does, the speck of a person PULLS up, and
grows
larger and larger as
it returns. A contrail
streaks behind him as
a
rips through
the air.
FISTS FORWARD,
GREGORY is
like an MX missile
bearing on NEO.
NEO turns just in
time to catch BOTH
FISTS in his chest.
Like a cue
ball striking another billiard,
all Gregors momentum is
transferred
into Neo. Gregor stops dead in the air as Neo is hurtled out of view.
CU: GREGOR
HE is in
shock somehow as
he sees NEO
flying away. He
clenches his
fists and flexes his body, then looks down.
WE see the ground, thousands of feet below.
GREGORY
"Holy shit!"
FOR some
reason, he
starts to
fall. Even
as he
claws to
maintain
altitude, his
rational mind
has caught
up with
him and
is somehow
denying the fact that he can fly.
As hes
facing the
ground, NEO
slams into
him from above. Gripping
Gregor by the neck and his
belt, he drives straight down. The
ground
rushes, it takes
one second to
drop past a
50-story skyscraper. Neo
slams
Gregor,
front first,
into
the concrete
sidewalk.
They bust
through the sidewalk, into the sewer below.
THE Countach and bike
zip down a long,
perfectly flat empty road.
A
brown sunset plagues the horizon. There is no civilization in sight.
THE Countach skids
to a stop,
kicking up a
massive dust cloud
that
hides the
car. We
hear the
door slide,
and the
massive black-clad
figure of MORPHEUS emerges from the dust.
An Uzi in each hand, pointed at US.
THE COP behind the wheel is too slow to draw, call for backup, or even
duck for cover. The safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips
through
it, chewing the cop to pieces. His body thrashes in the seat.
MORPHEUS turns away. NIOBE pulls up on her bike and gets off,
slowly,
obviously the ride had been
a long one. Trinity joins
them. Morpheus
stops.
MORPHEUS
"I thought Razor said their were two cops."
THEY smell somethings wrong. They
move, back to back in
a triangle,
for the
phone booth,
weapons draw
and looking
in all
direction at
once.
MORPHEUS
"Niobe, you first."
TRINITY
"Bullshit, its my turn."
NIOBE
"Junior ranks leave first."
TRINITY enters the booth as the phone starts ringing.
Its the moment Smith was waiting for.
HE BURSTS
out of
the door,
gun firing
at the
booth. Inside, glass
shatters, and blood sprays as
Trinity is riddled with bullets.
Smith
doesnt stop. He sprays for an eternity, even firing as she collapses,
phone still ringing. Her body slumps, smearing blood against the booth
door as it shuts from her weight.
MORPHEUS and NIOBE open fire. Smith shudders, flickers violently, his
body moving too fast to follow as the two rebels empty their clips at
him. The actions of the guns stop in the open position, barrels and
empty chambers smoking, as the last empty shells patter to the ground.
MORPHEUS throws the guns down and turns to Niobe.
MORPHEUS
"Get her out."
NIOBE dives for
the shattered booth,
kicking away the
starred glass
and
answering
the
ringing
phone.
She
pulls
it
down,
and hauls
Trinitys destroyed body up, placing the phone to her ear.
TRINITYS head merely sags lifelessly to one side.
NIOBE
"Come on! Go through, Trinity! God damnit dont give up!"
TRINITYS
eyes
flicker.
She
focuses
on
Niobe,
summoning
her
consciousness enough to make the
phase back into the real
world. She
starts to fade as we cut to:
MORPHEUS charges SMITH.
Smith ignores reloads
him, and sights
in on
the exposed back of Niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone
back
on the
hook. As
the sights
rest right
between her shoulder blades,
Morpheus grabs his gun with both hands. He squeezes off one shot,
the
action freeze
back on
an empty
chamber, before
Morpheus throws his
hands up in the air
The shot ricochets clips Niobes ear and ricochets off the booth.
She
hangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear. The phone
rings.
She looks at it, then back at Morpheus and Smith, raising dust as they
fight.
She leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight.
Morpheus and
Smith clash
in the
dust -
punches, kicks,
and blocks
coming too
fast to
see. Smith
is wailing
on Morpheus, but Morpheus
sneaks in a
kick that separates
them. They take
stances a good
two
distances away. Theyre about to go at it again when:
NIOBE sprints
into the
fight. Performing
a flying
leap kick, Smith
grabs her
and swings
her down,
crashing her
body into the concrete
with a sickening crack-thud. She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheus
flies
back into
action, catching
the agent
with a
furious ass
of
swinging kicks.
Niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love. Together they
assault
the agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will
capped
by the limits of their Matrix-bending powers. Finally, Smith resurges.
He
lands
a punch
into
Niobes stomach,
and
her body
folds
over
unnaturally, as if her back is broken. She crumples to the deck, blood
pouring from her mouth.
MORPHEUS screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of
Smiths
neck,
smashing
the
agents
face
down
and
imprinting
it
in the
concrete. For a
moment, Smith is
still. Morpheus collects
Niobe and
runs for the phone booth, which is still ringing.
ITS too far. Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him
forward.
Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him
and
starts smashing his fists down into Morpheus face.
SMITH
"I should have killed you the first chance I had."
Like an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one final
blow. But
instead of
striking, his
eyes catch
something. He
flips
back, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split second
too
slow to
cut the
agents head
off. Instead,
it slices
cleanly
through the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat.
RAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps
over
Morpheus as
he pursues
the agent.
Smith rolls
backwards, gains his
footing, and retreats from the
swirling blades of death. He
turns to
Morpheus:
RAZOR
"Go!"
HALF-DEAD MORPHEUS drags NIOBE to the booth.
Behind them, Agent Smith backs away from RAZORS dual blades, on long,
one short. Whenever Razor attacks,
Smith backs away. They circle
one
another.
MORPHEUS puts Niobe through the phone.
RAZOR forces Smith around.
RAZOR
"Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor."
SMITH frowns
and moves
forward, but
the whistling
edge of
a blade
makes him
think twice.
RAZOR holds
the short
sword parallel to the
ground, the long sword straight up. He hides his eyes behind the short
sword.
SMITHs back is against the sunset. The sun drops below a cloud.
RAZOR flashes
the light
off his
short blade,
directly into Smiths
eyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword.
SMITH, blinded, turns and backs away. RAZOR attacks.
IN the
booth, Niobe
is gone.
MORPHEUS hangs
up the
phone. He
can
barely stand up enough to reach the handset. When it rings he picks it
up. But he doesnt disappear.
MORPHEUS
"Reload me."
MORPHEUS disappears for a second, then reappears. Now he is
perfectly
clean, and immaculately dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and
kicks
through
the remains
of the
booth, walking
toward the
fight as
he
produces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat.
RAZOR keeps
swinging at
SMITH -
and missing.
Seeing his chance, he
runs back for the ringing
phone. SMITH pursues, almost on
RAZOR when
the neo-samurai jumps in the
air and pirouhettes, swinging one
sword
after another, like a helicopter blade from Hell.
IN the liquid
world of slo-mo,
the short sword
cuts through Smiths
outstretched fingers, sending them
flying. The long sword
grazes his
forearm, cutting through the fabric
and taking off a slice
of flesh.
The tip of
the sword slices
through his suit,
cutting his tie
off,
digging about an inch into his torso.
SMITH collapses into the dust, his
face a mask of blood and
dust. He
doesnt try to get up.
RAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth.
Razor
goes
through first.
MORPHEUS keeps
his eyes
and weapon
locked on
SMITH, who
makes no
attempt to
pursue. He
stands calmly,
and in a
dignified manner, wipes dust off
his clothing as he watches
Morpheus
step into the booth, and replace the phone.
It rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith.
SMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses,
taking
advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy.
SMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first
anger,
then
perhaps
sadness.
Hes lost.
Hell
be
in
the Matrix
forever.
With a quicksilver flash,
his body reverts back
to the shape of
the
rookie cop.
THE young
man is
left standing
there. He
is filthy,
bloody, badly
sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at
the carnage
as his
mouth simply
opens and
closes, reflexively,
in
shock. He focuses on Morpheus.
The rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his
body
broken and his mind blown.
NEOS relief fades into confusion.
NEO
"I know. Im sorry."
MORPHEUS (O.S.)
"And the problem is..."
NEO
"Uh, its impossible. If the Matrix is destroyed, the people within
the system will die. They will all die. There has to be a different
way."
MORPHEUS doesnt respond.
NEO
"Morpheus? Did you know this?"
We
hear
nothing. NEO
can
hear his
own
heart beating.
Anger
and
confusion add to the already heavy mental burden he carries.
MORPHEUS (O.S.)
"I didnt say things would be easy, Neo."
NEO sinks to the ground, shocked. He shakes his head.
NEO
"No."
NEO cant stand the reality of the situation. Hes coming apart.
NEO
"No, Morpheus, this cant be! We cant do this! We have to get the
people out."
MORPHEUS (O.S.)
"Even if we could somehow get to them without cutting through their
defenses, theres no way we can rehabilitate billions of people. They
wouldnt even want to be woken up."
Neo is silent.
MORPHEUS (O.S.)
"You can do it. You can free us."
NEO
"Why me? Why the fuck do I have to do this?"
MORPHEUS is silent for a long while.
Neo hears the line click dead. He cant believe what has happened.
Neo closes the cell
phone. He reaches to
tuck it away, then
pauses,
looking at it. He drops it to the ground and walks on.
He stands out on
a finger of crumbling
church, the night air
all
around him.
The
city
lights are
alive below.
He
focuses
on the
Metacortex building. Leaving
him there, we
rush to it
until we dive
into the dark
shadows
of the
very building,
going
microscopically
close, until the
darkness gives way
to the glowing
green miasma
of
quantum
code.
It
fills
the
screen
before
we
bust
through into
darkness again.
