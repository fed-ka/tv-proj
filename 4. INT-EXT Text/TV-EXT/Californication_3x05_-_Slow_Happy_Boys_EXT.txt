                                  ZLOZ
                    Is your father a lumberjack?  
                    Because whenever I look at you, I 
                    get serious wood in my pants.

      Vapid Chick walks off.  Hank hands him a beer.  They clink.

                    Nice job, Shecky Greene.

                    I don t know, Moody.  I could get 
                    used to this.  Fuck, I ve got some

                    I mean, what s stopping me from 
                    taking this city by storm?

                                  HANK
                    Me.  Just me.  I won t let you.

                    You trying to hold me back?  Keep

                    That out there -- that s a fucking

                    What the fuck do you know about 
                    back home?  You got out years ago.  
                    It s easy for you to spout some

                    You got it all wrong, man.

                    See that broad over there?

      Zloz nods out a CALIFORNIA GIRL over yonder.

                                  ZLOZ
                    I m gonna go talk to her.  Maybe 
                    she s warm for my form, maybe she s 
                    not.  I m no Marky Mark or nothing,

                    Zloz, I speak from experience when 
                    I say that some things are best 
                    left a fantasy.  Once you cross 
                    that line, it s hard to find your

                                    CHARLIE
                    She punched me.  My fault, of 
                    course.  I think I gave her some 
                    VD.

                                  HANK
                    Of course you did.

      They pile into the Porsche.  Charlie is forced to wedge

      Hank and Zloz play catch on the sand.

                    Fucking beautiful here, man.  Takes

                    How come you never made it to my

                                  HANK
                    Shit, I dunno.  I was pissed at 
                    you, I guess.  I didn t want to see 
                    you throw your life away.  We had a 
                    plan.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Yeah.  And I fucked it up.

                    We were gonna make it out of there.

                    Couldn t have been more wrong.  You 
                    did a beautiful thing, Zloz.  You 
                    stepped up.  Married that girl.  
                    Had a family.  Don t be a shithead.

      A moment.

                                  ZLOZ
                    I was really sorry to hear about

                    Yeah, me too.  Thanks for the

                    Did you hear Mr. Amato passed away 
                    last year?

                                  HANK
                    You re kidding me.  Guess it kinda 
                    proves his theory.  Maybe you 
                    really do die less than five miles 
                    from where you were born.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Yeah, they re dropping like flies

                    I get these nosebleeds.

                                  HANK
                      Nosebleeds?  What do you mean?

                    Never thought much of  em.  Thought 
                    maybe it was that big blow phase we 
                    went through in our twenties.  
                    Finally, Kim makes me go to the

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, well... I love ya, Zloz.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Love you, too, Moody.  Ya fuckin  
                    homo.

      Zloz smiles, picks up his bag and goes, disappearing into the 
      terminal.  Hank watches him go.  But there s little time for 
      reflection.

      All of a sudden, BECCA blows past him.  Climbs into the 
      backseat with her bag.  Hank sighs.

                                  HANK
                    Wow.  Not even a hello?  Good 
                    times.  Hey, what am I, your limo 
                    driver?  Get in the front --

      Hank is on his way to the driver s side when a familiar voice 
      stops him:   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 34.



                                  KAREN
                    What, you re just gonna leave 
                    without me...?

      Hank looks.  And there she is.  KAREN.  Bag in hand.  
      Smiling.  And yes, his heart skips a beat.  Or two.  Is she a 
      mirage?

                                  BECCA
                    Merry fucking Christmas.  Can we go 
                    home already?

      Without missing a beat:

                                  HANK & KAREN
                    Shut up.

      Hank moves to Karen.  Pulls her into his arms.  She smells 
      like home.  Life is good in the Golden State.



                                                                    OVER AND OUT.
