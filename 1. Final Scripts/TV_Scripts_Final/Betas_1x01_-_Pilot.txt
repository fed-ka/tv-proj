      INT. BARCADE - SILICON VALLEY - NIGHT

        A watering hole with a vintage video game theme-- ARCADE 
        cabinets, neon PAC MAN art, quarter-dispensing WAITRESSES.

      CLOSE ON: the baby-faced good looks of aspiring dot-com
        maverick BARRETT THORNHILLIII, 22. We ll call him TREY. His 
        blazer-tee outfit reads laid-back, but his manic energy and 
      rapid speech suggest a neurotic, brilliant mind at work.

      Trey stares at his LAPTOP, which contains a bunch of GRAPHS, 
        CHARTS and DATA, when A CUTE CO-ED bumps him slightly as she 
        jostles for a drink.

                                    CUTE CO-ED
                      Oh, sorry, I didn t mean to--

                                    TREY
                    No problem.

                                    CUTE CO-ED
                          (to the bartender)
                      Oyster Stout, please.

      Still staring at his computer--

                                    TREY
                        Interesting.

                                    CUTE CO-ED
                      Excuse me?

                                    TREY
                      It s just-- I wouldn t have pegged 
                      you as a beer drinker. If I m going 
                      strictly by appearances, that is. 
                      You don t present yourself as a 
                        prototypical-- I would ve thought 
                        Appletinisdown the street, not 
                      tech geekbeer bar. That s all.

                                    CUTE CO-ED
                            (trying hard to be nice)
                      Oh. I guess I just felt like a 
                      beer? Fruity cocktails don t sit 
                      well with me.

      Trey looks up at her. You can almost hear his gears turning.    1/28/20132.


                                    TREY
                      Did you know that girls who like 
                      the taste of beer are sixty percent 
                      more likely to have sex on the 
                      first date than girls who prefer, 
                      say, red wine. Or Appletinis.

                                    CUTE CO-ED
                      What?

                                    TREY
                      That s not my opinion.
                            (indicating screen)
                      I have the data right here.

                                    CUTE CO-ED
                      Hold on. You don t even know me--

                                    TREY
                      For guys, it s more clear cut-- a 
                      guy who can easily imagine 
                      murdering someone? Eighty-eight 
                      percent chance he ll have sex with 
                      you on the first date-- 

                                    CUTE CO-ED
                      You re disgusting.

      The Co-ed drops cash on the bar and storms off. Nearby are 
      two ALPHA MALES who have been listening. 

                                    ALPHA
                      Dude, that was epic. You some kind 
                    of anti-pussy wizard?

                                    TREY
                      I m an entrepreneur. Mobile apps. 
                      Working on something big.

                                    ALPHA
                      What, like how to repel hot chicks 
                    in five easy steps? Who d buy that?

      The Alphas bump fists--  Burn!  Trey doesn t miss a beat--

                                    TREY
                      I suppose you guys would.

                                    ALPHA TWO
                      What s that supposed to mean?    1/28/20133.


                                    TREY
                      Just that men who wear silver 
                      jewelry and put orange slices in 
                      their beers are more likely to act 
                    on homosexual impulses. It s not a 
                      hundred percent correlation of 
                      course...

      Alpha Two raises up on Trey, shoves him. Trey just points to 
      his screen, unflinching--

      POP! Alpha Two PUNCHES Trey in the face as we SMASH TO:

      INT. WEWORK OFFICES - DAY

        A COMMUNAL OFFICE SPACE for web startups, WeWorkfeatures an 
      OPEN FLOOR PLAN and hip furnishings. PROGRAMMERS and 
        DESIGNERS from various companies sit in clusters. COMPANY 
      NAMES are posted on whiteboard walls of the open  offices. 

      CLOSE ON: introvert tech genius, AVINASHDAGAVI, 22. Prickly. 
        Anxious. Odd. SWEAT on his lip. HEADPHONES on. A Steely Dan 
      tune pulses in his head as he codes away on a laptop. 

      But despite the tune s smooth vibe, and his hoodie-and-cargo-
        shortsensemble, Nash is anything but comfortable. He can t 
        concentrate. We get QUICK CUTS from his POV--

      -A FAT ENGINEER guzzles Cheetosstraight from the bag.

      -Two GEEKSshoot NERFGUNS at one another, LAUGHING.

        -Various hands CLACKING AWAY at KEYBOARDS, the sound GROWING 
        LOUDER AND LOUDER until it drowns out the MUSIC.

      One of the NERFWARRIORS bumps Nash s desk, knocking him from 
      his trance. He adjusts the position of his keyboard, aligning 
      it to an invisible grid in his mind, grabs his PHONE--

                                    NASH
                        Inconsiderate.    1/28/20134.


      INT. TREY S CAR - SAME TIME 

      Trey, face BRUISED from the night before, drives while 
        consulting his iPhone. ON THE PHONE: A PARKING APP entitled 
          SpaceRacereveals a MAP of the block. A BLINKING GREEN DOT 
        indicates an OPEN METER nearby, denoted by a CAR AVATAR. A 
      sexy British App voice announces:  Space Available. 

      Trey races to the spot and parallel parks, as the APP emits 
      its signature catchphrase:  Like a glllllove!  

      Trey sits for a moment, contemplating the App. He studies the 
        PARKING SPOTS around him, the TRAFFIC driving by, the 
        blinking AVATAR. Analyzing. Calculating. Then it hits him--

                                    TREY
                            (scoffs)
                    It won t work.

      His phone rings. Nash.

                      Thing s a joke. It s dangerous. Am 
                      I the only one who sees this?

        INTERCUT:TREY IN HIS CAR AND NASH IN WEWORK, ON PHONES.

      Nash isn t listening. He maneuvers through the crowded 
        office, desperate for some privacy, past a HALO TOURNAMENT, 
        through another company s STAFF MEETING...

                                    NASH
                      Can t do this anymore. Can t be 
                      productive here. Two weeks behind 
                      schedule and everywhere Cheetosand 
                      sweat stains and andand--
                            (ducking a Nerfball)
                      Assholes! 

      TREY gets out his car and enters the WEWORK OFFICE BUILDING.

                                    TREY
                      Nash? You re dropping your pronouns 
                      again. Try to breathe... 

      We can hear Nash ranting incoherently on Trey s phone--

                      Put on some of your smooth rock.  
                      Your Billy Joel or whatever.    1/28/20135.


                                    NASH
                      Billy Joel is shit! He does not 
                      soothe me. He is not the Little 
                      River Band. He is not Toto.

                                    TREY
                      I can t talk to you when you re 
                      like this. Put Hobbes on.

                                    NASH
                      Hobbes isn t here.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      THE AFOREMENTIONED HOBBES, 35. The team s cranky, mischievous 
      lead coder lazes in his undies, laptop perched on his pasty 
        stomach. With his unkempt beard and cynical edge, we get the 
        impression he s been around the block a time or two.

                                    HOBBES
                      Shit, that s hot. Are you wet? 

      ON HIS LAPTOP: Hobbes is VIDEO CHATTING with a SUICIDE GIRL.

                                    SUICIDE GIRL
                      Like an oil slick, baby. Wanna see?

      As the tattooed beauty starts to slip off her panties...

        whereHobbes is  cybering  in a crowded Fluff  n Fold. The 
      boy s MOTHER gestures to the DRYER he s sitting on--

                                    HISPANIC MOTHER (O.S.)
                      Excuse me, Mister, you finish?

                                    HOBBES
                      Finished? I m barely half mast!
                          (to her son)
                      Como se dice,  cock-block? 

      Just then-- HONK-HONK!-- a late model Civic pulls up outside. 
        Hobbes slams his laptop shut--


        OUTSIDE - IN THE CIVIC

        MITCHELL, 19, sits behind the wheel sipping an energy drink. 
        A sweet, nerdy junior coder with an innocent look and a rapid-
      fire, ADD-addled brain. He listens to GANGSTA RAP, vibing.    1/28/20136.


        Hobbes clambers into the passenger seat, carrying a still-
      damp pair of Dickies, a t-shirtand some tube socks.

                                    HOBBES
                      Swear to God, Mitch, this 
                        neighborhood s falling apart. 
                      Between the bums and the Illegals, 
                      I almost miss my ex.

                                    MITCHELL
                      Yeah, I was gonnasay, my 
                      roommate s mom does all our 
                      laundry. You ever want me to throw 
                    in a load or whatever, just say the 
                      word. G2G.

                                    HOBBES
                            (not gonnahappen)
                      Yeah, thanks. You got anymore of 
                      that Adderalllying around?

        Hobbes digs inside the glove box.

                                    MITCHELL
                      Just my, uh, prescription-- but I 
                      kind of need that to--

                                    HOBBES
                            (finding the pills)
                      Perfect. Fuckin exhausted. 

      He snatches Mitchell s energy drink and washes  em down.  
        Pockets a couple more. Mitchell chuckles nervously--

                                    MITCHELL
                      Okay, bottoms up! So hey, is Trey 
                      meeting with that investor dude 
                      tomorrow? 

                                    HOBBES
                      That s the word from on high. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    So like, this could mean like 
                      serious cash, right? 

                                    HOBBES
                      I d settle for grocery money. I eat 
                      any more ramen I m gonnastart 
                      sweating MSG.
                            (beat)
                      Hey, you got a picture of your 
                      roomie s mom?    1/28/20137.


      INT. WEWORK OFFICES - MORNING

      Trey enters the communal office and spots Nash hiding out in 
      one of the small glass  privacy booths  used for phone and 
      video conferences. Trey shakes his head. Not good.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      TREY AND NASH -- crammed into the SAME BOOTH, awkwardly close 
      to one another. Nash can t make eye contact-- the violation 
      of his personal space is too upsetting.

                                    TREY
                      Nash. Talk to me.

      Nash swallows, shifts awkwardly.

                                    NASH
                        Uncomfortable.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      TREY AND NASH. Now standing in adjacent booths, speaking 
        through the glass partition on their phones. Like inmates.

                                    NASH (CONT D)
                      Cancel the meeting.

                                    TREY
                      You don t cancel on George 
                      Murchison. He s one of the most 
                      sought after angels in the valley. 
                    If he invests in BRB, we re all but 
                      guaranteed our Series A. No more 
                        bootstrapping. No more communal 
                      office. No more Nash freakouts.

                                    NASH
                      It s not ready. I ran the beta last

      INT. WEWORK OFFICES - LOBBY - SAME

        Mitchell and Hobbes clamber into an ELEVATOR packed with TECH 
        GEEKSand HIPSTERS from other companies. All of them, 
        texting, surfing, gaming, etc. Among them:

        MIKKI, 21, an Asian-American coder whose style is a mash-up 
      of Hello Kitty and Enid from Ghost World. And--

      DANE, 24, a rail-thin graphic designer with sculpted facial 
      hair, piercingsand expensive glasses. Geekchic.

        Mitchell stares longingly at Mikki as she and Dane BUMP 
        PHONES, exchanging info with an app called BUMP-N-GRIND.

      DING! The elevator doors slide open, Hipsters and Geeks
        spilling out, hustling to their work areas. Mitchell

        ANGLE: THE PRIVACY BOOTHS -- where Trey and Nash continue to 
        squabble. Trey is losing patience.

                                    TREY
                      I m trying to be sympathetic to

                      That was different.

                      I need you to take care of the 
                      tech. Can you can do that for me?

      Trey places his fist on the glass between them for a fist 
      bump. But Nash refuses, storms out of the booth-- furious.

      Trey exits his booth. He approaches Mitchell and Hobbes. The 
      boys look at him expectantly--

      INT.  BARCADE  - LATER THAT EVENING

      The Betas Gang is gathered at a booth, working on their 
        laptops, beneath a CHALKBOARD full of EQUATIONS and 
        ILLUSTRATIONS. In giant underlined letters: The Social 
        Matrix. Trey is having one of his insight-whirlwinds, talking 
        a mile a minute, gesticulating with a piece of chalk--

                                    TREY
                      People in Western culture think in 
                      one of three ways-- visual, 
                      auditory or kinesthetic. So I m 
                      listening for clues as I talk to 
                      her. She tells me she feltlike a 
                      beer, that cocktails don t sit
                      well. I offended her and she told 
                    me to holdon.

      He circles KINESTHETIC on the board, next to a drawing of a 
        HEART. A COCKTAIL WAITRESS approaches, irked--

                                    COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                      Hey, did you erase our beer menu?

        REVEAL that the CHALKBOARD is just that. On the far right 
      side, half-erased names: -VEIZEN, -ORTER, -LE ALE, etc.

                                    TREY
                      This is important.

                      I need to be a whole lot drunker.

      Just then, a GROUP of BOISTEROUS ASIANS tumble into the bar 
        wearing matching YELLOW POLOS. They re red-faced drunk.

                      That should be us, celebrating our

                      lapped by a pack of pudgy Koreans.

      Nash doesn t want to engage, but it s true. Trey digs in--

                      Going home to work on the code.

      INT. BARCADE - LATER

      Trey, Hobbes and Mitchell. Hobbes and Mitchell are staring at 
      their phones. Actually, most of the people in the bar are on 
      their phones. Trey can t take it--

                                    TREY
                      See, this, this is what I m talking 
                      about. We re surrounded by people, 
                      all desperate to interact, and 
                      everyone s staring at screens, 
                      pretending not to notice.

                                    MITCHELL
                      Dude, have you played Fruit

                      Besides, this place is a dog park.

      Trey points to a buttoned-up WOMAN in a TAILORED SUIT at the 
      end of the bar. A pair of HEELS rests on the bar stool next 
      to her. This is LISA RUDOLPH, 24.

                                    TREY
                      Really? What do you call that?

      Lisa offers a pinched smile and returns the shoes to the 
        stool, rebuffing him. Continues typing on her phone.

                                    LISA
                      It s pronounced Loo-boo-ta.

                      I know. I was just testing you.

                      stranger s pronunciation. I m 
                      guessing you spend a lot of time 
                      evaluating people. Are you in H.R.?

                                    LISA
                      No, but I ambusy. No offense.

                      Sure. Forgive me for trying to 
                      start a conversation in a popular 
                      social venue.

      That pissesLisa off. She looks up from her phone--

                                    LISA
                      Actually, I m working. But thanks 
                      for the shot of judgment and the 
                        condescension chaser. I thought 
                      putting my shoes on the stool would 
                    be a pretty clear sign I m not 
                      looking to get hit on by every 
                      Aspiein the joint, but that s the 
                      thing about you guys-- you re not 
                      exactly aces when it comes to 
                      reading people.

      Lisa slips her heels on and departs, Trey moves back to 
        Hobbes and Mitchell, who have a laugh at his expense--    1/28/201314.


                                    TREY

      EXT. BARCADE - LATER

        A hip-hop themedTaco Truck ( Tacos, Nah mean! ) is parked at

      the thuggish PROPRIETOR of the truck, while--

        Mitchell and Hobbes sit on the sidewalk, eating tacos and 
        drinking sodas. Hobbes spots Mikki and Dane standing in line.

                                    HOBBES
                      Look sharp. Your future ex is here.

                                    MITCHELL
                        What reyou-- Oh God. No, wait--

      But Hobbes is already making his way over to Mikki and Dane. 
        Mitchell reluctantly follows.

                                    HOBBES
                          (to Dane)
                      What s crackin , Chin Curtains?

                                    DANE
                      I was just telling Mikki that I m 
                      spinning at The Cellar on Friday. 
                      You guys should come check out my 
                      set.

                                    HOBBES
                      Yeah, I will neverbe drunk enough 
                      for that. Mikki. A pleasure. I m 
                      Hobbes. And this-- is Mitchell. Boy 
                      genius and turntable prodigy.

                                    MITCHELL
                      Hi, hey, hello. It s nice to uh, 
                      finally... I ve been watching you 
                      across the office for like, weeks. 
                      I mean, not-- notin a creepy way.

        Cringe. Mikki offers a half-smirk in response.

                                    DANE
                      What kind of stuff do you spin?

                                    MITCHELL
                      Oh... all... kinds of stuff.
                            (Dane waits, curious)
                      You know, mad crazy beats, like--
                                    (MORE)    1/28/201315.

                                      MITCHELL(CONT'D)
                            (beat-boxing)
                      And the--
                            (scary dubstepnoises)

        A bizarre performance. But before Mitchell can dig himself 
        deeper, Hobbes  trips  and SPILLS his drink on Dane s shirt.

                                    HOBBES
                      Oh, shit! Sorry, man. We better get 
                      you to a sink.

                                    DANE
                      Careful! This shirt s hand-painted.

        Hobbes leads Dane away, shooting Mitchell a look--  Make your 
        move!  Mikki stares at him, bemused. When she finally speaks, 
      her tone is completely deadpan. This is just how she rolls.

                                    MIKKI
                      Nice beat-boxing. Are you 
                      classically trained?

                                    MITCHELL
                      Ha!  Classically trained.  LOL. 
                      Totally. That s-- wow.

        Another awkward beat.

                                    MIKKI
                    Do I make you nervous, Mitchell?


      INT. BARCADE BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Trey enters, bumping into Dane as he leaves. As he unzips at 
        a urinal... REVEAL Hobbes behind him, drunk.

                                    HOBBES
                      Hola, jefe. Que paso?

      He sidles up next to Trey, uncomfortably close.

                                    TREY
                      Common men s room decorum calls for 
                      a two foot gap between users.

                                    HOBBES
                    So about this meeting tomorrow. 
                      We re good, right? You feel ready?

      Trey just looks at him like,  Of course.     1/28/201316.


                                    HOBBES (CONT D)
                       Cause I m thirty-five years old, 
                      man. That s like, ninety-five in 
                      Valley years. I can t take another 
                      failed start-up.

                                    TREY
                      We re not gonnafail.

                                    HOBBES
                       Cause I think you might be onto 
                      something here, but if BRBtanks 
                      they re gonnaOld Yeller my ass. 
                      Just-- look me in the eye and tell 
                    me you got this.

      Trey turns to Hobbes as he zips up, looks him in the eye--

                                    TREY
                      Hobbes. I got this.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


      INT. TREY S CAR - THE NEXT AFTERNOON

        Smooth rock plays as Trey drives. In the passenger seat, Nash 
        SCRATCHES at the woefully unfashionable JEANS he s wearing.

                                    NASH
                      I feel like my legs are 
                        suffocating.

      The car approaches a modern mansion, a GLORIOUS GLASS 
        STRUCTURE perched on WolfbackRidge Road. We see the 
        unmistakable trappings of an exclusive PARTY in progress. 
        VALETS help guests from FANCY CARS, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE drink 
      and laugh on the expansive deck.

                                    NASH (CONT D)
                      What is this?  What s going on?

                                    TREY
                      Looks like The Murch is having a 
                      few people over.

                                    NASH
                      You told me we were going to a 
                      meeting. This is-- this is why you 
                      made me wear pants! You liedto me.    1/28/201317.


                                    TREY
                      No, I managed expectations. If I 
                      told you we were going to a party, 
                      you d be in the fetal position 
                      humming Hall and Oatesright now. 
                      Now stay close and don t say 
                      anything.

                                    NASH
                      What? Why?

        A VALET opens Trey s door, ending the debate.


      EXT. MODERN MANSION - AFTERNOON

        A BORED ATTENDANT waits with an iPad, checking a GUEST LIST.

                                    TREY
                            (nervous, speedy)
                      Hey there. Larry Page and 
                        ShamitRamdi. We should be on the--

                      Have a great time.

      Trey smirks to himself, pushes Nash ahead of him into...


      INT. THE MURCH S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

        A MASSIVE FOYER. Where POWER PLAYERS and WELL-TO-DO GUESTS 
        network and mingle.

                                    NASH
                      What was that? We weren t invited?!

      They continue into...


      INT. MURCH S MODERN MANSION - LIVING ROOM  - CONTINUOUS

        Massive. Sleek. Stylish. GUESTS mingle amidst the Far East-
        meets-future decor while a BAND of shaggy, middle-aged 
        MUSICIANS rock out on a STAGE at the far end of the room.

                                    NASH
                            (freaking out)
                    We can t-- We don t belong here.    1/28/201318.


      Nash starts scratching at his legs and HUMMING. Trey grabs 
      his shoulders--

                                    TREY
                      Nash, I need you to listen to me.  
                      It s gonnabe fine. We just need to 
                      find the Murch, get five minutes 
                      alone with him, and do our thing. 
                      Can you breathe for me? Big in 
                      through the nose...

      Nash stops scratching and humming. Inhales. Exhales.

                                    TREY (CONT D)
                      Okay. Follow me.

      They move through the crowd, Trey pointing out the players--

                                    TREY (CONT D)
                            (re: a well-dressed geek)
                      Chris McLaren. Designed the Mad Cow 
                      games. Escapist bullshit, but his 
                      company s valued at $600 million. 
                      We ll do better.
                            (re: a regal 60-year-old)
                      Felix Abasi, big time V.C. He 
                      invested in Lunagramand about a 
                      billion others. And that-- is 
                      George Murchison.

      ON STAGE WITH THE BAND-- Millionaire Angel Investor GEORGE 
       THE MURCH  MURCHISON jams on the FLUTE, Jethro Tullstyle. 
      Not the slick money-man we may have imagined, but a slightly 
      pudgy ex-hippie in linen pants and a sherwani.

                                    TREY (CONT'D)
                      Don t let the flute and sandals act 
                      fool you, he s got a mind like--

                                    NASH
                      --John Mayer. 

                                    TREY
                      What?

                                    NASH
                      He s playing. With John. Mayer.

      Sure enough, neo-bluespretty boy JOHN MAYER is jamming with 
      The Murch, mid-guitar solo. As the band hits its final note-- 

                                    TREY
                    Go time.    1/28/201319.


        A smattering of APPLAUSE. Trey drags Nash toward the stage, 
      where The Murch kisses cheeks and slaps fives.

                                    TREY (CONT D)
                      Mr. Murchison. Trey Thornhill. This 
                    is my partner, AvinashDagavi. We 
                      met briefly at your TED talk last--

                                    MURCH
                    Ah yes, Thornhill. Got your emails.
                            (pointed)
                      All twenty of them. How did you... 
                      Did I invite you?

                                    TREY
                    If we could just get five minutes 
                    of your time, we re working on 
                      something--

                                    MURCH
                      Got a party to host, kid. You wanna 
                      talk shop, call my office Monday 
                      morning and set something up.

                                    TREY
                      I ve been calling your office for 
                      weeks, but they told me--

      The Murch walks off, leaving Trey and Nash with their dicks
      in their hands. Nash scratches his leg-- 

                                    NASH 
                      We re fucked.

                                    TREY
                      Easy, bud. We just got here.


      INT. WEWORK OFFICES - AFTERNOON - SAME TIME

        Hobbes and Mitchell are debugging.

                                    HOBBES
                      Beta s still draining juice like a 
                      Saigon street walker. Did you try 
                      switching from GPSto the local 
                      cell network?

      But Mitchell isn t listening. He s watching Mikki and Dane in 
      the distance. Dane has his shirt lifted up, revealing a 
        TATTOO OF HEADPHONES on his right pec. 

                                    MITCHELL
                      I totally blew it with Mikki.     1/28/201320.


                                    HOBBES
                      Lemme tell you something about the 
                      ladies, Mitch. They re slow to warm 
                      up, but they reward persistence. 
                      Think of Mikki as a frostbitten 
                      limb. Cold and incapable of 
                      feeling, but you rub long and hard 
                      enough, you ll get to the pink.

        Hobbes pulls an iPHONEout of his pocket--

                                    HOBBES (CONT D)
                    To whit-- Dane s iPhone.

                                    MITCHELL
                      What? How did you--

                                    HOBBES
                      Let s just say it fell out of his 
                      pocket.  Now, I send you Mikki s 
                      digits...
                          (he swipes and sends)
                      And then we change hernumber in 
                      Dane s phone...

                                    MITCHELL
                      Change it to what?

                                    HOBBES
                    To mine. So when I send Dane a text--

                                    MITCHELL
                            (catching on)
                      He ll think it s coming from 
                      Mikki... But if I have her number, 
                      shouldn t I just, like, call her?

                                    HOBBES
                      Are you a Jedimaster of the Social 
                      Matrix? No. For guys like us, love 
                    is a fuckingjungle, and the only 
                      way you get a girl like Mikki is by 
                      taking out the alpha. Dane s gotta 
                      go. And by  go,  I mean suffer 
                      brutal humiliation by our hands.

        Hobbes holds out Dane s phone. A nervous Mitchell takes it.


      INT. THE MURCH S MANSION - VARIOUS

      Trey talks shop with a fellow ENTREPRENEUR.    1/28/201321.


                                    TREY
                      I don t want to take the first 
                      money that comes knocking. I need 
                    an investor with vision, someone 
                      who sees the long game. Have you 
                      seen Murchison anywhere?

                                      ENTREPRENEUR
                      Nah. He usually doesn t put in much 
                      face time at these things. Unless 
                      you re, you know--

      He indicates a small group of DARK-HAIRED HOTTIESnearby.

                                      ENTREPRENEUR (CONT D)
                      Then he s got plenty of face to 
                      give.

        Meanwhile... NASH has retreated to his  happy place -- 
        earbuds in, Yacht Rock cranked. He hums along, nibbling on 
        satayskewers, focused intensely on something OFF SCREEN. 

      He eyes it critically, carefully, like a scientist studying a 
        chemical reaction. And then we see it--

        A FRAMED SHUNGAWATERCOLOR of a naked Japanese woman 
        receiving oral pleasure from an OCTOPUS. 

                                    NASH
                      Ridiculous. Mollusks have barbed 
                      tongues.

        Reveal A WELL-DRESSED WOMAN standing next to him, nonplussed.


      INT. WEWORK OFFICES - BULLPEN - LATER

        Mitchell lurks near Dane s desk, in espionage mode. When Dane 
      gets up, Mitchell slips Dane s PHONE into his messenger bag.

                                    MIKKI (O.S.)
                      What are you doing?

        Startled, Mitchell turns to find Mikki watching him.

                                    MITCHELL
                      What? Nothing. I... was just...

                                    MIKKI 
                       Cause it looked like you put a 
                      phone in Dane s bag. Which is 
                      weird,  cause he s been looking for 
                      his phone all day.

        Mitchell, freaked, confesses in a single breath--    1/28/201322.


                                    MITCHELL
                      Hobbes took it to get me your 
                      number because you and Dane bumped 
                      phones earlier and then we changed 
                      your number so we could text Dane 
                      but pretend we were you and--

                                    MIKKI
                      Cool. I want in.

                                    MITCHELL
                      You want... what?

                                    MIKKI
                    If you re messing with Dane, I want 
                      in. I m bored. Plus, he s a tool.

                                    MITCHELL
                      I thought you guys were-- why dyou 
                      give him your number?

                                    MIKKI
                    He said he had a weed connect. I 
                      just moved here and I m out.


      INT. MODERN MANSION - SAME TIME 

      Nash reloads on skewers, arranging them OCD-stylewhen--

                                    VOICE (O.S.)
                      Avinash? OMG, is that you?

      Nash turns to find MICHAEL LAU (22), the SpaceRace
        impresario, bounding over, arms extended for a hug. 

                                    NASH
                      Michael Lau.

                                    MICHAEL LAU
                      It s been ages!

        NASH S POV:Lau closes in fast-- uncomfortably so-- but 
        there s something adorable about his nebbish, bespectacled 
      face that keeps Nash from beating a hasty retreat.

                                    MICHAEL LAU (CONT D)
                      After you guys dropped out junior 
                      year it was like--  Poof! Ghost 
                      Protocol initiated!  I miss our old 
                      hack sessions.

      We may sense some sexual tension between these two... not 
      that they re aware of it.    1/28/201323.


                                    NASH
                            (overly formal)
                      Congratulations on SpaceRace. 

                                    MICHAEL LAU
                            (nicest guy ever)
                      I think they overvalued it, but... 
                      I m just psyched to see what you re 
                      cooking up.

      Nash scratches, doesn t make eye contact. Michael notices the 
        Shungaprints--

                                    MICHAEL LAU (CONT D)
                      Wow, these are explicit, aren t 
                      they?  Geez.
                            (chuckles)
                      Erotic!... You wanna get some air? 


      EXT. MURCH S MANSION - DECK -  SUNSET

      Trey checks his watch, impatient. Looks across the DECK and 
      sees LISA, the woman from Barcade, standing alone, taking in 
      the sunset. He approaches. She sees him coming--

                                    LISA
                      And just like that, a stunning 
                      view... ruined.

                                    TREY
                      I didn t catch your name last 
                      night. Trey Thornhill.

      He extends his hand, but she doesn t return the offer.

                                    TREY (CONT D)
                      I just came over to tell you that I 
                      wasn t hitting on you last night.  
                      You re not even my type, I prefer 
                      tall women with blond hair. No 
                      freckles, dancer s build, a little 
                      extra in the trunk is fine, far 
                      less conservative fashion sense--

                                    LISA
                      Are you for real? I need to get 
                      this on video.    1/28/201324.


                                    TREY
                    My point is, I was conducting 
                      research when I approached you and 
                      while I can see how you d 
                        misinterpret my intentions, I 
                      assure you they had nothing to do 
                      with sexual desire.

                                    LISA
                      Well thank God for that.
                            (wait--)
                      Did you say research?

                                    TREY
                      Yes. I m developing an app that s 
                      going to revolutionize social 
                      networking. I m here to pitch it to 
                      George Murchison.

                                    LISA
                            (not impressed)
                      Sounds promising.

                                    TREY
                    It is. Very promising. I promise.

      Just then, Nash steps outside with Lau, buddy-buddy. Trey is 
      taken aback--

                                    TREY (CONT D)
                      What the shit?

      Lisa turns, sees Lau too--

                                    LISA
                      Ah! There he is. Michael!
                            (waves Lau over)
                      Well, Trey, it s been strange.

                                    TREY
                      You re with Michael Lau?

                                    LISA
                      With, with? God no. George 
                      Murchison invested in him. And as 
                      Mr. Murchison s Senior Analyst, 
                      it s my job to make sure that 
                      investment pays off.

      Panic takes hold as Trey realizes what he just stepped in.  
      Lau smiles at Trey, goes for a high five--

                                    LAU
                      Thornhillin the hay-ouse!    1/28/201325.


      But Trey leaves Lau hanging, too stunned to react.  

 END OF ACT TWO. 

                                    ACT THREE


      EXT. MURCH S MANSION - DECK - MOMENTS LATER

      Trey speed-walks away from Lau and Lisa, grabbing Nash by the 
      elbow and dragging him with--

                                    TREY
                      That s Murch s gatekeeper, and she 
                      doesn t like me.  We need to find 
                      him while she s busy with Lau--

                                    NASH
                            (mouth full of satay)
                      But he said to call next week--

                                    TREY
                      We re done waiting. Time to see the 
                      wizard.


      INT. MURCH S MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      Trey spots the Murch holding court, wielding a SAMURAI SWORD 
        behind a SUSHI BAR made of ice. 

                                    MURCH
                      This bluefin was caught less than 
                      twenty hours ago off the coast of 
                      Matsusaka. Wait  til you taste the 
                      freshness.

      The Murch carefully slices into the fish, the small crowd 
         oohs  and  aahs. 

                                    MURCH (CONT D)
                      Anyone tries to dip this in soy 
                      sauce will get my shinshintosword 
                    up their ass.

        LAUGHS from the group. Trey pushes his way to the front.

                                    TREY
                      Mr. Murchison. I m sorry, if we 
                      could just get five minutes--

                                    MURCH
                      I thought I told you to fuckoff.    1/28/201326.


                                    TREY
                      Actually, you told me to call your 
                      office next week, but next week is 
                      too late.

                                    MURCH
                      This isn t the time or the place, 
                      kid.

      Trey spots Lisa CLOSING IN. Now or never--

                                    TREY
                       The only wrong place is second 
                      place.  You said that, sir, in your 
                      keynote. 

        A beat. The Murch sheathes his sword--

                                    MURCH
                      Five minutes.


      INT. MODERN MANSION - MURCH S OFFICE

      Murch reclines behind a massive desk in his man cave, smoking 
        a JOINT, surrounded by GIANT MONITORS. Lisa stands behind 
      him, waving smoke away as she takes notes on a tablet.

      Nash nervously works a laptop, which feeds ONE OF THE 
        MONITORS -- displaying a MOCKUPfor the  BRB  MOBILE APP. 
      Trey is mid-presentation, spreading his gospel.

                      these people are hanging out, in 
                      real time, so you can stop staring 
                    at screens and get out into the

                      It s bigger than that. I m talking 
                      about a world without loneliness.    1/28/201327.

      But Trey won t be dismissed so easily--

                                    TREY
                      When Facebooklaunched, kids used 
                    it to enhance their social lives. 
                      Now my grandma s on there  liking  
                      casserole recipes and Taylor

                      We ve turned life into a spectator 
                      sport, but in our reallives, we re 
                      lonelier than ever.

      Murch picks up his flute and blows a few bars, unconvinced.

                                    MURCH
                      I ve got a second set with Mayer. 
                    So stop tickling my nipples and 
                      show me what you re packing.

                      Nash? Show the man how it works.

      Nash shoots Trey a worried look, then pulls up The Murch s 
        FACEBOOKPROFILE on a monitor. With a few keystrokes, he s 
        HACKED INTO IT.

      Nash CLACKS AWAY, applying the BRBalgorithm to reveal 
        PROFILES Murch has a high match percentage with on the site, 
        ranked by common interests and geographical proximity.

      A MAP similar to GoogleMaps appears, GLOWING PINS

                      There they are. All over the city, 
                      which has just become your social 
                      oyster. Now let s find you a pearl.

      Nash ZOOMS in on THE MURCH S HOUSE-- a smaller set of PINS.

                      I m guessing you re a brunette man.

      NASH CLACKS AWAY, and most of the pins vanish, leaving four 
      or five remaining. He MOUSES over one, finding a match ratio 
      of 92%, and clicks, bringing up her FACEBOOKPROFILE.

                      Debbie. Late 20s, mixing and 
                      mingling as we speak. I m guessing 
                      she s into gold digging, medical 
                      marijuana and Aqualung. But you
                      don t have to guess, because BRB
                      says you ve got a nine-in-ten shot 
                    at sexual chemistry. And this is

                    As our user base grows, so does our 
                      data set. As we mine that data, our 
                      algorithm evolves, until 
                      eventually, you ll have the entire 
                      Social Matrix in your pocket, just 
                        a finger-swipe away.  The end of 
                        loneliness.  That sBRB. It s what 
                    we type when we leave webspace. And 
                      now it s the reason we leave, too.

      Lisa looks skeptical. But Murch is intrigued.

                      Yo, silent partner. How are you 
                      doing this?

      Nash just smirks, Sphinx-like. This is what he does.


      INT. WEWORK OFFICES - COMMUNAL KITCHEN - LATER

        Hobbes sits at a table, TEXTINGfuriously. He sees Mikki and 
        Mitchell approaching and panics, pretending to make a call.    1/28/201329.


                                    MITCHELL
                      It s okay, I told her. She wants 
                      in. And Dane is a drug dealer.

                                    HOBBES
                      Maybe I underestimated him.

                                    MIKKI
                      Nah, he s just a middleman. Has 
                      Dane said anything I can use later 
                    to get off?

                                    HOBBES
                      I m six texts in. Which according 
                    to my advance computational 
                      modeling means we re only a few 
                      texts away from Dane sending us a 
                      dickpic.

                                    MIKKI
                            (reads over his shoulder)
                      I would never say  damp.  Makes my 
                      vag sound like a cellar.

        Mitchell reels from the mental image.

                                    HOBBES
                    No offense, but I ve got a lot of 
                      experience in this field.

                                    MIKKI

                      It s genius, right?

                      That s why we need you. We can t go 
                      wide, not yet. But we re sitting on 
                      something huge. We just want money 
                    to finish the beta.

                                    MURCH
                      And I want an escort who looks like

                      balls, kid, but my advice? Make 
                      something practical. Something 
                      people need.

                                    LISA
                      Like SpaceRace.

      Trey snaps-- that s one too many victories for Michael Lau.

                                    TREY
                      SpaceRace? Think! There are 320,000 
                      parking meters in San Francisco and

                      like you into billionaires. This is 
                      the future, and it s knocking on 
                      your door.

        A long beat.

                      Decent pitch, kid. But I m high as 
                      a kite and all I ve got in my head 
                    is the flute solo to  Your Body is

      INT. TREY S CAR - LATER

      Trey and Nash ride in silence, tension filling the car. As 
      Trey pulls into a parking spot outside of WEWORK, the 
        SpaceRaceapp purrs:  Like a gllllllove.  Trey YANKS his 
        iPhonefrom its cradle and HURLS it out the window, pissed.

      He takes a moment to compose himself.

                                    TREY
                      The Murch will come around. He s 
                      just testing us. 

      Nash snorts--  Are you kidding me? 

                                    NASH
                      I told you we weren t ready.

                                    TREY
                      The algorithm can t be denied. Any 
                      idiot can see its value. We ll find 
                      someone else--

                                    NASH
                      Listen to yourself! Or are you even 
                      capable of listening? You just push 
                      and push and you never shut up!

      Nash starts pulling off the jeans Trey made him wear.  He 
        struggles to get them off.

                                    NASH (CONT D)
                      What is wrong with you?!

                                    TREY
                      What s wrong with you?! At least I 
                      try. At least I put it out there 
                      for people to say  no  to. You d 
                      rather sit alone in your-- 
                            (stops himself)
                      And what the fuckwere you doing 
                      with Lau? You jumping ship? I 
                      thought we were partners!

      Nash finally gets the jeans off. He throws open the car door, 
      turns back for a final shot--

                                    NASH
                    So did I!

      --and TOSSES the jeans in Trey s face. SLAMS the door and 
      walks away in his boxers. Trey sighs. Fuck.    1/28/201332.


      INT. WEWORK OFFICES - LATER

        Mitchell, Mikki and Hobbes are huddled around Hobbes  phone. 
      ON SCREEN: the familiar  ...  ofan impending text. Suddenly, 
      DING! Hobbes shoots his fist skyward in triumph.

                                    HOBBES
                      The eagle s junk has landed!

      The three stare in giddy horror at DANE S DICK PIC.

                                    MITCHELL
                      Yuck. Why is he holding it next to 
                      the keyboard like that? 

                                    MIKKI
                    To show scale?

                                    HOBBES
                      Base to tip is only like  V  to 
                         back-slash.  Full chub, too.

      Trey enters the office, sees the gang together, laughing and 
        high-fiving. He watches for a beat... can t bear to tell them 
      the bad news. He turns and slinks out of the office UNSEEN.


      INT. TREY S APARTMENT - VERY LATE / VERY EARLY

        A modest space, devoid of furniture except for a MATTRESS in 
      the middle of the room. One WALL is covered with SCRIBBLINGS
      and DIAGRAMS. In the middle of them, a large printout tacked 
      to the wall:  Move Fast And Break Things. 

      Trey sits alone, back against the opposite wall, staring at 
      this mantra. He picks up his iPhone, screen CRACKED from the 
        incident in the car. Calls Nash--


      INT. NASH S STUDIO - SAME TIME 

        IKEAdecor. Well organized. Nash is engaged in an epic GUILD 
      WARS session on his triple-wide COMPUTER MONITOR. He wears a 
        GAMING HEADSET, from which the TINNY sounds of battle ECHO.

      CLOSE ON -- Nash s PHONE ringing in its dock, displaying a 
      PHOTO of TREY AND NASH at Stanford, arms around each other s 
        shoulders. An instrumental version of Hall and Oates ballad 
       One On One  plays, Nash s chosen ringtonefor his friend.

      As the call goes to voice mail, we see that Nash has another 
        missed call as well-- this one from MICHAEL LAU.    1/28/201333.


      INT. TREY S MODERN LOFT - CONTINUOUS

      Trey considers leaving a message on Nash s voicemail, but 
      can t find the words. He clicks off, demoralized.

      Trey crawls onto the mattress and pulls a pillow over his 
      head, blocking out the world. A long beat, and then...

      DING! 

      WE PUSH IN ON THE PHONE to find AN INCOMING TEXT: A SNAPSHOT 
      of the GORGEOUS BRUNETTE ( Debbie ) from Trey s pitch. She 
      lies in The Murch s bed naked, post-coital. 

      THE TEXT below reads:  You kids give good algorithm. I ll be 
      in touch. 

      DING! A second TEXT. It reads:  Lisa will run point. BTW she 
        doesn t like u.

                                                                      CUT TO BLACK.
