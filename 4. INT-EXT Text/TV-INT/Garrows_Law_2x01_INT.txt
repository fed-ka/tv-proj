      FOUR COACH PASSENGERS, including GARROW, at the point of a 
      pistol aimed at them as they warily, fearfully even, remove 
      their valuables and hand them over. We open out to see the 
      HIGHWAYMAN, impatiently gesturing with the pistol to hurry them 
      along. As he takes their valuables, the HIGHWAYMAN stops, pulls 
      down his mask and enquires:

                                  HIGHWAYMAN
                    MrGarrow...?

                                  GARROW
                    You know me?

    The HIGHWAYMAN s tone suddenly friendly, convivial.

                                  HIGHWAYMAN
                    Know you?  Why I d know you even if 
                    you was boiled up in soup!

      GARROW smiles awkwardly at the scrutiny of the other PASSENGERS.

                                  HIGHWAYMAN
                    You was for me at the Bailey.  Highway 
                    robbery and not guilty.   You do not 
                    remember?

                                  GARROW
                    The memory is all too vivid now.

    The HIGHWAYMAN, delighted, hands him back his valuables.

                                  HIGHWAYMAN
                    I paid you out before and I am 
                    grateful once again. Lord bless you 
                    and save you!                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  1A.


    The HIGHWAYMAN withdraws. GARROW acutely aware of the  other 
      PASSENGERS looking at him. They are put out. They didn t get 
      their valuables back.

      SCENE OMITTED44


      GARROW standing in SOUTHOUSE s office (with luggage) looking 
      around curiously at its chaotic, fly blown appearance.

                                  GARROW
                    Mr Southouse...? Mr Southouse..!

      SOUTHOUSE S head appears from below the desk behind which he has 
      obviously been hiding.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    You are within.

                                  GARROW
                    The door was unlocked.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Damnation.

                                  GARROW
                    You wished it so?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    You think I would wish to give my 
                    creditors an opportunity?!

                                  GARROW
                    You have debts?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Merely accounts that I have yet to settle.

      GARROW, dismayed by SOUTHOUSE s words, appearance and demeanour 
    as his mentor hurries to the door to lock the door.

                                  GARROW
                    It burdens me to see you looking 
                    so...if I could have come back from 
                    the Northern Circuit sooner to keep 
                    company with you...

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I am sure of it.

                                  GARROW
                    It seems the life of a widower is not easy.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  3A.


                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    It is altogether hard to take. The 
                    loss of her is hard to take.                            GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  4.


      A tender moment between them. GARROW sees that SOUTHOUSE has 
      been drinking, is drinking now. He s concerned.

                                  GARROW
                    It seems you have found some other 
                    company...

      SOUTHOUSE, ironic, rueful:

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I have made myself a sacrifice at the 
                    shrine of Bacchus.

                                  GARROW
                    If you are sometimes prostrate there I 
                    hope at least your profession keeps 
                    you upright still?

      SOUTHOUSE doesn t respond.

                                  GARROW
                    Mr Southouse...? (beat) Mr Southouse 
                    you have established clients. If you 
                    have served them well then they are 
                    repaying that service surely?

      Pause. An admission:

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I have not had appetite to provide 
                    that service. Nor gone about it.

                                  GARROW
                    You have lost your grip.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I am still at these offices but...not 
                    quite in my office.

                                  GARROW
                    Mr Southouse we can remedy this... 

    He takes his jacket off and fills a bowl with water.

                                  GARROW
                    Firstly we will improve your 
                    appearance by some shaving to your 
                    face, I will send out for some coffee 
                    and thus enlivened you will  venture 
                    into the coffee shops, converse with 
                    the Merchants and anyone else in need 
                    of an Attorney...

      SOUTHOUSE looks at him with fondness.                            GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  5.


                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I had reckoned your absence longer 
                    than two months.

                                                              CUT TO:


    SIR ARTHUR HILL, in the middle of breakfast, surprised and not 
      altogether happy at Sarah s entrance with SAMUEL. 

                                  HILL
                    You did not send word of your return 
                    to London.

                                  SARAH
                    I did not expect my confinement to 
                    last six months.

                                  HILL
                    Bramber is hardly a confinement.

                                  SARAH
                    Bramber is not my home, it is your 
                    borough and my dear Arthur you are 
                    never there.

                                  HILL
                    And so when we are united it is a 
                    happy occasion.

                                  SARAH
                    And when we are not it is a less than 
                    happy separation. Now I am come home. 
                    To you.

                                  HILL
                    But I am engaged in Parliament and at 
                    the Admiralty.

                                  SARAH
                    You are second Assistant Secretary 
                    there - how engaged can you be?                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  5A.


                                  HILL
                    Samuel is well.

      SARAH hands SAMUEL to HILL.                            GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  6.


                                  SARAH
                    You see how he does respond to you? I 
                    am glad of it because I must take my 
                    leave of you....

                                  HILL
                    You go where?

                                  SARAH
                    I have urgent business to attend to. 
                    Mary...

                                  HILL
                    It requires the presence of your maid?

      SARAH, lightly, affectionately.

                                  SARAH
                    As your son requires you.

      SARAH leaves. HILL looking ambivalently at SAMUEL.

                                                              CUT TO:


      A woman called ANNIE CHRISTIE is in the dock. Judge BULLER 
      presiding. YARDLEY, a Parish Constable, is giving evidence against 
      her. SILVESTER is prosecuting. At the Counsel s table GARROW - 
      uninvolved in the case - is reading a newspaper:

                                  YARDLEY
                    I insisted on knowing what she had in 
                    her apron. There I found two gowns, a 
                    scarlet cloak and a sheet....
                                                                                              *                            GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  7.


                                  SILVESTER
                    Were there any other things found but 
                    these?

                                  YARDLEY
                    This key I found on her which opens 
                    the Prosecutors door.

    He holds it up. GARROW glances up. SILVESTER, satisfied. The 
      case seems cut and dried.

                                  SILVESTER
                    No more questions my Lord.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Do you have anything to say in your defence?

                                  ANNIE CHRISTIE
                    I buy and sell old clothes. I bought 
                    these things of a woman. As for the *
                    key, it is the key of my door. 

      GARROW suddenly compelled to stand up.

                                  GARROW
                    My Lord as this poor woman has no 
                    counsel will you permit me as Amicus 
                    curiae to ask Mr Yardley a thing or 
                    two?

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Very well.

      SILVESTER and GARROW share a look.

                                  GARROW
                    Did you ever try this key you say 
                    opens the prosecutors door?

                                  YARDLEY
                    No.

                                  GARROW
                    Then how do you identify it as such?*                            GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  8.


                                  YARDLEY*
                    Because the prosecutor tells me her *
                    key was eat upwith rust.*

      GARROW, incredulous:

                                  GARROW
                    Is it by a key being worn with rust 
                    sir that you affect to identify it in 
                    a court of justice?

      GARROW takes a key out of his pocket.*

                                  GARROW*
                    I have the key to my chambers here. It *
                    too is eat up with rust.*

      Laughter from the court.*

                                                              CUT TO:


      SOUTHOUSE is travelling in a carriage with two men - the 
      GILBERTS. PETER GILBERT more tentative, diplomatic, drier. HUGH, 
      unapologetic, to the point. They give the impression of being 
      busy with little time to waste.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    Ship called the Zong. The owners claimed for 
                    the value of their..of their cargo.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    133 slaves thrown overboard. On the 
                    grounds of necessity.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    The Captain deemed they were running 
                    out of water supplies. The action 
                      purportedly taken to save the ship.                            GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  9.


                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Purportedly.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    We honoured the loss.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Thirty pounds each Negro. Three 
                    thousand nine hundred and ninety 
                    pounds.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    As we undertook the risk of loss, 
                    capture and death of the slaves or any 
                    other unavoidable accident to them.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And now you dispute the claim?

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    We do more than that. We challenge 
                    fraud.

      HUGH GILBERT hands him a journal.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    The ship masters log?

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    No, that was apparently lost.

      HUGH, recriminatory to PETER:

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Its loss should have been a 
                      disqualifying clause in the policy and 
                    we would have been discharged by it.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    Well now we are here to remedy it!(to 
                    SOUTHOUSE) This is a diary written by 
                    the only passenger on board the ship. 
                    Robert Stubbs. It contradicts the 
                    captains account.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And has only since come to light?

                    Mr Stubbs almost succumbed to the 
                    fever that gripped him aboard ship.

                    He was in no position to co-operate in 
                    our assessment of the claim but now 
                      recovering, saw fit to forward the 
                      documentation.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  10.


                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Well Gentlemen I am very happy to 
                    accept the case. Grateful in fact.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Your engagement is conditional on you 
                      instructing Mr Garrow.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I see.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    We are underwriters averse to risk Mr 
                    Southouse. And in Mr Garrow we see 
                    fewer. Goodbye.

    The coach has stopped and HUGH GILBERT opens the door to let 
      SOUTHOUSE out. He s a little dismayed by his abrupt dismissal.

                                                              CUT TO:


                                  JUDGE BULLER*
                    (To ANNIE CHRISTIE) Who is this woman 
                    you brought the clothes from?

                                  ANNIE CHRISTIE
                    I did not know her.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  11.


                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Then where did this sale take place?

                                  ANNIE CHRISTIE
                    In the Blue Boar.

      BULLER, repeating the answer sceptically, world wearily and 
      critically.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    In the Blue Boar.

      GARROW realizes that his intervention has not been decisive. 
      SILVESTER smiles at BULLER s response and then at GARROW - 
      because he knows it too.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Do you have any witnesses to speak on 
                    your behalf?

                                  ANNIE CHRISTIE
                    I have no friend in the world but God 
                    and...

      ANNIE glances up into the public gallery, as if looking for 
      someone.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    And who Madam?

                                  ANNIE CHRISTIE
                    But God and you Gentlemen and I beg 
                    for mercy.

      GARROW looks at ANNIE apologetically as if to say  I did my 
      best . She looks disconsolate.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Members of the Jury, you may...

      Suddenly a voice rings out, interrupting him:

                                  SARAH (O.S.)
                    I will speak for her!

      SARAH (with MARY alongside) has appeared in the public gallery. 
      GARROW looks up, astonished and utterly dismayed.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Lady Sarah! I do not normally take 
                    kindly at being interrupted in my own 
                    court but your appearance or should I 
                    say your re-appearance gives me an 
                    altogether different humour.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  12.


                                  SILVESTER
                    I think you are not alone my Lord.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Swear her.

      SARAH comes to the witness box. The CLERK hands her a bible. 
      SARAH, glancing at GARROW as she gives the oath, can t bring 
      herself to make proper eye contact with him. It s mutual.

                                                              CUT TO:


      GUSTAVUS VASSA, a black man (late thirties) is sitting in a bath 
      tub. He s distracted, lost in thought, in some kind of haunted 
      remembrance as he washes himself. 

                                                              CUT TO:


      SARAH, giving evidence, a little uncertain, acutely aware of 
      GARROW s presence.

                                  SARAH
                    She...she was formerly house maid to 
                    me and I still employ her sister Mary 
                    as my personal maid.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    What character does she bear?

                                  SARAH
                    Honest, hardworking, conscientious. In 
                    her three years of service I only had 
                    cause to invest my trust in the 
                    prisoner.

      SARAH addresses this to the Jury. It goes down well.

                                  GARROW
                    Lady Sarah, I do not represent the 
                    prisoner but ask questions on her 
                    behalf as amicus curiae - a friend of 
                    the court.

                                  SARAH
                    Then she is truly befriended.

                                  GARROW
                    And by you too I think.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  12A.


                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Mr Garrow do you have a question to 
                    put to this witness? Well?                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  13.


    We see SOUTHOUSE making his way into the public gallery. (GARROW 
      unaware) GARROW aware of BULLER s impatience becomes gauche, 
      awkward:

                                  GARROW (TO SARAH)
                    You...you are well I hope?

      SILVESTER rolls his eyes. BULLER frowning. And SOUTHOUSE looking 
      dismayed by this  reunion .

    In front of a mirror, VASSA dressing himself. Purposeful, 
      intent. We see from his clothes that he is a  Gentleman .

      ANNIE and MARY hug each other in relief at the verdict.

      SARAH is talking to GARROW. 

                                  SARAH
                    I hope my appearance did not cause you 
                    any discomfort.

                                  GARROW
                    It was only your previous 
                      disappearance that caused me any 
                      difficulty.

                                  SARAH
                    I will not pity you. Especially when I 
                    suspect that you have lately met 
                    several young women who do walk 
                    chaperoned beside you. And not because 
                    good manners demand it but lest they 
                    swoon and are in want of someone to 
                    lean on!

                                  GARROW
                    Alas I am only in demand at the bar.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  14.


                                  SARAH
                    I have been in the country. I have a 
                    son now. Samuel.

                                  GARROW
                    I wish you well in your happiness.

      They hold each others gaze for a moment or two and she goes. 
      SOUTHOUSE approaches, looks on at SARAH s departure.

                                  GARROW
                    Coincidental Mr Southouse.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Not serendipitous then?

                                  GARROW
                    The only good fortune in this is the 
                    outcome of the trial. Do not enquire 
                    after my heart.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I make no judgement.

                                  GARROW
                    You do not? Most unlike you.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I wish to instruct you in a case. I 
                    hope it will be of interest. I...

                    Mr Southouse...

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I venture that it must.

                    A lady bears witness at the Old Bailey to a

      SARAH pre-empting the conclusion he thinks he s coming to.

                                  SARAH
                    I had no more expectations of seeing Mr 
                    Garrow than he had of seeing me.

      SOUTHOUSE is outlining the case to GARROW.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    The insurance claim declared the ship 
                    was rendered  foul and leaky, having 
                    been retarded by perils of the sea . 
                    Contrary winds and currents and other 
                       mistakes .

                                  GARROW
                    Affecting the safe passage of its 
                    cargo?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    440 Africans on board from west Africa 
                    to Jamaica. 133 thrown into the sea, 
                    60 dead from fever. Now...

      SOUTHOUSE rolls out a map and lays it flat on the desk.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                      ....Liverpool Assurance covered the 
                    loss of  30 per negro because  
                    although Captain Collingwood may have 
                    been  in want of common care  he was 
                    not negligent. However, Robert Stubbs 
                    diary suggests very strongly that the 
                    loss arose not from  perils of the 
                    sea  but from Collingwood s poor 
                    judgement.

                                  GARROW
                    How so?

      SOUTHOUSE using the map to show the journey.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  15A.


                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    On the voyage he mistook Jamaica for 
                    Hispaniola - Spanish territory - so 
                    they did not dare venture there.

                                  SOUTHOUSE (cont'd)
                    Belatedly realizing his mistake he is 
                    then committed to the necessity of 
                    having to sail back to Jamaica against 
                    the prevailing winds. The ship, 
                    according to Stubbs, was 300 miles 
                    leeward. 

                                  GARROW
                    The wrong side?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And subsequently the journey took 112 
                    days instead of the 60 days of most 
                    Middle Passage journeys.

                                  GARROW
                    As a consequence of which they ran out 
                    of water.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And the slaves jettisoned.

                                  GARROW
                    How grievous this mistake?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Enough to suggest negligence, that he 
                    was not fit to command. Enough to 
                    suggest the insurers were misled.  The 
                    want of skill in a Commander is not a 
                    risk for which the underwriters are 
                      responsible .

      GARROW looking at STUBBS journal/diary:

                                  GARROW
                    The account finishes before any 
                    throwing over of slaves.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Stubbs words still compel the 
                      prosecution of this case.

                                  GARROW
                    There is an appalling loss of life in 
                    this.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    The case would answer to that.

                                  GARROW
                    Would it? It is a case about liability 
                    for the loss of cargo.

                                  GARROW (cont'd)
                    That the declaration was true or  
                    false is all it will answer to.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  17.


                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    It would also answer to my... 
                      difficulty! (beat) I am in want of 
                    this brief Will.

      GARROW receptive but troubled and conflicted, leaves. SOUTHOUSE 
      left frustrated and worried.

      VASSA in with GARROW and SOUTHOUSE. *

                                  VASSA*
                    Fifty four women and children thrown *
                    singly through the cabin windows. One *
                    after the other. The rest from the *
                    quarter deck, shackled together two by *
                    two and weighed down with iron. Eleven *
                    jumped into the water voluntarily. *
                    Death becomes the best friend you have *
                    on such a voyage. You wish its relief.*

                                  GARROW*
                    You should know that I am already *
                    requested in this cause. Liverpool *
                    Assurance wish to prosecute the owners *
                    of the Zong for insurance fraud.*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    You are wrong if you think that is the *
                    same cause. That is merely a mercenary *
                    business about the pecuniary value of *
                    Negroes. Not their right to live. And *
                    being deprived of their right to live *
                    I will prosecute for murder.*

                                  GARROW*
                    But forgive me Mr Vassa, you were not *
                    aboard this ship, you lost no relative *
                    on it. I mean to say that no crime has *
                    been committed against you.*                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  17A.


      VASSA, sardonic, indignant.*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    Because I was not murdered myself?! *
                    Because I survived my own passage, *
                    must I stand aside and venture only my *
                    good fortune? I am them Mr Garrow, I *
                    am them!*

                                  SOUTHOUSE*
                    But a prosecution for murder cannot *
                    succeed! Either at the old Bailey or *
                    the Admiralty Court!*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    Its success will depend on the Jury.*

                                  SOUTHOUSE*
                    I mean it cannot even be begun because *
                    cargo cannot be murdered! Africans are *
                    viewed as no different from other *
                    forms of property, like horses and *
                    cattle.*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    If you are an Attorney then you should *
                    know your law! The Somerset ruling *
                    gave it out that  property  can have *
                    rights.*

                                  SOUTHOUSE*
                    For a freed slave in England like *
                    yourself perhaps. But not maritime *
                    cargo. It is inanimate!*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    Slaves have  agency  in the way of *
                    insurrection at sea! And when they are *
                    killed for it, the owners claim!*

                                  SOUTHOUSE*
                    Horses can rear up and be shot for it *
                    and the owners claim! But that does *
                    not make them human!*

      VASSA angry with Southouse, glances at GARROW.*

                                  SOUTHOUSE (CONT D)*
                    African slaves do not have the status *
                    of personhood. I merely make the point *
                    in law. As an Attorney.*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                      (POINTEDLY) In want of a brief.*                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  17B.


                                  GARROW*
                    Hear me...both of you!(BEAT) I think *
                    we can proceed in a way that will *
                    satisfy us all.*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    If Mr Southouse is to be satisfied *
                    then you will prosecute an insurance *
                    fraud...*

                                  GARROW*
                    It will help you in your cause! Lose a *
                      prosecution for murder then a *
                    definitive precedent is set that *
                    slaves can be killed at will. But if I *
                    can prove the claim to be fraudulent, *
                    if I can prove the plea of necessity *
                    for those deaths to be false then...*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    Then the insurers interests will be *
                    served.*

                                  GARROW*
                    Yes but more than that! Because in *
                    future, because of this case, they may *
                    find a better way to see those *
                    interests served. By providing the *
                    least possible indemnity for slaves *
                    murdered in passage.*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    Instead of thirty pounds for a negro s *
                    head they will only pay out twenty? *
                    That is your idea of progress Mr *
                    Garrow?*

                                  GARROW*
                    If it will inhibit the murder of *
                    slaves then yes.*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    So you will inch towards justice and *
                    not demand it?*

                                  GARROW*
                    If we go in its direction then yes!*

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA*
                    I cannot allow myself your patience. *

      VASSA goes. SOUTHOUSE to GARROW:*                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  17C.


                                  SOUTHOUSE*
                    I shall begin preparation of the case *
                    by visiting Liverpool. I just wish it *
                    were not such a long way to venture.*

                                  GARROW*
                    But it will provide some distraction *
                    from...other matters that press you.*

                                  SOUTHOUSE*
                    I shall work assiduously and all the *

      SOUTHOUSE, on a long, uncomfortable, sweaty journey finds 
      himself squashed in his seat amidst his fellow PASSENGERS who 
    are either snoring, staring at him or eating loudly and greasily 
    in his ear. He is trying to read (the muster roll).

                                                              CUT TO:


      SOUTHOUSE approaches a GROUP OF MEN who are drinking.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I enquire after James Kelsall, First 
                    mate on the Zong. I understand he 
                    lodges here.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  22.


                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    You have found him. And who enquires 
                    after him.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    John Southouse, Attorney.

    The GROUP moves away at this. SOUTHOUSE sits down opposite 
      KELSALL and as the SERVING MAID approaches he tells her:

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Water.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    Your business sir?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I act for Liverpool Assurance.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    Then you have no business with me.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    You will be called by the defence and 
                    then you shall do business with the 
                      Prosecution s counsel. So it may be as 
                    well for you to hear what may be put to 
                    you.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I have already sworn that there was 
                    only enough water for four days but 
                    ten to thirteen days would be required 
                    to regain Jamaica.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Which knowledge caused Captain 
                      Collingwood to call his crew about him? 
                    To begin the throwing over of the 
                    slaves? Women and children first?

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    29th November. Eight o clock in the 
                    evening. Coinciding with the changing 
                    of the watch. When the maximum numbers 
                    of crew members were available...for 
                    the task.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    How did it feel to commit such an act?

      KELSALL hesitates, trying to disguise any conflict.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  22A.


                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I will not reproach myself for my 
                    obedience.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  23.


                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And does your conscience reproach you?

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    If the charge were murder it might be 
                    so but as it is fraud it does not 
                    figure.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Robert Stubbs wrote a journal of his 
                    time on the ship. You know of it?

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    The man was in a fever.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And his view of Captain Collingwood - 
                    did his agitation only come from the 
                    typhoid or from what he had seen?

      KELSALL is troubled and not willing to answer.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    You will not make a case with me...I 
                    must make my living.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    From the pushing of slaves into the sea? 
                    And then to swear for Collingwood?

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    On a voyage such as that, men succumb. I 
                    cannot suffer for all of them.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Who do you suffer for?

      KELSALL will not respond.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I have already obtained the muster 
                    roll. There were two Kelsalls on 
                    board. Yourself and...?

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    It does not signify. Besides I know 
                    what I must answer.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    What you must not what you ought? But 
                    then you are first mate and practiced 
                    in doing the bidding of Captain 
                    Collingwood.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  23A.


      KELSALL, provoked.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  24.


                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I am not so easily bidden! I stand by 
                    my opinions!

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Then you have been in dispute with

                    I admire the way you seek to gain sir 
                    but you will not profit from me.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    As you profit from your silence?

      KELSALL doesn t respond. SOUTHOUSE goes. A MAN has been watching 
      this encounter - CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD. He approaches.

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    Show as much resolve at the Old Bailey 
                    and you will find no quarrel with me.

                                  HILL
                    He had...occasion to be there. In the

                                  SARAH
                    A meeting? I came upon the man!

                                  HILL
                    Then was it hoped for? Did you wish to 
                    re-unite Garrow with what is his?

                                  SARAH
                    Samuel? I have been faithful to you!

                                  HILL
                    I cannot believe it to be so. I have 
                    given my thoughts over to this 
                      constantly. I will not condemn you for

                    will be heir to my entire estate, my 
                    title and my property. At least I will

                    So you will arrange our marriage

                     allow  me to have deceived you when I

      HILL is trying to persuade the GILBERT BROTHERS.

                                  HILL
                    The unsavoury aspect of this case may 
                    well lead to pressure in Parliament to 
                    regulate slave insurance.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    How so?

                                  HILL
                    By specifying along the lines that NO 
                    loss shall be recoverable against the 
                    throwing over of living  slaves ON ANY 
                    ACCOUNT WHATSOEVER. Underwriters like 
                    yourself will lose business and slaves 
                    will become uninsurable.

      PETER GILBERT looks anxious at this. HUGH is bullish.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  29A.


                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Sir Arthur we do not intend to sustain 
                    or accept any loss in this case by 
                    abandoning it.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  30.

                    You deal in risk? How will you 
                    underwrite the end of your business? 
                    You are of this trade. You cannot 
                    undermine it.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    We do not predict history, we follow 
                    policy. And we are  4000 out of pocket 
                    because of a fraudulent claim.

                    Slaves overboard or not Sir Arthur I 
                    am afraid that has been our most 
                    grievous discovery.

      HILL doesn t like being thwarted in this way but realizes he 
      cannot dissuade them.

      PETER and HUGH GILBERT are meeting with GARROW and SOUTHOUSE. 
    The carriage throws them around a little.

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    Naturally we resisted Sir Arthur s wish for 
                    us to adopt a  political  view.

                                  GARROW
                    What view do you take?

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    We wish our money back. And proving the 
                    claim falsely made you will obtain it.

    He considers the meeting over and raps on the carriage roof, 
      signalling that it should stop. SOUTHOUSE, glances at GARROW who 
    is obviously not impressed. SOUTHOUSE tells the GILBERTS 
      reassuringly as he gets out:

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    If Captain Collingwood was not a true 
                    commander of his ship, Mr Garrow will 
                    have it out. For he can steer the Old 
                    Bailey to his will.

      They exit the carriage. 


      HILL has come to seek SARAH out. He s conciliatory, gentle. 

                                  HILL
                    All I ask of you...all I ask is some 
                    gesture to me, some thought or deed or 
                    word that means you reciprocate the 
                    feeling I have for you.

      SARAH is in front of the mirror looking levelly at him.

                                  SARAH
                    What can I ever do in such a way that 
                    will convince you of my constancy?                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  32.

                    How so?

                                  GARROW
                    If you will appear as a witness.

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    But I was not there.

                                  GARROW
                    Not on the Zong. But you and those 133 
                    souls may be concealed in another 
                    vessel altogether.

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    A Trojan horse?

      GARROW smiles. VASSA responds.

      HILL is working. SARAH comes in. He looks up. 

                                  SARAH
                    I will not do it. I cannot.

                                  HILL
                    Cannot?

                                  SARAH
                    It would be unjust. A betrayal.

                    Your loyalty is to me.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  35A.

                    And true to him because you love him?

      SARAH cannot, will not, respond. He takes this as an admission. 
    And vindication.

                                  HILL
                    You accused me before of delusion. But now 
                    it is proven. It is all proven!

                                  SARAH
                    Your judgement is all wrong!

      GARROW is taking notes.

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    The sharks would always accompany the 
                    ship in expectation of dead bodies 
                    being thrown over. They were never 
                      disappointed.

                                  GARROW
                    And you would wish to be thrown over 
                    yourself?

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    If I could have gotten over the 
                    nettings.

                                  GARROW
                    Nettings?

                    The assembly of ropes placed along the 
                    sides of the ship to prevent that 
                    particular redemption. And then we 
                    were truly delivered Mr Garrow.

                                  GARROW

                    The merchants and planters came on 
                    board and examined us most attentively 
                    and then they made us jump.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  36A.


                                  GARROW
                    Jump?                           GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  37.


                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    Those who could jump the highest 
                    fetched the best price. A sign of 
                    health and strength.

      Pause. VASSA, distracted, elsewhere...

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    Like this...

      VASSA jumps. GARROW, uncomfortable:

                                  GARROW
                    Mr Vassa...

      VASSA jumps again.

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    You see Mr Garrow? How high...

      VASSA breaks down. GARROW holds him by the shoulders.

                    You will take your place in the witness

                    Westminster!

                                  LORD MELVILLE
                    A parliamentary Divorce would amicably 
                    allow both sides to remarry. But I 
                    cannot think you could contemplate 
                    Garrow as Sarah s new husband. I 
                    cannot think you would wish it 
                    amicable.

                      Negligence. Collingwood was negligent. 
                    Not evil, not a murderer, not cruel. And 
                    if you can prise Kelsall apart on the 
                    cause of the dispute that may answer to 
                    it.

                                  GARROW
                    I wish to introduce another stratagem...

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    You will enlighten me?

                                  GARROW

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    What evidence will he provide? *

                                  GARROW
                    You did say yourself that this case 
                    was about more than insurance.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    There may be consequences is what I 
                    meant. But I will not have this 
                      prosecution sabotaged by 
                      pamphleteering and agitation!

                                  GARROW
                    And I will not have this prosecution 
                    ignore murder!

      Suddenly there s a rapping at the door. GARROW answers it to 
      find SARAH there. She s upset and distracted.

                                  GARROW
                    Sarah...?

      SARAH seeing SOUTHOUSE.

                                  SARAH
                      I apologize for any intrusion. I did 
                    not have the wits to consider where 
                    else I may seek help.

                                  GARROW
                    Help?                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  40A.


    She hands him the writ she s been served. He reads it, looks at 
      her, then hands it SOUTHOUSE.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  41.


                                  SARAH
                    If he means to dissolve the marriage 
                    then I cannot say I am surprised by it 
                    but I must confess myself ignorant of 
                    the nature of it.

      SOUTHOUSE looks to GARROW.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    This means of action...it is a sad 
                    thing...

                                  SARAH
                    I do not wish delicacy Mr Southouse. 
                    Enlighten me.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    He means to cut you off financially.

                                  GARROW
                    What has provoked him in this way?

      SARAH looks at GARROW. SOUTHOUSE, taking the cue, decides to 
      withdraw but needing to make a point:

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I fear you will be terribly detained 
                    by this Lady Sarah and I hope Mr 
                    Garrow will find time when he is not  
                    so detained himself by his pressing 
                    duties in the law...

      GARROW, explaining to SARAH:

                                  GARROW
                    I am prosecuting in the Zong case tomorrow.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    The session begins early.

      Smiling stiffly, he goes but not without a final, pointed look 
    at GARROW. SARAH and GARROW left alone.

                                  GARROW
                    So you will tell me why your husband 
                    seeks to disown you?

                                  SARAH
                    He is in the grip of an idea that our 
                    son is not his, that I am not 
                    faithful. And most of all he insists 
                    that I love you.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  41A.


                                  GARROW
                    Despite how you must have refuted 
                    every accusation?                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  42.


                                  SARAH
                    His fancies have pushed me here. But 
                    from such fancies a truth comes Will.

    She looks at him intently. GARROW doesn t want to hear this, 
      know this. He s conflicted, tormented by it.

                                  GARROW
                    I asked you once in vain to leave him. 
                    Your refusal exhausted every hope I 
                    ever had of you. Now you declare your 
                    love for me as Hill seeks to banish 
                    you?!

                                  SARAH
                    (ANGRY) I do not come to you seeking *
                    refuge, to hide from the disgrace he 
                    is determined to put upon me. In fact 
                    I have come to say that I will own it. 
                    If the disgrace be my feeling for you 
                    I will gladly own it!

      Pause. He looks at her then goes to her, kisses her. She 
      responds. GARROW stops, pulls back.

                                  GARROW
                    You must not.

      VASSA arrives at the Old Bailey for the first time. A sense of 
    the duty he must perform, knowing that the reception he may 
      receive will be hostile. Everything around him - the barristers *

      STUBBS is in the witness box. COLLINGWOOD is in the dock. GARROW 
    has realized to his dismay that STUBBS  infirmity  now owes 
      itself to drink as much as recovering from a fever. In other 
      words, he has been drinking.

                                  GARROW
                    What do you think induced Captain 
                      Collingwood to mistake Jamaica for 
                      Hispaniola?

                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    He identified it at nine leagues out.

                                  GARROW
                    Nine leagues?                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  45.


                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    Twenty seven miles.

                                  GARROW
                    Twenty seven miles! Captain 
                      Collingwood made a wrong 
                      identification from a distance of 
                    twenty seven miles?!(beat) No more 
                    questions my Lord.

      GARROW glad to have got through this examination without mishap. 
      SILVESTER stands up to cross examine.

                                  SILVESTER
                    Mr Stubbs why is your account of the 
                    journey incomplete?

                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    I was taken ill...

                                  SILVESTER
                    Were you ill while you were writing 
                    your journal?

                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    I had a fever.

                                  SILVESTER
                    Would that explain why your hand- writing 
                    deteriorates page by page, why your 
                    sentences cease to hold together in any way 
                    that is sensible?

                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    The pen shook in my hand is all...

                                  SILVESTER
                    And your judgement Mr Stubbs - was 
                    that very shaken also?

      Laughter. GARROW knows this is going badly, and may get worse.

                                  SILVESTER
                    Mr Stubbs - why were you a passenger 
                    on board the Zong?

                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    I was in need of passage.

                                  SILVESTER
                    Why?                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  45A.


                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    I had been appointed Governor of 
                    Annamboe by the African company but had 
                    left there...                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  46.


                                  SILVESTER
                    Why?

      STUBBS hesitating:

                                  SILVESTER
                    You are under oath Mr Stubbs...

                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    I had been suspended.

                                  SILVESTER
                    Why?

                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    Abusing my position.

                                  SILVESTER
                    Abusing your position? In what way?

                                  ROBERT STUBBS
                    Seeking to make private profit.

      STUBBS character is exposed and his credibility dying.

                                  SILVESTER
                    So you found yourself dumped on the coast 
                    of Guinea? Until picked up by the Zong. 
                    And then picked up once again by the 
                    insurance Company as a witness!

      GARROW looks wounded. SILVESTER has killed STUBBS credibility. 
      HUGH GILBERT looks to PETER GILBERT with grim dissatisfaction, 
      even blame. PETER GILBERT looks embarrassed.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Mr Garrow - any more witnesses for the 
                    prosecution?

                                  GARROW
                    My Lord - I call Gustavus Vassa.

    The GILBERTS look at each other. VASSA comes to the witness box 
    as STUBBS departs it. The novelty of a black witness is not lost 
    in the public gallery. His appearance provokes much observation 
    and conjecture. GARROW and VASSA share a look.

      It s difficult for him and he falters.

                    You cannot breathe. You would not wish 
                    to....the smell....

    One of the COURT USHERS is swinging incense/nosegays from a 
      chain in the courtroom. VASSA fixating on the swinging chain, 
      distracted by it. It s a reminder of his capture. GARROW 
      anxiously aware of this.

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    The smell of perspiration is only 
                    outdone by the stench of the latrines. 
                    It is unforgettable. Children fall 
                    into the tubs of excrement. They 
                    suffocate in it. 

                                                              CUT TO:


    The fevered shivering of a body. A sudden blast of light as the

                                  GUSTAVUS 
                    In this pestilential stew, if you are 
                    fortunate you succumb to smallpox or 
                    gaol fever.

      There s no doubt about the impact of this testimony - because it 
    has never been heard before and therefore SILVESTER is quick to 
      object to it.

                                  SILVESTER
                    My Lord what is the relevance of this 
                    testimony in a prosecution for insurance 
                    fraud?                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  48.


                                  GARROW
                    This fraud involves a journey across the 
                    Middle Passage. You would not wish to 
                    have a narrative upon it?

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Only if it bear some relation to the 
                      indictment.

                                  SILVESTER
                    Slaves thrown over - necessity or not?

      VASSA, a passionate outburst:

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    It is never a necessity to murder us!

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Mr Vassa you must curb your temper.

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    If I am angry I am a savage. If I am 
                    sanguine I am not a man.

      BULLER discomfited but acknowledging this:

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                      Yes...quite possibly.

                                  GARROW
                    Mr Vassa will you please give us some 
                    idea of your experience at sea?

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    I served in the British navy for seven 
                    years with my Master; I have worked on 
                    merchant ships in voyages to North 
                    America, the West Indies and the North 
                    Pole.

                                  GARROW
                    And as such a veteran of the seas you 
                    are familiar with the notion of a ship 
                    rendered  foul and leaky ? The Zong 
                    itself described and claimed  so.  By 
                    perils of the sea and contrary currents, 
                    the ship rendered foul and leaky. And 
                    therefore retarded in her voyage. 
                    Captain Collingwood and the ship s 
                    owners claim this was because there was 
                    crippling worm damage to the bottom of 
                    the boat. Can you comment?                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  48A.


                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    Ship worm. Teredo worms. In fact, salt 
                    water clams. 
                                  (MORE)                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  49.

                    They bore into submerged timber. Marine 
                    bivalve molluscs in the family 
                    Teredinidae. Hence Teredo worms.

                                  GARROW
                    And if I tell you that the Zong was 
                    copper bottomed. What say you then?

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    Any ship that is filled with copper 
                    plating on the underside of its hull 
                    is impervious to Teredo worms.

                                  GARROW
                    So the claims by Captain Collingwood 
                    and its owners that the ship was 
                    rendered foul and leaky?

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                      Impossible.

                                  GARROW
                    Thank you Mr Vassa. No more questions.

      VASSA has undermined the defence in a quite unexpected way. 
      SOUTHOUSE looks delighted. We pick out MELVILLE telling HILL:

                                  LORD MELVILLE
                    Garrow excels himself with the Negro.

      HILL, unhappily acknowledging this.

                                                              CUT TO:


      SILVESTER is examining CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  50.


                                  SILVESTER
                    Captain Collingwood, I am sure you are 
                    as distressed as I am that this case 
                    has been represented in some quarters 
                    as murder, a policy no doubt to inflame 
                    a jury. But let us be clear so that 
                    emotions do not undermine deliberation. 
                    Let us  part company with any claim 
                    that  actual persons have been thrown 
                    overboard. This is a case of chattels 
                    or goods. Blacks be goods and property. 
                    The case is the same as if horses had 
                    been thrown overboard. 

    We pick out VASSA. 

                                  GARROW
                    My lord my learned friend is not 
                    allowing the prisoner to speak in his 
                    own defence he is addressing the Jury 
                    in how they should feel.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Mr Silvester - refrain. And Captain 
                      Collingwood - if you will?

      COLLINGWOOD speaks in his own defence.

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    It was NOT the case that the slaves were 
                    thrown overboard in order to throw the 
                    loss onto the underwriters. Do you not 
                    think the apprehension of necessity 
                    justified when my crew themselves suffered 
                    so severely? Seven out of seventeen died 
                    on their way to Jamaica or after their 
                    arrival there. The cargo of the ship and 
                    its crew died from want of sustenance. 
                    They did not die from want of a commander!

      COLLINGWOOD s words in his own defence have struck a chord with 
    the Jury.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Mr Garrow? 

                                  GARROW
                    Captain Collingwood - you were, until 
                    you took this command, a slave ship 
                    surgeon?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    Eleven voyages as doctor.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  51.


                                  GARROW
                    But none of them as Captain of a 
                    slaver?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    No.

                                  GARROW
                    Your inexperience did not trouble you?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    Nor the owners of the ship. In fact they 
                    were reassured that the welfare of all 
                    those on ship would be safeguarded by my 
                    previous experience.

      GARROW, disgusted irony:

                                  GARROW
                     The welfare of all those on ship . 
                    (beat) After your wrong identification 
                    of Jamaica for Hispaniola and the 
                    necessity of sailing back three 
                    hundred miles to the windward, what 
                    did you do?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    I chose to hold a consultation with 
                    the crew subsequently.

                                  GARROW
                    And what decision taken?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    To destroy part of the slaves and to 
                    put the rest and the crew to short 
                    allowance.

                                  GARROW
                    That is how you  rectified  your 
                    mistake?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    To save the ship!

                                  GARROW
                    Because the situation had become 
                      catastrophic?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    Yes.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  51A.


                                  GARROW
                    The ship retarded by perils of the sea? 
                    The strong currents hindering your 
                    already belated journey to Jamaica. A 
                    state of emergency no less?                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  52.


                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    Sufficient for the throwing over to be 
                    a necessity.

                                  GARROW
                    So presumably you seized the goods 
                    nearest to hand?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    I beg your pardon?

                                  GARROW
                    In the dire circumstances in which you 
                    found yourself you jettisoned at 
                    random?

      COLLINGWOOD hesitates, not sure how to answer. 

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    No...

                                  GARROW
                    Then who did you choose first? The 
                    women and children? The sick? Those 
                    who would sell for least money?

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    We were in want of water! The 
                    healthiest would need least, would  
                    survive best on short allowance.

      It s a good response.

                                  GARROW
                    The healthiest also fetching the best 
                    price at market? Was that not the only 
                    real necessity here?! Not that you were 
                    in want of water but that you were in 
                    want of the market! And you decided, as 
                    the fastidious servant of your 
                    shareholders to get rid of any slave 
                    you deemed to fetch a price of less 
                    than the cost of insuring them!

                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    I am a fastidious servant, sir. Of my 
                    ship.

                                  GARROW
                    If you are so fastidious what became 
                    of the ship s log?                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  52A.


                                  CAPTAIN COLLINGWOOD
                    Left with the agent in Jamaica. Now 
                    lost.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  53.


                                  GARROW
                    How convenient.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Anything else Mr Garrow?

                                  GARROW
                    No my Lord.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Then we shall adjourn until tomorrow.

    We pick out MELVILLE close to HILL:

                                  LORD MELVILLE
                    It may be possible that you have it in 
                    your power to ruin the preening Garrow 
                    entirely.

      HILL bitterly ironic:

                                  HILL
                    I may employ a pistol.

                                  LORD MELVILLE
                    You do not have to challenge him a duel 
                    to seek your satisfaction. Aim at him in 
                    another way. Undo Garrow the man and we 
                    shall see the noisome barrister removed 
                    from the Old Bailey.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  54.


      GARROW aware that MELVILLE and HILL are talking about him.

                                                              CUT TO:


      GARROW with STUBBS journal, looking feverishly. He comes across 
      a page - curled up and yellow - where STUBBS stopped his entries 
    and the ink has run. GARROW knows that it s not what s written 
      that s important but the journal itself. 

                                                              CUT TO:


    The next day. HILL, MELVILLE, FARMER closeted together.

                                  FARMER
                    The writ is already drawn.

      MELVILLE to HILL:

                                  LORD MELVILLE
                    On your behalf I took that liberty.

                                  HILL
                    And so it merely needs serving?

      SOUTHOUSE and GARROW walk in. SOUTHOUSE brushing off rain.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Foul weather.

                                  GARROW
                    I could not hope for better.

      SOUTHOUSE looking at him uncertainly. GARROW, aware of the 
       confederation  closeted together. 

                                  GARROW
                    Who is the man with Hill and Melville?

      SOUTHOUSE sees Farmerfor the first time. They share a look. *
      They recogniseeachother.*                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  54A.


                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    It is of no matter.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  55.


      SOUTHOUSE indicates KELSALL - waiting in the corridor - to 
      GARROW. It s also a way of deflecting GARROWfrom FARMER. *
      SOUTHOUSE goes and sits beside KELSALL. GARROW suspicious.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    You know you are not bound to be character 
                    witness for Captain Collingwood.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I know I choose it.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Come, be honest, the owners of the 
                    Zong choose it.

      KELSALL doesn t respond. We pick out COLLINGWOOD, watching this 
      from the dock. Clearly not happy.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    The muster roll of the ship. It is 
                    your late nephew s name alongside you. 
                    Daniel was his name?

      KELSALL - this is raw, hard.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I had made assurances to my sister of 
                    his welfare.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And hard to bear knowing he may still 
                    be alive but for Collingwood s 
                    command. Was that the cause of your 
                    dispute?

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    No.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    No? Daniel s unnecessary death did not 
                    distress and vex you? Or was it  that 
                    there had already been so many 
                      unnecessary deaths?

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I cannot answer you!

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I was not in attendance when my wife 
                    died. I was engaged in some case of 
                    theft. I should have been at her bed 
                    but she left this place alone. And I 
                    did drink to forget that. 
                                  (MORE)                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  55A.

                                  SOUTHOUSE (cont'd)
                    But Mr Kelsall you have an opportunity 
                    to attend to your nephew again. If you 
                    think the truth to suffice.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  56.


      KELSALL doesn t respond - because he finds it too hard to. 
      SOUTHOUSE leaves him and approaches GARROW.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    Kelsall is in some difficulty...

      GARROW looking at SOUTHOUSE, sees that he s troubled by 
        something(MELVILLE, HILL, FARMER).

                                  GARROW
                    And are you?

      SOUTHOUSE shaking his head, a half smile.

                                  COURT CLERK (V.O)
                    The court session is resumed!

                                                              CUT TO:


      SILVESTER is examining KELSALL or rather listening to him speak 
    of COLLINGWOOD.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I have served with Mr Collingwood when 
                    he was ships surgeon and under him 
                    when he was Captain.

                                  SILVESTER
                    And your opinion of him Mr Kelsall?

      KELSALL, not entirely convinced in his response - or convincing. 
    He looks nervously at COLLINGWOOD in the dock.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    Captain Collingwood is an able man and 
                    a good commander.

                                  SILVESTER
                    And an honest one?

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I am...I am sure of it.

      GARROW stands up to cross examine KELSALL.

                                  GARROW
                    My Lord, if I may...?

      GARROW, taking in the  conspirators  beside BULLER at the bench 
    and then up in the public gallery - the GILBERTS and VASSA. He 
      won t flinch from his duty.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  56A.


                                  GARROW
                     An honest man ? As you are Mr Kelsall?                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  57.


                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    I should like to think so.

                                  GARROW
                    Did you have cause to dispute with 
                    Captain Collingwood on any occasion?

      KELSALL, not keen to answer, hesitates.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    There was none.

                                  GARROW
                    I remind you you are under oath Mr. 
                    Kelsall. (beat) Did you think Captain 
                      Collingwood s misidentification of 
                    Jamaica for Hispaniola a  mere  
                    mistake, an unavoidable accident?

      SILVESTER, objecting:

                                  SILVESTER
                    My Lord, Mr Kelsall is here to bear 
                    witness to Captain Collingwood s 
                      character....!

                                  GARROW
                    My Lord, this is pertinent..

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                      Allowed.(beat) Answer the question.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    The mistake having been made Captain 
                      Collingwood took measures as 
                      Commander...there were only five and a 
                    half Dutch butts, 3 full of sweet 
                    water, enough for only 4 days. Hence 
                    the jettisoning. And everyone put on 
                    short allowance.

                                  GARROW
                    And for some sickly members of the crew - 
                    like your nephew - that proved a fatal 
                      development did it not?

                                  SILVESTER
                    My Lord what is this to do with the 
                    character of Captain Collingwood?!

                                  GARROW
                    I am trying to get at Mr Kelsall s 
                    proper estimation of the man!                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  57A.


                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Then ask a question that demonstrates 
                    it.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  58.


                                  GARROW
                    Did you feel Captain Collingwood s 
                    actions  were ultimately responsible for 
                    the death of your nephew? Was that the 
                    reason for the dispute you will not own 
                    to, is that the reason you were 
                    suspended as first mate?!

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    It was none of that!

                                  GARROW
                    Then what was it?! What was it you 
                    found so hard to take, that you could 
                    not contemplate?!

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    Sir...

                                  GARROW
                    Some change? Some change that made all 
                    the difference Mr Kelsall....

      Pause. KELSALL, making a decision to tell the truth regardless 
    of the scrutiny of COLLINGWOOD.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    It rained sir. It rained.

                                  GARROW
                            (Rhetorical. For the Court) 
                    It rained.

      This revelation electrifies the court. See COLLINGWOOD - he 
      knows it s disaster.

                                  JAMES KELSALL
                    A Heavy downfall on 30th November. We 
                    collected hundreds of gallons of 
                    rainwater. But despite this, on 1st 
                    December, more slaves were thrown 
                    overboard. That was the reason Captain 
                      Collingwood suspended me as First 
                    mate. Because I would not go along 
                    with it. There was no need to throw 
                    over any more blacks. There was no 
                    want of water.

    We pick out VASSA looking on, saddened at the emergence of this 
    but heartened by its emergence all the same. SILVESTER, needing 
      somehow to rescue the case.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  58A.


                                  SILVESTER
                    My Lord, I wish the jury and the Court 
                    to note that this witness may have 
                    perjured himself and therefore any 
                      evidence...                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  59.


                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    How so Mr Silvester?

                                  SILVESTER
                    He describes Captain Collingwood as an 
                    able commander and then condemns him!

                                  GARROW
                    My Lord I would submit that Mr Kelsall 
                    does not perjure himself. Captain 
                      Collingwood IS an able commander. If, 
                    as the Captain of a slaver his duty 
                    was to make a profit. He  did so - by 
                    ridding himself of slaves unlikely to 
                    fetch what they were insured for or 
                    were simply unrecoverable. In that he 
                    has been most able.

      GARROW, at this final flourish, cannot resist looking defiantly 
    in the direction of HILL and MELVILLE.

                                                              CUT TO:


      JUDGE BULLER in his summing up to the jury.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    It is certainly worthy of observation 
                    that our Legislature can every session 
                    find time to enquire into and regulate 
                    the manner of killing a partridge, 
                    that no abuse should be committed and 
                    that he should be fairly shot yet... 
                    Well we shall let that be. And I am 
                    not required to direct you on the 
                    slaves as goods but merely whether 
                    these goods were jettisoned 
                      voluntarily or in necessity. That the 
                    claim of necessity was false and 
                    fraudulent if they were indeed thrown 
                    over after the rain. About which you 
                    must decide.

    As the JURY confer and deliberate, MELVILLE shoots a look of  
      displeasure at BULLER.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  60.




                                  COURT CLERK
                    You have reached a verdict.

                                  JURY FOREMAN
                    We have.

                                  COURT CLERK
                    And how do you find the prisoner on 
                    the indictment - guilty or not guilty?

                                  JURY FOREMAN
                    Guilty.

      GARROW looks immediately to VASSA who reacts with some 
      satisfaction. THEN:

                                  JURY FOREMAN
                    But we humbly make recommendations to 
                    mercy My Lord.

      VASSA shakes his head in dismay.

    The GILBERTS approach the bench (from the public gallery)

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    My Lord. We also wish to make a 
                      recommendation to mercy. Liverpool 
                    Assurance do not wish to take a 
                    ...moral position in this action.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    We were only ever in the business of 
                      recompense.

      Pause.

                                  JUDGE BULLER
                    Very well. Captain Collingwood I 
                    sentence you to two years 
                      imprisonment. You will be put on a 
                    Hulk ship.

      SILVESTER looks to GARROW. He s pleased at the outcome. GARROW 
      solemn. BULLER leans into MELVILLE.

                                  JUDGE BULLER (QUIETLY)
                    The law will not do your bidding. Or 
                    confound Mr Garrow for you.

                                  LORD MELVILLE (SHARP)
                    I do not need the law when I have the 
                    consent of decent Englishmen.                           GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  61.


      GARROW approaching VASSA who is bitterly disappointed, 
      disgusted.

                                  GUSTAVUS VASSA
                    A man who made a massacre on board a 
                    ship will now simply languish on one 
                    for a short time? A Man who showed no 
                    mercy now receives the mercy of his 
                    English peers?

                                  GARROW
                    There was but twelve men there. Not a 
                    country. And I hope the country will 
                    make its own verdict.

                                                              CUT TO:


      SOUTHOUSE and GARROW are being thanked by the GILBERTS.

                                  HUGH GILBERT
                    Very satisfactory Mr Garrow, very 
                      satisfactory.

                                  GARROW
                    You are easily satisfied I think.

      PETER GILBERT picking up on GARROW s tone:

                                  PETER GILBERT
                    Is not fraud discouraged here?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    And murder also I would venture.

    He and GARROW turn away from them. The GILBERTS look on and at 
      each other.

                                  GARROW
                    You are no longer mindful of your 
                      opportunities in the North?

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I am too mindful of how I have 
                    scraped, bowed and pleased these last 
                    few weeks.                        GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  61A.


      GARROW smiles.                          GL2 Episode 1. BLUE PAGES 9TH JULY 2010  62.


                                  GARROW
                    It is even less pretty than when you 
                    are curmudgeonly.

      SOUTHOUSE, mock aggrieved.

                                  SOUTHOUSE
                    I know nothing of that.

      They laugh. GARROW is approached by FARMER.*

                                  FARMER
                    William Garrow?

                                  GARROW
                    You have business with me sir?

                                  FARMER
                    You are served with a writ from the 
                    Court of Kings Bench. In the name of 
                    an action for damages by Sir Arthur 
                    for the act of Criminal Conversation 
                    with the plaintiff s wife.

      GARROW looks to SOUTHOUSE. HILL, MELVILLE look on with grim *
      satisfaction as FARMER goes to join them. GARROW wondering what 
    is about to befall him.
