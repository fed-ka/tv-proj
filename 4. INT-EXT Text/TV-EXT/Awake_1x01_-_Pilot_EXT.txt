      A gentle slope. The city shimmers like a postcard below. 
      Peaceful. Calm. SILENT. Perfect. Then-

      SCREECHING TIRES. Suddenly a CAR COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE 
      FRAME, a flipping blur of flying metal and BREAKING GLASS.

      And then it s gone. Everything s still, just as we found it.

                                  DR. LEE (V.O.)
                    So, tell me how it works.

      ANGLE ON the wrecked car. CLOSE ON the eyes of MARK BRITTEN, 
        unconscious, hanging upside down by his seatbelt. We can hear 
      the WHEELS STILL SPINNING helplessly in the air.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    I don t know. I close my eyes. I 
                    open them. Just like you.

      Very slowly pull back from his eyes until we see other 
      passengers in the car: 

      HIS WIFE (HANNAH BRITTEN) and a TEENAGE SON (REX BRITTEN) - 
      more on them in a moment. They re also hanging from their 
      seatbelts, bloody and unconscious.

                                  DR. LEE (V.O.)
                    Let s just start at the beginning.

      Suddenly, Britten s eyes flutter open. He looks around. As he 
      takes in his wife and son hanging from their belts- 

                                                                          SMASH TO:



      Britten, suit and tie, steps through barricades holding back 
      a crowd.

      As he does, DET. RICHARD VEGA, 30 s, gregarious, the type of 
      person who talks to strangers in elevators, steps over.

      He s the only one who seems excited to be at a murder scene.

                                  VEGA
                    Detective Britten! Over here.

                                  DR. LEE (V.O.)
                    And they ve got you working with a 
                    partner?

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    New guy. Vega. They just want 
                    someone to hold my hand until they 
                    know I m okay.



      There s a cab with a shattered window, a DEAD DRIVER slumped 
      behind the wheel.

      Vega walks Britten through the scene like a tour guide with a 
      slight case of nerves. He refers heavily to his notes.

                                  VEGA
                    So... the driver picked up a fare 
                    downtown, registered this address 
                    with dispatch. Um, he s still got 
                    his wallet, and there s a twenty on 
                    the seat beside him, so I think not 
                    only was it not a robbery, it looks 
                    like the fare was actually paid. 
                    Then, either the rider or someone 
                    else puts a gun to the window, 
                    BOOM, BOOM, BOOM... leaves us this 
                    messy little mystery.

                                    BRITTEN
                      Witnesses?

      Vega nods proudly. He s on that. He motions to an OFFICER who 
      brings over a WITNESS, knit cap, 30 s, skinny, very polite.                                                                                      3.


                                  VEGA
                    Okay, so I ve interviewed about 
                    thirty. Basically everybody came 
                    out of the bar when it happened. 
                    But this guy lives in the apartment 
                    building above it, saw from his 
                    window.

                                    WITNESS
                    After I heard the shots I looked 
                    out, saw a man in a cowboy hat run 
                    that way, up the block, and then 
                    turn into that alley.

                                  VEGA
                    Thanks. I ll let you know if I have 
                    other questions.

      The Officer leads the witness away. As he goes-

                                    WITNESS
                    Happy to help.

      Vega turns to Britten.

                                  VEGA
                    Exact same report from the bar 
                      witnesses, just a little more chaos 
                    on the ground. Guy in a cowboy hat 
                    running away, but no one close and 
                    no one who claims to have seen the 
                    shooting.

                                    BRITTEN
                    What do we know about the driver?

      Back to his notes.

                                  VEGA
                    Right. Driver. Married. No kids. 
                      Dispatcher says he wasn t the type 
                    to get in an argument. At this 
                    point nothing really suggests he 
                    should be dead except for the fact 
                    that he is.

      Britten surveys the scene. Looks past the crowds at the 
      barricades and notices the building across the street.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Building looks like it s got a 
                    secured front door. Let s see if 
                    they ve got a camera on it. Might 
                    have caught something we can use.

      Vega smiles, stares at him a beat.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  VEGA
                    I just, um... want to thank you.                                                                                      4.


                                    BRITTEN
                    For what?

                                  VEGA
                    I got passed over for detective 
                    three times before this assignment. 
                    I m pretty sure I only got the 
                    boost because you requested me. I 
                    just wanted you to know I, uh... I 
                    won t disappoint you.

      Britten s starts away.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I didn t request anyone. If you got 
                    promoted it s because they didn t 
                    want to waste anyone else s time 
                      baby-sitting me.

      As Vega takes that in-

                                  DR. LEE (V.O.)
                    And then what?

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    I go home.



      Britten and Vega step through the large crowds to find a cab 
      driven up on the curb and into a pole outside a bustling 
      outdoor shopping mall, driver slumped behind the wheel.

      As they take it in, an OFFICER steps up, gestures.                                                                                    12.


                                    OFFICER
                    Cab pulls up. Door opens. Three 
                    loud bangs. Everyone scatters, the 
                    driver manages to run up on the 
                    sidewalk until he smacks into this 
                    pole.

      He turns back to the crowds of people. 

                                    OFFICER (CONT D)
                    Everyone reports seeing an 
                      overweight man, heavy beard, 
                    glasses, some kind of ball cap, 
                    walking away from the scene. Heads 
                    straight into the crowd and then... 
                      disappears. 

      Bird steps up.

                                  BIRD
                    No heros today boys, just a hundred 
                    something witnesses who can t wait 
                    to tell you their story. Over and 
                    over and over.

      He tears some sheets out of his notebook, hands them to 
      Britten with a smile.

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    Still happy you came back?

      As Bird goes Britten stares at him. It s weird, switching 
      partners. Vega doesn t seem sorry to see Bird go.

                                  VEGA
                          (muttering)
                    Burnout.

      Off Britten s look-

                                  VEGA (CONT D)
                    Sorry. Just... I work my ass off to 
                    get the same job he sleepwalks 
                    through.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Maybe he just knows where to spend 
                    his energy.

      Britten turns back to the cab, follows a line of sight to the 
      top of a pole across the way. On top- a camera. 

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Wanna take a guess what we re going 
                    to see?



      Britten and Bird stand outside of a house. There s a CAR in 
      the street surrounded by OFFICERS and TECHS.

                                  DR. LEE (V.O.)
                    Because dreams aren t meant to be 
                      sustained. When we pull at the 
                    threads they tend to fall apart. 

      As Britten watches, VEGA GETS INTO A CAR DOWN THE BLOCK.

                                  DR. LEE  (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Your partners are threads. And once 
                    we start to pull on them, I think 
                    we can help you see the truth.

      Vega shoots Britten a brief glimpse from the car, then drives 
      away. Britten stares after him.

      The sound of Bird KNOCKING on the house s door snaps Britten 
      back to the task at hand. An UPPER MIDDLE CLASS HOUSEWIFE 
      opens the door.

                                  BIRD
                    Ma am. Detectives Freeman and 
                    Britten. We re working the Baker 
                    homicides down the street.
                          (beat)
                    We re told you noted this car in 
                    the area yesterday?

      He indicates the car crawling with officers and techs.

                                  HOUSEWIFE
                    Yes. We re all pretty close on the 
                    street. You kind of have a sense of 
                    what people drive. It just didn t 
                    look like it... fit.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Did you see anyone in or around the 
                    car?

                                  HOUSEWIFE
                    No. Is it involved in the case?                                                                                    17.


                                  BIRD
                    It s a stolen vehicle. It s 
                    possible the suspect used it to get 
                    into the area and then left it.

                                    BRITTEN
                    When did you notice the vehicle?

                                  HOUSEWIFE
                          (thinking)
                      I guess... around five.

      This raises eyebrows.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Are you sure?

                                  HOUSEWIFE
                    Yes. My husband had just texted me 
                    he was on his way home. I could 
                    check the text for the exact time 
                    if you want.

                                  BIRD
                    Why don t you do that.

      As she disappears the detectives eye one another, thinking.

                                    BRITTEN
                    The father made a call from inside 
                    the house at 5:30. 

                                  BIRD
                    Mom s car was confirmed home by 6.

                                    BRITTEN
                    And time of death was around 9. So 
                    that means we ve got the suspect in 
                    the area for almost four hours with 
                    both of his victims home before he 
                    actually strikes. 
                          (beat)
                    When did the girl get dropped off?

      Bird s already thinking the same thing.

                                  BIRD
                    Close to 8:45.

      Everything clicks in a way Britten was hoping it wouldn t.

                                    BRITTEN
                    If he just wanted to rob a couple 
                    of rich people he had all the time 
                    in the world. He didn t want money.
                          (looking at Bird)
                    He was after the girl all along.


                                    END OF ACT I                                                                                    18.


                                        ACT II



      Britten sits in the bleachers. It s not a packed house, but 
      there s a fair number of people for a tennis match.

      On the court Rex tosses up a ball and whips a blistering 
      serve right past his opponent. Britten smiles, CLAPS.                                                                                    19.


      Suddenly, Rex s COACH (TARA) slides in next to Britten.

                                  TARA
                    After two years playing football I 
                    didn t expect him to end up in the 
                    final.

      Britten looks over at her. 30 s, long, slender, like someone 
      who not only plays a sport for a living, but does it well. 
      She extends her hand.

                                  TARA (CONT D)
                    Tara. I m the coach.

                                    BRITTEN
                          (shakes her hand)
                    Right.

      As Rex wins another point-

                                  TARA
                    He s exceptionally talented.

      Britten CLAPS, keeps his eyes on Rex.

                                    BRITTEN
                    He had a very good teacher.

                                  TARA
                          (genuine)
                    I m so sorry. She was an amazing 
                    person.

      Britten looks at her, nods.

                                  TARA (CONT D)
                    You know, we used to play doubles 
                    together. She could have played 
                      professionally.

                                    BRITTEN
                    You think so?

                                  TARA
                    I did, and she was always better 
                    than me. I think the grind just 
                    didn t appeal to her.

                                    BRITTEN
                    But it appealed to you?

                                  TARA
                    Thought it would be more winning 
                    Wimbledon and less qualifying in 
                    New Jersey.

      Britten smiles. A beat.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I m not sure what he s doing out 
                    there to be honest. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    20.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT'D)
                    I know it s been hard on him, but 
                    he doesn t really tell me much. His 
                    mom was the one he talked to. 

                                  TARA
                    We ve talked about it a little.

                                    BRITTEN
                          (surprised, a little hurt)
                    Really?

                                  TARA
                          (easing the blow)
                    Sometimes it s just easier for boys 
                    to talk to a woman about that kind 
                    of stuff.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I ve tried. I just... my job makes 
                    it hard to be around. And the work 
                    is like learning another language. 
                    At some point I think I forgot how 
                    to have conversations that weren t 
                    evidence, suspect, motive. 
                          (beat)
                    What... what s he say?

                                  TARA
                    Nothing you don t know. He misses 
                    her a lot. This helps him miss her 
                    a little less.

      Rex wins another point. They both CLAP.

                                  TARA (CONT D)
                    Match point. If he wins this easily 
                    after a long layoff I may never get 
                    him to practice.

      Rex throws the ball up and absolutely HAMMERS it over the 
      net. The other player doesn t even move. Game, set, match.

      Britten, Tara, and the other spectators CLAP and CHEER. But 
      REX JUST STANDS THERE, staring over the net. Then-

      He simply falls to his knees and begins CRYING. Not victory 
      tears. Kid who s lost his mom tears. 

      Britten and Tara rush to him. But as they get close, it s 
      TARA THAT REX GRABS FOR. He wraps himself around her and 
      CRIES into her shoulder. 

      Britten stands watching, helpless.



      It s drizzling. Bird is standing under an umbrella by a BMW 
      as TECHS crawl around it taking pictures.

      Britten reaches him, looks inside the car, dried blood all 
      over the seats. Bird motions to the passenger side, points 
      out blood on the ground. 

                                  BIRD
                    When they got here they said that 
                    was still fresh. 

      He hands Britten some photos of the same scene, but from 
      earlier, when the daylight was just fading. He points to the 
      blood trail.

                                  BIRD (CONT'D)
                    Drizzle makes it hard to say, but 
                    they think we missed him by less 
                    than 45 minutes.

      Britten looks around. They re at the edge of a large and 
      intermittently populated parking lot.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I don t suppose anyone saw 
                    anything.

                                  BIRD
                    Nope. And no cameras. But the 
                    stolen car we found in the 
                      neighborhood was taken less than a 
                    mile from here.

                                    BRITTEN
                    So he drives his car to this lot, 
                    walks off and steals one to get to 
                    the girl s house. Kills her 
                    parents, abducts her, and then 
                    comes back here and ditches the 
                    family BMW for his vehicle. 
                          (walking along the car)
                    If you re going to move a 
                      kidnapping victim from one car to 
                    another, you probably don t park 
                    far away.

      He looks at the number on the parking space that the BMW is 
      in. 589. He looks at the space right next to it. 590.                                                                                    24.


                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    So we need someone who can tell us 
                    about the car parked in space 590 
                    for the last day and a half. Let s 
                    pull the plates on all these cars, 
                    see if anyone remembers it.

      Bird nods. Britten eyes the photos again. Notices something.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    We should also try to figure out 
                    who was in this space directly 
                    behind 590. 611. 

                                  BIRD
                    Why?

      Britten shows him the photo.

                                    BRITTEN
                    It s got a dry spot that the rain 
                    hadn t covered about the same size 
                    as the one in 590. So they probably 
                    left around the same time. If 
                    anyone s going to have seen 
                    anything or remember what was in 
                    space 590 it s probably whoever was 
                    in 611.
                          (re: blood on the ground)
                    We find any of the girl s blood in 
                    the house?

                                  BIRD 
                    Just the parents.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Well, if this was fresh it 
                    certainly didn t belong to them. So 
                    either she s somehow gotten our 
                    killer bleeding-

      They share a look.

                                  BIRD
                    Or we don t have a lot of time.



      Britten and the officer run down the deserted alley. They 
      stop, unsure which way to pursue. 

      Britten spots a side entrance to the office building.



      Britten and Vega are looking at the madhouse of police and 
      spectators surrounding the murder scene outside the station.

                                  VEGA
                    Should I take statements again?

                                    BRITTEN
                          (shakes his head)
                    They saw what I saw: someone in 
                    disguise who got away with murder. 
                    The tapes, the witnesses, he likes 
                    that we have everything and still 
                    end up with nothing. Makes him feel 
                    smarter than us. Invisible.
                          (a thought)
                    Where would you go if you were 
                      invisible?

                                  VEGA
                    I m going to take the 5th on that.

      Britten stares into the crowd.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I bet you wouldn t be able to 
                    resist admiring your own handiwork.

       He turns, walking toward the department. Vega follows.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    Once he ditches the disguise, he 
                    could stand in that crowd all day 
                    and we d never know it. 
                          (beat)
                    We pull the security tapes from all 
                    three scenes, but let them run 
                    through the hours after the murder. 
                    Maybe we get a face that pops up in 
                    all three crowds.



      Britten and Vega stand outside the restaurant where the first 
      cab driver murder took place, Britten s hand bandaged. He 
      still looks a little frayed.

                                  VEGA
                    You sure you re okay?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Can you just let me think?

                                  VEGA
                    Can you at least tell me what we re 
                    looking for? Maybe I can help.

                                    BRITTEN
                    I m not sure.

                                  VEGA
                    Then... why are we here?

      Dismissive-

                                    BRITTEN
                    I had a dream about it.
                          (to himself)
                    Or I m having a dream about it.

                                  VEGA
                    What?

                                    BRITTEN
                    Nothing. Will you just-

                                  VEGA
                    We ve still got partial face 
                    matches from the tapes to look 
                    over. There re witnesses to 
                    interview from the scene outside 
                    the station. There s-

      Britten looks up at the side of the building. The big 
      numerals 611 stare back at him.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Shh!

      Britten focuses on the numbers, waiting for them to tell him 
      something. Then he notices-

      The windows of the apartment building just above them. He 
      squints at the windows, then down the street. A thought.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    The witness.

                                  VEGA
                    What?                                                                                    49.


                                    BRITTEN
                    The witness from the 611 building. 
                    He said the killer ran up the 
                    street, around that corner and into 
                    the alley.

                                  VEGA
                          (exasperated)
                    All the witnesses said that. That s 
                    what the security tape shows. 
                    That s what happened.

      Britten looks back at the numbers.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Did anyone actually go to the guy s 
                      apartment? Look out his window?

                                  VEGA
                    Why? I just told you. Everyone had 
                    the same story.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Because if you re looking out of 
                    that building, there s no way you 
                    can see around that corner. From 
                    the ground you could have seen the 
                    killer go up that alley. But from 
                    up there there s no way you know 
                    that unless-

                                  VEGA
                          (Holy shit)
                    You happened to be the one who 
                    actually did it.

      Britten looks at Vega.

                                    BRITTEN
                    He likes to feel smart? Invisible? 
                    What s going to make you feel more 
                    invisible than actually talking to 
                    the detectives trying to catch you?

      They both stare up at the windows of the apartment building.



      Britten hits the street, spots the Hasid bolting up the 
      block. Britten breaks into a dead sprint, not willing to miss 
      his man a second time.

      Britten makes up ground. The Hasid seems to be slowing when-

      Suddenly, the Hasid stops, turns, gun drawn. Britten freezes, 
      his own weapon still in its holster. Then in a FLASH-

      TWO SHOTS. The Hasid goes down. Britten turns to see Vega a 
      hundred feet behind, gun drawn.

      They move in on the downed body. On the ground the hat and 
      hair have gone slightly askew revealing not only that it is 
      indeed the witness, but his red hair underneath.



      Britten and Vega are now surrounded by other officers, the 
      coroner, onlookers.  

      As the body is loaded into the rear of an ambulance-

      Britten just stares at the address on the outside of the 
      building. 611 Waverly.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten stands staring at space 611, case file in his hand.

      Bird stands behind him, sipping coffee.

                                  BIRD
                    Britten, you ve been staring at the 
                    pavement for the last hour. I think 
                    it s told you what it knows.

      Britten shakes his head, in his own little world.

                                    BRITTEN
                    This has to be it.

                                  BIRD
                    The blood trail led right to the 
                    car in 590. Why does it matter what 
                    was parked in 611? Don t you think 
                    if they d have seen anything, like, 
                    say, a bleeding little girl being 
                    forced out of one car and into 
                    another, we d have heard from them?                                                                                    51.


      Britten thinks about that. He opens the file, looks at the 
      photos of the scene again. The back to back dry spots in 
      space 590 and 611.

      And then it hits him.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Oh my God. 611. That s what it was 
                    trying to tell me. It was in 611.

      He drops everything else, holds the picture close.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    We had it backwards.

      Bird steps over.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    There was no car in 590.

                                  BIRD
                    But the blood trail-

      Britten points to the photo. 

                                    BRITTEN
                    These two cars didn t leave at 
                    about the same time. They left at 
                    EXACTLY the same time.

      He points to a little thread of dry pavement between the dry 
      spaces where the cars were parked.

                                    BRITTEN (CONT D)
                    See that little strip of dry 
                    pavement. That means there was 
                    something above it. Something 
                      connecting whatever was in these 
                    two spaces.

                                  BIRD
                          (getting it)
                    A tow hitch.

                                    BRITTEN
                    It wasn t a car in 590. It was a 
                    camper or something else he could 
                    stick her in. The car was in 611. 

      OFF Bird-



      Britten and Bird spot a camper attached to a truck parked by 
      an idyllic looking little lake. They move toward it 
      carefully, guns drawn.



      CLOSE ON Britten waking up, bloody, hanging from his 
      seatbelt.

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    No.



      Britten is taken in one ambulance as his wife and son, still 
      unconscious are put into another.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Police everywhere, ambulance, reporters. Bird steps next to 
      Britten. They see the GIRL with officers.

                                  BIRD
                    She says he kept talking about 
                    marrying her. That the Lord had 
                    brought them together.
                          (long beat)
                    So, the red hair. The obsession 
                    with that parking space. They re 
                    going to ask how you put all that 
                    together.

                                    BRITTEN
                    Right.
                          (a beat)
                    Can we call it a hunch for now?

      Bird looks at him.

                                  BIRD
                    I ve been a cop for thirty years. 
                    Only seen hunches on TV. But for 
                    now... okay, we go with hunch.                                                                                    58.


      We see the Girl being led into an ambulance.

                                    BRITTEN
                    What happens to her?

                                  BIRD
                    She goes to an aunt or something. 
                    I m not sure she even understands 
                    what s happened yet.

      As they watch the ambulance doors close behind the girl-

                                  BIRD (CONT D)
                    Remember when you used to think 
                    solved and fixed meant the same 
                    thing?

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and HANNAH are in black, surrounded by mourners. 

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    - yes, I still see both my wife and 
                    my son.                                                                                    59.


      Hannah leans on him SOBBING as a casket is lowered into the 
      ground.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten and REX are in black, surrounded by mourners. 

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    But I ve also watched each of them 
                    lowered into the ground.

      REX WEEPS as the casket descends.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Britten sits alone in the stands watching Rex practicing 
        relentlessly with his coach TARA. 

                                    BRITTEN (V.O.)
                    So if you re telling me that the 
                    price of being able to see them, to 
                    feel them, to have them, is my 
                    sanity-

      After crushing a forehand that sends Tara sprawling, Rex 
      looks up at his father, smiles.

                                                                            CUT TO:
