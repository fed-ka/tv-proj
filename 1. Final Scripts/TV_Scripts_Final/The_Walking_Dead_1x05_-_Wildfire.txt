      FADE IN:

      No clue where we are. A dark, mysterious shot:

      TIGHT ANGLE: The back of a MAN'S (Jenner's) head rises into 
      shot, rimmed by top-light. He brings a breather helmet to his 
      unseen face, slips it on over his head.

      As he tightens the enclosures at the back, a VOICE speaks 
      from everywhere and nowhere, soothing and surreal:

                                  VOX
                    Good morning, Dr. Jenner.

                                  JENNER
                    Good morning, Vox.

                                  VOX
                    How are you feeling this morning?

                                  JENNER
                    A bit restless, I have to admit, 
                    Vox. A bit...well...off my game. 
                    Somewhat off-kilter.

                                  VOX
                    That's understandable.

                                  JENNER
                    Is it? I suppose it is. I fear I'm 
                    losing perspective on things. On 
                    what constitutes kilter versus off-
                    kilter.

                                  VOX
                      I sympathize.

      EDWIN JENNER turns to camera, his BUBBLE FACE-SHIELD kicking 
      glare from the overhead lighting, the inside of his mask 
      fogging badly and obscuring his face, as:

                                  JENNER
                    Vox, you cannot sympathize. Don't 
                    patronize me, please. It messes 
                    with my head. Neither of us can 
                    afford that.

                                  VOX
                    Of course. I apologize.

      Jenner shrugs into a high-tech OXYGEN HARNESS, as:  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 2.


                                  JENNER
                    How about some music?

                                  VOX
                    Please specify your selection.

                                  JENNER
                          (thinks a moment)
                    Play her favorite. You know the 
                    one.

      Beat. MUSIC FLOODS IN: "TOP OF THE WORLD" by the Carpenters, 
      leading with its sweet country-western guitar intro... 

      He connects the harness hose into the helmet socket, sets the 
      air flow. Oxygen HISSES into the helmet, dissipates the 
      breath-fog. We see his face clearly for the first time: 

      He looks gaunt, hollow-eyed, chronically exhausted.

      KAREN CARPENTER'S VOCAL joins in. Jenner smiles, bends 
      briefly out of frame, comes back up with a BIG GNARLY 
      CHAINSAW, taking a moment to appreciate the music.

                                  JENNER (CONT D)
                    What an amazing voice Karen 
                    Carpenter had. 

      He yanks the cord, FIRES UP THE CHAINSAW: BRAAAAAAAAAP!

      INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - DAY

      Jenner exits the prep room and stalks up the hall, REVVING 
      HIS CHAINSAW... 

      Other than the breather helmet, he's wearing only boxer 
      shorts, tatty robe, and cowboy boots...

      The song is flooding the facility with Karen Carpenter's pure 
      voice and those soaring violin overdubs...

      INT. STAFF REC ROOM - DAY

      Designed with the idea that staff might be forced to occupy 
      this facility long-term: there's a bar, arcade games, ping-
      pong table, small karaoke stage, baby grand piano.

      Jenner enters the open doorway, shouts over the chainsaw 
      noise at the seemingly empty room:

                                  JENNER
                    YOU DON'T GET TO MOCK ME ANYMORE! 
                    NO MORE HIDING IN HERE ALL DAY 
                    WHILE I DO ALL THE DAMN WORK!   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 3.


      He turns, rams the chainsaw laterally through the doorjamb, 
      spewing splinters and drywall dust into the air...

      OUTSIDE THE ROOM (JENNER UNSEEN)

      The Carpenters' tune plays on, lovely and sweet, as:

      The CHAINSAW RIPS THE WALL TO SHREDS from the other side, 
      kicking so much drywall dust that it's hard to see.

      Horizontal swaths of wall get carved away from the doorframe 
      outward, destroying the wall in both directions, forming a 
      strange (though somewhat familiar) shape...

      The chainsaw dies. Silence now. Dust swirling. We hear grunts 
      of effort, the squeal of small wheels on flooring... 

      Now that the doorway has been raggedly reconfigured to 
      accommodate its removal from the room: 

      THE PIANO rolls out with its bench perched on top. Jenner 
      appears, pushing for all he's worth, guiding it...

      As he clears the swirling dust, he rips the breather helmet 
      from his face. The Carpenters MUSIC PLAYS ON, as:

      VARIOUS ANGLES 

      Jenner pushes the piano through the facility, past inactive 
      bio-hazard checkpoints, heaving and straining, maneuvering it 
      toward:

      INT. FACILITY COMMAND CENTER - DAY

      The nerve center, computer stations arrayed around an open 
      central area, lighting dim to conserve energy. It has a 
      Mission Control vibe, but one designed by I.M. Pei. HUGE WALL-
      SIZED DISPLAY SCREENS face the room, dark.

      Jenner appears on a raised platform at the back of the room, 
      pushing the piano in, looking ready for a heart attack.

      A ramp leads from the platform down to the main area. Jenner 
      sets his feet, maneuvers the piano onto the ramp. 

      He tries to control it, but of course it gets away from him, 
      sails down the ramp, and: 

      Across the nerve center the piano goes, SMACKING into some 
      hardware with a CRASH! Jenner cringes.

                                  JENNER
                    My bad!   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 4.


      He hurries down the ramp, checks to make sure the hardware 
      damage isn't too bad (there's a big dent), then shifts the 
      piano to face the huge main screen. 

      The CARPENTERS SONG ENDS, echoing off to silence, as:

      Jenner sets the bench and sits down at the piano.

                                  JENNER (CONT D)
                    We were reviewing the mutability 
                    coding at the core protein level. 
                          (tickles the ivories)
                    Pick up where we left off.

                                  VOX
                    Very well.

      Jenner launches into the BACH GOLDBERG VARIATION #5, eyes 
      riveted to the MAIN DISPLAY SCREEN. As a pianist, he could 
      give Glenn Gould a run for his money. It's obvious how much 
      playing helps him focus his thoughts, as:  

      A DISPLAY OF VIRAL MUTATION AT THE DNA LEVEL starts to unfold 
      on the wall-sized screen before him, the genetic strands 
      twining in a weird tentacled dance, as we

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ATLANTA - SUNRISE

      The sun rises over the still city.  

      Light sweeps across one BUILDING, chasing shadows away.

      Another building comes to life, the sun s rays reflected 
      blindingly off the glass.*

      EXT. GEORGIA LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE

      The sun continues to brighten the countryside.  We HEAR RADIO 
      STATIC and find --

      EXT. HILLTOP (LANDSCAPE) - DAY

      More STATIC, then --

                                  RICK (O.S.)
                    -- if you can hear me.  I don t 
                    copy, not sure if you re still out 
                    there.  If you are, I found some 
                    others.  My family, if you can 
                    believe it.  

      EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

      Rick speaks into his police-issue walkie-talkie.

                                  RICK
                    My wife and son, they re alive.  

      He takes a beat to consider the odds.

                                  RICK
                    This camp is about ten miles west 
                    of Atlanta, right past the Mt. 
                    Vernon exit off the 402.  We were 
                    attacked.  Walkers just came out of 
                    the woods.  They re spreading.  We 
                    lost people, Morgan.  Watch 
                    yourself.  I think we should head 
                    for the CDC.  If you can hear this, 
                    we ll meet you there.  Grimes, 
                    over.

      He lowers the walkie, convinced that was a waste of time, but 
      still hoping it wasn t.  He heads down the hill and enters --  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 6.


      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      As Rick makes his way through the camp, he passes the 
      aftermath of the attack.  

      GLENN and T-DOG add wood and brush high for a funeral pyre.  

      JIM drags a walker to the pyre and drops it at DARYL S feet.  
      Daryl swings a pickaxe and shatters the walker s skull.  
      Glenn and T-Dog then step forward, lift the walker, swing it 
      by the head and feet and toss it onto the fire. 

      Rick makes his way to LORI, CAROL, DALE, and SHANE.  They are 
      huddled together, whispering to each other. 

                                  LORI
                    Poor thing.  Her sister.

                                  DALE
                    I can t take this.

                                  SHANE
                    What do we do?  We gotta, you 
                    know... like with the others.

      Daryl swings the pickax again.

                                  RICK
                    Still won t move, huh?

                                  LORI
                    Still won t talk to us.

      REVEAL they are looking at --

      ANDREA, kneeling at a distance beside a BODY, that of her 
      dead and bloody sister, AMY.  Andrea is seemingly oblivious 
      to everyone and everything around her.  She just looks down 
      at her sister, as if in shock.

                                  LORI
                    She kept vigil all night. 

      Rick grimaces then turns to approach Andrea.  Lori catches 
      his arm, stopping him, then steps forward cautiously in his 
      place.  When she reaches the sisters, she kneels to look 
      Andrea in the eye. 

                                  LORI
                    Andrea, I am so sorry about this.

      But Andrea s lost in thought, a million miles away.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 7.


                                  LORI
                    She s gone.  You have to let us... 
                    take her.  Let us do this.  We all 
                    cared about her. 

      Andrea doesn t move.  Lori sees she s not getting through.  
      She gets up and returns to Rick and Shane.  They are at a 
      loss.  In low tones --

                                  RICK
                    Let s take a step back, wait her 
                    out. 

                                  SHANE
                    We don t have time.  We have to 
                    make sure this is finished.  Then 
                    strap on those guns and sweep these 
                    goddamn woods.  We re gonna have to 
                    rush her.

                                  LORI
                    That s her sister, not a hostage. 

                                  SHANE
                    Gonna be a walker soon enough.

      Rick raises his hand, quieting them. 

                                  RICK
                    Let me give it a shot. 

      He steps toward Andrea.

                                  RICK
                    I didn t know your sister but --

      Andrea suddenly raises a pistol, points it right at him.  
      Rick freezes. 

                                  ANDREA
                    I know how to use the safety.

      Lori tenses, as if to run between them.  Shane s hand 
      reflexively goes toward his gun but he does not draw.  CARL 
      realizes what s happening but is frozen like everyone else.

                                  RICK
                    No need for that.  

      He backs away slowly.  Andrea watches him then lowers the gun 
      and returns to her vigil. *  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 8.


                                  DARYL
                    Ya ll can t be serious.  You just 
                    gonna leave that dead girl there?  
                    She s a timebomb. 

                                  SHANE
                    Let her be.

                                  DARYL
                    Take the shot.  Clean through the 
                    brain.  I could hit a turkey 
                    between the eyes from here.

                                  SHANE
                    Like I said, let her be.

      Daryl cuts him a fuck-you look then heads off, sickened at 
      Shane and Rick making this call.

      INT. CAMP - FIELD WITH GRAVES - DAY*

      Jim has been digging at the  holes again, widening them, *
      turning them into graves.  He s sore, hurt.  He looks around 
      discretely, then lifts his shirt.  He s been BITTEN.  He 
      drops his shirt, looks around again, then continues digging. 

      Daryl dispatches a DEAD SURVIVOR with his pickaxe.  *

      MORALES and JACQUI drag a walker body toward the grave.  
      Glenn stops them.

                                  GLENN
                    What are you doing, man?
                          (off Morales s look)
                    Geeks go over there.

      He indicates the pyre smoke.*

                                  GLENN
                    They re infected. 

      Jacqui and Morales drag the walker back down the hill, toward *
      the fire.  Daryl indicates the mayhem.

                                  DARYL
                    You reap what you sow.

      Morales glares at him.  The stress and strain of the last 
      twelve hours and now the smell of burning flesh is getting to 
      everyone.  

                                    MORALES
                    Shut up, Daryl.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 9.


                                  DARYL
                    You left my brother for dead.  You 
                    all had this coming. 

      He shoots nearby T-Dog a cold look.  Glenn, Morales, and T-
      Dog trade looks.  No one feels like fighting.  Seeing no one 
      takes the bait, Daryl moves off.  The others trade looks then 
      Glenn starts to drag the dead survivor toward the grave.  AS 
      Morales gives him a hand --

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Dale watches Andrea sitting beside her sister from a 
      distance.  He takes a long, private beat then turns away.  He 
      spies Carol talking with SOPHIA comfortingly.  Dale crosses 
      to them.

                                  DALE
                    Andrea s not the only one who lost 
                    a loved one.  I m real sorry about 
                    your dad, sweetheart.

      Sophia looks up at him, tearfully.

                                  DALE
                    And you, too, Carol.  My 
                      condolences.

                                  CAROL
                    I was just saying we have to... lay 
                    him to rest. 

                                  DALE
                    The others can handle that.

                                  CAROL
                    He s my husband.
                          (to Sophia)
                    Do you want to say good-bye?

      Sophia shakes her head fearfully.  Carol doesn t press.

                                  DALE
                    I ll stay with her.

                                  CAROL
                    Thank you.

      She kisses her daughter then crosses to ED S body.  Shane 
      stands beside it with a shovel.  He s just about to split its 
      skull but stops when he sees Carol.

                                  CAROL*
                    I should be the one to do it.*  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 10.


      She reaches for the shovel.  Shane hesitantly hands it to 
      her.  Carol takes a beat, then lifts the shovel and brings it *
      down on Ed s skull.  Then again.  And again.  And again.   
      All her rage spilling out. 

      Dale shields Sophia s eyes and whisks her away.  Carl 
      follows.

      Shane pulls the shovel out of Carol s hands.  She just hangs 
      there looking down at her husband with hatred.  Tears and 
      sweat pour off her face.  

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Jacqui wipes sweat off her brow.  As Jim passes --*

                                  JACQUI
                    Are you bleeding?

      Noticing BLOOD on his shirt.

                                  JIM
                          (covering)
                    Got some on me from all the bodies. 

                                  JACQUI
                    That blood s fresh.

      Jim starts to back away.

                                  JACQUI
                    Were you bit?

                                  JIM
                    I fell, scraped myself... during 
                    the attack. 

      Jacqui isn t buying, reiterates -- 

                                  JACQUI
                    You got bit.

                                  JIM
                    No, it s just... I m all right...

                                  JACQUI
                    Let me see.

      He doesn t respond, a look of panic flashes across his face.  
      He looks around, hoping no one is noticing.  Jacqui registers 
      alarm. 

                                  JIM
                          (pleading)

      But Jacqui calls out to anyone who will listen --

                                  JACQUI
                    A walker got him!

      Everyone looks up, surprised.  

                                  JACQUI
                    A walker bit Jim!

      As people approach, concerned, Jim picks up a shovel, as if 
      to defend himself.

                                  DARYL
                    Lemme see...

      Jim backs away. 

      Daryl lunges at him catches him by the shirt and rips it 
      open, REVEALING --


      JIM S WOUND

      It s fucking nasty.

      Glenn, Morales, T-Dog, Daryl, Jacqui lean in to take a look.  *
      Glenn grimaces.  T-Dog looks at Jim compassionately.. 

      OFF Jim, doomed --

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Andrea gently wipes the blood of Amy s face and neck with a 
      small rag ripped from Amy s shirt.  She cleans around her 
      eyes and mouth, then lovingly straightens her hair, arranging 
      it so it hides the gruesome neck bite.  She straightens her 
      clothes delicately, as if trying not to wake a sleeping 
      child. 

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Dale hands Sophia off to Carl as he approaches.

                                  DALE
                    Keep an eye on her, buddy.  She s 
                    lost her daddy.

                                  CARL
                    I know what that s like. 

      Carl trades looks with an approving Lori then escorts Sophia 
      away.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 12.


                                  DALE
                    Good kid.

                                  LORI
                    Thanks.  

      She looks over at Andrea.

                                  LORI
                     I can t get through.

                                  DALE
                    Can you blame her?  Her sister, 
                    ripped apart like that?  

      He s about to burst into tears but chokes it back, shoves it 
      back down.  Lori sees for the first time he s grieving as 
      well.

                                  LORI
                    Amy was a great girl.

                                  DALE
                    Very special.

                                  LORI
                    Besides Andrea, you knew her the 
                    best.  Go, be with them.  She needs 
                    someone.  Then maybe, she ll let us 
                    take the body.

      He watches the sisters intently, wanting to be with them, but 
      not sure it s his place.

                                  LORI
                    We can t keep circling like 
                    vultures.

                                  DALE
                    It s not my place.

                                  LORI
                    Then who else?

      That strikes Dale. 

                                  LORI
                    You re the only family she s got

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      The group, including, Carol, Jacqui, Dale, T-Dog, Morales, 
      Rick, and Shane are gathered.  Jim seated on the ground, 
      leans against a tree, his condition worsening.

                                  DARYL
                    We should put a pickaxe through his 
                    head and the dead girl s and be 
                    done with it. 

                                  T-DOG
                    For the love of God, the man s 
                    still alive. 

                                  DARYL
                    Only a matter of time. 

      He said that a little too loudly.  Everyone looks at Jim 
      guiltily.

                                  GLENN
                          (lowers his voice)
                    How long does it take to kill you? 

                                  JACQUI
                    I never saw anyone live after a 
                    bite, have you?

      No one else has either.

                                  DALE
                    You figure there are different 
                    strains?  Jim s sinking slow and 
                    Amy still hasn t turned.  Maybe 
                    it s a weaker type.

                                  CAROL
                    If that s true, maybe you could 
                    catch it from just being around it.  
                    From the air, or touching blood.

                                  SHANE
                    If we start jumping to conclusions, 
                    we re just going to whip each other 
                    up.

                                  RICK
                    Right, first thing we ve got to do 
                    is get Jim some help.

                                  DARYL
                    There ain t no help for that.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 14.


                                  RICK
                    You don t know that.  We just said 
                    we ve never seen someone survive a 
                    bite. 

                                  DARYL
                    You got a cure?

                                  RICK
                    Maybe.  I heard a rumor that the 
                    CDC was working on this.  I was 
                    thinking we should head there. 

                                  SHANE
                    We don t even know if that place is 
                    still functioning.

                                  CAROL
                    If there are any politicians left, 
                    trust me, they re not fighting to 
                    save civilization.  They re three 
                    miles underground with Dr. *
                      Strangelove. 

                                  RICK
                    I don t buy that.  If the 
                      government s got any muscle left, 
                    they re putting everything they ve 
                    got into cracking this disease.

                                  DALE
                    Like they dealt with AIDS for 30 
                    years and never cracked that one.  
                    Didn t even have a name for it the 
                    first few years.

                                  RICK
                    I m telling you, they d protect the 
                    CDC at all cost.  I think it s our 
                    best shot.

                                  SHANE
                    For what?  

                                  RICK
                          (isn t it obvious?)*
                    We ve got a sick man.*

                                  SHANE
                    Fort McPherson s sixty miles away.     
                    If it s still operational, it d be 
                    armed.  We d be safe there.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 15.


                                  RICK
                    How does that help Jim?

                                    MORALES
                    Wouldn t we have heard radio 
                    chatter if either one of these 
                    places was up and running? 

                                  DARYL
                    This is a waste of time.  We need 
                    to be moving away from the hot 
                    zone. 

                                  DALE
                    CDC s on the outskirts, not in the 
                    city.

                                  DARYL
                    Close enough. 

                                  T-DOG
                    Where do you think we should go?

                      Anywhere... I don t want my family

                                  JACQUI
                    All we got between us and another 
                    attack is a string of tin cans. 

                                  GLENN
                    We got guns. 

                                  JACQUI
                    I never fired one in my life. 

                                  RICK
                    We gotta be smart about our next 
                    move.  I really think the CDC s the 
                    best choice. 

      The others weigh that.  

                                  DARYL
                    Y all gonna risk your lives on 
                    rumor for someone who s half-dead?  
                    Go ahead.

                                  T-DOG
                    Just like we did for your brother.

      Daryl glares at T-Dog a long beat, then turns his attention 
      toward Jim.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 16.


                                  DARYL
                    If the problem is this crazy freak, 
                    I ll take care a him right now.

      He grabs a pickaxe and starts to move toward --


      JIM

      As Daryl walks toward him, murder in his eyes.  People watch 
      horrified as -- 


      RICK

      Steps up behind Daryl and puts a gun behind his ear. 

                                  RICK
                    We don t kill the living.

                                  DARYL
                    But you gonna kill me?  Really?

                                  RICK
                    Jim s not a freak and he s not a 
                    criminal.  He was attacked, like 
                    all the others. 

      Daryl grips the pickaxe tightly, as if to swing it.  Shane 
      steps forward and takes it from him.  Rick lowers his gun.  
      Dale glares at him. 

      Rick turns to Jim and helps him up.

                                  RICK
                    Come with me.

      Everyone freezes, unsure what he s doing.  Jim gives Rick a 
      panicked imploring look --

                                  JIM
                    Where are you taking me?

                                  RICK
                    Somewhere safe.

      He takes Jim by the arm and leads him toward the RV.  The 
      group starts to break up.  Daryl gives Rick one last eye-fuck 
      then exits.    "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 17.


      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Dale approaches Andrea, still holding Amy.  Jacqui and Glenn 
      watch as he cuts through the invisible circle around the two 
      sisters and crouches in front of them.  Andrea does not raise 
      her gun.

                                  DALE
                    I know you got something going on, 
                    so I won t crowd you.  Just came to 
                    pay my respects, to you and to Amy.   

      Andrea nods appreciatively.

                                  DALE
                    I never told you how I lost my 
                    wife.  Cancer. 
                          (long beat)
                    I dragged her to every doctor, 
                    every test.  But after all the 
                      surgeries, the chemos, she was 
                    ready -- accepted it, you know? -- 
                    but I never could.  Probably all 
                    those treatments that killed her, 
                    to tell you the truth.  

      Andrea listens.  For the first time today, someone is getting 
      through.

                                  DALE
                    Since Margaret passed, well, you 
                    girls, you know, you were the first 
                    people I - ah, I don t know -- am I 
                    making any sense?

      Andrea purses her lips -- a small, reassuring smile. 

                                  ANDREA
                    It was her birthday.

      She pulls a small gift from her pocket and unwraps it 
      carefully as Dale looks on.  

                                  ANDREA
                    Her birthday was always like a week-
                    long affair, but I somehow always 
                    missed them.  I was in college, too 
                    old for kids parties.  She d call, *
                    all excited.  I d say I make it, *
                    always meant to but... I always *
                    thought --

                                  DALE
                    -- there d be more time.*  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 18.


      Andrea looks down at her sister, takes a long beat.*

                                  DALE
                    Don t beat yourself up.  Trust me, 
                    it s hard enough without you adding 
                    guilt to the mix. 

      Andrea displays a gift box.  She opens it, removes the 
      mermaid necklace and holds it out, as if showing it to Amy.  
      She then puts it around her neck and fastens the clasp.  She 
      lays Amy back.  Amy looks peaceful.

                                  DALE
                    She would have loved it.

      Andrea looks down at her sister thoughtfully.  Dale sees 
      she s drifting away again.  He gets up and shuffles away, 
      leaving the two sisters alone. 

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Rick crosses to Shane.

                                  RICK
                    You know these people better than I 
                    do.  They might pull together for 
                    you. 

                                  SHANE
                    Once they do, we ll head for Fort 
                      McPherson.

      Not what Rick wanted to hear. 

                                  RICK
                    Both of us are grabbing at straws here.  
                    But there s one thing we can agree on.  
                    We got a bunch of people scared 
                    shitless.  And need to hear a plan. 

                                  SHANE
                    I got a plan.  Just not your plan.

      OFF Rick, frustrated -- 

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Andrea puts her forehead on Amy s and whispers to her. 

                                  ANDREA
                    Amy, I m sorry.  I m so sorry.  For not 
                    being there -- even now, I wasn t there.

      She finally starts to cry.    "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 19.


      Lori, T-Dog, and Daryl watch from a distance.

      Andrea lifts her head slightly, REVEALING Amy s arm is 
      twitching slightly.  Andrea watches coolly as her sister s 
      body pulses weakly.  She s changing into a walker.  

      Andrea gently caresses Amy s hair as she watches her mouth 
      start to move strangely.  It finally opens and she gasps for 
      air.  Her eyes flutter open and her limbs jerk involuntarily 
      like a newborn s.

      At a distance, Daryl steps forward, the pickaxe in hand.  

      Rick rushes over.  Shane, too.  But they keep their distance.  
      The others watch as well:  Lori, Dale, Carol, Glenn, T-Dog, 
      Morales.

      Still, Andrea doesn t move.  

      Amy looks right at Andrea.  Her eyes washed out.  Haunted. 

      Amy starts to move her arms slowly.  Her hand reaches out 
      almost gently toward Andrea.  Andrea holds her ground 
      fearlessly.

      Amy s hand continues slowly toward Andrea s face, then 
      suddenly grabs at her hair.  She gnashes her teeth.  Amy is 
      now a walker. 

      Rick and Shane start to head toward them, to pull Andrea away 
      but --

      Andrea puts her hand on Amy s forehead and holds the still-
      weak Amy at bay.  Amy growls at her and paws the air weakly.  
      Andrea firmly keeps her in place, like a stern parent holding 
      a toddler having a tantrum.  

      Finally, Andrea raises the gun.  Amy bites at it.

                                  ANDREA
                    I love you --

      BAM!  She FIRES.  The bullet shatters Amy s forehead.  As the 
      body falls backward, Andrea catches it, holding it upright, 
      then lowers it delicately onto the ground. 

      Rick, Lori, Shane, and everyone else trade looks.  

      Andrea looks down at the body -- she did what she needed to -- 
      then turns and walks off, leaving Amy s corpse behind.

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK:

      FADE IN:

      INT. RV - DAY

      Jim, sweaty and suffering chills, stares out the window at 
      the continuing camp clean up.  

      There s a KNOCK on the door.  It opens immediately and Carol 
      enters.

                                  CAROL
                    How you feeling?

      She looks at him compassionately.  He looks like shit.  She 
      feels his forehead, then his cheek.

                                  CAROL
                    You re burning with fever.  You 
                    need to lie down.

      She hands him a small water bottle, but his hands are shaking 
      so much, she must steady it for him to drink.  He does so 
      painfully.  

      OFF Carol, her patient dying -- 

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Glenn and Morales drag Amy s body to the fire.  Dale 
      intercepts.

                                  DALE
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                  GLENN
                    We need to burn the body.

                                  DALE
                    Show a little humanity, for 
                      chrissake.  She should be buried.

                                  GLENN
                    No disrespect, dude, but she 
                    changed.

      Daryl joins them.

                                  DARYL
                    You should burn it, like the 
                    others.  Keep the virus from 
                      spreading.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 21.


                                  DALE
                    You re a scientist, all of a 
                    sudden?  She was shot in the head.  
                    There s no threat now. 

      Rick steps forward.

                                  RICK
                    What s the problem?

                                  GLENN
                    Amy, do we burn her or bury her?

      Rick shakes his head at the absurdity of it all.

                                  RICK
                    I guess bury.

                                  DARYL
                    You just change the rules however 
                    the mood strikes you?

      Lori joins them. 

                                  RICK
                    There are no rules.

                                  LORI
                    That s the problem. 

                                  RICK
                    What do you mean?

                                  LORI
                    We haven t had one minute to hold 
                    onto anything of our old selves.  
                          (to Rick)
                    We need time to mourn.

      EXT. CAMP - FIELD WITH GRAVES - DAY*

      Andrea drags Amy s body toward one of the fresh graves. As 
      she approaches WE SEE --

      The entire band of survivors gathered around.  Mourners.

      Andrea pulls Amy into the grave and lays her down gently.

      Glenn stands beside the grave, waiting for Andrea to eulogize 
      her sister.  When Andrea turns and stands alongside Dale, 
      Glenn takes the cue and begins filling the grave. 

      Jacqui watches solemnly. 

      Carol and Sophia hold each other, Ed s death a cold reality.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 22.


      Morales has his arms around MIRANDA, LUIS, and ELIZA.

      T-Dog s eyes are red.  Daryl stands next to him, nods in 
      agreement.  A moment between them.

      Lori, teary-eyed, stands with her hands on Carl s shoulders.  
      Carl just stares at the graves.  Rick stands beside them.

      Shane stands alone, watching Rick with his family. 

      Dale picks up a handful of dirt and tosses it on Amy s grave.  
      He then backs away from the grave and rejoins Andrea.

      A beat as everyone stands in silence.  Glenn finishes 
      shoveling then looks to Shane as if he should say something, 
      but Shane is fixated on Lori.  Lori looks back at Shane then 
      holds Carl tighter.  Glenn studies Rick, who seems lost in 
      thought.

      Andrea takes one last look then turns and exits.  Dale 
      follows.*

      Carol leads Sophia away. *

      The group slowly breaks up.  T-Dog, then Daryl.  

      INT. RV - DAY*

      Jim looks wearily out the window of the RV, seeing people *
      returning from the burial.  He hangs his head, trying to keep *
      his shit together.*

      EXT. CAMP - FIELD WITH GRAVES - DAY*

      Rick follows Lori and Carl as they head off.  Shane watches 
      them go as --

      Rick catches up with Lori. 

                                  RICK
                    We can t go through that.

      Lori stops and turns to him, sees the raw emotion in his 
      eyes.

                                  RICK
                    Not us.  Burying other people s bad 
                    enough, but the thought of one of 
                    us --

      He stops himself.  Lori s thankful he does.  She looks at 
      Carl, who s fully aware what they re thinking.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 23.


                                  CARL
                    We re safe, dad, right?  Now that 
                    we re together. 

                                  RICK
                    Yeah, buddy.  And we ve got to stay 
                    that way.

      Carl s relieved.

                                  RICK
                    Now, give me a chance to discuss 
                    some things with your mom, okay?

      Carl nods and heads off.  Rick and Lori continue walking 
      toward the RV.

                                  RICK
                    We ve got a sick man.  Just a 
                    matter of time before we have more.  
                    Maybe I m crazy about this CDC, but 
                    this guy, Morgan, he was pretty 
                    sure.  I trust him more than I 
                    trust some of these folks.

                                  LORI
                    They re all terrified.  We all are.

      Rick nods.  He is, too.

                                  LORI
                    And if one of them suggested we 
                    head toward the city based on a 
                    hunch, you d have no part of it.

      Rick knows she s right but isn t sure if that should change 
      his mind.

                                  RICK
                          (the only certainty)
                    I love you.

                                  LORI
                    I love you, too. 

      INT. RV - DAY

      Jim lies on the bed, writhing in pain.  His clothes are 
      drenched with sweat.  Carol wipes his face with a damp cloth. 

      The door opens and Rick and Lori enter.   

                                  LORI
                    You need anything?  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 24.


                                  CAROL
                    His fever s worse.

      Lori and Rick pityingly take in Jim.

                                  LORI
                    Carol, you mind stepping out for a 
                    sec?

                                  CAROL
                    Sure.  Poor man. 

      She follows Lori out.  Rick sits beside Jim.  A beat, then 
      Jim painfully opens his eyes.  

                                  JIM
                    I thought there d be a grave ready 
                    for me.

      An awkward beat.

                                  RICK
                    Nobody wants that. 

      Jim starts to cough violently.  He spits some blood on the 
      floor.  Rick takes a step back.  Jim collapses back on the 
      bed.

                                  RICK
                    We re going to get you some help.

                                  JIM
                    It s too late.  The graves.  It s 
                    there.  Hands.  Armies. 

      Rick realizes he s delirious.

                                  JIM*
                    Amy s there, swimming.  Watch the 
                      mangroves.  Those roots ll gouge 
                    the whole boat. 

      Jim looks right at Rick and speaks lucidly.

                                  JIM
                    You ll watch the boat, right?  You 
                    said you would.

                                  RICK
                    I ll watch the boat.  Don t worry.

      Jim lies back and shuts his eyes peacefully.  OFF Rick, 
      keeping vigil --   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 25.


      EXT. CAMP - RV - DAY

      Daryl powwows with Lori and Carol.  He holds a pickaxe.

                    I ve got a good idea -- how about

                    He s not a walker. 

                                  DARYL
                    Under my new policy he is.

      Shane approaches and hands him a gun.  The other three are 
      surprised.

                                  SHANE
                    We ve got to secure the perimeter 
                    before nightfall.  You, Glenn, and 
                    Dale take that side.  
                          (pointing)
                    Rick and I got that.

      Daryl takes the gun but leaves the pickaxe.

                                  DARYL
                          (to Carol)
                    You re gonna need it.

      He heads off.  

                                  CAROL
                    I m going to check on Sophia.

      She exits.  Shane and Lori look around.  They re as alone as 
      they re going to be. 

                                  SHANE
                    I need you to talk some sense into 
                    Rick.

                                  LORI
                    He s dead set about the CDC thing.  

                                  SHANE
                    It s a pipe dream.  A mistake.

                                  LORI
                    I m not hearing any better options.  
                    He says they re working on a cure.   

                                  SHANE
                    You re backing him?  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 26.


                                  LORI*
                          (yes)*
                    He s my husband.  And what he says *
                    makes sense.  It s not like he s *
                    running off like some coward, *
                    leaving a man for dead.*

      That hits Shane hard.  He s surprised she came out swinging *
      like that.  And Lori s surprised at how loaded her own words 
      are.

                                  SHANE
                    It may be time to play the dutiful 
                    wife, but you can t tell me fixing 
                    your marriage is worth putting 
                    everyone else at risk. 

                                  LORI
                    That s not what this is.

                                  SHANE
                    Then what is it?

                                  RICK (O.S.)
                    What s what? 

      Shane turns.  Rick stands behind him.  An awkward beat as 
      Shane and Lori watch him, trying to gauge his attitude.

                                  SHANE
                    The plan for tomorrow.  We moving 
                    out or should we start bunkering 
                    down, wait for help to find us?

                                  RICK
                    The walkers have already done that.

                                  SHANE
                    But now we ve got firepower.

                                  RICK
                    How long will that last?

                                  LORI
                          (to Rick)
                    I was just telling Shane I think we 
                    should trust your gut.

      Rick is pleased.  Shane cuts Lori a disbelieving look then -- 

                                  SHANE
                    Come on, we ve got to sweep the 
                    area.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 27.


      He walks off.  Rick looks at Lori appreciatively then follows 
      Shane.  OFF Lori --

      EXT. WOODS - DAY

      Rick and Shane make their way stealthily through the woods, a 
      few feet apart from each other.  Their guns are raised, as if 
      hunting.  They scour the --

      WOODS --

      For walkers but the area is desolate. 

                                  SHANE
                    People are still making up their 
                    minds.  You go to CDC, you might be 
                    on your own.  You really wanna do 
                    that?

                                  RICK
                    I gotta do what s best for my 
                    family.  

                                  SHANE
                    Exposing them to all kinds of risk?

                                  RICK
                    As opposed to what?  Leading them 
                    blindly into hostile territory?  
                    We re looking for a lifeline.  I 
                    say swim toward the big ship, not 
                    further out into the ocean. 
                          (off Shane s look)
                    I m asking you to back me up. 

      A long pause as they walk. 

                                  SHANE
                    I want to, man.  I just don t see 
                    it.

                                  RICK
                    If it was your family, I think 
                    you d feel differently.

      Shane stops.

                                  SHANE
                    I kept them safe, looked out for 
                    them, like they were my own. 

                                  RICK*
                    And I appreciate that but -- *  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 28.


      SNAP!  A noise deeper in the woods.  Rick moves off to 
        investigate.  Shane lifts his rifle, puts it to his eye, then 
      scans the terrain.

      SHANE S POV -- JUST WOODS.

      He lowers his rifle, peering straight ahead, then raises it 
      again to make sure.

      SHANE S POV -- JUST WOODS, THEN --

      RICK enters his sight.

      TIGHT ON SHANE 

      He watches Rick intensely.  Rick is oblivious he is in 
      Shane s sights.

      Long beat.

      Shane finally lowers the rifle, lets out a deep breath, then 
      looks around nervously. 

      As he starts walking --

                                  RICK
                    Clear.  Better get back.

      He brushes past Shane and heads back to the camp. 

      After a beat, Shane follows.

      EXT. CAMP - DUSK

      Rick and Shane approach the group, huddled near a campfire, 
      still fearful as night falls.  

                                  SHANE
                    I ve been thinking about Rick s 
                    plan...

      Rick turns, caught off guard.

                                  SHANE
                    There re no guarantees.  But, I ve 
                    known him a long time.  I trust his 
                      instincts. 

      A beat as everyone takes that in.  

                                  SHANE
                    The most important thing is to keep 
                    together.  

      Rick registers appreciation for Shane s support.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 29.


      Lori looks at Shane.  She suspects this is more about her 
      than the efficacy of Rick s plan. 

                                  RICK
                    We leave first thing in the 
                    morning. 

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK:

      OPEN ON the early morning Georgia landscape, the sun already 
      risen. 

      EXT. HILLTOP (LANDSCAPE) - DAY

      STATIC, then --

                                  RICK (O.S.)
                    -- we re moving out.

      EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

      Rick on the walkie-talkie.

                                  RICK
                    Again, by the quarry.  It s not 
                    safe here.  Avoid it at all cost.  
                    I ll try to leave a map or note, 
                      something, so you can follow our 
                    trail.  Shouldn t take long to get 
                    to the CDC, as long as the road is 
                    clear.  If things are overrun with 
                    walkers -- 
                          (beat)
                    Our numbers are down, Morgan.  
                    We ve got women and children, a 
                    sick man who s not going to make 
                    it.  I sure hope you re right about 
                    this CDC, buddy.  I need you to be.   
                    Grimes, out.

      He lowers the walkie then exits.

      EXT. GEORGIA LANDSCAPE - DAY

      GUNFIRE rings out and echoes off the hills.  It stops as 
      suddenly as it started.

      INT. RV - DAY

      Jim sits up and listens nervously.  He is rattled, his 
      breathing labored, his skin discolored.  His condition 
      deteriorating.   

      EXT. GEORGIA LANDSCAPE - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DAY

      The shooting continues.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 31.


      EXT. FIELD ADJACENT TO CAMP - DAY

      Rick and Shane patrol behind the group, watching their 
      technique.  

                                  RICK
                    Only four rounds.  We need to 
                    conserve ammo.  Just get a feel for 
                    the weapon.  

      Andrea draws her gun from her waistband, FIRES at a target, 
      then pops the clip, loads another round and repeats. 

      CLOSE ON makeshift target, four bulls-eyes.

      Rick and Shane trade knowing looks.

                                  SHANE
                    Nice shot.  You re a natural.

      ON Andrea, focused.

      T-Dog steadies himself, then squeezes off a shot.

      So does Carol.

      And Jacqui.  She s nervous but focused. 

      Glenn, Morales, and others in line beside them.

      Sophia holds the gun up nervously then puts it down again.

                                  SOPHIA
                          (to Carol)
                    I can t.

      Carol puts down her own weapon then moves to Sophia.

                                  CAROL
                    You don t have to.

      She holds Sophia, realizing it s all been too much for her 
      little girl. 

      Shane corrects Glenn s stance.  Glenn makes the adjustment 
      then continues to fire.  

                                  RICK
                    Remember, four rounds.  That s it.

                                  DARYL
                    We d have more ammo if you didn t 
                    play Santa Claus with it at the old 
                    age home.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 32.


      Rick watches Carl take his shot -- a great reason to ignore 
      Daryl. 

      Carl misses by a mile. 

                                  CARL
                    I suck.

                                  RICK
                    It takes practice.

                                  CARL
                    Can I shoot another?

                                  RICK
                    That was your fourth.  Don t worry.  
                    You ll get another chance.  But 
                    now, we need to hightail it out of 
                    here.
                          (to Shane)
                    We good to go?

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      Rick and Shane address the troops.  They are gathered near 
      their packed vehicles. 

                                  RICK
                    Everyone stay on channel 40, but 
                    keep the chatter down.  Jim will 
                    stay in the RV with Carol, so he s *
                    in good hands.  Questions?*

      None.

      Morales steps forward, his family beside him. 

                                    MORALES
                    We re not going.

      Everyone turns, surprised. 

                                    MORALES
                    Heading the other way.  Got family 
                    in Birmingham.  

                                  RICK
                    You won t make it on your own.

                                    MORALES
                    We ll take that chance.

                                  RICK
                    That s a lot of pressure to put on 
                    yourself.

                    It ll be hard to watch your back 
                    when you ve got to do it all -- 
                    find food, shelter, keep watch.

                                    MIRANDA
                    We can handle it.   

                                  RICK
                    I really think --

                                    MORALES
                    -- I gotta do what s best for my 
                    family. 

      Shane regards Rick, who s just gotten his reasoning thrown 
      back at him.

                                  RICK
                      I understand.  Channel 40... if you 
                    change your mind.

      Morales nods to Rick and Shane.  The other survivors say good-
      bye to Morales and his family.  As he leads his family to a 
      van --

                                  SHANE
                          (to Rick)
                    What makes you think our odds are 
                    any better?

      Rick s only answer is to pull some papers from his pocket.  
      Shane takes them and opens them, revealing --

      A hand-traced MAP with the CDC marked off.  Along the top, 
      Rick has written: WE ARE HEADING FOR THE CDC.  KEEP MOVING. 
      THIS AREA NOT SAFE.  RICK GRIMES.


      RV DOOR

      Opens.  Jim stumbles out and moves toward the group.  He 
      looks like a walker. 

      Carol is the first to see him. 

                                  CAROL
                    Oh my god, is he...

                                  JIM
                    I need to finish the holes.

      Rick steps forward and intercepts him, but keeping his 
      distance.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 34.


                                  RICK
                    Jim, you should get back in the RV.  
                    Carol, Lori, can you help him?

      Lori and Carol step forward and escort Jim back to the RV.*

                                  DARYL
                    You re bringing him? 

                                  RICK
                    That s what this is all about. 

                                  DARYL
                    He ll never make the trip. 

                                  RICK
                    He s making the trip.  

      He watches Lori and Carol escort Jim back to the RV then 
      turns toward Ed s Cherokee. 

      Dale steals forward and scribbles on Rick s note.  He laughs 
      then heads off.  Lori leans in to read it.  

       WALKERS KISS MY ASS 

      EXT. CAMP - DAY

      The caravan pulls out, the RV leading the way.  It pulls onto 
      the road then slowly makes its way away from the camp.  It is 
      followed by the Cherokee, then the church van, then Daryl s 
      Suzuki, then Shane s Jeep. 

      INT. RV - DAY

      Jim screams in pain with every bump as he is tossed about.  
      Carol tries to comfort him, but he is in agony.  She calls 
      out --

                                  CAROL
                    Pick a smoother route, for God s 
                    sake. 

      UP FRONT --

      Dale drives.  Glenn s his co-pilot, the original map on his 
      lap.  They trade helpless looks.  

      INT. CHEROKEE - DAY

      Rick drives.  Lori sits beside him, Carl and Sophia in the 
      backseat.  Rick checks the rearview to make sure everyone s 
      in line.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 35.


      INT. CHURCH VAN - DAY

      T-Dog drives, accompanied by Andrea and Jacqui.  Andrea 
      stares out the window, lost in thought. 

      INT. DARYL S SUZUKI - DAY

      Daryl drives.  A shotgun riding shotgun. 

      INT. SHANE S JEEP - DAY

      Shane follows Daryl.  He s alone. 

      EXT. ROADS - DAY

      The caravan makes its way toward Atlanta.  Through the quiet 
      Georgia woods.  Around bends.  Various driving shots.

      INT. RICK S CAR - DAY

      As Sophia sleeps in the backseat, the Grimes family talk 
      quietly. 

                                  LORI
                          (to Carl)
                    How d you do shooting?

                                  CARL
                    I need more practice. 

      She cuts Rick a look.  He understands immediately.

                                  RICK
                    Your mother doesn t like guns.

                                  CARL
                    I have to learn how to shoot.

                                  LORI
                    I know, it s just... I don t like 
                    guns.

      Long beat. 

                                  LORI
                          (changing the subject)
                    Been awhile since we ve been on a 
                    trip together.

      Rick, grateful for the change in tone, pounces --

                    Never did do the Grand Canyon.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 36.


                                  CARL
                    Why not?

      A beat as Rick and Lori think.

                                  RICK
                    Just weren t big vacation people.  
                    Your mom always wanted to visit her 
                    family.

                                  LORI
                    And your dad always took extra 
                    shifts.

                                  RICK
                    We always figured we d get to it 
                    next year.  It s not like it s 
                    going anywhere. 

                                  CARL
                    I wanna see it.  Can we still take 
                    that trip?  See the Grand Canyon?

      Rick s smile fades but then he recovers it.

                                  RICK
                    Sure, buddy.  First things first.

      Carl sits back, content.  Lori and Rick trade looks.

      INT. RV - DAY

      Dale drives, Glenn beside him.

                                  DALE
                    How d you do during shooting 
                    practice?

                                  GLENN
                    All right.

                                  DALE
                    It s one thing to shoot a tree, 
                    another a charging walker.

                                  GLENN
                    What are you telling me?

                                  DALE
                    I m afraid you might get that 
                    chance before this ride s over.

      He looks out the windshield.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 37.


                                  DALE
                    Ah, shit.  What is this?

      EXT. ROAD - DAY

      TIGHT ON the RV s engine, OVERHEATING.  The hood s popped 
      open and steam pours out everywhere.

      PULL BACK to show the caravan stopped and the group gathered 
      around Dale and Glenn, examining the engine. 

                                  DALE
                    It s the hose, completely shot.

                                  RICK
                    I thought you jury-rigged 
                      something.  

                                  DALE
                    It s not holding.  I was planning 
                    to strip the cube van.

                                  SHANE
                    Shit.

                                  RICK
                    There s got to be a gas station or 
                    abandoned car between here and the 
                    highway. 

      Everyone trades wary looks, another fucking problem. 

                                  RICK
                    Glenn, Dale, shouldn t take us 
                    long.

      Shane looks over at Lori then stops Rick.

                                  SHANE
                    I ll take this one.  

                                  RICK
                    You sure?

                                  SHANE
                    Yeah, you stay with your family. 

      INT. RV - DAY

      Jim lies on the bed, eyes open.  He s fading.  Carol keeps 
      vigil.

      Rick enters.  He s taken aback by Jim s condition but tries 
      to appear upbeat.   "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 38.


                                  RICK
                    Why don t you take a few, grab some 
                    air.

      Carol is hesitant to leave but finally does.  Rick sits 
      beside Jim.

                                  RICK
                    We should be back on the road soon.  
                    Hang in there. 

      Jim tries to catch his breath.

                                  RICK
                    You comfortable?  You need --

                                  JIM
                    Leave me here.

                                  RICK
                    Not a chance.

                                  JIM
                    I m done.  

                                  RICK
                    You can t give up. 

                                  JIM
                    Just lean me against a tree, in the 
                    shade.  I wanna be with my family. 

                                  RICK
                            (sympathetically)
                    They re all dead.

      Jim nods sadly. 

                                  RICK
                    All you gotta do is sleep.  Close 
                    your eyes and by the time you wake 
                    up we ll be --

                    I can t -- this ride, it s killing 
                    me.  The pain... 

                                  RICK
                    Jim, the fever, you re not thinking 
                    straight.

                                  JIM
                    I am.  Now, I am.  And I want this.  
                    Leave me here.  That s on me.

                    I know what I m asking.  My

                    If we give up, it s over.  No one *

                                  JIM*
                    You can t save me.  And you know *
                    it. *

      OFF Rick, torn -- 

      EXT. ROAD - DAY

      Dale and Glenn work under the RV hood.  Glenn holds a hose in 
      hand, proud papa.

                                  DALE
                    Only take me a few minutes.

      Shane addresses the group.

                                  SHANE
                    Let s get ready to head out. 

      Everyone scurries for their places.  As Shane approaches his 
      car, he passes the RV door.  It opens and Rick carries Jim 
      out. 

                                  SHANE (CONT D)
                    What s going on?

                                  RICK
                    He doesn t want to go any further.

      He carries Jim over to a tree and helps him sit beside it.

      Lori, Carl, Daryl, Andrea, T-Dog, Carol, Sophia, and the 
      others step out of their vehicles.  Glenn joins them.

                                  GLENN
                    Are we just going to leave him 
                    here?

                                  JIM
                    Please.  Just go.  

      They all study him a long beat.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 40.


                                  ANDREA
                    He wants to die gracefully.  

      Everyone looks at her.  

      Rick continues to think it through, then grabs a container of 
      water and places it beside Jim.

                                  DARYL
                    What the hell, man?

                                  RICK
                    He s made his decision.  I can t 
                    force him.  Can t force any of you. 

                                  SHANE
                    What s the point of going to the 
                    CDC then?  We re close.

                                  RICK
                    I think it s still the right plan.  

                                  CAROL
                    He can t take the bouncing around 
                    in that thing.  Look at all his 
                    sores.

      But Shane s still focused on Rick.

                                  SHANE
                    We re really just walking away? 
                          (emotional)
                    I don t want to live with that.

      Lori takes that in.  *

                                  T-DOG
                    Shouldn t we... you know?

      Rick cuts him down with a look. 

      Andrea kneels down in front of Jim.  He opens his eyes.  She 
      leans forward and kisses his forehead.  She then gets up, 
      turns away, and exits.

      Glenn then steps forward and forces a smile.

                                  GLENN
                    Hang in there, bro.

      Dale follows him.

                                  DALE
                    Good luck.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 41.


      Then Daryl, nodding coldly.*

      Then T-Dog.

                                  T-DOG
                    Peace, man. 

      Then Jacqui.

                                  JACQUI
                    Just close your eyes, sweetie.  
                    Don t fight.  

      And the rest of them line up -- Carol, Sophia, Lori, Carl, 
      the others, then Shane and Rick. 

                                  SHANE
                    I m sorry, Jim.

      One by one they file past, each paying their respects.  Jim 
      starts to slip into unconsciousness.  

      Rick is on the edge of breaking and fighting it.   

      Jim opens his eyes.  This hits Rick hard.  He holds back his 
      emotions then turns quickly and heads to his car.

      EXT. ROAD

      The caravan heads out again.  The vehicles slowly pass Jim, 
      one by one. 

      As they pass, the same people who wanted him dead, are now 
      filled with sorrow as THE CAMERA, one by one, finds their 
      faces.  The last being Rick. 

      OFF Jim, as the caravan disappears into the distance --

      Jenner in HazMat gear standing alone in the middle of a

      He opens a freezer drawer and removes a specimen container 
      labeled:  TS-19   

      He lifts the lid of the container to reveal a sample of 
      necrotic tissue.  He delicately places it on the workspace.

      He picks up a pair of dull, plastic scissors and carefully 
      cuts off a sample.  It s slow going. 

                                  JENNER
                    Vox, can t I get some decent 
                    scissors?

                                  VOX
                    It is for your own protection.

                    You d miss me?

                                  VOX
                    Do you need to take a break, 
                    Doctor?  You re anthropomorphizing 
                    me again. 

      Jenner blinks his eyes a few times then tries to focus.  He s 
      exhausted.

                                  JENNER
                    No, I m fine.

      INT. CDC LAB - DAY

        A centrifuge spins.  

      Jenner watches it.  His eyes close then snap open. 

      The centrifuge stops. 

      Jenner opens it then removes the sample.  He places it on the 
      workspace and examines it carefully.  He notices something 
      and reaches out to touch it.  He then stops himself and while 
      still inspecting it curiously, reaches for an instrument 
      without looking.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 43.


      He knocks over a beacon of fluid, which spills on the larger 
      sample.  It starts to dissolve.

                                  JENNER
                    No!

      He instinctively brushes the sample to protect it then stops.  
      He looks at his hand, horrified.

      His glove is dissolving. 

      He frantically rips his glove off but --

      His second pair (below the top pair) is also being eaten 
      through.

                                  JENNER
                    It s eating through.

      He runs to a decontamination shower and pulls the chain.  An 
      ALARM rings.  Water floods down on his HazMat suit.

      He looks at the large sample -- ruined.

      Jenner runs for the door.

                                  JENNER
                    Let me out.  Let me out, Vox. 

      He exits and the door locks behind him.  A steel door slams 
      down.

                                  VOX
                    Should I proceed with full 
                      decontamination, Doctor?

      Jenner heads for another shower. 

                                  JENNER
                    Yes, damn it.  

      He removes his HazMat gear, then his secondary gear, then his 
      underwear.

      Jenner steps into the shower and is blasted by a chemical 
      wash.

      He examines his hand carefully.  It seems unharmed.

                    No, don t!  

      He looks up from the shower and into the lab.  TS-19 sits on 
      the workspace.

                                  JENNER
                    Wait!  Stop!  Don t burn -- 

      BOOM!  A FIREBALL rips through the lab, incinerating it. 

      Jenner hangs his head and lets out a deep, anguished moan.

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      The caravan comes into view.

      INT. RV - DAY

      Glenn studies the map then points.

                                  GLENN
                    Should be that way.

      Dale puts on his blinker.

      INT. RICK S CAR - DAY

      RICK S POV --

      Dale s blinker signals left.  The RV starts to turn.

      Lori and Carl lean forward enthusiastically as Rick follows.

                                  CARL
                    Are we close?

      Rick and Lori peer through his windshield.

                                  LORI
                    Oh my god.

      He pulls to a stop. 

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      The caravan pulls to a stop.  Rick steps out of his car.  
      Then one by one, all the doors open and the group exit their 
      cars.  They stand there, in a line, their mouths open, as the 
      take in --

      EXT. STEPS OF CDC - DAY

      An urban battlefield.  Dead SOLDIERS, shot in the head, some 
      eaten, fill the street and line the steps of the CDC.  They 
      obviously went hand-to-hand with the countless WALKERS 
      filling the street.  A massacre on both sides.

      A pile of CORPSES blocks the main entrance. 

      -Carol holds Sophia close.  

      -Lori takes in the horrific sight. 

      -Jacqui stares in shock.  

      -Dale shakes his head in disbelief.

      -Glenn studies Rick, then Shane, then trades a look with T-
      Dog that says, what now?

      -Carl watches his father.  Suddenly, he hears a NOISE next to 
      him.  He looks down to find --


      A SOLDIER

      Now a walker, reaching out toward Andrea.

      The others jump back.  Rick pulls his weapon, aims a shot, 
      but BAM!

      Shane fired first.  He gives Rick an accusing look.

      INT. CDC - DAY

      Jenner, his eyes red, paces furiously.  He drinks from a full 
      glass of wine, two open bottles before him.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 46.


                                  JENNER
                    You callous, thoughtless, idiotic 
                    abacus.  That was the last sample 
                    of TS-19.  You know what we did to 
                    get that.  It was everything.  And 
                    now it s gone.  GONE!

                    I didn t mean destroy her --

      An ALARM sounds as white lights flash sequentially.

                    There are people outside the main 
                    entrance.

      Jenner reacts anxiously.  He s been alone far too long. 

                                  JENNER
                    People?  What sort of people?

                    they want?

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Rick tries the MAIN ENTRANCE.  It s locked.  He sees an 
      intercom panel, presses a few buttons, realizes it s dead.  
      He then pounds on the door. 

      A long beat.  No response.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 47.

                    There s nobody here.

      Another beat as our people look around taking in their new 
      situation.  The door is locked and they are surrounded by 
      dead soldiers.  Now panic starts to set in. 

                                  DARYL

                    You re done, man.  I ain t 
                    listening to you.

      Rick doesn t respond.  He s frozen.

      Shane stays quiet.  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 48.


      Rick looks at Lori, her arms still around Carl. Instinctively 
      she moves to Rick s side and nods reassuringly.  Suddenly, 
      Rick notices --  

      A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA moving.  

                                  RICK
                    Did you see that?

      Rick walks up and looks directly into the camera --

      INT. CDC - INTERCUT

      Jenner watches Rick looking right at him. 

      BACK TO RICK AND THE OTHERS -- 

      Rick bangs on the door again.

                                  T-DOG
                    Man, there s nobody here.

                    Let s get out here, we have to find 
                    someplace safe. 

      INT. CDC - INTERCUT

      Jenner watches Rick on the security monitor. 

                                  RICK
                    If you can hear me... Please, help 
                    us.  We have women, children, no 
                    food.  Nowhere else to go.

      Jenner sweats profusely.  He drains his glass, then continues 
      watching.

      Rick hates to say this in front of everyone --

                                  RICK
                    If you don t let us in, you re 
                    killing us... Please.

      Still no answer as Shane appears on the monitor next to Rick.

                                  SHANE
                    Maybe the camera s still working 
                    and everybody s dead.

      Rick, with no other choice, is about to give up hope.  He 
      turns and starts down the stairs when ---  "THE WALKING DEAD"   Ep.105  REV. NETWORK Draft  7/21/10 49.


      THE DOOR 

      Opens behind them.

      They turn and ready their weapons.  They trade cautious looks 
      as they approach the entrance.  

      Rick and Shane pull the corpses away that block the entrance.

      Carol, Daryl, Jacqui, climb over the bodies faster than Rick 
      and Shane can clear them.  The group scrambles its way into -- 

      INT. CDC - CONTINUOUS

      And looks around, amazed.  Lori smiles with relief when she 
      feels the blast of air conditioning.  

      They ve made it.  Dale slaps Rick on the back.  

      The group exchanges looks with Rick, acknowledging he was 
      right.

      Jenner studies them on a monitor then runs his fingers 
      through his hair and straightens his clothes, trying to make 
      himself presentable.  AS he braces himself for his guests --
