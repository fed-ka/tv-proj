
    The modest house has a crowd of reporters and TV cameras
    before it.  Lois and Clark make their way to the door as
    GERALDO RIVERA emerges, dabbing his eyes with a
    handkerchief.

                                   LOIS
                  _Geraldo_?

                                   GERALDO
                       (deeply moved)
                  Hi, Lois.  Boy, I've covered some
                  tragic stories before...  But
                  _this_...

    He just waves a hand, unable to go on, then leaves as Lois
    and Clark stare.  The door re-opens, Leigh-Anne stands
    there, dramatically clutching a scarf, dressed for sympathy.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE
                  I forget.  Which of you kind people
                  did I say was next?

    The reporters shout, wave arms, jockey for position.

                                   LOIS
                  Hello, I'm Lois Lane...

                  I feel a woman should tell my
                  Story.

    She goes inside, Clark leans close to Lois.

                                   CLARK
                       (quietly)

                  Hoax, hoax, hoax.



    It's the scene we saw on TV.  A squad of several suited
    Secret Service types, in reflective sunglasses and
    earpieces, trots to the limo and one opens the door.


17  ANONYMOUS                                                       17   

    This is the feared international terrorist, ANONYMOUS,
    master of disguise, now done up as a Secret Service guy.
    While the other men scan the crowd, he lets a small silver
    transmitter with tiny antenna slip down one side of his leg
    until it rests on the curb.  He steps back into the squad as
    the PRESIDENT, in formal military-like garb, emerges from
    the car.  He waves to the crowd then starts moving slowly
    toward the building, surrounded by Secret Service guys.


18  ON TRANSMITTER                                                  18   

    A light blinks ON. We hear a high-pitched HUM.



    Now as the HUM grows more shrill, the Secret Service types
    all begin reaching for their earpieces.  All but Anonymous.
    Suddenly the noise becomes a SHRIEK and all the guards grab
    their ears and crumple to the ground.  Anonymous thrusts a
    hand into a pocket, is clearly holding a gun, moves swiftly
    to the bewildered President.

                                   ANONYMOUS
    Right this way, Mr. President.

    He starts hustling the man toward the side of the building,
    when suddenly SUPERMAN BLURS into view.

    He streaks right to the curb where the transmitter rests, 
    and crushes it.  The Secret Service types recover, stand, as 
    Superman goes to the President, who is now standing alone.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  Are you alright, Mr. President?

                  ... Where did he go?

    Another mob scene.  Vendors hawk "Super Stud" t-shirts,
    Superman diapers, rattles, etc.  Angry women wave signs
    reading "SUPER DEADBEAT."  Reporters and video crews fight
    for curb space.  Among then is a lackluster Lois.  Suddenly
    Superman BLURS into their midst and the mob goes wild.

                                   REPORTERS
                  Superman! If the boy is yours,
                  will you seek custody?!  Are there
                  other 'Super Kids' around the
                  country?!  Is it true you have a
                  wife in Red Bluff, Montana?!  What
                  do you say to teens who wanna be
                  just like Superman?!

    Superman raises hands to calm them.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  You people all know me and what I
                  stand for.
                       (sees Lois)
                  And what I won't stand for.  I've
                  always tried to protect the weak
                  and the helpless.  And that's why
                  I'm here today.  To protect this
                  little boy from any more of _this_.

    Lois wishes she were invisible.  Suddenly the reporters
    desert Superman and Lois for:


36  A LIMOUSINE                                                     36   

    It pulls up to the curb.  Leigh-Anne, Anonymous, and Jesse
    emerge.  Jesse's in a mini-super suit.  CAMERAS FLASH, the
    press closes in, Jesse looks scared.

                                   LEIGH-ANNE

                  Do you have any idea what raising 
                  Jesse's been like?  Before I got 
                  pregnant, I had prospects.  You 
                  probably don't know I was runner up 
                  in the Junior Stenographer Pageant.

                                   SUPERMAN

                  Jesse's not just any child.  And 
                  since he got.... the way he is... I 
                  can't keep him in clothes, 'cause 
                  he grows so fast... Can't keep a 
                  roof over our heads, 'cause he 
                  wrecks every place... Can't keep a 
                  job 'cause no day care center'll 
                  have him...

                  I'd help if I could, but how?  I 
                  don't have money, or credit cards, 
                  or a shoebox full of cash.  Does 
                  this look like a rich man's 
                  wardrobe?

                  I don't want your money.  At first 
                  I did, but this has gotten so big!  
                  I have a book offer...  A Movie of 
                  the Week Deal...  A kid's clothing 
                  company wants to do a 'Jesse' 
                  line....  Superman, I can give him
                  the kind of life I never coulda 
                  dreamed of.  And, of course, I 
                  won't be doin' so bad, myself.

    Press and onlookers smile as, beyond them, one little kid
    hops off the President's lap and Jesse approaches.  He
    reaches out to the President, the President reaches out to
    him.

    The President stands, bends over, Jesse puts his arms around
    him.

    Suddenly, with a WHOOSH, Jesse and the President BLUR
    straight up and off into the sky!

    Chaos as Secret Service and Crowd erupt in confusion.  Guns
    FIRE, people SCREAM, hit the dirt.

    Superman, in flight, SUPERHEARS Jesse's distant cry for

    Superman slows down to hear more of Jesse's yells.  Nothing.
    He spots something on the ground, and starts to descend.



    Four or five elderly ladies wait.  Superman lands.

    Diners are eating, listening to the sweet sounds of an
    ACCORDION PLAYER.  They start to hear the ROAR of the
    oncoming missile.  Superman BURSTS through the ground with
    another EXPLOSION of rock.  Diners scatter, chairs go over.
    In SLOW MOTION he catches the giant nose-piece of the
    nuclear missile just before impact.
