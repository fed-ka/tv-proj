      FADE IN:*

11EXT. FRONT YARD OF SMALL BUNGALOW - GLASSEL PARK -NIGHT

      A police officer is down and bleeding, is being ministered
      to by paramedics, he is grievously hurt.  We can't see his
      face. 

      Another gun-shot victim, late teens, t-shirt, is pronounced
      dead by EMT technicians.

      In the BG, various uniform cops take statements from three
      Latino teenage girls, various neighbors, the hysterical mother
      of one of the girls, as FID (force investigation division)
      officers arrive.  

      The coroner's van pulls up.  A K-9 unit patrols the grounds,
      as flashlights cross-beam into dark corners around this small
      bungalow.

      In the FG, a young uniform cop, 22, BEN, stands stricken. 

      A crime scene PHOTOGRAPHER stops documenting this chaotic
      scene and calls out to him --

                                      PHOTOGRAPHER
                    You okay, son?

      Ben doesn't answer.

      A bright white flash as the camera freezes on his face, and
      it tranforms into a still photograph. The typed words

                   "BEN - GLASSELL PARK 1:45 AM"

      appear at the bottom of the image and we HEAR OVER the
      anonymous voice of a man.

                                      MAN'S VOICE.
                    Ben Sherman just finished phase one
                    of his probationary training.  He*
                    still needed to have his daily book
                    signed by his training officer if he
                    was going to move on to phase two. 
                    The night had not gone well.

      After credits, we abruptly  --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

22INT.  LYDIA'S APT. MORNING (18 HRS EARLIER)

      LYDIA ENGSTROM, mid 40's, wearing a skirt suit from Kohl's
      and modest heels, is leaving the apartment she shares with
      her mother, ENID.  Puts down her cup of tea, grabs her keys,
      a bagel, and a small black leather duffel bag.

                                      LYDIA
                          (calling out to her)
                    What do you want for dinner?  You
                    want me to pick something up?

                                    ENID ENGSTROM (O.S.)
                    I'm fine.  I'll eat the fish from
                    last night.

                                      LYDIA
                    Alright.  Call me if you change your
                    mind.  Bye, Ma.

33EXT.  LYDIA'S APARTMENT/INT. CAR/STREET - BURBANK

      As Lydia walks down the pathway to her car at the curb. 
      Suddenly, from the bushes...

                                      MAN'S VOICE.
                    Do you want some?

      Lydia stops, can barely make out a man, who is partially
      hidden by the bushes.

                                      LYDIA
                    Excuse me?

                                    MAN
                          (louder now)
                    Do you want some?

                                      LYDIA
                    Gee, do I want some?

      She approaches him, opens her duffel, reaches for something.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Hold on, let me get a closer look. 
                    That way I can make a better decision
                    for myself here.

      He steps out, and from her expression we can tell he is
      exposing himself. Before he knows what has happened, she has
      cuffed him and is marching him towards her car.  Puts him in
      the backseat, careful not to bump his head.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    What's your name and date of birth,
                    sir?


                                                                (CONTINUED)      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                       3.

      Lydia picks up the radio in her car, calls it in as she starts
      the car and pulls out --

                                      LYDIA
                    Good morning.  One King 54.  Show me*
                    Code six at Burbank and Olive with*
                    one in custody --

      The dispatcher obviously recognizes her from her voice --

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hey, Della.  How's your son? 

      She laughs, listens as Della tells her something about her
      kid.

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    That's cute. I've got a 311, Stanley
                    Sidelsky, 8-20-60 --*
                          (as she holds)
                    Thanks, Della.

      Appraises him in the rear view mirror as she drives --

                                      LYDIA (CONT'D)
                    Stanley, you the Valley Molester?

                                    STAN
                    Oh God, no.  Nothing like that.

                                      LYDIA
                    Stan, I gotta tell you, I've seen
                    one before.  You do this to a kid? 
                    That's very, very bad.

                                    STAN
                    I know.

                                      LYDIA
                    What can we do about this?  Have you
                    been in therapy?

                                    STAN
                    I've tried -- lots of different
                      modalities. 

      She turns to look at him.  He starts to cry. Lydia hands him
      a tissue from a box on the dash. *

                                                                                  CUT TO:      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                       4.

44EXT.  PRECINCT PARKING LOT

      As Lydia and Stanley pull in, we pass a group of young uniform
      Cops, watch as they try to find their designated cars and
      training officers in a sea of black and whites.  They carry
      their gear for the day.

      One of them is Ben, who we recognize from the first scene. 
      The other is a female boot, his own age.  She stops walking
      suddenly, just stands there, as the others continue on.

                                      BEATRIZ
                          (to herself)
                    I can't do this.

      Ben has overheard her, stops, looks at her.  We don't get
      the feeling that they are friends particularly.

                                      BEATRIZ (CONT'D)
                    I slept an hour last night, my
                    stomach's been upset for three weeks.  
                    I've got this crazy tic in one eye.

      Ben is torn, wants to go find his training officer, but a
      fellow boot is freaking out. 

                                    BEN
                    One day at a time.  You've heard
                    that, right?

                                      BEATRIZ
                    Yeah, my dad's an alcoholic.

                                    BEN
                    It's one day.  That's all you have
                    to do. 
                          (beat)
                    You can do this.

      She takes a deep breath.  He waits, clearly divided -- 

                                      BEATRIZ
                    Okay.  I can do this.

      As he turns to walk away -- 

                                    BEN
                    That tic is ridiculous.

      He turns back, gives her a killer grin to show he's teasing
      her.  She laughs.  A piercing whistle suddenly.  Ben looks
      over at a man who has his fingers in his mouth, in his early
      40's --

               "JOHN COOPER - NORTH HOLLYWOOD 7:45"



                                                                (CONTINUED)      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                       5.

4CONTINUED:4

                                    JOHN
                    You done?

      When Ben nods yes, John appraises him, from top to bottom --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Look sharp, act sharp, be sharp. 
                    Guys coming out of prison are buff
                    and on drugs.  You do what they teach
                    you in the academy, you will die.

      As they walk towards their car --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                      Knucklehead wants to take your gun. 
                    So, if it's you or some 300 lb. naked
                    guy on PCP, you put him down any way
                    you can.  You have to be able to
                    back your badge.

      If this makes Ben nervous, he doesn't show it. They find
      their car.  John opens the door and recoils from the smell.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Great.  Just what I need, a nice
                    little staph infection.  A detective
                    over at Central's gonna lose her
                    foot.  It's going around.

      Ben has been trained to go through the car, make sure
      everything they need is in place.  As he goes through a
      checklist, shot-guns, radio, etc. Checks the trunk, then

                    of the Academy, what, a month ago?

      Ben nods.

      They pull out of the lot, hit the streets.  They will chase
      the radio, listen to dispatch as calls come out.

                    Said they'd gotten him into trouble
                    his whole life.  I took a Polaroid,
                    put it in my pocket.  Captain shows

      They pass a run down apartment building in North Hollywood. 
      We stay behind, move into the courtyard of the building,
      where a ten year old girl, KAYLA DAVIS, plays ball by herself
      against the side of the building, repeatedly throwing the
      ball, and then catching it with her mit.  Adjacent, two other
      identical buildings, all three stories, all with burnt out
      grass, ill-kempt.  Neighbors are starting their day.  From
      the second floor of her building we see her Dad, BRAD, 36,
      pull the curtains aside to check on her.  Over, WE HEAR the
      repeated percussive THWONK of the ball hitting the wall.

88INT. RUSSELL HOUSE

      RUSSELL, 42, lives in Copland.  Castaic, Simi Valley, Valencia
      and Santa Clarita.  Most cops don't live in Los Angeles
      proper, nor would they want to live in the same community
      where they put people away.  Russell has three teenage
      children who have already left for school, and his irate,
      still good looking wife, DINA, sits in front of a computer. 
      She is blogging as he talks to Lydia.

                                      RUSSELL
                          (laughing)
                    So, wait, he exposed himself to you?

      Dina is annoyed at his complicity with Lydia.  He listens
      for another moment then hangs up.  Leans over to see what
      she is writing.  We can see that her blog is called "I LOVE
      A COP", only because the graphic is big, the rest he can't
      read.

                                      RUSSELL (CONT'D)
                          (imitating her, riffing)
                    "His tour ended at 1, he didn't get
                    home till 5.  Any ideas, ladies?"

                                    DINA
                    You're a dick.

                                      RUSSELL
                    You should consider changing the
                    name to "I hate a cop".

99EXT.  RUSSELL'S HOUSE/STREET - MORNING

      He goes outside, gets into his car and backs up when he sees, 
      across the street and down about two houses --

      A cop neighbor.  He pulls up next to him.

                        "SAL"

      SAL is older than Russell, 45 to his 42, but looks even older. 
      Old acne scars, still handsome.  He is smoking, checking his
      garage sensor to make sure it works, closes tight behind
      him.  We can HEAR a Dog barking down the block. 

                                    SAL
                          (to Russell)
                    I think your wife is blogging my
                    wife.  She's getting all pissy with
                    me suddenly.

      Russell laughs.  The dog continues to bark --

                    No one calls the cops cause they're
                    happy.  We're the first line of
                      accountability in a world where there
                    is no accountability.  We tell you,
                    "no, you can't drink the beer in
                    public" "No, you cannot beat up your

                    So what are you, a little wallflower?

      Just then, a young, thin, very unkempt man flags down their
      cruiser.

                    I can't talk about this now, I gotta
                    get off.

      Nate has two boys and his wife is pregnant again.  The
      pictures on his desk evidence this.  Sal, who we met in Santa
      Clarita, walks in.  He is their boss, a Detective 3.

      He stops in front of the board, studies it a beat, turns to
      Sammy.

                                    SAL
                    You closed Suarez?

      Sammy smiles, proud.

                                    SAL (CONT'D)
                    He copped out to you?

                                      SAMMY
                    I read the transcripts, he confessed*
                      telephonically.  So I went and talked
                    to him.

                                    SAL
                      Excellent.

      A florid cop, ANDY, who looks stuffed into his shirt collar,
      walks in --

                    He raped and murdered this girl last

      Henry Cole gets off the Dash bus.  The sun is hot, glinting
      off the cars that line either side of this wide street.  He
      is talking to his girl on his sister's pink phone when a car
      passes him.

      The car does an abrupt U-turn and pulls up near him.  Three

      They spill from the car.  The two others, DANNY and PANCHO,
      are the same age as Zig-ZAG, all under twenty.  They all
      raise guns and open fire on Henry.  Then, as quickly as they
      arrived, they are gone.  Henry lays still, bleeding out under
      the hot merciless sun.

1818EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET - LATE MORNING

        A hand-lettered sign on a post reads "Fix your accent" with
      a telephone number beside it.  We pan over, next to it, where--

      John and Ben have proned out all three men from the car they
      have stopped.  John was right, wants and warrants have come
      back telling us the car was used in the commission of a
      robbery.  Their guns are on the ground in a little pile. 
      The last suspect, a rough looking woman in her thirties,  is
      already cuffed.  John shoots Ben a look..."do it."

                    Get on your knees and then lay flat

      Ben stops, doesn't know what to do.  Nothing in his training
      prepared him for this. John groans, then pulls him aside.

                                    JOHN
                    When you say please, that's the same

                    I'm not Canadian.

      John gets up to go to the bathroom.  The others continue to
      eat.  Chickie finishes, stands up.  Dewey stands up.  When
      she turns her back to him, he is on her, applying the outlawed
      arm bar choke-hold.  Ben jumps to his feet to help her, but
      she vehemently waves him off, struggles with Dewey.

2222INT.  FOOD COURT - BATHROOM - DAY

      John shakes a lone pill out of plastic container, pops it
      into his mouth, stands rubbing his hip, as Ben comes in --

                    That guy's trying to choke out*
                    Chickie.

      John quickly replaces the pill bottle in his pocket, upset
      that Ben might have seen it.

                                    JOHN
                    Don't worry about it.

      He and Ben head back to the food court, watch Chickie as she
      backs him up into a table and they both go down hard.  She
      has gotten him off of her.  They are both panting hard.

      Nate and Sammy work the scene of the kid's shooting.  Henry
      has already been transported to the hospital.  Both have
      gloves on, are going through evidence, putting up numbered
      plastic flags where there are shell casings.  The Dash bus
      has been retained and the DRIVER and THREE BLACK GIRLS are
      being interviewed by ANDY.  The Girls are crying. KENNY NO-

                    it might be a long wait.

      Kenny  nods.

      Other uniform officers are cordoning off the crime scene, as

      hits the siren and chases him down Sunset for a beat.  The

      move over to the Ferrari.  A young Beverly Hills type is
      fanning the air in the car.

                    Get out of the car now, numbnuts.

      WARD, 23, gets out reluctantly, hands his driver's license
      to John, who studies it for a beat.

      John picks up on Ben's mortification.

                                    JOHN
                    Search the car.

      Ben does.  Holds up a small bag of dope.

                    You're making a big mistake.  You
                    can't search my car without "just

                    like a little kid.  She was pretty
                    though.

      Lydia's interior alarm is now at Code Red.

                    I just get your names right here in

      She hands the pad to him, watches him closely as he writes
      down his name.

3131EXT.  SOUTHEAST STATION - AFTERNOON

      Sal stands watching an attractive news reporter, MIA
      SANCHEZ,as she is about to interview a middle aged black
      man, MALIK COLEMAN.  A crew has set up and is filming her*
      directly in front of the station house.

                                    MIA SANCHEZ
                    A 17 year old boy was shot this
                    morning, and remains in critical
                    condition in what caps several weeks
                    of escalating gang violence.  I'm
                    here with Malik Coleman of Unity 2,*
                    a youth outreach program.  Mr.*
                    Coleman, our mayor is saying these*
                    shootings are not race related.  Do
                    we have a race war on our hands?

                                      MALIK COLEMAN*
                    Yeah, it's racial, we just ain't
                    allowed to say it's racial cause the
                    ACLU and Latino special interest
                    groups won't vote for Mayor "La Raza"
                    again.  Oh, "let's not jump to any
                      assumptions?"  He thinks by saying
                    that, he's headin' off race riots? 
                    There is a segment of Hispanics that
                    wants to efface blacks from the
                      Southwestern United States.  The
                    last twelve been brown shooting down
                    blacks.  The police don't protect,
                    they come to collect. 

      Sammy, Nate, Andy and Kenny No-Gun approach from the parking
      lot, stop to watch. Sal shakes his head, cannot believe this.

                                      MALIK COLEMAN (CONT'D)*
                    Every young African American kid in

      She stops.  Sal walks over to her, as the other Detectives
      enter the building.  He pulls her aside.

      His wife Tammi is high, waiting for Sammy to pick up his
      cell.  She is sitting on the couch with Richter.  His entire
      snout is covered with the day-glo orange powder from the
      giant bag of Dorito's that rests on her lap.  She is  stuffing
      fistfulls of them in her mouth.  Then Richter puts his snout
      in the bag, convulsively wolfing down this forbidden treat
      until she pulls his head out.  They take turns.  When Sammy
      finally picks up --

      We intercut between them --

      She starts to cry, spits the huge mouthful of Dorito's out

                    guns and making you breakfast at

                    Why do you say "deceased" all the
                    time?  Why can't you just say someone
                    died?  Why are they "deceased?" I
                    hate that.

                    It's not that simple.

                    come we don't make love?

      with a type of noose attached in a loop at the ends.  Ben
      tries to shoo away the neighborhood kids, but they keep
      breaking free.  When he has herded them up, John nods at the
      landlord, who opens the door with a key.  Then waits till
      animal control gives the go ahead.

      John and Ben enter next, John holding the flashlight.  He

4242EXT.  SANTA MONICA BLVD - EARLY EVENING

      John and Ben are driving, Ben lethally quiet, when John spots
      a YOUNG WOMAN, walking down the sidewalk by herself, without
      a purse, wearing a tight t-shirt and jeans.  He pulls up*
      just behind her, leans out the window --

                                    JOHN
                    Hey, baby, show me your tits.

      She turns around, angry, then sees it's him, laughs.

              "SHAWNA - SANTA MONICA BLVD. 6:45"

                                      SHAWNA
                    No freebies for you, asshole.

      She leans into the window.  John makes the introductions.

                                    JOHN
                    Shawna, Ben.  Ben, Shawna.

                                    BEN
                    Hey.

                                      SHAWNA
                    Howdy.

                                    JOHN
                    I trained this crazy chick.
                          (to ben)
                    Shawna works Vice in case you didn't
                    guess.  Where's the guys?

      She points to a plain car across the street and down about
      1/2 a block.  John waves to them, then pulls her in close to
      him.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Never, ever lean into the John's
                    side of the car.

      She laughs, kisses him goodbye, starts doing a slow strut
      down the street. John does a u-turn and pulls up alongside
      the plain car.  Inside, two undercover Vice cops with long
      hair, "VID, and EDDIE".  VID has a really bad moustache. An
      embarrased looking ARRESTEE is in the backseat with hand-*
      cuffs on.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                          (referring to Vid's
                            moustache)
                    Oh, Mr. Holmes, could I just touch
                    it once?  I hear it's really big.

      They all crack up.

                    This is Ben.  Meet the two biggest
                      degenerates I have the pleasure of
                    knowing, Vid -- and Eddie.

      They all exchange greetings, then --

                                      EDDIE
                    I'm putting the bracelets on this
                    guy this morning, he says to me "will
                    I get out of jail before my wife
                    gets out of church?"
                          (beat)
                    "Gee, sir, I don't know how to answer
                    that."

      John gestures at the guy in the backseat.

                                    VID

                    Public park that has these huge posted
                    signs every two feet "this area is
                    under surveillance by the LAPD"

      Ben feels bad for the guy in the back seat.

      We adjust FOCUS to PICK UP SHAWNA, leaning into the passenger*
      side of a car, which has pulled up next to her.  They can*
      hear her in their car, she is miked.

      They all laugh.  Suddenly --

                                      SHAWNA (V.O.)
                          (revulsion)

                    She had him.  What's she doing?

                    What's the matter with you?

      Vid is about to put the car in gear, come up on them, Eddie
      puts his hand out to stop him - she is still standing clear
      of the car, doesn't seem to be in danger --

                                      CUSTOMER (V.O.)

                    My wife won't have sex with me since
                    she had the baby.

                    No way.  Kid'll be tossed around
                    like a frisbee for six hours.

                    I'm a cop, you moron!

      The guy leaves tire tracks he pulls away so fast.  Ben looks
      shocked.

4343INT. SOUTHEAST STATION - HOLDING CELL - EVENING

      Andy comes into a cell where a shaved headed guy, MIGUEL
      RAMOS, 22, sits on a bench.  He is covered in tattoos.

                                    ANDY
                    Droopy, what'd you go and kill that

                    I swear, I didn't do that.  It was
                    somebody looks like me.

                                    ANDY
                    I hate when that happens.

                                      MIGUEL
                    Serious, it wasn't me, cuz.
                          (changes the subject)
                    I got a new tattoo.  You always like
                    this shit --

      He pulls up his shirt.  It is a tattoo of a man hanging by a
      noose with the words "Mama Tried" written next to it.

                                    ANDY
                    Good one.  You know that song?

                                      MIGUEL
                    What song?

                    Merle Haggard song, vato.

                                      MIGUEL
                    Could you sing it?

                                    ANDY
                    Can I sing it?

                                      MIGUEL
                    Yeah, man.

                                    ANDY
                    Let me think.
                          (closes his eyes for
                            a beat, hums and
                            then sings)
                    I turned 21 in prison doing life
                    without parole, no one could steer
                    me right.  But Mama tried, Mama tried.

                                      MIGUEL
                          (grins big)
                    That's good man, I like that.

      Andy sits down.

                    Kid got shot this morning.  Sounds

                                      MIGUEL
                    No, man.  That wasn't us. I heard
                    about that.  That was Avenues for
                    sure.

                                    ANDY
                    Why would Avenues come all the way
                    over here?  That makes no sense.

                                      MIGUEL
                    They're trying to consolidate and

                    Alright.  See you around, Droopy.

      Miguel makes like there is a noose around his neck and he is

      Janila's mom, LAVONNE, arrives in the upstairs area, spots
      Janila and moves towards her.  Sammy and Nate come out of
      the interview room, someone called and gave them a heads up.

                                      LAVONNE

      Sammy shakes his head in frustration.

                    I don't want to offend you, but 
                    this was an attempted murder and
                    they were witnesses.

      has put on huge fluffy slippers and a t-shirt that reads
      "when it rains, it pours," sits across from them without
      saying a word.  Behind them, in the kitchen, a huge middle
      aged man, WILL, hovers menacingly.

                    When we spoke earlier you said you

      Will shrugs.  He's not leaving.  Sammy stands up to go.  So
      does Nate.  Donna walks them to the door.

                                      DONNA
                    You gotta understand.  I lost two

      been set up now and will remain through the night or until
      the little girl is found.  A van is setting up equipment to
      broadcast with reporters.  Brad is waiting for his sponsor,
      ELLIS, who has just arrived, to be let through by the cops. 
      Ellis puts his arms around him, hugs him.

      Maria and Russell pull up in his car.  Both remain quiet. 
      Maria watches as Ellis hugs Brad.

      VERNITA, Henry's mom, has been allowed in to the intensive*
      care unit and stands near her son.  He is unconcious, alive. 
      She is crying.  She kisses his hand, then worries about it.

      She comes out to talk to Nate and Sammy who are waiting with
      Shamika.  Shamika goes in, pulls up a chair near Henry.

      Sammy takes Vernita over to a little waiting area, Nate goes
      to get her a cup of coffee.

      Dewey and Chickie have arrived as back up.  They are all
      outside of their patrol cars, a few houses down from the

                                    JOHN
                    This isn't a SWAT callout.  Bunch of*

      The noise from the back of the house is even louder now --
      MUSIC, SHOUTING, GLASS BREAKING.  As they begin to move --

                    Cuff first and then search.

      Ben nods, he remembers the drill.  Once they are close to
      the house, they pull out their guns.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      LAPD - "Pilot" FULL BLUE  -  9-9-08                      54.

      John comes around the house first, followed by Ben.  Three
      small chihuahuas begin to go nuts.

      The Three Gangbangers who shot Henry, ZIG-ZAG, PANCHO, and*
      DANNY, have been partying with THREE GIRLS. Pancho is very*
      drunk, he is making out with one of the girls, as her MOTHER,*
      a small woman, pulls at him.  Another girl is puking in the*
      bushes.  Danny and Zig-Zag are sitting with the third girl
      on Danny's lap, they are throwing empty bottles against a*
      wall, where they are breaking. 

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Stand up and put your hands in the
                    air, now!

      Danny doesn't move, his hand reaches for a gun.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    I will shoot you through your head. 
                    Put your hands in the air, now!!

      Danny does.  The girl on his lap is laughing.  John pulls
      her off of him and stands Danny up.  Takes his gun, turns
      him around and cuffs him.  Roughly knocks his legs out from
      under him and Danny goes down.  John prones him out, puts a
      foot up on his back to keep him there.  He turns to see that --

      Chickie has gotten Pancho off the girl, has proned him out,
      and cuffed him.

      Dewey has Zig-Zag cuffed.  Ben begins to search him.

      All three gangbangers are speaking in Spanish, it is spooking
      Dewey, as is the very LOUD MUSIC and the dogs BARKING. 

                                      DEWEY
                    Take him outside, down on the lawn.

                                    BEN
                            (protesting)
                    I haven't finished --

                                      DEWEY
                          (interrupting him,
                            shouting)
                    What are you --generation why?  I
                    ask you to do something, you do it! 
                    I'm your senior officer.*

      Dewey grabs Zig-Zag, takes him down the steps and out on the
      tarmac.  Then goes to check inside the car in the driveway
      to make sure it's not an ambush.  As he does --

                                      ZIG-ZAG
                    How you doing?

                                      ZIG-ZAG
                    Good, cause you look like a dead man
                    to me.  You just got temporary use
                    of your arms and legs.

                                      DEWEY
                    Shut your fucking mouth.

      Zig-Zag has reached for a gun still tucked in his back waist,
      and turns around, still hand-cuffed, and SHOOTS Dewey.

      Ben, from the porch, turns and fires, shooting Zig-Zag in
      the chest and blowing him two feet down the driveway.

      Pancho has lept to his feet and sprinted off while Chickie
      has turned away.  She has no idea which way he went.  She
      gets on the radio to call for a helicopter.

      Both shot men lay in the driveway.  John is already on the
      radio --

                                    JOHN
                    Officer down, shots fired.  Roll me
                    an AR now!*

      As he moves to Dewey, who is still alive and mumbling.  Tries
      to comfort him and perform rudimentary life-saving techniques.
      Zig-Zag is dead.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Sit down.

      They both sit down on the porch, watch as Dewey, still
      thrashing around, is loaded into the ambulance.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Where'd you learn to shoot like that,
                    the Beverly Hills Gun Club?

      Ben's taken it all day, he's had enough.

                                    BEN
                    Why don't you shut the hell up, sir?

      John laughs.

                                    JOHN
                    Right in his ten-ring.  Superb.

      Then, gesturing at Dewey -- angry --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    The fuzz that was.

      When Ben turns to look at him --

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    He should have vested out ten years
                    ago.  He was a crap magnet.  Nothing
                    worse than a twenty year dinosaur
                    with a drinking problem. 
                          (softening)
                    I liked the guy, alright?  But you
                    want to put a gun in your mouth,
                    pull the trigger before someone else
                    gets hurt.  He was on a last chance
                    contract.  Did that change a freaking
                    thing?  No. 

      A car pulls up and disgorges two men.  Internal affairs --
      FID, force investigation division.  They go over to the
      Captain who told John not to sit with Ben.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)

                    This is "warn a brother." You don't
                    lie.  That's how they get you.  Lying
                    is worse than an out of policy
                    shooting, so just tell it the way it
                    happened, you'll be fine.  No big

                          (beat)
                    You'll get over it.  They'll send

                    bed, you put on your gun, and your

      A long beat.

                                    JOHN (CONT'D)
                    You know why?

      Ben looks at him, waits --

                    Cause it's a front row seat to the
                    greatest show on earth.

      Ben has just had it, he puts his head in his hands.

                    Can you abuse it?  Yes, sir.  You
                    can and you will, I guarantee it.
                          (beat)
                    Because it is relentless and it gets
                    to you and it seems like it changes
                    nothing.  But a day like today --
                    with some interesting capers and a
                    few good arrests?  That's pretty
                    good.  But once in awhile, you take
                    a bad guy off the streets for good? 
                    That's doing God's work.

      He turns to leave, throws Ben his rookie book, which he has
      already signed.

      Lydia pulls up in her car on a side street.  It has started
      to rain.  She doesn't walk towards Brad's apartment, but
      away from it, towards the other building where Dwayne lives
      and she saw the ants.  She is walking away from the cops and
      media which has now trickled down to one van.  She turns
      into the courtyard of the other building, most of the lights
      are out.  She moves towards the stairs, goes up to Dwayne's
      floor, trying to find the ants.  She stands there, in the
      dark hallway, on the second floor, and sees the ants now,
      leaving Dwayne's apartment.  She follows them to a doorway
      two apartments down, where they disappear under the door. 
      She is standing in the shadows and doesn't see the large man
      come up behind her and strike her.  She goes down hard.

      parking lot of a bar.  He is sitting in his car, trying to
      make a decision.  He sees the vanity plates belonging to Mia
      Sanchez that read "sxy nwscstr." He can't decide what to do,
      just sits there, finally turns on his windshield wipers.

      Lydia comes to.  She is sitting out of the rain, against a
      wall.  Across from her is ARSHAM, the Armenian man who lives
      with his mother.  He is holding her gun, is very agitated. 
      Lydia shakes her head, trying to clear it, puts her hand up
      and feels blood.

                    It's Arsham, right?  Is that your

                    I didn't want to hurt her.  But you
                    know, she starts screaming and I
                    panic so I put my hand over her mouth.

                                      LYDIA
                    I need to go in your apartment and
                    find her, Arsham.

      She stands up, and so does he.  He looms over her, starts to
      pace.

                    I'm going to go in now.

      She doesn't care if he shoots her.  She walks into the
      apartment, which is dark.  Feels for a light switch.  The
      ants are swarming towards one of the bedrooms.  She moves
      towards it, opens the door to his bedroom.  The ants are
      moving towards the closet.  She opens the door.  

      We cut to his mother, AGATA, who is now in the doorway in
      her bathrobe.

                    What do you do, Arsham?!  What do
                    you do?

      She starts to cry and shout.

      He lets her, as his mother continues to scream.

      quiet.  She can't stop thinking about what happened.

8181INT.  HOSPITAL - NIGHT

      Shamika has decided to spend the night, waiting for Henry to
      wake up.  She is still reading "Beloved."  Ben is at the
      nursing desk talking to a nurse. 

                                    BEN
                    His name is Dewey.
                          (occurs to him)
                    That's probably a nickname.

      As she continues to look --

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    He's a cop.

      She nods, knows exactly who he is asking about --

                                      NURSE
                    He's in surgery.

                                    BEN
                    Is it okay if I wait?

      She gestures at the waiting area, help yourself.  Ben sits
      down, across from Shamika.  A long beat.  Then --

                                    BEN (CONT'D)
                    I like that book. 

      Shamika looks up,studies him for a beat.

                                      SHAMIKA
                    How come you read this book? 

      Ben is going to lie, but then decides not to --

                                    BEN
                    My black studies class.

      She shrugs dismissively and goes back to her reading.  After
      a beat--

                                      SHAMIKA
                    For real?

      He nods yes. They both can't help smiling now.  Such a relief
      to find anything amusing.

                                    BEN
                    I'm sorry.  Is he going to be okay?

                                      SHAMIKA
                    They say so.

                                    BEN
                    Alright, good.  That's good.

                    He's sleeping right now.

      Ben nods again.  After a beat.

                    You a cop?

      Ben is quiet for a long beat.  Then he makes a private,
      pivotal decision and looks up at her.

                                    BEN
                    Yeah.  I am.
                          (lighter, joking)
                    We have a look or something?

                          (points at his head)
                    It's the hair, that's all.

                          (kidding her)
                    I don't look mean or anything?

      She shakes her head no, they both continue to smile, in on
      the joke of this horrible day, pleased they found a little
      common ground.

                                                                                CUT TO:*

      from his beer, which he is still holding.  Puts the pills
      back in his pocket.  Rubs his hip.

      A young, very good looking man has come in, stands watching

      The man approaches, holds out his hand.  There are two lines
      of meth or coke or something on his palm.

                    You just bought something.

      John approaches him, pours beer into his hand, ruining the
      drugs.

                                    JOHN
                    You think I would risk a $90,000

                    of ass-whupping down on your head.

      The man moves off.  John rubs his hip again and tries to
      straighten up.  His back hurts and his legs hurt.  He moves
      out into the main room, sits down at the still jumping bar. 
      There are no women here.  John sips his beer.  The man next
      to him turns to him.

                    I had the day from hell.  I got
                    arrested.

      John turns to look at him.  We recognize him as the guy from
      the back of the Vice car who they arrested.  John moves over
      a seat, just wants to drink his beer in peace.  Dead silence,
