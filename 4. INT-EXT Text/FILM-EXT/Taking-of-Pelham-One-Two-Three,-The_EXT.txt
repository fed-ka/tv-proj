Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual
face is visible because of his thick white hair, large
bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The
rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He
wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered
package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing
it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker --
"Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears
quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than
he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs,
