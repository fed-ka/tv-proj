      Farmland stretches to the horizon, shimmering in a heat haze.  
      Panning, we discover A BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising ominously 
      from the landscape, like a Kansas tornado.  As a fire engine 
      SIREN wails louder --


      Follow SMOKE wafting up from burned-out wreckage to FIND --

      Jane, Lisbon, Cho, Van Pelt and Rigsby being led across 
      smoking ruins by Marquesa Police Chief TREY PILLER, 30.  
      Piller s got the genial noblesse oblige of a former high 
      school football star, but it doesn t quite hide his stress.  
      Farmland all around, but it s parched and dry, the corn only 
      half-grown.  FIRETRUCKS and looky-loos in the b.g.

                                  LISBON
                    Chief Piller, why the firetrucks?  
                    Shouldn t they be gone by now? 

                                  PILLER
                    Took forever to put the fire out.  
                    Not enough pressure for the hoses, 
                    see, not with this drought.  Rich 
                    Garcia had the best corn in the 
                    county, and now look.

      They reach a burned-out hulk of a car.  Piller points to it.

                                  PILLER (CONT D)
                    That s where we found him.  What 
                    was left.  Hardly enough for Susan 
                    and Madeleine to bury.

      Piller s a little upset.  Jaw clenched tight, red-eyed.

                                  JANE
                    Tough to lose a comrade, uh?

                    Yup.

                    Probably saved your life more than

                                  JANE
                    You ve been crying.  You re not the

                    reason.  And that s a National

                    We were with the 3-192 Armor.  Two 
                    tours in Anbar.  You re the arson 
                      specialist? 

                                  LISBON 
                    No.  That would be Agent Rigsby. 
                    Mr. Jane is... a consultant.

                                  PILLER
                          (eyes Rigsby)
                    You ll be able to tell, right?  
                      Definitively.  Whether the fire was 
                    an accident, arson, whatever?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Two years with the San Diego County 
                    arson squad, Chief.  I ll be able 
                    to tell.  

      Rigsby is just a little psyched to get to use his expertise.  
      Especially in front of Van Pelt.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    Chief Piller, you and your men 
                    haven t contaminated the scene, 
                    correct?

                                  PILLER
                    My men?  It s just me and Terry 
                    O Brien, Agent.  But yes, we did 
                    like you said -- haven t set foot 
                    after we pulled Rich out.

                                  RIGSBY
                    OK, so to determine if it s arson, 
                    I ll need to analyze the burn path, 
                    find the point of origin, check for 
                    signs of accelerant --

      He sees something.  Goes over to a charred piece of wood with 
        a carbonized lock on it.  Picks it up and examines it.  
      Trying to hide his disappointment --

                    Yes.  Even more so when it s 
                    coupled with murder.

                                  CHO
                    I m not seeing a spot where he

      Lisbon confers with Piller, Rigsby, Cho and Van Pelt.  Jane

                    Well, sure, now that you mention 
                    it, Dave was kind of in business 
                    with them.  With Rich and Trey and 
                    Ben.

                                  CHO
                    What kind of business?

                                  SUSAN
                    Real estate.  Mar Verde Real Estate 
                      Corporation, they called it. 

                                  CHO
                    Big operation?

                          (wry laugh)
                    Lord, no.  Started out, it was just 
                    a way of giving Dave Martin a place 
                    to live.  Rich and the others in 
                    the unit convinced him to move to 
                    Marquesa with them after mustering 
                    out.  You know, no man left behind 
                    and all.  Even Dave.

                                  CHO
                    He had problems?

                    He was an ornery drunk basically.

                    his Guard buddies.  They got 
                    together and bought a five acre 
                    piece of land from the town, up at

                    Idea was Dave would work it up into 
                      a specialty market type farm -- you 
                    know, high-end produce and such.  
                     Course he didn t do a damn thing

                    Oh, it took  em forever to get the

                      silliness.  I told Rich don t waste 
                    your time.  Land s worth nothing 
                    anyhow, not since the water ran 
                    dry.  But they always had some kind 
                    of cockamamie scheme going.  
                    Petting Zoo.  Golf Range.  Tommy

                    I... I guess that s right.


      Tommy Olds  beat-up TRAILER sits on blocks at the edge of the 
      property.  A tall fence around much of the dry, brown land.  
      Nearby is some equipment, and a sign for Mar Verde Development 
      Co.  Lisbon and Jane examine the area, and an odd tower 
      structure.  Lisbon s on the phone with Cho.

                                  LISBON
                      Interesting.  Yeah, we re at 
                    Alton's Grove, they re building 
                    something here all right.  Call me 
                    when you ve spoken with Machado. 

      She hangs up.  She sees a FLASH out of the corner of her eye 
      at the window of the trailer.  Turns, but there s nothing.  
      His back still to the trailer --

                                  JANE
                    We have an audience.  

      A face appears at the window.  Tommy.  Lisbon gives a 
      tentative wave --        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     25.



      Lisbon emerges to see Jane heading up the hill toward the 
      fence just beyond the trailer.  She catches up to him --

                                  LISBON
                    Jane?  What is up with you?  Eww.

      She looks down.  Her foot has squished into mud.  The mud 
      puddle extends to the fence gate.

                                  JANE
                    Exactly.

      He throws open the gate...

      It s an oasis in a desert.

      BACK TO JANE AND LISBON

      As they go inside the mini-Shan-gri-La.

                                  LISBON 
                    All this green... But there s a 
                    drought.  

      Jane treads on the ground in the middle of the garden.  It s 
      sodden, water soaking everything.

                                  JANE
                    Not at Alton s Grove there s not.

      Tommy has entered, a shy smile. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Do you like it?  I got geraniums,

                    will make me move out, I won t have 
                    nowhere to live.

      Lisbon kneels, presses the ground beneath her.  It wells like 
      a squeezed sponge.

                                  LISBON
                    It s just coming up from the

                                  JANE 
                    It s an aquifer.  A new source of 
                      groundwater.

                                  LISBON
                    Got to be worth millions.

                    Worth killing for.


      A nice large place.  The CBI car parked in the drive.  Cho 
      and Van Pelt KNOCK on the big front door.  (Note:  they are 
      not wearing clothing that would indicate they are police.)

      Suddenly BANG!  Their car s window explodes as a bullet ZINGS 
      between Cho and Van Pelt.  They dive to the ground behind a 
      tree --

      BEHIND THE TREE

      They hurriedly draw their weapons as another bullet plugs the 
      tree just over their heads.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I guess we found Machado.

      ANGLE -- Machado rising from cover, very scared, holding a 
      semi-automatic rifle.

      Van Pelt holds up her badge so that Machado can see it.  
      Machado s relieved, and a little embarrassed.

                    Crap.  Okay, don t shoot.

                                  JANE
                    The assault was self-defense and 
                    the accelerant was a plant.  But go

      The CBI vehicle drives away.  A light in the house goes on, 
      and Machado s silhouette is visible as he paces nervously.


      An odd KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCKING brings Machado to the front door, 
      rifle in hand.  Machado peers out the door, gun at the ready.

      AT THE BARN, the barn door CLAPS rhythmically.  Deliberately.    
      Machado cocks his weapon and moves toward the barn... 


      The barn door suddenly stops clapping.  Machado creeps to the 
      barn, gun levelled, hoping to catch the intruder by surprise. 

      The BARN DOOR CLOSES behind him with a bang.

      INSERT -- OUTSIDE, HANDS DROP THE CROSSBEAM INTO PLACE,

                          (deadpan)
                    Jane.  You scared us.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     46.

      CONTINUED:3636

                                  JANE
                    Scared myself.  Door jammed.  Where 
                    the hell were you guys?   

                                  RIGSBY
                    We called in to say we were 
                    checking out a lead.  

                                  CHO
                    Of course, Lisbon didn t know you 
                    were about to pull an idiotic 
                    stunt.  Sorry.

                                  JANE 
                    No harm done.  Arrest this man.  He 
                    confessed to killing Dave Martin.

                                  CHO 
                    Cool.

      Machado already on his knees, Cho puts cuffs on him.  Just 
      then, Rigsby taps Jane on the shoulder, points.  Crouched 
      behind a tree, watching the blaze, a SILHOUETTED MALE 
      FIGURE...

      When he sees Rigsby coming toward him, the mystery man runs.  
      Rigsby pursues him.  

                                  JANE
                    I ll... just wait here.

      A ROLLING CRASH BANG O.S.

                                  RIGSBY (O.S.)
                          (yelling)
                    FREEZE! 

      On Jane and Cho.


      Lisbon s car outside.  As Lisbon and Jane go inside, on the 
      windshield... a drop of rain.  Then another.        THE MENTALIST     "Flame Red"     SALMON 11/04/08     53.



      Raining harder now.  The drought is over.  Jane and Lisbon on 
      the porch, watching it.

                                  LISBON
                    So...

                                  JANE
                    So?

                                  LISBON
                    Seems like maybe this whole thing 
                    has changed your mind a little 
                    about taking personal revenge.   

                                  JANE
                    Goodness, no.  Not at all. 

                                  LISBON
                     Revenge is for fools and madmen ?  

                                  JANE
                    That was rather good, wasn t it?  
                    Complete bull, but good. 

      And they sprint for the car through the rain.  Off them -- 

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                        THE END
