
    LOIS suddenly bursts through the rear doors of the baggage 
    terminal building, running at full speed.

                                    LOIS
                         (yelling)
                   Stop!  Stop!

    Two THIEVES (#1 and #2), dressed as airline baggage
    handlers, flee on a little baggage tractor, pulling several
    open carts of luggage.  Lois sprints across the concrete,
    legs driving, arms pumping, and leaps onto the last cart.
    She starts climbing her way forward. Thief #1 starts
    hurling luggage at her from the first cart, trying to knock
    her off, as Thief #2 drives faster and faster.


 2  CLARK                                                             2   

    suddenly steps out of another door in the terminal and for
    the first time hears Lois's cries.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois?!

    Spotting the trouble, he reaches to loosen his tie as he
    dashes forward.  He passes behind another luggage cart piled
    high with baggage and when he emerges from the other side,
    he's SUPERMAN, disappearing in a streak.


 3  THIEF #2                                                          3   

    a look of horror on his face, slams on the brakes and stops
    the tractor; he was about to run into Superman.  Thief #1
    catapults back into his seat.

                                    THIEF #1
                         (groaning)
                   Oh, man...

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Gee, that must've been painful.

    Superman steps close, his arms blur, and a second later he's 
    tied the two thieves wrists to the steering wheel with their
    windbreakers.  Lois runs up from the last cart.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Lois, are you okay?

                                    LOIS
                   They couldn't've hit me if I'd been
                   standing next to them!

                                    SUPERMAN
                         (smiles)
                   Wait right here.  I've gotta drop 
                   them off at the police, then I'll 
                   see you home.

                                    LOIS
                   You don't have to do that.

                                    SUPERMAN

                         (mimics his tone)
                   Superman...

    The two thieves perk up; is this a little domestic spat 
    they're watching?  Embarrassed, Superman gestures Lois a few 
    steps away.  They speak in whispers.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Lois, I'd feel better if you'd wait 
                   for me.  It's going to be dark 
                   soon.

                                    LOIS
                   Clark, I've driven home alone for 
                   as long as you've known me.  And 
                   like two million times before that.
                   I'll be fine.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   But...

                                    LOIS
                   Look, okay, I admit, ever since I 
                   figured out... you know... maybe 
                   I've taken a few more chances 
                   because I always know you'll be 
                   there.  But it's not like I'm six, 
                   Clark.  I can cross the street 
                   _fine_.

    Superman relents.  He can't help it.  He loves her.

    Lois smiles and leaves.  Superman turns back to the two 
    hapless thieves.

                         (to himself)
                   Don't get me started.

    He reaches to untie the thieves.

                                                       CUT TO


    Lois drives her Jeep along the empty road.



    A 1972 Cutlass 442 convertible, stacked high with personal
    belongings, is parked in front; the passenger door hangs 
    open, more belongings spilled onto the sidewalk.  Lois pulls 
    up in her Jeep behind it.

    She drags herself out.  She carries notepads, purse, and a 
    bulging canvas tote bag slung over one shoulder.  The tote 
    bag has the Daily Planet logo and "Lois Lane" embroidered on 
    it.  Lois looks shook-up and uncertain.  STAR ADAMS, a young 
    woman about the same age as Lois, is energetically moving 
    stuff from the Cutlass to the lobby.  She's dressed in 
    casual, but funky clothes and wears a small crystal on a 
    chain around her neck.  Star notices Lois heading up the 
    steps and brightly turns to greet her.  She always speaks in 
    bursts.

                                    STAR
                   Oh. wow!  Don't tell me _you_ live
                   here!  This is so cool!  You're 
                   Lois Lane, right?  The Daily 
                   Planet?  That must be a great place
                   to work.  I don't have a 
                   subscription, but I really love the 
                   logo.  I'm your new neighbor: Star.

    Lois feels flattered at being recognized and it brings her 
    partially out of her preoccupation.

                                    LOIS
                   Hi. It's, uh, not often I meet
                   people who recognize me.

                                    STAR
                   Oh, I didn't!  I've never seen you 
                   before in my life.  Not even a
                   picture!  If you were a snake you 
                   could've bit me.

                                    LOIS
                         (a shade annoyed)
                   Then what are you; like, psychic?

                                    STAR
                   Yeah!  You, too?!

                                    LOIS
                   No.  But how'd you know my name?

                   I got it off your tote bag.
                         (hands her a card)
                   I do psychic counseling and
                   channeling, but don't worry, I'm
                   really quiet.  Occasionally, I _do_ 
                   do hypnosis and tarot and crystal 
                   healing, but I _never_ do any of 
                   the dark stuff.  Too scary.  I'm a 
                   Pisces, at least in this life, but 
                   I have been a Taurus; wow, was that 
                   bad.  So did you just come in from 
                   a story or something, you look 
                   really whipped.

                                    LOIS
                   Um... yeah.  I was out on a...
                   story.

    Lois starts to move to the door.  Star suddenly puts her 
    fingers to her temples and closes her eyes.

                                    STAR
                   Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
                         (opens her eyes)
                   You don't really have to close your 
                   eyes, but most people expect it.  
                   I'm getting... I'm seeing... 
                   something more than a story 
                   happened to you tonight.

    Lois is suddenly very uncomfortable.  She tries to get past 
    a mound of Star's belongings.

                                    LOIS
                   Nope.  Just... a boring old story.  
                   Nothing to get brainscanned over 
                   and... anyway... I like to keep my 
                   brain private.

                                    STAR
                   Oh, I'm not prying.  Your mind's
                   practically shouting.

                                    LOIS
                   It is?

                                    STAR
                   Lemme see, you were... buying 
                   groceries and met Mel Gibson.  No, 
                   that's not it.  You... just came 
                   into a lot of money, but it doesn't 
                   belong to you.  You stole it.  No, 
                   that's someone upstairs.  You... 
                   went for a drive...

    Lois plummets earthward, disappearing into a cloud.  Clark
    plunges in after her, loosening his collar as he goes.  Lois

                   Don't worry, Lois. I've got you.

    Lois doesn't speak; she just nods.

                   He's fine.  Lucky I heard him

                   Man, Lois, you were like Greg 
                   Louganis.  Whooosh, right out the 
                   door.

                                    LOIS
                   I... I must've slipped.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Jimmy, why don't you go get Lois's
                   car.
                         (to Lois)
                   I think you've had enough flying
                   for the day.

                   Sure thing.

    He runs off.

                   And I think _we_ should have a 
                   conversation with Dr. Solsvig.

    CUT TO:



    Lois parks her Jeep about a block from the Planet; it's the 
    closest space she could get.  She and Clark get out.  They 
    start walking towards the Planet.

                                    CLARK
                   The thing I don't understand is, 
                   what would you jumping out of a 
                   helicopter have to do with aliens?

                                    LOIS
                   I haven't the faintest.

    Lois checks her watch.  It's 3 o'clock.  The trance-like 
    expression returns to her face, but Clark doesn't notice.
    Lois peels out of frame as Clark continues to speak.

                                    CLARK
                   I mean, in Close Encounters, 
                   Richard Dreyfuss was drawn to the 
                   mountain, but what could've been 
                   drawing you?  The ground?  It 
                   doesn't make sense.  It's just 
                   lucky I was there.  You know, 
                   that's my nightmare, you'll get in 
                   trouble and I'm not there.  That's 
                   why when you --

    The blasting horn of a semi-truck cuts Clark off.  He spins 
    towards the street and WE SEE that Lois is walking down the 
    middle of the street straight towards the speeding truck!  
    The truck blasts it's horn again.

    With no time to change into Superman, cups his hands to his 
    mouth as he pretends to cough and SUPERBLOWS Lois up into 
    the air and out of the path of the truck.  Then, still 
    hiding his breathing with his hands, he GENTLY BLOWS a 
    supporting cushion of air and lowers Lois softly to the far 
    sidewalk.  He zigzags across the street to her.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois....

    But Lois is still in the trance.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Lois!  Listen to me, it's me, 
                   _Clark_.

    He shakes her and her eyes slowly clear.  A scared look 
    wrinkles her face.

                                    LOIS
                   It happened again, didn't it?

                                    CLARK
                   You nearly became a hood ornament.
                   Come on, I'm going to take you
                   home.

    Clark firmly takes hold of her hand and they walk back
    towards the Jeep.



    Clark, driving the Jeep, parks in front of the building. He
    and Lois get out and pause on the sidewalk, mesmerized by
    what they see.


24  LOIS AND CLARK'S POV - A NEON SIGN                               24   

    That shines brightly in a first floor window. It reads:
    "Psychic Channeling and Advice by Star".

                                    LOIS
                   Unbelievable.

    A second later, a man dressed in a bad, homemade set of
    clothes who looks like Ben Franklin, sprightly steps out the
    front door and waves back at Star, who's opened the window
    next to the sign.

                                    STAR
                   See you next week, Mr.
                   Schaffenberger!

                                    STAR (CONT'D)
                         (to Lois and Clark)
                   That's Mr. Schaffenberger.  Ever 
                   since he got hit by lightning, he's 
                   thought he's Ben Franklin.  I've 
                   been helping him reach Thomas 
                   Jefferson; they're working on a 
                   revision of the Declaration of 
                   Independence.  Ooops, gotta get 
                   ready for my next appointment.

    Star waves goodbye and disappears back into the recesses of 
    her apartment.  Lois looks at Clark.

                                    LOIS
                   Maybe you're not the only alien on
                   the planet.

                                    CLARK
                   She seems good hearted.

                                    LOIS
                   Actually, she is.  That's what's so
                   creepy.

    They both laugh.  Lois starts to go in and Clark follows.  
    Lois stops.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   Where're you going?

                                    CLARK
                   I thought... I mean
                         (confused)
                   ... I just... felt... you might not 
                   want to be alone right now.

                                    LOIS
                   Clark, I appreciate your concern,
                   but I'll be fine.

                                    CLARK
                   How do you know?

                                    LOIS
                   I _know_, now _go_.  Besides... 
                         (putting on a brave 
                          front)
                   ... you can't babysit me 24 hours a 
                   day, other people need you, too.

    She leans up and kisses him, then makes a shoo-ing motion 
    with her hand.  Clark reluctantly nods, and leaves.

    Lois heads for her entrance, but is cut-off by a WOMAN
    rushing ahead of her.  The WOMAN carries a ventriloquist's
    DUMMY on one arm.

                                    DUMMY
                   I hate it when you make me late!

                                    WOMAN
                   I don't know why you keep going to
                   her, she's a nut!

                                    DUMMY
                   She's a nut? _She's_ a nut?!  Who
                   diagnosed termites when nobody else
                   could find anything?  Huh?  Huh?!

    And as the bickering pair enters, Lois takes a final glance
    at the neon sign and goes in.



    Clark and a very determined Lois march towards the building.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, it's the oldest trick in the
                   book.

                                    LOIS
                   Clark, who's the best poker player 
                   at the Planet?  You're talking to 
                   the Queen of Bluff.  If I can't 
                   maneuver him into talking, no one can.

    Clark gives a dubious look.



    Lois and Clark pass several people, chatting.

                                    LOIS
                         (sotto)
                   What's he doing now?

    Clark turns back with his X-RAY VISION.


42  CLARK'S X-RAY POV - (SPECIAL EFFECT)                             42   

    Fences is just turning off his computer screen, whatever was
    on it shrinking to a dot.

    Clark shakes his head.

                                    CLARK
                   Nothing.  Something was on his
                   computer, but he turned it off just
                   before I could read it.

                                    LOIS
                   Did you hear anything?

                                    CLARK
                   They're out of three-hole paper.
                   Otherwise, too many people.

                                    LOIS
                         (sighs)
                   So much for spooking him into
                   giving himself away.

                                    CLARK
                   Lucky he doesn't play poker.

    Lois gives Clark the eye.
