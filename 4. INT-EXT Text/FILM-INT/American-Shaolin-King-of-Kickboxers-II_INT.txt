ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.
The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old
and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would
be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered
sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is
typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the
students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is
a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth
shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.
ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT
Struggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is
trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He
drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside
him.
YOUNG ADULT
Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes...
Sifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he
walks past the student.
KWAN
At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks
trained in iron palm until our hands bled...
(beat)
... then we trained some more.
He walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind.
YOUNG ADULT
(getting back into horse stance)
I guess not...
ANGLE ON KWAN
As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is
moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and
rearranges her hands.
KWAN
Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!
He
moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward
the
door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door.
It
is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As
he
is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.
STUDENT
Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce
Lee...
KWAN
Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in
flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is
effective. Show me.
The boy shrugs
and then
starts throwing side kicks. Kwan
is half
looking at the
boy and
half looking towards the door and
the clock.
The boy throws
three or
four kicks and then stops. He is
watching
Kwan watching
the door.
Kwan sees him, and turns back to
him.
KWAN (CONT'D)
(shaking his head)
A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never
mind.
He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door.
Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the
master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't
know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is
doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS.
RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles
widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously
hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and
underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit,
while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They
are all very impressed.
KWAN (CONT'D)
Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen
uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.
I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!
This last he says looking at the empty door.
MOTHER
I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.
KWAN
Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors
depend on heart and soul  that's how they saved the
T'ang emporer.
He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering
his students around him.
KWAN (CONT'D)
Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.
(to class)
During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the
martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er...
fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But,
there was also time for individual training  where skills were honed
like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.
He turns to go.
One of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat.
STUDENT 2
What do you want us to do?
KWAN
When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the
cliff. Understand?
STUDENT 2
No.
The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused.
KWAN
No matter.
He exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him.
They look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.
The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu
and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the
spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW
CARSON, a
muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare
shoulders,
moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu
maneuvers.
He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot
wax on his
skin (INSERT).
In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.
ANGLE ON KWAN
Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching
Drew.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body
moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.
Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts
instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls
but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and
Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost
move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping
Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is
lit by the TV screen.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who, for the first time, sees that it is Kwan.
DREW
MASTER KWAN!
He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.
He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax.
It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's
chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to
wipe the hot wax off.
DREW (CONT'D)
Master Kwan! I'm sorry, very sorry!
KWAN
(blustering)
I'm OK, never mind! What are you doing anyway?
DREW
Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling
the already hard wax off his chest.
DREW
Practicing. I saw it in this movie...
Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of
him.
KWAN
Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this...
Should study tapes of opponent.
DREW
I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had
tapes to study... they did it this way... right?
KWAN
Not quite  our drills at the temple had meaning. If we
had tapes, we would have watched them.
Drew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.
KWAN (CONT'D)
"The
warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win
100
times in 100 battles." Study the tapes I gave you.
All
these years of one on one training  you're the best
I've
ever taught.
DREW
The best?
KWAN
Best white boy, maybe. Just fight like a Shaolin warrior
 the rest will take care of itself.
(picks up tape)
Face reality, before it breaks your jaw!
Drew holds out his hand for the tape, and Kwan slaps it into his
hand. Drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the VCR, when
Drew's stepfather, BOB, walks in. He is a big, overweight man, and he
is very angry.
BOB
(shouting)
Are you screwing around with this stuff again?
DREW
Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?
BOB
It's your attitude that bothers me, son.
DREW
I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.
It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension
in the room, and starts to say something.
BOB
(cutting him off)
Don't say a word, yellow man.
REACTION SHOT OF KWAN
Closing his already opened mouth.
BOB (CONT'D)
You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were
taken care of... after. At least respect my wishes, and
make something of yourself... Stop wasting your time!
DREW
(sarcastic)
When I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going
to let you be part of my entourage...
BOB
You mean when you're in jail...
DREW
Just leave me alone, Bob, OK? I NEVER asked for anything
from you.
He spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the
workout room, leaving Bob and Kwan standing alone.
Kwan looks at Bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.
KWAN
Pressure. Big tournament this weekend.
He starts to walk out, but Bob follows him.
BOB
How would you have liked having to take care of a kid you
never really wanted... ?
KWAN
I wish I had the chance...
Kwan exits, and we...
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR BEING PAMPERED BY HIS ENTOURAGE
The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure
and another is doing a manicure. An exercise physiologist is going
over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old Korean master,
MASTER KIM, comes into the room.
TREVOR
Ah, Master Kim.
(to physiologist)
I'll look at these stats later.
Trevor indicates a seat near him, much lower than the one he is
sitting in. The Korean master prefers to remain standing.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Are all you guys named Kim? So, what did you think?
KIM
(thick accent)
You velly good fighter...
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Learn English, will ya? And, tell me something I don't
know...
KIM
A mountain lion doesn't ponder his weakness, and is
therefore vulnerable.
TREVOR
(after a beat)
Well, I'm pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap.
(beat)
You're history. Chaunce, get ride of the bum.
The butler, CHAUNCY, comes forward and walks up to Master Kim.
CHAUNCY
Very good, sir.
TREVOR
Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to
the left, Sam.
The masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
It's hard being me, you know. So much pressure...
ESTABLISHING MONTAGE OF TOURNAMENT: CROWDS AND COMPETITORS.
(SOME IDEAS, NOT IN ORDER)
Competitors warming up (wall front stretch, very high; one guy
kicking another in the head  tap, tap, tap; two man routine
practicing  another one jumps in?; two beautiful girls sparring;
crowd assembling; group of kids waiting  call comes over public
address system, they run off; stand outside selling high tech
equipment; different styles of fighter's clothes  camo, stars &
stripes, "headhunter"; stern 9 year old girl doing kata; two toddlers
barely seen through their safety equipment fighting furiously; two
twins doing identical kata; breaking; etc.)
ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN
Walk into the area  Drew is dressed in the ill-fitting handmade suit
by Mrs. Rodriguez. People recognize him as he walks past.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Making his entrance. He is in a perfectly laundered and pressed suit,
and his assistant is carrying another suit pressed and ready to go.
COMPETITOR
Hey, Trevor! What's the 2nd uniform for?
TREVOR
The finals.
COMPETITOR
(after he's gone)
Cocky bastard...
ANGLE ON TREVOR
As he wins a fight.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he wins.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Drew watching, as he wins again.
DREW AGAIN
Winning. The stage is set for the finals.
ANGLE ON THE RING
Drew and Trevor are already inside, waiting. Drew fights in a mish
mosh of gear (different colors, different makes), while Trevor is
decked out in designer, personalized gear.
ANNOUNCER
Fighting for the Grand Championship: Trevor Gottitall and
Drew Carson. 3 rounds, max point. Gentlemen, bow to the
ref, to each other...
The referee gives them a signal and the fight begins. Drew is holding
his own, but Trevor is scoring. After several flashy moves, the round
is over.
Score: 6 - 1. We see Trevor's cheerleaders cheering.
ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER
Where he is given mineral water to drink, his shoulders are massaged,
etc.
ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER
Kwan sheepishly offers him a sip of water from a battered paper cup.
2nd round: Drew's getting beaten worse than the first round. Nothing
he tries works. The score at the end of the round is 15 - 4, in favor
of Trevor.
ROUNDBREAK
Drew is exhausted, frustrated and worried. Trevor is pumped and ready
to go on forever.
KWAN
You only lose if you give up.
ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER
The psychologist is exhorting him to destroy Drew. Trevor leans back
on his padded stool, smiling.
The 3rd round starts. In this round, Trevor is destroying Drew,
making him look ridiculous. A clinch comes, and
(INSERT HERE) before they can break, Trevor grabs the drawstring
around Drew's waist and pulls.
They face off ("20 seconds" comes the call), and Trevor charges. As
Drew blocks, his pants begin to sag. Trevor, not trying to score,
just trying to keep Drew's hands busy, keeps coming.
Drew's pants drop lower and lower.
When they get around his knees, he finally notices them, and reaches
down to get them. Trevor drives and picks him up in a throw,
effectively showing Drew's bare ass to the world.
CUT AWAY to crowd laughing, girls shocked, cameras poised and
recording, one mom puts her hands over her daughter's eyes, etc.
Trevor dumps Drew and scores the final point, just as time runs out.
A buzzer goes off, signaling the end of the round.
Trevor thrusts his fists into the air in celebration. Drew tries to
crawl out of the ring, and everyone is watching him.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANGLE ON TREVOR
As he is being interviewed by tv reporters.
TREVOR
I was never worried. He's no match for me. I just hope
the 2nd place trophy is a belt!
Crowd laughs, Trevor's entourage laughs the hardest.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he packs up his stuff.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SMOKING ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLE, ITS TIP EMBEDDED IN
DREW'S FOREARM.
Kwan's hand COMES INTO FRAME and flicks the needle, sending it
vibrating back and forth.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew sitting at the table in Kwan's
house, the acupuncture needle in his arm and his face pensive and
sad. Kwan busies himself around the needle, trying to alleviate the
pain of Drew's bruises.
KWAN
Next time we get that guy...
DREW
(shaking his head)
No next time, Master. Maybe...
(big sigh)
... you should find a new student. I just can't do it 
I'm not getting any better!
KWAN (CONT'D)
Don't talk like that. At Shaolin...
He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew
looks at him funny  this is very against his character.
KWAN (CONT'D)
I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the
time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was
coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers
stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought.
It was all we had left to eat  no more money. These were
hard times in China, people were selling their children
for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop
soldiers with guns, though? Yes?
He pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it
and turning it slightly this way and that.
KWAN (CONT'D)
Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of
the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back.
Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and
the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street,
and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers,
and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing
with the dust of the street.
Kwan smiles with the memory  it is a sweet and heroic one.
KWAN (CONT'D)
The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us,
touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I
watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was
larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed
then and there to become like him, fight for right like
the Shaolin.
He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why
he is telling him this story.
KWAN (CONT'D)
I never did, though. My family left China and ended up
here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in
China.
DREW
You mean... all the stories...?
KWAN
(nodding)
Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I
realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself
that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other
people.
DREW
Why are you telling me this?
KWAN
I've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was
never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have
all the potential in the world, but I can't take you
where you want to go.
Kwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where
it was with a cotton ball.
KWAN (CONT'D)
There, that should control the swelling.
He watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said.
DREW
So you're not a Shaolin?
KWAN
No.
DREW
Never were?
KWAN
No.
Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his
face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.
KWAN (CONT'D)
What?
DREW
If you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one.
KWAN
What are you talking about?
DREW
I'm going to the Shaolin Temple  they can train me so I
will never lose like that again.
Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's
eyes.
KWAN
He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold
cloth.
He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.
DREW
(eyes intent)
Don't you
see? You said
yourself I needed the right
training 
where better
than the Shaolin Temple? What's
holding me
here? I have
the chance to do what you
couldn't.
I will go to
the Shaolin Temple.
Kwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving
the idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew.
KWAN
I must pay for your ticket...
DREW
No! I'll make it there myself.
KWAN
I grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be
those stories. You can live my dream for me  at least
let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble
he's caused.
Kwan touches Drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. Drew
nods his head, then bows in the traditional Chinese manner.
DREW
Master...
MONTAGE OF DEPARTURE
ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN AS KWAN HANDS HIM A "NORTHWEST AIRLINES"
TICKET.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he packs for China.
ANGLE ON KWAN AND DREW
As Kwan drops drew off at the AIRPORT. Drew takes his suitcase and
walks into the airport.
There are no seats. Drew takes his pack off and sits on it.
Next to him is an old man, his teeth red and rotted from betel nut
juice. The man smiles at Drew.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW GETTING OFF THE TRAIN.
He stops on the platform for a moment, a huge colorful Chinese
billboard in the b.g. A transit cop quickly comes up to him and prods
him into motion. Drew walks on, passing a sign that reads "Luoyang".
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE INTERIOR AS DREW OPENS THE HEAVY DOOR.
The muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of
the day outside. Drew quietly closes the front door, and the half
light takes over.
He walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a MONTAGE of
temple shots, establishing the feeling of the
temple:
the famous Shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the
floor of
the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the
temple,
the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the
ceiling,
a huge wooden carving of
Bodhidharma, etc.
No one is around.
Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders
into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING.
Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense
burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in
rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes
are open, but they don't seem to see him.
He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall.
He goes into a corridor, then passes the "Wooden Man Chamber".
HE STICKS HIS HEAD IN, AND SEES ALL KINDS OF WOODEN STATUES LINED UP.
HE ALMOST STARTS IN, BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE SOUNDS OF TRAINING
OUTSIDE (O.S.). HE WALKS OUT IN SEARCH OF THE SOUNDS.
The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more,
moving with the beat, until they stop chanting.
Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.
DREW
That was great! Great!
The monks finally take notice of him, and they are shocked.
MONK 1
No tourists! Temple closed!
DREW
So you can see me?!?
Several monks rush up and start herding Drew towards the exit.
MONK 1
(very agitated)
No tourists! No tourists!
Drew stops their progress and makes sure he has the monk's attention.
DREW (CONT'D)
I'm not a tourist! I want to be a monk!
The monk stops, his face a mask of shock. He calls to another monk,
and they have a short conversation in Chinese.
ADMISSIONS MONK
That's not possible.
DREW
What do you mean, sir?
ADMISSIONS MONK
The training is too difficult. Besides, Shaolin policy is
no foreigners.
DREW
I didn't come all this way, from America, to get turned
away. I want in. I want to become a Shaolin monk.
ADMISSIONS MONK
What people want and what they can have are often not the
same.
DREW
Not in this case.
MONK
Oh, yes, especially in this case.
DREW
I'm not leaving.
Drew starts to sit down, intent on staying, almost like a kid who is
going to hold his breath until he turns blue.
MONK
You give me no choice.
(to other monks)
Remove him.
He continues in a stream of Chinese, and the other monks grab Drew
and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the
door.
DREW
I just want to be a monk!
Drew is forced through the courtyard to the front door.
They pass the monk who was sweeping up in the back of the temple. He
watches with interest as they open the door and force Drew through
it, out of the temple.
He smiles.
CUT TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR OF TEMPLE.
The line of disciples has stopped, waiting for Drew. Drew, back pack
in hand, takes his place at the end of the line.
They parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside
the temple.
As they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are
put out by the fact that Drew is among them.
Several of the disciples turn around to look at Drew, and a couple
are openly hostile to him.
They file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each
holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple.
A gong sounds, and the questions begin.
ANGLE ON FIRST DISCIPLE
Who is asked...
MONK
Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin patriarchs?
DISCIPLE 1
Yes, without pause.
ANGLE ON DREW
MONK
Do you renounce the earthly world?
DREW
Sure do, master. You bet.
The monk pauses, for that is not the ritual answer to the question.
The Drill Sergeant comes up to him and whispers in his ear, and the
monk then continues.
MONK
Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it
means death?
DREW
I do.
The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side
with his elbow.
DRILL SERGEANT
(whispering)
Answer "Yes, without pause."
DREW
(rubbing his side)
Yes, without pause.
ANGLE ON ANOTHER DISCIPLE
MONK
Who is the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple?
DISCIPLE 2
Bodhidharma.
ANGLE ON DREW
MONK
Do you accept the shr fu at the Shaolin Temple as your
spiritual leaders?
DREW
Yes, without pause.
The Drill Sergeant nods his head.
MONK
Will a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal
gain?
Drew pauses, looking at the Drill Sergeant. The D.S. nods, urging him
on.
DREW
Yes, without pause.
The D.S. puts his hands over his eyes.
DREW (CONT'D)
I mean, no, of course not.
Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded.
A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows
down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards
the raised platform in the center.
Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure.
It is San De!
San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then
clears his throat.
Everyone stands up again.
SAN DE
Do these disciples accept the authority of the Shaolin
Temple?
DRILL SERGEANT
Yes, without pause, Master San De.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who now knows that the monk he called a "Janitor" is the headmaster!
DREW
(under his breath)
I'll be damned!
The DISCIPLE next to him, GAO, pokes him sharply in the ribs.
GAO
Shut up!
DREW
(holding his side)
Oh, unbelievable, in the same place...
SAN DE
Are they ready to begin their training?
DRILL SERGEANT
They are.
SAN DE
Then, let us welcome them into our ranks!
Gongs go off, firecrackers are set off, and a special flag is raised
on the flag pole. A roar comes from the crowd outside.
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
All of whom are happy. All, that is, except for Gao, who is staring
at Drew.
Drew, notices the stare.
DREW
You got a problem, man?
GAO
You, American...
ANGLE ON SAN DE
When the noise subsides.
SAN DE
Your training begins tomorrow. For now, your shr fu will
introduce you to our temple. Welcome to Shaolin.
San De walks away, and the disciples are split into several
"platoons". Drew is matched up with the Drill Sergeant, and Gao is
also in his group.
DREW
Great, just great.
They are motioned to follow Gao out of the courtyard and into the
temple proper.
Drew walks behind the other disciples, who are lining up to get their
robes. As he takes his place in line, a monk comes up to take Drew's
backpack. Drew resists, and a tug of war ensues.
DREW
What are you doing, man?
MONK
You must surrender this.
DREW
No way, man! Get your own...
The Drill Sergeant sees the scuffle and walks over.
D.S.
It is unseemly to argue like this. Take the backpack into
the sleeping quarters.
(to Drew)
Do not cling to material things  it is not good for your
soul.
He walks away, and Drew reluctantly gives up his backpack.
Drew lines back up, and is about to get his robes, when Gao slides
over and takes them from him. Drew immediately shoves him and tries
to grab the robes back. Gao smiles and moves away, holding the robes
up and away from Drew.
Drew is pissed and ready to go after Gao. Before he can, however, LI,
another disciple, grabs another set of robes from the table and gives
it to Drew, pulling him away from the confrontation.
DREW (CONT'D)
What's with that guy?
LI
Watch out for Gao. He's trouble.
DREW
Really? I hadn't noticed... Why'd they let him in,
anyway?
LI
Who knows? Maybe for the challenge?
DREW
No, that was me...
They both smile and walk off.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS HAVING THEIR HEADS SHAVED.
THE CAMERA MOVES DOWN the line of monks, as their hair is shaved off
in clumps. Drew is standing next to his chair, arguing with the D.S.
about the haircut.
DREW
Mr. James designs my hair, master. I don't think...
D.S.
This will symbolize your final break from the outside
world.
DREW (CONT'D)
Can't I just wear a patch?
The D.S. shakes his head, and Drew sits down, unhappy.
The barber starts on Drew's head, big clumps of hair falling down to
the floor.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS, AS THE MONKS FILE IN,
LED BY THE D.S.
A number of cots are lined up side by side. The D.S. has assigned a
bed to each monk. Drew finds his bed, which is right next to Gao's.
GAO
I want another bed.
D.S.
Why?
GAO (CONT'D)
I won't sleep next to the American.
D.S.
We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or Mongol. We
are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk.
GAO (CONT'D)
Well, this monk smells!
Drew unconsciously smells himself. He shakes his head.
Li goes up to the D.S. and points to the bed he was assigned.
LI
I will switch with Disciple Gao.
D.S. nods, and then starts for the door.
D.S.
Go to sleep. No talking! We have an early day of training
tomorrow.
Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew
with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very
secretively since the D.S. is watching.
DREW
Jerk!
Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into
their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and
Drew stares up at the ceiling.
DREW (CONT'D)
Thanks for what you did.
LI
Where are you from?
DREW
New York City. You?
LI
Beijing. What is New York like?
DREW
Amazing. I'll tell you about...
GAO
Shut UP!
DREW
Blow me!
Drew waits for a moment, fearful that the D.S. will be coming back
in. He doesn't.
DREW (CONT'D)
Good night, Li.
LI
Wan an.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANGLE ON DREW, SLEEPING
All is quiet.
Suddenly, a huge stick ENTERS FRAME, and it pauses for a moment above
Drew, before THUMPING down on top of him.
Drew cries out when he is hit, and jumps out of bed, looking all
around him. No one is there. A few of the disciples are moving around
because he yelled, but there is nothing else there.
Drew, belatedly, gets into a fighting stance, but no other attack is
coming.
ANGLE ON GAO
Who seems to be sleeping peacefully.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he climbs back into bed, bone-weary. He lies back down to sleep.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LATRINE.
Drew stumbles in, bleary-eyed,
to relieve himself. He stands at the
urinal, relaxing as he starts.
Suddenly, a huge stick WHACKS Drew
across the rear end, the SOUND
reverberating through the latrine.
Drew yelps and jumps, looking
around for the attacker.
No one is there, and his underwear is now all wet.
ESTABLISHING TIGHT SHOT OF RICE GRUEL ("WATER RICE"), A SPOON
STIRRING THE MEAGER MIXTURE.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew sitting with Li and some other
disciples.
Drew makes a face.
DREW
You got to be kidding.
The D.S. comes up behind and grabs the bowl from him.
D.S.
You don't like it, don't eat it.
He takes the bowl away.
DREW (CONT'D)
I didn't say I wasn't going to eat it... Geez!
He turns to the rest of the disciples.
DREW (CONT'D)
Well, at least we start training today, right, guys?
A chorus of Yeahs.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DORM ROOM, ALL THE DISCIPLES CHANGING INTO THEIR
WORKOUT CLOTHES.
They are the standard fighting monk issue  suitable for martial arts
training.
DREW
Wonder what they'll start us with first?
LI
Iron Palm?
SHU
Wooden Man, I think.
WU
No, it'll be basics, first day. Horse stance, kicks and
punches...
When they are all dressed, they run out of the room.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES ALL IN BED.
They are exhausted from their work. Drew is lying in bed, his eyes
wide open, ready to get attacked.
ANGLE ON DREW
As his eyes go closed, finally.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES, DREW IN THE MIDDLE, SITTING IN ROWS
IN THE INCENSE-FILLED MEDITATION CHAMBER.
The monk in charge of the chamber is talking to them.
MEDITATION MONK
Breath in through your nose, out through your mouth.
Imagine yourself sitting on the bank of a river watching
your thoughts flow by. Clear your mind... Think of
nothing.
Drew sits, trying to think of nothing. He is not succeeding.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WASHING DISHES, ALONE IN THE KITCHEN AREA.
He bends over to get a dish, when a pole comes and SMACKS him on the
rear end. He turns immediately in one direction, but gets hit again
from the OTHER direction.
Drew is furious, and he can't even see the attacker.
DREW
Come out, goddamn it! Show yourself!
No answer, as we HOLD on Drew looking around.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP OF DISCIPLES SEATED ON ROUND PILLOWS
PRACTISING ZAZEN, SITTING MEDITATION.
Drew is in the center of the room, and the sound of light snoring is
heard.
ANGLE ON DREW
It is him, he is asleep!
Suddenly, a bamboo shinai is SLAMMED across Drew's back, waking him
up.
MEDITATION MONK
Bodhidharma meditated for 9 years without sleeping. Think
you can manage 9 minutes?
ANGLE ON DREW
Who is holding court.
DREW
We came here to train, not to be slaves! We're free
men...
MU
But we swore to obey them...
DREW
An uninformed choice is no choice at all!
MU
Huh?
DREW
We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even
know we're dissatisfied, things will never change.
GAO
They haven't changed for centuries, why should we listen
to you?
DREW
Are we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd?
WU
I'm with you!
The others are with him too, except for Gao. They are ready to
explode, and Drew has the match.
DREW
I'm for going to the Headmaster right now!
They are all ready. They head for the door, but Gao doesn't move.
Drew stops at the door and turns to Gao.
DREW (CONT'D)
You're either with us, Gao, or you're against us.
No answer from Gao. They exit the room.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND THE BOYS RUSHING DOWN THE CORRIDOR,
HEADING FOR SAN DE'S QUARTERS.
ANGLE ON D.S.
Heading for the same place but from a different direction.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE SAN DE'S CHAMBERS.
Drew goes to knock on the door, when it opens and San De is standing
there. The D.S. has just arrived. He looks at San De for
instructions, but San De indicates that he will deal with them.
DREW
Master San De!
SAN DE
Who else?
DREW
We have something to say...
SAN DE
This is an interesting coincidence, as I was just on my
way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all.
DREW
I request permission to go first.
SAN DE
I think I'd better...
DREW
No, really, I want to...
San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority.
SAN DE
Here at the temple,
we use a period of intense physical
labor to test your
patience, and to teach you humility
and self-reliance.
As you continue training, you will be
given chores every
day  remember the first time you saw
me I was sweeping?
Physical labor keeps us humble.
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
Who tonight have been anything but humble.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
You've all performed
admirably, and have learned an
important lesson  to
obey your shr fu without question.
Because of this, I've
decided to begin your martial
training sooner than
what is prescribed. Tomorrow
morning.
The disciples can hardly believe their luck.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
And, what did you have to say to me?
ANGLE ON DREW
Who is sputtering now.
DREW
I... I mean we, just wanted to... thank you for the
opportunity to be part of the illustrious history of the
Shaolin Temple.
(beat)
Yeah, that's it. Right, guys?
They all say "Thank you" as one, and then bow to the headmaster with
their hands clasped in front of them. They turn away and head down
the hallway.
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
As they increase their pace, almost running through the halls with
their excitement.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DOOR TO THE SLEEPING QUARTERS.
Suddenly, it BURSTS open and in come the disciples, led by Drew. They
fan out into the room, Drew in the center.
DREW
Gentlemen, this calls for a party!
He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and
puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll.
Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most
accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad.
The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic.
Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines (old stuff 
the swim, the twist, etc.). Everyone is having a great time.
ANGLE ON GAO
Glowering, as he moves toward the boom box.
He reaches for the "Stop" button.
Drew blocks the arm, and a pushing and shoving match starts.
GAO
You're trying to get us all kicked out!
DREW
I'm just trying to have a party. Chill out!
They push and shove into the middle of the room, a couple of kicks
and punches thrown, then they face off, ready to duke it out.
The party is raging, while Gao and Drew are the only ones static, set
to do battle.
Just then, the door starts to open. Everyone freezes and looks toward
the door, including Gao. Drew, meanwhile, has the presence of mind to
jump onto the boom box, shutting it off and hiding it with his body.
ANGLE ON DOOR
As the D.S. opens it and sticks his head in.
He surveys the room, seeing the tableau of frozen monks, with Drew
lying on his bed.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who waves to the D.S.
ANGLE ON THE D.S.
Who knows that something is going on.
D.S.
Go to sleep. Lights out.
He hits the lights and then closes the door. In the semi-darkness the
room relaxes in a collective sigh. Drew stands up and packs up the
stereo.
Gao walks over past Drew.
GAO
It's not over, American.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHAMBER FULL OF FIGHTING MONKS, ALL GOING
THROUGH THE SAME SET OF MOVEMENTS.
Kick. Punch.
Kick. Punch.
INTERCUT of feet striking the stone floor, depressions in the floor
testifying to the centuries of training this chamber has seen.
Through the door come the D.S., Drew and the others. They line up
along one wall, watching the fighting monks go through their form.
It is beautiful: powerful, graceful and intimidating.
Their form done, they file out of the chamber, leaving the D.S. with
his group, along with one fighting monk. The D.S. motions for them to
line up as the monks had.
D.S.
You will train 6 days a week, from 5 am to 9 p.m.,
alternating with work and meditation. Sunday afternoon is
free time.
D.S. lets that sink in, then motions for the monk to take over.
MONK
In order to keep our bodies strong, Bodhidharma gave us a
series of exercises and breathing techniques. Because the
times demanded action, we developed Shaolin style wu shu
from these exercises.
He goes through a couple of martial movements.
MONK (CONT'D)
The spirit of Bodhidharma remains. Training is like
meditation. Be aware of everything, but aware of nothing
in particular. Think not thinking.
DREW
What do you mean, 'Think not thinking'?
MONK
Non thinking.
ANGLE ON DREW
Confused.
ANGLE ON MONK
Who doesn't explain any further.
MONK (CONT'D)
Your training begins today, in this most sacred of
training halls. The floor bears witness to the efforts of
fighting monks from centuries past.
ANGLE ON FLOOR
Where there are depressions and worn spots, the result of thousands
of hours of training.
MONK (CONT'D)
At the Shaolin temple, we forge our bodies in the fire of
our wills. We adhere to a vow of non-violence, unless
someone else is in danger... Follow my movements...
He starts moving through a series of techniques, and the rest of the
disciples try to mimic his actions. He is moving around the room, and
they are trying to do what he is doing.
Some are getting it, some aren't.
Drew, used to a more individualized type of training, isn't getting
it.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUPS WORKING OUT.
Drew is in with the group. Gao and Drew are chosen to do a training
exercise together.
D.S.
In this exercise, you try to touch your partner's chest
lightly, and your partner tries to block.
The group gets started doing the drill, and Gao is almost caving
Drew's chest in with his blows. He is so close to Drew that Drew
doesn't have a chance to block it. On the last strike, Drew falls
back to the ground.
The D.S. is there immediately.
D.S.
Something wrong?
Drew shakes his head and gets back up.
D.S.
Switch!
Now it's Drew's turn to strike, and he tries to hit Gao with the same
amount of force as he did, but Gao avoids his attack, throwing him
off balance. He throws another punch out, and Gao grabs it and pulls.
Drew falls to the floor again. A monk who was watching walks over.
MONK
The goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner. Just
try to tap his chest.
DREW
I know, but...
MONK
Then do it that way...
The Monk walks away, shaking his head.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING INTO THE CHAMBER.
This is the chamber where they had their first workout, and Drew just
stands there for a moment, soaking up the tradition of it.
He walks to an area of the chamber under the famous painting and
stands staring at it.
QUICK CUTS to different ANGLES of the painting.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who begins to sweep.
His broom is going over the depressions where the monks train, and
soon he loses his desire to sweep. He takes the broom in his hand as
a weapon and starts to spin it, going through a martial arts form,
his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the floor.
He finishes with a flourish, having moved into a shadowy area in a
corner, and then bows to an imaginary crowd, using the broom as a
microphone.
DREW
(imitating an announcer)
Presenting, the greatest fighter in the history of the
Shaolin temple... Drew Carson!
Drew holds his broom over his head, nodding his head to the imaginary
crowd.
DREW
The crowd is going wild.
Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into
Drew's unprotected stomach!
Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee,
and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach.
Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and
sends him pitching to the floor.
ANGLE ON DREW
As he lands face down in the pile of dust and dirt he already swept
up.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE BREWING TEA.
The room is filled with paintings and scrolls. A Golden Sash hangs in
a place of honor.
San De
puts the tea
leaves into the pot, then soaks them with boiling
water.
He pours the
water out, then repeats the process several
times.
His movements
are all very precise and careful  it almost
looks
like a martial
art kata.
SAN DE
Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while
meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction
we all have to fight against.
San De looks pointedly at Drew, who doesn't meet his eyes.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
When he awoke, he was so enraged at his eyelids for
betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the
ground.
(beat)
From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even
the leaves look like eyelids.
San De shows Drew a tea leaf.
DREW
Impossible.
SAN DE
Nothing is impossible if your spirit is pure, and your
will is strong.
The tea is ready, and San De begins to pour for Drew.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
I understand you've been questioning some of the
teachings of the temple...
DREW
It's just not the way I was taught...
San De keeps pouring into Drew's cup. It is getting to the rim. San
De is not stopping.
DREW (CONT'D)
Master! Stop! No more will go in!
San De continues pouring until the tea runs all over the table.
SAN DE
Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have
learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first
empty your cup?
He picks up the cup and tosses the tea through an open window. He now
pours into the empty cup.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
The rules and disciplines of the temple exist to free
you, not restrict you. They keep your mind from harmful
thoughts.
(beat)
Drink your tea.
Drew nods and sips at his tea.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DORM ROOM, LI STANDING IN FRONT OF DREW, THE
REST OF THE DISCIPLES GATHERED AROUND.
The room is dark  it's after lights out.
LI
Are you nuts? We can't go to a party, with GIRLS!
DREW
Why not? We're working hard, we deserve some R & R.
LI
'R & R'?
DREW
We've earned this. Back home in New York, you don't say
no to a party... Where's your sense of adventure?
WU
What do you do at a 'party' with girls?
Drew smiles, knowing that he has them.
DREW
You dance, and talk. And have a good time.
LI
That clinches it, we can't dance.
WU
And we don't know how to talk to girls...
DREW
(trying to sound like an expert)
That's easy. You just talk to them like you would to the
guys  you just don't tell them as much, and... not in
the same way...
Drew is in over his head.
GAO
Like you know?
DREW
Look, dancing's easy. I'll show you. We'll start with
slow dancing.
An OOOH escapes from the guys.
DREW (CONT'D)
Dirty dancing!
Giggles now. Drew pulls his boom box out of his backpack, and starts
searching for a suitable tape.
DREW (CONT'D)
You guys grab a pillow for a partner, while I find some
slow music.
The disciples have grabbed their pillows. Drew pops the cassette into
his boom box and turns it on, low and sultry.
DREW (CONT'D)
Just move in time to the music, nothing elaborate. Think
of it as a soft form...
The disciples move and sway in time to the music. They are treating
their pillows like imaginary girls.
ANGLE ON LI
Who is holding his pillow at arm's length.
DREW WALKS BY LI
DREW (CONT'D)
Loosen up, Li. She's not going to bite!
LI
How do you know?
ANGLE ON WU
Who is really getting into it. He is dancing with his pillow cheek to
cheek, and occasionally sneaking a kiss.
ANGLE ON OTHER MONKS
Practicing their dancing and preparing for the party.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who sits back on his bed, his hands clasped behind his head.
DREW
This is going to be great...
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES
Still moving and swaying to the music.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES
Now asleep and in bed, still clutching their pillows like they were
girls.
ANGLE ON DOOR
As it opens. The D.S. looks in on the room, and sees all the kids
holding their pillows. He shakes his head and then closes the door.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, GAO AND SAN DE IN THE SHADOWS OF SAN DE'S
ROOM.
San De is sitting down reading a Buddhist text. With a sigh, he puts
it down. On the wall behind is hanging a Golden Sash.
SAN DE
So soon?
(beat)
Tell me what happened.
Drew looks at Gao, and Gao looks at Drew. There is a pause, one that
is very uncomfortable. Finally, Drew speaks.
DREW
It was my fault. I started it.
ANGLE ON GAO
Surprised at Drew's confession.
DREW (CONT'D)
Disciple Gao was better than me.
Drew pauses, and Gao is even more surprised at the revelation.
DREW (CONT'D)
I lost my temper. He was only defending himself.
ANGLE ON SAN DE
Who nods his head and looks at Drew.
SAN DE
Is this true, Disciple Gao?
Gao looks at Drew, wondering what he should say. Drew looks at him,
nodding for him to say yes.
GAO
Yes. But, I am not completely blameless...
SAN DE
I didn't think you were...
(beat)
The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We
challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other.
Never do we fight to see who is best  we train to be
able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet
express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch
or kick in anger.
(beat)
Shake hands and let your emotions go.
Gao looks at Drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept
away in the shock of Drew taking the blame.
They shake hands.
Both Drew and Gao notice the Golden Sash hanging on the wall. It is
occupying a place of honor.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
That is the Golden Sash, the highest honor of the temple.
It is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle
of understanding.
DREW
The best fighter?
SAN DE
Among other things. Fighting is only a small part of
being a Shaolin monk.
GAO
Yours?
San De nods.
SAN DE
Return to your training.
Drew and Gao get up, bow to San De and head for the door.
They get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they
jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door.
Finally, Drew tires of the game and opens the door for Gao.
DREW
Ten more seconds and I would have kicked your ass...
Gao smiles and walks through the door. Just as he passes Drew, he
punches him in the stomach.
GAO
In your dreams...
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES GETTING READY TO GO OUT.
They are dressed in "street" clothes and are just pulling on their
hats. Drew, instead of wearing his temple-issue hat, pulls on a New
York Yankees baseball cap!
DREW
Now, we're ready!
He leads them towards the window of their dorm, but stops when he
gets there. He turns to where Gao is standing, all alone.
DREW (CONT'D)
Gao, you coming or what?
There is a moment of indecision, then Gao frowns, shakes his head and
comes jogging towards them.
GAO
I'm coming, just to keep you out of trouble!
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARTY.
It isn't happening. The boys are on one side, the girls are on the
other. The music is bad Chinese rock and roll.
The only ones together are Drew and Ashema, who are talking in the
center of the room. The disciples are all clustered together, staring
at the walls and the ceiling. A group of giggle girls are standing
around Drew and Ashema.
A group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room,
observing everything that's going on.
ANGLE ON DREW AND ASHEMA
DREW
Great party...
Ashema smiles a sheepish smile. Drew decides that if they are going
to have a good time, he's going to have a hand in it. He pulls out a
cassette tape, gives it to Ashema
DREW (CONT'D)
Play this when I signal, OK?
She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come
over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girls
DREW (CONT'D)
Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of
China...
He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls.
DREW (CONT'D)
This is Gao. And this wild man is Li...
Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing
them to stand with the girls for a moment. When everyone is paired
off, he motions to Ashema.
DREW (CONT'D)
Hit it!
INSERT of Ashema's finger on the tape player "PLAY" button.
ANGLE ON THE ROOM
As the song the disciples have been singing in the fields blasts out.
Immediately, the disciples start moving with the music, and suddenly
the
Party is happening.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES
Who are now slow dancing to a romantic melody  some holding the
girls closer than others. Drew and Ashema are locked in an embrace,
their eyes closed.
A hand comes in and taps Drew on the shoulder.
DREW
(eyes still closed)
Not now, Li...
The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard.
Drew opens his eyes, and sees that he is surrounded by five tough
guys, dressed in dark clothes and with sunglasses on.
DREW (CONT'D)
What can I do for you?
TOUGH
Leave.
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES.
They have noticed what is going on.
ANGLE ON DREW
DREW
No, thanks.
He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls,
away from danger.
The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs
has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping
over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of
him.
Drew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight.
DREW (CONT'D)
Can't we talk this over?
The tough pulls his fist back to strike Drew, who has been grabbed by
two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back.
Suddenly, a figure FLIES in and SLAMS the tough to the ground.
It is Gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. The room
ERUPTS in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs.
The girls are SCREAMING as the boys kick and punch.
The disciples are winning, having a great time, until the door to the
room SLAMS open and the HEADMISTRESS comes storming in, screaming at
the top of her lungs for them to stop.
ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND THE DISCIPLES
As they all agree as one to hightail out of there. They go running
past the Headmistress and out the door, full speed.
ESTABLISHING SHOT AS THE LAST DISCIPLE CLIMBS THROUGH THE WINDOW  IT
IS DREW.
He lands on the hardwood floor, panting his lungs out after the run.
After a BEAT, he lifts his head and looks right at Gao.
DREW
Did you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble?
The group pauses for a BEAT, then they all laugh, relaxing.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO CARRYING A PLATE OF CHINESE FOOD OVER TO A
TABLE WHERE THE DISCIPLES EATING, THEIR EYES SCANNING THE ROOM FOR
SIGNS OF WARNING.
Gao sits down and looks around. They are all dressed in their
training clothes, dirtied after a full day of training.
GAO
I can't believe nobody's said anything! It's been a whole
day!
LI
We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we
get away with it?
DREW
I think we might have. If they knew, they'd have already
gotten us! You guys just have to stop looking so guilty.
ANGLE ON WU
Who pushes his dinner away from him.
WU
I've lost my appetite.
DREW
Let's go back to the dorm for a few minutes, go over our
stories in case they seperate us...
He gets up to leave, and the others follow him.
LI
Seperate us?
DREW AND THE OTHERS ARE FRANTIC.
DREW
Cops! Somebody called the cops?!?
Before anyone can answer, the door opens and the D.S. walks into the
room, his face serious.
D.S.
Drew! Come with me to San De's chamber...
He turns to go, but the others are on their feet, ready to follow
Drew.
D.S.
Just Drew.
Drew looks at them and shrugs, then follows the D.S.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE AND THE GIRLS SCHOOL HEADMISTRESS.
Also in the room are two high-ranking police officials. The
Headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and San De is just
sitting there, letting her vent. She has obviously been going at it
for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. She stops when
Drew and the D.S. enter and points an accusing finger at Drew.
HEADMISTRESS
He's the one!
SAN DE
Drew, I think you know Headmistress Low. Correct?
Drew can only nod.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
The police have also come. A morals violation is what
brought them...
Drew's head snaps up at the words "morals charge"
POLICE LIEUTENANT
We demand that he leaves the temple, and China!
POLICE CAPTAIN
He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He
must leave.
They all agree that Drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of
the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs).
ANGLE ON DREW
Who is staring down into the abyss.
SAN DE
This is a serious issue, there is no question. This we
will have to take under advisement  but we will handle
matters of this temple.
POLICE CAPTAIN
This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized
to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight,
where he will be held until he leaves the country.
San De pauses, letting this sink in. The D.S. steps forward.
D.S.
Master, may I?
(San De nods)
We accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our
ranks. If we force him to leave China, we admit failure.
Can we do that?
The police don't have an easy answer to that.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who is surprised that the d.s. is sticking up for him.
D.S.
You are wise. You know what is right and what is not
right. This disciple does not even know right from wrong.
Who will teach him if we do not?
This sinks in, and the police have nothing to say. The Headmistress
will not keep quiet, however.
HEADMISTRESS
He does not belong here!
DREW
(whisper)
Chill out, honey!
Drew catches a hard look from the D.S.
D.S.
Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from
that which he so desperately needs?
She is about to speak, but thinks better of it.
San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.
SAN DE
Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought
this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight
knowing that the situation has been swiftly resolved.
POLICE CAPTAIN
I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news.
SAN DE
You will not have to.
The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his
hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes
back to face Drew.
DREW
Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you
both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen
again.
SAN DE
Neither will we. You must leave the temple in the
morning.
DREW
But I thought... the police...
D.S.
You do not deserve to leave the country as a criminal,
but you cannot stay.
Drew sits for a moment, looking back and forth between San De and the
D.S. His eyes are filling with tears, and he wipes at them.
DREW (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, Master.
SAN DE
As am I.
Drew gets up and walks out of the chamber.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WITH THE OTHER GUYS AROUND HIM.
He has just finished telling the disciples what is going on.
They are shocked.
GAO
Why only you?
Drew shrugs and goes over to his bed, lying down with a sigh.
LI
The D.S. always told us that we're all responsible for
what happens.
WU
It's not fair.
DREW
It doesn't have to be fair...
DISSOLVE TO:
ANGLE ON DREW LYING IN THE DARK
Everyone else is asleep, but not Drew. He is staring at the ceiling.
DISSOLVE TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WAKING UP TO AN EMPTY ROOM.
Everyone is gone already, their beds made up. Drew gets up quickly
and gathers up his few things. He puts on his New
York Yankees cap and shoulders his back pack, then looks around the
room one last time.
DREW
I hate long goodbyes anyway...
He exits the room.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE'S CHAMBER, SAN DE WAITING FOR DREW IN ONE
OF THE CHAIRS.
The door opens and Drew walks in, the D.S. can be seen in the b.g.
San De indicates one of the chairs for him to sit in. He does.
SAN DE
Quite a show of solidarity, yes?
Drew nods, trying to hide a smile. He is trying his best to appear
humble.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
Why did you come to the Shaolin Temple?
DREW
(caught off guard)
To train, Master.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
Yet you rebel at every rule, and blame the training for
your inability to learn and progress?
No response from Drew, who is just looking down at the ground.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
You are like someone swimming in fresh water crying "I
thirst!". What you seek is all around you. Don't fight
with the ways of the temple, the battle is within
yourself.
DREW
Within myself?
SAN DE
You must accept the responsibility for your life. If we
force you out of the temple, you can always blame the
temple for your failure  it never has to be your fault.
(beat)
Life without committment is no life at all.
DREW
What if I can't handle it? What if I fail?
SAN DE
Live for the moment, Drew. The future will take care of
itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every
last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear
failure.
DREW
(after a beat)
Then, it's up to me.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
Yes. Your fellow disciples stood up for you. It's your
turn.
DREW
I don't want to let them down.
SAN DE
Don't let yourself down.
He bows to San De and then leaves the chamber.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF BARE CHESTED DREW, SOAKED IN SWEAT.
In the b.g. is a huge bronze buddha. Drew is in the same position as
the Buddha.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SNOWY MORNING.
A group of monks, Drew in the lead, come running down the path,
barefoot in the snow.
ANGLE ON DISCIPLES
Throwing kicks and punches at icicles hanging from rocks on a cliff.
Slow motion as the disciples shatter the ice.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND SAN DE SITTING ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER.
San De has an ornately embroidered golden box in his hand, and he is
showing it to Drew.
SAN DE
You are to deliver this scroll to the Arhat living on the
Jade Mountain. This is your quest. The scroll that is in
this box is more precious than life. Guard it well.
DREW
I will, Master.
SAN DE
If you deliver this, you may ask this master, the most
advanced monk of the Shaolin tradition, any question you
wish, and he must answer it.
San De takes out a map of the area.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
This map will lead you to the Jade Mountain. Let nothing
deter from safeguarding the sacred scroll. You leave
first thing tomorrow morning.
(beat)
You must return within three day... or don't bother to
return at all.
San De stands and bows to Drew. Drew returns the bow, takes the map
and the box, then leaves the chamber.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW EATING WITH THE MAN HE SAVED.
They look at each other and smile, but Drew is anything but happy.
DREW
What am I going to tell the arhat?
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF HUT AS DREW WALKS INTO THE HUT  NO ONE IS
AROUND.
He walks through the rooms, looking at all the books and scrolls
littered around the room.
DREW
Maybe he won't miss one little scroll...
He shakes his head and starts for the front door.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER.
Drew pauses for a moment,
examining the room. It is filled with
wooden statues of monks,
all in different fighting positions. The
carvings are precise and
incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open
hands, fists and legs are
fashioned out of hard wood, and they look
very dangerous indeed.
Drew gathers himself for a moment, then starts into the chamber.
ANGLE ON DREW'S FOOT
As it presses down on one of the stones of the floor.
The attacks start  from all sides, as the wooden statues COME TO
LIFE, spinning, lunging and striking.
Drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to
the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving.
Drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues,
letting his arms practice for the attacks.
There is fear in his eyes.
He starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are
different this time.
Drew is clobbered.
Driven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is
already bruised and bleeding.
DREW
(whispering)
I can't do it.
FLASHBACK TO D.S.
D.S.
There is no can't, only won't.
FLASHBACK TO SEVERAL D.S. ATTACKS
Including the one where Drew succeeded in evading them.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who gathers himself, straightens up and takes a deep breath, forcing
it out in a breathing exercise.
DREW (CONT'D)
I am a Shaolin monk.
He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again.
Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically).
He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him,
making his way across.
He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue
comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly
adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way.
Suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly
spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the SPEARS with his
arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him.
They THWOCK into the wall, sticking there.
As he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of
ARROWS comes HURTLING towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others,
and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on.
He goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man
Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out
the door.
Drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously,
expecting a trap or a trick.
Nothing happens.
He gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a
handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand.
Immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling DROPS
right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his
muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck.
Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a
dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly.
The panel drops lower and lower.
FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCE
ANGLE ON DREW
As he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body,
letting his inner energy take over.
ANGLE ON PANEL
As it slows with a GRINDING NOISE, then stops.
ANGLE ON DREW
Holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body
completely relaxed.
The panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens.
The whirling statue slows, and then stops altogether. Drew reaches up
with a hook kick and taps it in the face.
DREW (CONT'D)
Not this time.
Drew quickly walks through the door.
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF HUGE HALL, THE FLOOR OF WHICH IS CROWDED WITH
RINGS.
One large raised ring is in the middle of the floor  the place for
the finals.
ANGLE ON SIDE OF THE RING
Where Li, Gao, San De, D.S. and some others are waiting. They are all
in monastic garb.
Drew and Ashema walk up to them, holding hands. Drew is dressed in a
fighting monk's costume as well, and he bows to his fellow monks.
DREW
Are we late?
SAN DE
The fight has not yet started.
DREW
Did you think he would get into the finals?
SAN DE
Who could know? He fights the winner of the Western
countries, which is why I wanted you here.
DREW
I'll help any way I can.
ANGLE ON THE CROWD
As it parts to let someone through. Drew turns casually to look at
the competitor. Slowly, a figure, followed by a large group of
people, comes clear... it is Trevor!
ANGLE ON DREW
Who is stunned.
ANGLE ON SAN DE
Could he have known?
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Who spots drew standing near the ring. He walks past him, trying to
place his face. Then, he comes back and walks right up to Drew and
slaps him on the back.
TREVOR
Carson! Drew Carson! I can't believe it! I come half way
around the world, and run into you! I heard you left the
city, but I didn't know losing to me drove you into being
a monk!
Drew is dumbstruck, and Trevor takes advantage of it.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
(to San De)
He take a vow of silence too? Nice hair, Drew.
(he looks at Ashema)
If he took a vow of chastity too, honey, you see me after
this fight, 'Kay?
He puts his arm around Ashema and lets his hand slide down onto her
rear end.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Wish me luck, huh?
He walks off, and Drew, who still hasn't said a word, stares after
him. All of the monks are looking at Drew with questioning looks,
everyone that is except for San De.
ANGLE ON THE RING
As Trevor and the Shaolin entry bow to each other. The fight begins.
It isn't even close. Trevor is better than he ever was. He is
incredible, and he destroys the Shaolin fighter.
Oblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd, he plays with the
Shaolin fighter, making him look like a real fool.
INTERCUT REACTION SHOTS OF DREW
Who is watching the destruction. Behind his eyes, he is reliving his
humiliation.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Who finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique,
and then immediately plays to the crowd, RIGHT IN FRONT OF DREW AND
THE OTHERS.
The referee comes over to Trevor, and raises his fist up in victory.
Trevor tears his arm away and SCREAMS TO THE CROWD:
TREVOR (CONT'D)
I'M NOT DONE!
The crowd, which before was wild and booing, now grows quiet.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
I want HIM!
He points right at Drew.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
I want to face the American who is now a Shaolin monk! I
want to learn at the hands of a master!
The crowd, who has seen Drew and heard about him for quite a while,
warms to the prospect. They start cheering for the American Shaolin
to face Trevor.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
I want the American Shaolin!
ANGLE ON DREW
Who doesn't know what to do. San De appears and puts a comforting
hand on his shoulder.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Pointing and yelling for Drew.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who climbs the ropes and goes into the ring. The crowd is going
crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks
over to Trevor.
DREW
I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You
humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never
happen again.
TREVOR
So, let's see what you've learned.
DREW
(shaking his head)
I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating
you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be
defeated, not you.
TREVOR (CONT'D)
Bull! You're just chicken!
DREW
The arts should never be about who is best  they are too
important for that.
He bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring.
ANGLE ON CROWD
They don't know what's going on.
ANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS
They don't know either. They want Drew to fight him.
ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.
Who know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they
have ever been.
TREVOR
COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away!
Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is
standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes.
SAN DE
Do you turn away from him out of fear?
ANGLE ON TREVOR
Who is seething.
TREVOR
I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies!
Look at him  he is too scared to face me!
ANGLE ON DREW
His face calm.
DREW
No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for
my ego.
SAN DE
You have learned much.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
TREVOR
The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha!
ANGLE ON SAN DE
Who indicates trevor with a inclination of his head.
SAN DE
You did the right thing.
ANGLE ON TREVOR
TREVOR
How about you, baldy? Or you?
He is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb
into the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look
at Drew.
GAO
Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the
fighting monks.
SAN DE
(looking at drew)
What should be done?
GAO (CONT'D)
Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of
the temple.
San De looks at Drew long and hard.
SAN DE
There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some
people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to
smile slowly.
SAN DE (CONT'D)
It's your call.
Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still
standing, trying to get someone to fight him.
Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and
Li and together they high-five.
DREW
For the temple...
Drew climbs into the ring.
The crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as
he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match.
Immediately, his contingent of people start to work on him  massage,
drinks, etc.
ANGLE ON DREW
Who sits alone in the other corner.
ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
Who see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.
ANGLE ON GAO
Who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to
give it to Drew.
ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER
As it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew
(painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels
to bring air to him, etc.
The referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do,
and he motions for them to bow to each other.
TREVOR
Remember last time, punk?
DREW
Nothing exists but the moment, and...
(beat)
... I'm going to enjoy it.
They back up, and the fight begins.
Trevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.
He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy
technique, but he can't touch Drew.
TREVOR
Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!
And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.
Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this
quickly. He
goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that
Trevor is
completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,
and soon has
Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of
high kicks,
takedowns, flips and punches.
Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even
bothering to defend himself.
Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his
right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-
fashioned roundhouse punch.
ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
Yelling for the knock out blow.
ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE
Worried about this latest development.
Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his
hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.
Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a
thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.
To teach him a lesson.
Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.
The crowd goes crazy.
ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
Who also get the message.
ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.
Who knew the message all along.
WIDE ANGLE OF ENTIRE RING
Drew and Trevor standing together in the center. The monks on the
side climb into the ring to celebrate with Drew.
