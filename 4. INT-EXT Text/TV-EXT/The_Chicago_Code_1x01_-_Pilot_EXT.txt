                    We re the South Side and the North 
                    Shore.  We re steak joints and dive 
                    bars.  We re jazz on Rush Street and 
                    shoppers on Michigan Av.  We gave the 
                    world Oprah, Obama and the  85 Bears. 
                    And we would ve thrown a knockout 
                    Olympics if those crooks who run the 
                    thing hadn t bought it for Brazil 
                    instead.  We delivered Kennedy the 
                    presidency and eight years later threw 
                    a convention no one ll ever forget.

                                        JAREK
                    It s clear!  Come on!

    He proceeds, but not fast enough for Jarek s tastes.

                    People think the city s reputation for 
                    crime started with Al Capone, but 
                    Chicago was such a lawless cesspool, 
                    that when the Great Fire destroyed 
                    half the town in 1871, many thought it 
                    was simply God s retribution.

                    Even after the fire, and before 
                    Capone, one newspaper wrote  Chicago 
                    is infested with a horde of thieves, 
                    burglars and cut-throats, bent on 
                    plunder, and who will not hesitate to 
                    burn, pillage and even murder.

      BACK TO THE PRESENT AS --

    The car roars past MALCOLM X. COLLEGE and under the 
      EISENHOWER EXPRESSWAY --

                                        JAREK
                    Get there, Bill.

    The car approaches W. Harrison as a BLACK MUSTANG 
      CAREENSpast.  Bill SLAMS on the brakes to avoid hitting 
    it or the 8 POLICE CARS tailing.  It s a high speed 
      chase and Jarek can only sit and watch the parade go by.

                                        JAREK
                    Harrison s closed at Halsted.  He ll 
                    try to cross the river at the 
                    Roosevelt Bridge.  Beat him there.

                                        BILL
                    I ll try.

      Jarek stares daggers at him.

      QUICK FLASHof YOUNG JAREK, in a line of rookies, having 
    his badge PINNED to his chest by his FATHER (his face 
      unseen).  Young Jarek SMILES with PRIDE, shakes hands.

                                        JAREK (V.O.)
                    When my father pinned the badge on me, 
                    he said shake hands with the good 
                    citizens of this city using a velvet 
                    glove, but keep a razor blade hidden 
                     tween your fingers for the rest of 
                     em.  Also told me the moment I ever 
                    felt safe, remember I was just a dumb 
                    Pollock, as capable as the next idiot 
                    of getting my head shot off.


      Inside the Black Mustang, LUIS ESPERANZA, 23, sees a 
        SQUADCARapproach alongside.  He sticks a HANDGUN out 
    the open window, fires a WARNING SHOT.  The SQUAD CAR
      slows down, falls back in line.  Distracted, Luis BASHES 
    the side of a parked car, bounces off and keeps going.                                                                                      3.



      Bill drives as Jarek cranes his head, sees A POLICE 
      HELICOPTER in the sky heading their direction.

                                        JAREK
                    Coming our way.

    As they approach the Halstedintersection, Jarek and 
      Bill both look to their left for oncoming traffic, see --

    THE BLACK MUSTANG heading straight for them. 

                                        JAREK
                    Go!

      Bill ACCELERATES, avoids being sideswiped by the Mustang 
      which FISHTAILS, falls behind them, one lane over.

                                        JAREK
                    Slow down, get even with him.

      Bill slows so that the Mustang catches up.  Luis points 
    his gun out the window.  Bill slams on the brakes, 
      almost gets rear ended by the lead trail car.

                                        JAREK
                    Catch back up to him.

                                        BILL
                    He s armed.

                                        JAREK
                    I know this guy.  He won t shoot me.

                                        BILL
                    Nah, he ll miss you, hit me. 

                                        JAREK
                    Catch up to him or I ll toss you out 
                    right here and now.

      Beat.  Bill doesn t believe him.  Jarek reaches across 
      Bill and unlocks Bill s door --

      Bill accelerates and catches up to Luis.  As Luis raises 
    his gun from 4 feet away, both cars still going 70 --

                                        JAREK
                    Luis!  It s me.

                    What s going on, Luis?                                                                                      4.

                    I m in a stolen ride, man.  Plus I got 
                    the gun and some weed and I m on 
                    parole.  How many years is that?

                                        JAREK
                    Doesn t have to be the rest of your 
                    life.  Nobody s hurt yet.

                    What about your girlfriend, Luis?  
                    What s her name again?

                                        LUIS
                    Maya?  She s pregnant.  It s a boy.

                                        JAREK
                    Yeah?  What about that kid, Luis?  You 
                    don t want to live to see him?

                                        LUIS
                    You ain t ever gonnalet me touch my 
                    son now.  Maya s gonnabe so pissed.

                                        JAREK
                    Why don t you explain it all to Maya?  
                    Where is she right now?

                                        LUIS
                    At the flower shop, working.

                                        JAREK
                    Let s go there then.  Okay?

                                        LUIS
                    Don t play games on me.

                                        JAREK
                    Wouldn t do that to you, Luis.  I ll 
                    let you hug her, kiss her goodbye.  
                    You wanna do that, Luis?  You want to 
                    kiss Maya goodbye, feel your son s 
                    kick?  Just drop the gun out that 
                    window and follow us there.

      A beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Today s a good day to trust me.

      Beat, then the gun CLATTERS to the street at 60 MPH, 
      gets run over by a trailing squad car.                                                                                      5.


      HELICOPTER SHOT

      Bill and Jarek s car pulls in front of the black Mustang 
    and the whole line of cars slows --


      A very pregnant MAYA, 23, waits anxiously outside the 
      flower shop with two BEAT COPPERS (Chicago slang for 
      Uniform Officers) and assorted Lookie-Loos.

      Jarek and Bill s car appears, followed by the black 
      Mustang and the eight Squad cars.  Bill parks, Luis does 
    the same.  Jarek exits, approaches Luis --

                                        JAREK
                    Let s see the hands, Luis.

      Luis complies, gets out of the car.  Jarek indicates the 
      nervous wreck Maya --

                                        JAREK
                    Maya looks beautiful.  Congratson the 
                    kid.  You got one minute with her.

      Luis approaches Maya, who throws herself into his arms.

                                        MAYA
                    Oh my God, Luis.  What s going on?

      Luis puts a hand on her belly.  Kisses her.

                                        LUIS
                    I m so sorry, baby.

      Away from this, Bill stares at Jarek, pissed.

                                        BILL
                    You almost got me killed, asshole!

                                        JAREK
                              (re: citizens)
                    Lose the language, women and children.

                                        BILL
                    I said you almost got me killed.

                                        JAREK
                    You re right.  I m sorry about that.

                                        BILL
                    Just  cause you rub elbows and 
                    whatever the hell other body parts 
                    with the new Superintendent, doesn t 
                    mean I --                                                                                      6.


                                        JAREK
                    It s clear this partnership isn t 
                    going to work.  We re just not a 
                    match.  I ll let your Lieutenant know 
                    to reassign you at our mutual request.

                                        BILL
                    After one day together?  Screw you.

                                        JAREK
                    I m not going to warn you about the 
                    profanity again.  Kids are listening.
                                (beat)
                    I need the car keys.

      Bill FLINGS them hard at Jarek s chest.  Jarek catches 
      them though, calmly puts them back in his pocket. 

                                        JAREK
                    Appreciate the time and effort.  Best 
                    of luck to you out there.

      Jarek turns and approaches Luis and Maya --

                                        LUIS
                    They really got me this time, chica. 
                    I m gonnabe away a long, longtime.
                                (offher anguish)
                    Before I go though, I know this prolly
                    ain t the right moment...

      Luis drops to a knee, takes her hand.  She wells up.

                                        LUIS
                    And I don t got a ring or nothin , but 
                    will you marry me, Maya?

                                        MAYA
                     course I ll marry you, Luis.

    The civilian crowd applauds, oohsand ahhs.

                                        LUIS
                    You ll wait for me to get out?

                                        MAYA
                    Sure I will.

      Jarek shakes his head at the beat coppers.  No way 
      she ll wait.  As Jarek breaks up the kissing couple --

                                        JAREK
                    Come on, Luis.  Honeymoon s over.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A DEAD BODY (20 s, Hispanic) lies in the middle of the 
      street, eyes peacefully closed, dressed in an impeccable 
      SUIT and TIE.  Surprisingly, no blood, no mess.

                    How does a thirty-eight year old woman 
                    get put in charge of 10,000 Chicago 
                    police officers?

      CALEB EVERS, Early 30 s, boyish, but tall and athletic, 
      walks towards the crime scene.  Caleb eyes Jarek, at a 
      distance, talking with SUPERINTENDENT TERESA COLVIN, 38.

                    It helps if the city s first choice, a 
                    fellow from Texas, takes in a little 
                    too much of the local flavor with a

                    The city s second choice, a thirty-
                    year Chicago P.D. vetseemed like a 
                    lock til he had a heart attack and his 
                    wife made him take early retirement.  
                    So Teresa Colvin, the controversial 
                    choice, became the only choice left.

    The Camera finally lands on the PORTRAIT of Teresa.  She 
      could not stand out more from her predecessors.

                    For a city that has run for decades on

                    My take is a boss with seventeen years 
                    on the Chicago force, someone who hits 
                    the streets with her men rather than 
                    hiding behind her desk or lounging on 
                    the golf course like the last guy, 
                    must be a good thing.  Of course, my

                                        JAREK
                    Yeah, I heard.

                                        DET. HOWELL
                                (suspicious now)
                    Why are you in this part of town?

                                        JAREK
                    New detail.  

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Yeah?  What s that?

                                        JAREK
                    I ride all around the city listening 
                    to the radio, hijack any case I want 
                    from the Primary.

      Beat.  Then Det. Howell laughs.  Must be a joke.

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Really?  How can I get that job?

                                        JAREK
                    Spend four years training the future 
                    Superintendent, gain her trust.

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    You re serious?  Since when is this?

                                        JAREK
                    Sparky, what time is it?

                                        CALEB
                    8:22.

                                        JAREK 
                    New policy commenced at 8:21 and this 
                    is official notification I m taking 
                    over your case.                                                                                        14.


                                        DET. HOWELL
                    That s ridiculous.  The Prom Queen s 
                    really giving you that kind of juice?

                                        JAREK
                    Teresa Colvinisn t a Prom Queen, 
                    she s the Superintendent.  And yes, 
                    that kind of juice.  Canvas started?
                              (off his nod)
                    Great.  Anything turns up, hit my 
                    cell.  And keep taking notes.  
                      Paperwork s still yours.

      Caleb kneels down over the husband s body.  He s wearing 
      HEADPHONES, but the cord isn t attached to anything.

                                        CALEB
                      Headphones, but no I-Pod.  Shoot  em 
                    up robbery in this neighborhood?  
                    Guess it s possible, but...

      Jarek starts to walk away --

                                        JAREK
                    Come on...

      Caleb rushes after the fast-moving Jarek --

                                        CALEB
                    We really got free reign to take over 
                    any investigation in the city?

                                        JAREK
                    Ido.  Tomorrow you go back to the 
                    real world.

                                        CALEB
                    Okay.  So why are we walking away from 
                    our crime scene?

                                        JAREK
                    Ever been to Liffey Construction?


      ERNIE TREFIAN, 35, muscled, Armenian-American head of 
      this area s ORGANIZED CRIME DIVISION, addresses a dozen 
      cops - some in uniform, others in C.P.D.windbreakers, 
    all vested.  He hands out handmade flyers --

                                        ERNIE
                    Our target in this city-wide 
                      coordinated raid is Jimmy Washington.  
                    You all know Jimmy.  We re expecting 
                    to find at least three weapons in a 
                    lock box under his bed and hopefully 
                    some cocaine and heroin.  He s not Dad 
                    of the Month material, so we think his 
                    son s probably at Mom s, but you never 
                    know.  John and Tim, you got the door 
                    with me and Wiggy.Rick and Octo got 
                    the back.  Isaac and Vonda got crowd 
                    control.  Rest of you, follow us 
                    inside.  Let s do it.

    All head for cars.  Isaac whispers to Vonda, pissed.

                                        ISAAC
                    Crowd control?  Again with this?


      Four unmarked police cars and two squad cars in a line 
      sneak down the street like a snake hunting a mouse.                                                                                      17.


    As they pass through a red light, the lead car 
      ACCELERATES to 50 (no lights or sirens) and the others 
      follow turning on W. 18th street (Residential) and stop 
    in front of a row of APARTMENT BUILDINGS.  Across the 
      street, people sit on porches and stoops watching.

      Cops silently STORM their targeted building.  Isaac and 
      Vonda take a position watching the spectators.

    We HEAR the sounds of  POLICE!  OPEN UP!  asa battering 
    ram pounds into a METAL DOOR fifteen times before we 
      hear it crash in.  Isaac, frustrated, spiethe LOOKIE-
      LOOS.One draws his attention -- QUENTIN SILVER, 20 s, 
      sits on an old car seat -- a poor man s porch swing.

                                        ISAAC
                                (sotto, to Vonda)
                    You see Quentin Silver over there?

                                        VONDA
                    Is that Quentin?

                                        ISAAC
                    Oh, that s him.  Outstanding warrant 
                    on that gas station armed-robbery.

                                        VONDA
                    We re just crowd control.

                                        ISAAC
                    Unless we see a wanted fugitive.

      Isaac smiles.  She finds his charm hard to resist.  
      Isaac walks casually towards the crowd.  Vonda follows.  
      Quentin s played this game before though, sees them 
      approach and he leaps off the car seat, over the porch 
      rail and runs for it.  Isaac and Vonda chase --

      OVER fences, through garbage cans, and around parked 
      cars, Isaac and Vonda storm after Quentin, arrive at --


    No sign of Quentin.  Isaac s not ready to quit.

                                        ISAAC
                    You that way, I got this way.

    We stay with Vonda as she peels off the other way.  Gun 
      raised she stealthily approaches a back yard with a tool 
      shed.  The shed door quivers ever so slightly in the 
      wind.  She approaches, FLINGS the door open --

      Nothing.  She closes the door, now REVEALING Quentin who 
      PUNCHES her in the jaw, sending her sprawling to the 
      ground.  He s on top of her, trying to RIP her GUN from 
    her grip.  She hangs on tenaciously.                                                                                      18.


    She deflects the punches with her spare hand, but he s 
      beginning to overpower her as --

      BAM!

      Isaac FLIES into screen, BARRELS into Quentin, knocking 
    him off of Vonda.  Isaac SHOVES Quentin s face into the 
      dirt, grabs an arm and twists it behind Quentin s back.

                                        ISAAC
                    Thanks for leaving me a taste.

      Vonda smiles back at the man who just saved her.


      Jarek and Caleb lean on their car.  Across the street, 
    the employees wait for the all-clear.  Some smoke, 
      others on cells.  Caleb shows his ink-stained hand.

                                        CALEB
                    Won t come off.

                                        JAREK
                    Guess your principal was right.

                                        CALEB
                    What are we doing here?

                                        JAREK
                    Linda Walling worked here.

                                        CALEB
                    Why aren t we going to her husband s 
                    place of work then?

                                        JAREK
                    Because Liffey Construction is 
                    special.

                                        CALEB
                    Special how?

      Jarek s cell phone rings.  Jarek shrugs, answers.

                                        JAREK
                    Detective Wysocki.

                                        PHILLIP (V.O.)
                    It s me.

      REVEAL Phillip across the street, away from his co-
      workers, talking on his phone staring at Jarek.

                                        JAREK
                    You re just chatting with your wife.

      Phillip turns so as not to look at Jarek.                                                                                      21.


                                        JAREK
                    I want to give you the opportunity to 
                    talk to me without your co-workers
                    being aware of it.  But you do know 
                    something useful though, right?

                                        PHILLIP
                    I can t lose my job.

                                        JAREK
                      I understand.

                                        PHILLIP
                    I m too old to start over.  My 
                    daughter s in private college.

                                        JAREK
                    I m not writing anything down, I m not 
                    even asking you your name.  Just give 
                    me a place to look.  You liked Linda?

                                        PHILLIP
                    Yes.

                                        JAREK
                    Then do her this one last favor.

      A beat.

                                        PHILLIP
                    She was crunching numbers on the big 
                      Lakeshoreproject.  Sealed bids are 
                    due to city hall next week.  It s us 
                    and two other companies.  Linda said 
                    someone at the top knew what the other 
                    two secret bids were.  She said she 
                    was getting pressured to rig our 
                    numbers to come in under them.

                                        JAREK
                    Well, that certainly soundslike the 
                    Chicago I know and love.

                                        PHILLIP
                    The last time I talked to her, she was 
                    real nervous, said she was considering 
                    blowing the whistle to someone at city 
                    hall.

      Jarek sees TWO ACCOUNTANTS walk near Phillip.

                                        JAREK
                    I appreciate it.  Now say  I love you 
                    too, honey  and hang up.

                                        PHILLIP
                    I love you too, honey.                                                                                      22.


      Phillip hangs up.  Jarek hangs up.

                                        JAREK
                    You know what my father used to call 
                    this?

                                        CALEB
                    What?

                                        JAREK
                    A Windy City Lead.

                                        CALEB
                    What s a Windy City Lead?

                                        JAREK
                    Something you should run away from.


      Jarek and Caleb on the sidewalk with Det. Howell, who 
      hands them each a Police flyer.  Jarek nods his thanks 
    as Teresa s TOWN CAR pulls up.  Jarek opens up the door 
    for Teresa, who sees Caleb.

                                        TERESA
                      Congratulations.  You ve lasted longer 
                    than his last three partners.

                                        CALEB
                    Just keeping my head down.

                                        TERESA
                    Tell me we ve got something, Jarek.

                                        JAREK
                    You know Detective Glen Howell?

                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Superintendent.                                                                                      25.


                                        JAREK
                    Det. Howell and his men just came up 
                    with a solid suspect.  This thing 
                    breaks, we got him to thank.

                                        TERESA
                    Nice work, Detective.

      Det. Howell nods a silent thanks to Jarek.

                                        TERESA
                    Alderman s waiting.

                                        JAREK
                              (to Caleb)
                    Stay here.

      Jarek and Teresa enter the offices as Det. Howell exits, 
      leaving only Caleb and Antonio to kick their heels.

                                        CALEB
                    Caleb.

                    Antonio.

                                        CALEB
                    You re the driver?

                                        ANTONIO
                    Yeah.

                                        CALEB
                    Me too apparently.

      Antonio tries to write on his notebook, is frustrated.

                                        ANTONIO
                    You got a pen?  Mine s out.

                                        CALEB
                    Let me look.

      Caleb goes to his and Jarek s car, opens the passenger 
      door, scans... opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, finds --

      A BULLWHIP neatly coiled up.  The Polish Cowboy indeed.


      Jarek and Teresa exit.  Caleb and Antonio sit in their 
      respective cars.  Teresa stops Jarek.

                                        TERESA
                    Since when are you so free with

                    Hey, you keep showing promise, you 
                    might get somewhere in the department.

                    All the city bidding Liffey does, 
                    can t have his name on the letterhead.

                    I ve heard it.

                    But you don t know it.

                    Jarek.  I m trying to get two gangs to 
                    lay down their guns before midnight.  
                    I m taking on the Police Union and a 
                    hundred pissed-off, armed cops.  Don t 
                    drag me into a fight with the second 
                    most powerful man in Chicago after the 
                    Mayor unless you knowsomething.

                                        JAREK
                    He s way more powerful than the mayor 
                    and you wantedto take on corruption.  
                    And besides, now that Gibbons and his 
                    machine know I m sniffing around 
                    Liffey Construction, the next move 
                    isn t mine or yours.  It s his.

      HIGH ANGLE looking down on Teresa and Jarek --                                                                                      29.


      REVEAL

      Alderman Gibbons watches the silent action from his 
      office window as he sips his scotch.

      QUICK FLASHof old time Chicago politics footage, people 
    at the polls, politicians glad-handing, campaigning as --

                                        GIBBONS (V.O.)
                    My Great-Grandfather ran this ward 
                    when it was only Irish and German.  My 
                      grandfather followed him, taught me 
                    you take care of your own first and 
                    foremost.  You wonder why the same 
                    guys get elected over and over again?  
                    It s because someone got the 
                    Fitzgerald family the zoning variance 
                    they needed to build that extra 
                    bedroom for his sick mother.  It s 
                    because someone got the Vittinghoff
                    boy s drag racing citation knocked 
                    down to a simple speeding ticket so he 
                    wouldn t lose his license.  Someone 
                    did that for them.  That someone was 
                    me.

      BACK TO THE PRESENT as Gibbons continues watching --

                                        GIBBONS (V.O.)
                    My father didn t want the job, but I 
                    ran the first chance I had.  My name 
                    got me elected the first time.  After 
                    that, I earned every single vote.  
                    They say Chicago is the city that 
                    works.  What some people never 
                    understand is it works in a lot of 
                    different ways.

      Gibbons watches Jarek s car drive off and Teresa get 
      into her car.  As he takes one last sip --

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                      30.


                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

      Vonda and Isaac lean against their squad car as Jarek 
    and Caleb drive up.  As Vonda watches --

                                        VONDA (V.O.)
                    Uncle Jarek s the one who woke me up 
                    and told me my father had been shot.

      QUICK FLASHof 10 year old Vonda shaken awake by Jarek.

                                        VONDA (V.O.)
                    And when Dad died the next day, he 
                    hugged me and told me I was his 
                      responsibility now.

      QUICK FLASHof 10 y.o.Vonda listening solemnly.

                                        VONDA (V.O.)
                    He taught me how to knock down the 7-
                    10 split, taught me when you smell 
                      Blommer schocolate in the morning 
                    air, it s going to be cold that day.

      QUICK FLASHof chocolate being stirred at Blommer s. 
    The camera goes from the pot, to the chimney, up into 
    the air and ZOOMS a mile to Young Vonda s house where 
    she wakes up in bed smelling the chocolate in the air.

                                        VONDA (V.O.)
                    And when I told him I wanted to enroll 
                    in the Academy, not only did he not 
                    stop me, I know he pulled strings to 
                    get me in early.  Though he didn t 
                    admit it then.  And he wouldn t now.

      Jarek and Caleb emerge from their car, approach.

                                        JAREK
                    Need a favor.  We got a suspect in our 
                    double hummer.  Wendell Holmes.  We ll 
                    sit on his house, but I pulled his 
                    contact cards.  He s got three 
                    felonious friends stumbling around the 
                    city.  See if you can get one dirty.

                                        VONDA
                    Love to.

                                        JAREK
                    Let me see it.

      Jarek looks at Vonda s face where she took the punch.                                                                                      31.


                                        ISAAC
                    She handled herself really good.

                                        JAREK
                    Ernie says you two went chasing after 
                    this guy out of position.

                                        ISAAC
                    Wanted felon, what would you have 
                    done?

      Isaac has him there.  Jarek sidles close to him.

                                        JAREK
                    I got to tell you what happens to you 
                    if something happens to her?

                                        ISAAC
                    We ll be just fine.

      Jarek pulls Vonda to the side, out of earshot.

                                        JAREK
                    You sleeping with your partner?

                                        VONDA
                    No.

                                        JAREK
                    I can see.

                                        VONDA
                    I swear on Dad s grave.  No.

      That satisfies him.  Still --

                                        JAREK
                    I m trying to figure out why you d 
                    follow this guy off the reservation to 
                    get popped like that.
                                (beat, off her)
                    Isaac s too cocky.  He s the kind of 
                    guy who s going to drown one day, pull 
                    someone down with him.

                                        VONDA
                    I m being careful.

                                        JAREK
                    Trust me, partners is complicated 
                    enough.

    She nods her understanding.  Jarek walks back to Isaac, 
      who s looking at the contact cards Caleb has given him.

                                        JAREK
                    I need one of them dirty.                                                                                      32.



      Jarek and Caleb on stakeout.  After a beat.

                                        CALEB
                    Top Ten Album Covers of all time.  
                    I ll start.  Nirvana s  Nevermind .  
                    Now you.

      A beat.  Jarek s not going to play this game.  His cell 
      rings through the car s sound system.  He has no choice 
    but to answer on speaker phone.

                                        JAREK
                    Hello?


      Antonio opens the car door for Teresa, as he gets off 
    the phone.  As they walk towards the school entrance --

                    Raids all went off with no friendlies

                    Really?


      Vonda and Isaac in their squad car, eyes peeled.

                                        ISAAC
                    Your uncle s really got it in for me.

                                        VONDA
                    He s just over-protective.

                                        ISAAC
                    Doesn t he know I got your back, baby?

    She laughs it off, but inside she s flattered, in love.

                                        ISAAC
                    His generation still sees color.  
                    Time s on the side of the righteous.

                                        VONDA
                    That s one of our plates right there.  
                    White Chevy.

      They watch the car come to a complete stop at a stop 
      sign, then continue.

                                        ISAAC
                    He roll that stop sign?

                                        VONDA
                    Think he did.

      Isaac hits the siren.


      Jarek & Caleb pull up.  YANCY, 20 s, scuzzball, stands, 
      hands cuffed in the back.  Jarek rolls down the window --

                                        JAREK
                    What do you got, Officers?                                                                                      39.

                    Suspect ran a stop sign.  In searching 
                    Yancy s vehicle, we found some 
                      electronics that come back stolen.

                                        JAREK
                    This your first time getting popped?

                                        YANCY
                    Not exactly.

                                        JAREK
                    We can bring him in for you.  

                                        VONDA
                    That dbe a big help.  Thanks, 
                    Detective.

                                        JAREK
                    Really should eat first, though.  You 
                    hungry, Yancy?


      Jarek, Caleb and Det. Howell with Wendell, who smokes.

                                        JAREK
                    You want to tell us about this five 
                    grand you were bragging to your 
                    buddies you were getting paid?

                                        WENDELL
                    Who ratted?

                                        CALEB
                    How many people you tell?

                                        WENDELL
                    One too many.  Guy paid me the five 
                    grand to take out the couple.  Extra 
                    emphasis on the wife.  Make it look 
                    like a rip off he said.  I mean I 
                    already got a damn I-Pod.

                                        JAREK
                    What was this guy s name?

                                        WENDELL
                    Never gave it.  Wanted it that way.

                                        JAREK
                    You never saw him before?

                                        WENDELL
                    Not before two nights ago at the bar.

                                        JAREK
                    You ID him for us?

                                        WENDELL
                    You put him in front of me, yeah, I ll 
                    do business with you.

                                        JAREK
                    Okay.  Detective Howell s got 
                    additional questions for you.

                                        WENDELL
                    I know the drill.                                                                                      41.


                                        DET. HOWELL
                    Thanks for the bust.

                                        JAREK
                    Any time.

      Det. Howell leads Wendell back inside.

                                        CALEB
                    We got the shooter, but not the money 
                    man.  So, where to?

                                        JAREK
                    I know where I m going next.  To make 
                    love to my fiance. 

                                        CALEB
                    Excuse me?

                                        JAREK
                    Should only take about an hour.  I ll 
                    meet back up with you then.

                                        CALEB
                    For real?

                                        JAREK
                    You know how to keep a gorgeous twenty-
                    seven year old happy?

                                        CALEB
                    No.

                                        JAREK
                    Figured as much.


      Dedicated to slain Chicago Police Officers, this 
      monument lies between Soldier Field and Lake Michigan.  
    Dim lights illuminate hundreds of names of lost souls.

      Jarek enters, looks at a name for a moment, then --

                                        LIAM (O.S.)
                    You could ve warned me to wear a cup.

      Reveal LIAM emerging from the shadows.  Jarek pulls out 
      Liam s license, tosses it to him.

                                        JAREK
                    Doesn t play as well, you know what s 
                    coming.  You got any pals up here?

                                        LIAM
                    A guy I graduated with got killed as a 
                    rookie, but I barely knew him.

                                        LIAM (CONT'D)
                                (beat)
                    Your brother s up here, right?  
                    Where s his name?

                                        JAREK
                    Over there somewhere.

                                        LIAM
                    Which wall?

                                        JAREK
                    I don t know.  I never look at it.  
                    What s the word?

                                        LIAM
                    This whole Liffey investigation has 
                    the Gibbons machine freaked out.  
                    Everyone s in lock down mode.

                                        JAREK
                    I need the guy who hired the shooter.

                                        LIAM
                    I keep hearing a name whispered.  
                    Don t know what it all means though.  
                    Name s Jasper.  Sounds like he s up 
                    here from down south.

                                        JAREK
                    Better than nothing.  I need you to 
                    get closer to Alderman Gibbons though.

                                        LIAM
                    I ve been under for almost a year now, 
                    I ve never even met the man.

                                        JAREK
                    After today you will.  And soon.

      A beat.  Liam looks at the wall.  Takes it in.

                                        LIAM
                    How many of these did you know?

      Beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Take care of yourself, Liam.
                              (re: walls)
                    I don t want to know any more.

      Jarek exits.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                      43.


                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Jarek and Teresa.  They watch Caleb clean out the car.

                                        TERESA
                    No wonder Gibbons was so helpful.  
                    There s no real link back to him.

                                        JAREK
                    We didn t kill Gibbons, we just 
                    wounded him.

                                        TERESA
                    We didn t even wound him.  But we did 
                    get the shooter and the money man.  
                    Usually that s a good day.
                                (beat)
                    Your boy sniffed something up with 
                    Liam.

                                        JAREK
                    Maybe Liam s getting sloppy.

                                        TERESA
                    Or your partner has better instincts 
                    than you think.

      Beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Too bad he s a Cubs fan.

      Ernie approaches from inside, hands Teresa a note.

                                        ERNIE
                    Good news.  I got word to the 
                    Overlords that moms and squeezes were 
                    next.  They want us to call off the 
                    dogs.  They re willing to give us the 
                    crew that dragged that boy out of the 
                    mortuary.  All they re asking for is a 
                    face to face just like Paco got.   

                                        TERESA
                    After what they did?  They don t 
                    deserve a face to face with me.                                                                                      50.


                                        ERNIE
                    Need someone to set terms in person.

                                        TERESA
                    I know someone who s ready for it. 
                    Thanks, Ernie.

      Ernie exits.  Teresa can still see Jarek s pissed.

                                        TERESA
                    Sometimes you just have to go home and 
                    sleep it off.  Who taught me that?

                                        JAREK
                    Whoever he was, sounds like a dumb 
                    Pollock.

                                        TERESA
                    Only some of the time.

      Teresa moves off towards her car, where Antonio opens 
    the door as Caleb approaches Jarek.

                                        CALEB
                    Car s clean.  Where to?

      Beat.

                                        JAREK
                    Look, Sparky.I don t see this 
                      partnership working.  We re just not a 
                    match.  I ll let your Lieutenant know 
                    to reassign you at our mutual request.

      Beat.  Caleb takes it like a man.

                                        CALEB
                    Sure, I understand.

                                        JAREK
                    I wish you luck though, and keep safe.

                                        CALEB
                    Appreciate having the chance to ride 
                    with you.

      Jarek nods.  Caleb moves off, buries his disappointment.


      Antonio gets into the car.  Teresa in the back.

                                        TERESA
                    We good?

                                        ANTONIO
                    We re good.

      Teresa nods, knows her apprentice has learned well.

                                        TERESA
                    Let s go home then.


      Quiet, residential.  Antonio parks the car.  As he gets 
    out to open the door for Teresa --

                                        ANTONIO (V.O.)
                    When Teresa Colvinfound me I was 
                    twelve years old and acting as a 
                    lookout for a couple local dealers.

      QUICK FLASHof a 12 YEAR OLD ANTONIO on a shittystreet 
      spying the hood with another cholo.

                                        ANTONIO (V.O.)
                    She was starting a charter program 
                    that pulled me and some other kids off 
                    the street, got on me about my grades.

      QUICK FLASHof Teresa TUTORING a 12 Year Old Antonio.

                                        ANTONIO (V.O.)
                    She talked me into joining the P.D. 
                    andwhen I quit  cause I thought it 
                    was too hard, she found me and dragged 
                    my lazy ass back to the Academy.

      QUICK FLASHof Teresa finding Antonio at a BAR with 
      buddies.  She drags him out.

      BACK IN THE PRESENT

    As Antonio closes the car door and Teresa steps out to 
      walk to her house --

                                        ANTONIO (V.O.)
                    When the time came to pick --

      BAM!

      A GUNSHOT interrupts Antonio s memory.

    He SEES a BULLET IMPACT hit Teresa in the CHEST.  
      Antonio THRUSTS himself in front of Teresa just in time 
    to take the IMPACT of a SECOND GUNSHOT.

    The force knocks them both back on their asses, on the 
      ground, backs against the town car, Antonio still acting 
    as a shield in front of her.

      Antonio is hit by ANOTHER shot.  He s unconscious.  
      Teresa takes Antonio s gun from his limp hand and FIRES 
      back in the dark direction of the hostile muzzle flash.                                                                                      54.


    WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS running, a car door SLAMS.  A car 
      SCREECHES off.

      Teresa lays on the ground, GASPING loudly for breath, 
      still CRADLING the lifeless Antonio in her arms.


      Isaac rushes towards the hospital.  Sees a bunch of COPS 
      milling about in front of the ER entrance.  Then he 
      stops.  Looks, sees --

      VONDA sitting in her car.  She appears to be crying.  He 
      goes to the passenger window, knocks.  She looks up.  
      Tears.  She unlocks the door, Isaac gets in.  Sits.

                                        ISAAC

                    it.  But first and foremost you
