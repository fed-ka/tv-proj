A hansom cab, with Holmes' and Watson's luggage strapped
to the rack on top, is proceeding down the busy street.
WATSON'S VOICE
He was the most brilliant man I have ever
known -- and I dare say people have
envied me for sharing that flat with him
in Baker Street.
The cab draws up
in front of 221B. The front door opens
and MRS. HUDSON,
a plump, motherly woman in her fifties,
wearing an apron,
hurries down the steps. She greets
Holmes and Watson
warmly as they alight.
WATSON'S VOICE
I'll grant you he was stimulating -- but
he could also be moody, unpredictable,
egocentric, and more often than not,
completely infuriating -- as our
landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can attest --
bless her kind soul.
The cabbie
starts to unload their luggage. As Holmes,
Watson and
Mrs. Hudson proceed inside, CAMERA TRAVELS UP
THE FACADE
OF THE BUILDING, past the number 221B, to the
bay window
on the second floor.
4.
It is raining. A bus comes down the street, the open top
deck sprouting umbrellas like black mushrooms.
WATSON'S VOICE
Naturally, I don't mean to imply that my
friend was always on cocaine -- sometimes
it was opium, sometimes it was hashish.
And once he went one of these dreadful
binges, there was no telling how long it
would last.
An enraged Watson, cane and opera glasses in hand, and
the flower still behind his ear, is jogging down the
center of the deserted street.
Wisps of fog swirl along the street, making yellow haloes
around street lamps.
WATSON'S VOICE
I was not to get the answer until we
became involved in what I consider to be
the most outrageous case in all our years
together.
Out of the mist comes a hansom cab, with the dim figure
of a woman visible in the passenger seat. The cab stops
in front of 221B, and the driver starts to get down.
From upstairs comes the faint sound of violin music.
The cabbie crosses the pavement, consults an address in
his hand, glances up at the number of the house, then
rings the bell.
The cabbie has tossed the blanket into the hansom, and is
mounting the driver's seat. Across the street, a man
steps out of the fog into a pool of light cast by one of
the street lamps. He is a craggy-faced Prussian of about
fifty, and his name is VON TIRPITZ. He looks up toward
the Holmes flat. As the hansom makes a U-turn and comes
abreast of him, he hops into the cab. The hansom
disappears into the fog.
The street lamps are still lit. A policeman, on patrol
duty, is strolling along the sidewalk, swinging his
truncheon. Suddenly he sees something up ahead.
Alarmed, he ducks into the doorway of a building,
flattens himself against the door.
From the opposite direction comes a horse-drawn water-
sprinkling wagon. The spray covers the sidewalks as well
as the street.
The policeman waits till the wagon is past, then steps
out of the doorway relieved, resumes his patrol.
This is a run-down district in the northwestern part of
London. On the corner is No. 32 -- a dilapidated
abandoned shop, with windows painted halfway up.
As CAMERA APPROACHES the building, we hear sawing from
inside.
Holmes, cane in hand, and Watson are swiftly ascending
the steps of a building with an imposing Palladian
facade. Beside the entrance is a discreet sign reading:
DIOGENES CLUB. Members Only. As they reach the top of
the steps, Watson stops Holmes.
WATSON
I don't mind telling you I'm a bit
apprehensive about this.
69.
HOLMES
I'm rather curious myself as to what is
going on in that Machiavellian mind of
his.
WATSON
I don't mean Mycroft, I mean Madame
Valladon.
HOLMES
Don't worry.
She's perfectly safe with
Mrs. Hudson.
He opens the door and they start in.
Holmes and Watson are walking toward 221B.
Holmes is
whistling 'Loch Lomond.'
WATSON
You will be gentle, won't you, when you
tell her you're dropping the case?
HOLMES
Watson, what does the word Glennahurich
suggest to you?
WATSON
Absolutely nothing.
76.
HOLMES
It's Scottish.
WATSON
Is it?
HOLMES
And like all Scottish names, it's really
a word picture. Glen means valley, na
means of the, and Hurich, if memory
serves me, means yew tree.
WATSON
You're just trying to impress me.
HOLMES
So the three boxes go to the Valley of
the Yew Tree.
He resumes whistling. They start to cross the street,
skirting a parked hansom. Feeding the horse is the same
cabbie who fished Gabrielle out of the river, and in the
passenger seat is Von Tirpitz, the craggy-faced Prussian
we saw before. He stares fixedly after Holmes and
Watson.
Holmes and Watson come up to the door of 221B, and Watson
fishes his key out. Holmes is still whistling.
WATSON
(singing along)
And I'll be in Scotland before ye...
(breaks off, looks at Holmes
apprehensively)
You are dropping the case, aren't you,
Holmes?
HOLMES
Open the door.
Watson turns the key in the lock, starts to open the
door, but is stopped by a chain on the inside. Through
the opening a revolver appears, aiming at them point-
blank.
HOLMES
Don't shoot, Mrs. Hudson -- you're liable
to lose two excellent tenants.
77.
Through the upstairs window of 221B we see Gabrielle
shutting the parasol. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE the
hansom parked across the street, and von Tirpitz
watching. He signals to the cabbie, who is back on his
perch. The cabbie flicks his whip, and the hansom takes
off down the street.
DISSOLVE TO:
The Highland Express is speeding northward through the
moonlit landscape, its steam whistle hooting mournfully.
The Highland Express is pulling out of the station. As
the last car disappears, and the steam clears from the
tracks, we see Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson on the
platform. A BAGGAGEMAN is loading their luggage on a
hand-cart, under Watson's supervision.
WATSON
Let's see -- two, three, four --
Gabrielle removes her parasol, which has been inserted
under the straps of her suitcase.
GABRIELLE
I'll take that.
HOLMES
(to baggageman)
How do you get to Glennahurich?
How far
is it?
BAGGAGEMAN
Glennahurich?
WATSON
You know -- a valley -- with a yew
tree... ?
Gabrielle casually opens her parasol.
BAGGAGEMAN
It's about a mile out of town.
(a beat)
Why would you be wanting to go there?
WATSON
Well, if it's got a view, it might be a
nice place for a picnic.
BAGGAGEMAN
It's got a view, right enough -- but it's
no place for a picnic.
HOLMES
Why not?
BAGGAGEMAN
Because it's a cemetary.
87.
Gabrielle looks at Holmes. CAMERA PANS UP TOWARD an iron
footbridge, spanning the railway tracks. Moving across
it in single file are the seven cowled Trappist monks,
with von Tirpitz in the lead.
DISSOLVE TO:
Under a leaden sky, the yew trees which give the place
its name brood over ancient gravestones.
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come down an overgrown path,
stop and look off.
A rather meagre funeral procession is moving along the
avenue which runs between the rows of graves. It
consists of one normal-size pine coffin and two smaller
ones, loaded on a cart which is being wheeled by a couple
of workmen. Bringing up behind is a MINISTER, with an
open prayer book in his hands.
WATSON
(a note of excitement)
The three boxes. Is that it, Holmes?
HOLMES
I would think so.
GABRIELLE
The two small ones -- they must be
children's coffins.
Holmes starts to cut across between the graves, Gabrielle
and Watson following.
At the grave-site, the workmen are removing the coffins
from the cart. There is one large grave, two smaller
ones. A couple of grave-diggers stand by respectfully,
caps in hands.
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up behind a nearby
headstone, stop and watch.
At the grave-site, the minister is finishing the service.
MINISTER
... earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust
to dust.
88.
In sure and certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life through our
Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.
The workmen trundle the cart off, the minister following.
The grave-diggers don their caps, pick up their shovels.
From their vantage point, Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson
are watching.
GABRIELLE
It's so sad.
HOLMES
Sad -- and rather odd. There are no
flowers -- and no mourners.
The grave-diggers have finished filling in the graves
when Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come up.
HOLMES
Morning.
GRAVE-DIGGER
(looking up)
Morning.
HOLMES
Working you hard, Dad?
GRAVE-DIGGER
Not really. This is healthy country.
Sometimes you sit around for weeks with
nothing to do. Then you get three in one
day.
HOLMES
What happened?
GRAVE-DIGGER
An accident. Aye. Father and two sons,
they say -- they were found floating in
the loch.
HOLMES
Local people?
GRAVE-DIGGER
No. Nobody around here knows them. The
story is that their boat capsized in a
swell -- but I don't believe it.
89.
HOLMES
What do you believe?
GRAVE-DIGGER
You may think I'm an old fool or an old
drunk -- but I've living around Loch Ness
all my life...
WATSON
Are you trying to tell us it was the
monster?
GRAVE-DIGGER
Damn right. MacLarnin saw the kids'
faces when they were pulled out of the
water -- looked like old men -- must've
died of fright.
WATSON
Incredible.
GRAVE-DIGGER
Is it? Last Easter Sunday my wife and
me, we were on our way to services, when
suddenly... But what's the use?
He picks up a white-washed wooden cross, plants it at the
head of the grave. The other grave-digger has inserted
smaller crosses into the other two mounds of earth.
HOLMES
(taking some coins out of his
pocket)
Here you are, Dad.
(hands them to the grave-
digger)
GRAVE-DIGGER
Thank you... You look like nice people.
If you're wanting a holiday in Scotland,
go to Loch Lomond, go to Holy Loch -- but
stay away from Loch Ness.
He and his partner shoulder their shovels, move off.
WATSON
(snorting)
To think that people still believe in
that nonsense. Here we are, living in
the Nineteenth Century --
90.
GABRIELLE
I'm ashamed to admit it -- but I was
relieved when he mentioned a father and
two boys. It could possibly have
anything to do with Emile.
HOLMES
It would appear not.
WATSON
However, there still remains the clue of
the castle and the red runner -- wherever
it may be.
They are about to get under way when suddenly Holmes
stops them.
Coming down the avenue toward them are four small boys,
in knickerbockers and caps, carrying bouquets of flowers.
Without a word, Holmes draws Gabrielle and Watson back to
their hiding place, behind the headstone.
The four boys approach the freshly-filled graves. They
remove their caps, lay their flowers on each of the two
small graves, then kneel down and bow their heads in
prayer.
From their position behind the headstone, Holmes, Watson
and Gabrielle are watching the four boys, who have their
backs to them.
WATSON
If they're unidentified graves, why are
those boys bringing flowers?
HOLMES
Because it's their brothers who have just
been buried.
WATSON
Their brothers?
HOLMES
And they're not boys. They're as tall as
they'll ever grow. Hand me some pebbles,
will you?
WATSON
Pebbles.
91.
He picks some up from the ground, hands them to Holmes,
who tosses them in the direction of the graves. The
pebbles strike a granite cross. At the sound, the four
boys simultaneously turn their heads over their
shoulders. Despite their slight bodies they have the
features of mature men.
Gabrielle and Watson react to the sight.
GABRIELLE
They are -- how do you say it in English?
-- nains.
WATSON
Midgets.
HOLMES
(nodding)
Boys with the faces of old men...
WATSON
I still don't see --
HOLMES
Would it help if I told you they were
acrobats?
WATSON
Not at all.
HOLMES
Do you remember a tumbling act -- six
brothers -- missing from the circus?
WATSON
Oh, yes -- that case you turned down -- I
completely forgot.
HOLMES
Some of us are cursed with memories like
flypaper. And stuck there is a
staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly
useless.
The four midgets have now risen, and putting on their
caps, move off down the avenue. Holmes, Gabrielle and
Watson emerge from their place of concealment.
92.
GABRIELLE
(worriedly)
Mr. Holmes, is those are not children,
then -- ?
HOLMES
Quite. The question now is -- who's in
the third grave?
CUT TO:
The point of a crowbar digs under the edge of a coffin
lid, which starts to give with a squealing protest of
nails. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Holmes, standing in
the large grave, from which the earth has been removed.
Kneeling beside the grave, watching anxiously, are
Gabrielle and Watson, the latter holding a bullseye
lantern.
Holmes pries the lid open, disclosing the corpse of a
middle-aged man. His arms are folded across his chest,
and on the third finger of his left hand is a wedding
ring similar to Gabrielle's. From the picture of him we
have seen earlier, we recognize the face as that of Emile
Valladon.
Gabrielle lets out a piercing scream, collapses in a
faint. Watson catches her.
WATSON
Holmes!
She's fainted.
HOLMES
(preoccupied)
Hand me that lantern.
Watson passes down the lantern, and Holmes slowly shines
the beam along the length of the coffin.
WATSON
It is Valladon, isn't it?
HOLMES
Obviously. What is not so obvious is why
his wedding ring has turned green --
93.
The lantern beam now reveals that laid out at Valladon's
feet are three canaries -- their plumage bleached a grey-
white color.
HOLMES
-- and why there are three dead canaries
in the coffin. White canaries.
DISSOLVE TO:
An open carriage is proceeding along the driveway toward
the hotel, scatting a flock of sheep grazing nearby.
Watson is sitting beside the coachman. Holmes and
Gabrielle are in the passenger seat, their luggage is
strapped to the back. Through the trees which line the
road we glimpse Loch Ness, which is partly obscured by a
low-lying mist.
The carriage pulls up in front of the hotel, which is
identified by a sign above the entrance, and Holmes,
Watson and Gabrielle get out.
CLOSE SHOT - HOTEL REGISTER
Holmes' hand is writing: Mr. And Mrs. Ashdown and valet,
London.
Watson focuses the telescope on the lake.
LOCH NESS THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY
Through the swirling mist which clings to the surface of
the lake, a shadowy figure with a long, monster-like neck
can be see gliding along.
97.
Watson almost drops the telescope in excitement.
WATSON
There it is!
There it is!
Holmes joins him on the balcony.
WATSON
Look for yourself.
He hands the telescope to Holmes. Gabrielle comes up to
the window behind them. Holmes trains the telescope on
the lake.
WATSON
See it?
See it?
LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY
Holmes' eye slowly scans the lake, but there is no sign
of Watson's monster -- just the rolling mist.
Holmes lowers the telescope.
HOLMES
I see nothing.
WATSON
Nothing?
He grabs the telescope from Holmes, looks toward the
lake.
WATSON
It's gone.
HOLMES
Gone?
Maybe it was never there.
WATSON
I swear to you -- I saw it -- clear as
anything --
98.
HOLMES
Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we
are living in the Nineteenth Century --
He steps back into the room.
Holmes and Gabrielle are sitting on a blanket, the
contents of the picnic basket spread before them, having
lunch. Watson is pouring the wine. Their bicycles are
resting nearby.
WATSON
We have so far investigated
eight drafty
castles -- had our bicycles
attacked by
sheep and our ears assaulted
by bagpipes
-- and we are exactly where
we started.
100.
HOLMES
(to Gabrielle)
Would you like some cranberry sauce,
dear?
GABRIELLE
Yes, dear.
HOLMES
Would you pass the cranberry sauce,
please, John?
WATSON
Yes, dear.
As he does so, he catches sight of something o.s.
WATSON
(calling)
I say there. Good afternoon.
Remember
me?
On the road above, approaching a bridge which spans the
lake where it narrows into a stream, are the seven
Trappist monks, walking slowly in single file.
Watson waves to them, but the monks pay no attention to
him.
WATSON
(to Holmes)
Some chaps I met on the train. We had a
long conversation -- or rather, I had a
long conversation -- because they're not
allowed to talk -- Trappists, you know.
Just study their Bibles. You'll never
guess what the one next to me was reading
-- the Book of Jonah -- isn't that odd?
HOLMES
(looking after the monks)
Quite.
As he turns back, he notices that Gabrielle is
manipulating her parasol in the air.
HOLMES
What is it, dear? What's the matter?
101.
GABRIELLE
A bee.
She continues to work the parasol, alternately opening it
and partially closing it.
On the bridge von Tirpitz, who is at the rear of the file
of monks, glances back toward the lakeshore.
DISSOLVE TO:
On a promontory jutting into Loch Ness stand the remains
of a medieval fortress. Around the Tower, the Motte, and
the ruins of the East wall, wooden scaffolding has been
erected, and a couple of dozen men are engaged in what
appears to be repair work. Amidst the rubble of the
Nether Bailey, an encampment of tents has been set up.
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come bicycling up along a
fence on the heights overlooking the castle, dismount in
front of the locked gates. Attached to the gatepost is a
sign reading: WARNING: No Unauthorized Person Permitted
Beyond This Point.
WATSON
Well, I don't think we have to bother
with this castle. It's just a pile of
rubble.
GABRIELLE
Then why are they taking precautions?
She points to the sign -- and to a guard coming up the
driveway, with a couple of huge mastiffs on leashes.
HOLMES
Why, indeed?
(turning the tandem around)
Let's go.
WATSON
Go where?
HOLMES
When rebuffed at the front door, one's
only choice is to try the tradesmen's
entrance.
102.
They move off.
DISSOLVE TO:
Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson are coming up a path from
the lakeside, leading their bicycles. They lean the
cycles against a ruined wall, start across the courtyard.
A middle-aged MAN in kilts emerges from the tumbled-down
gatehouse, comes toward them.
GUIDE
Sorry.
No visitors allowed.
HOLMES
Are you the guide here?
GUIDE
Yes. The castle is closed to the public
while work is going on.
HOLMES
What are they doing?
GUIDE
It's being restored by the Society for
the Preservation of Scottish Monuments.
HOLMES
Too bad. I particularly wanted my wife
to see Urquhart Castle. The tower is one
of the most interesting examples of --
about 1400, wasn't it?
GUIDE
That's right.
HOLMES
Let me see -- was it built under James
the Second or James the Third?
GUIDE
The Thrid... If you come back next year,
we'll be all done here, and I'll be glad
to show you around.
HOLMES
Thank you.
103.
As the three of them move off, a canvas-topped wagon
comes through the stone archway, stops at the front of
the steps leading to the inner courtyard.
WATSON
Pleasant sort, isn't he?
HOLMES
Pleasant, but ignorant. He was off one
hundred years and one James.
(taps guide-book in his
pocket)
It's actually 1500 and James the Fourth.
GABRIELLE
If he's an official guide, shouldn't he
know... ?
HOLMES
If he's an official guide.
They have now reached the wall against which they left
their bicycles. Suddenly Holmes stops, attracted by the
sound of birds chirping.
HOLMES
Listen...
Do you hear anything, Watson?
WATSON
(concentrating)
No. Those birds are making too much of a
racket.
HOLMES
(looking off)
They're not just birds -- they're our old
friends.
Watson and Gabrielle follow his gaze.
From the back of the wagon, the carriers have removed the
small bird-cage we saw in the mail-drop on Ashdown
Street. They hand it to a workman, who starts up the
steps with it. To another couple of workmen they pass
down an open-sided crate in which rest two heavy glass
bottles protected by wicker. Stencilled on the wooden
slate of the crate are the words: SULPHURIC ACID -
CORROSIVE.
104.
Holmes is watching thoughtfully, Gabrielle and Watson are
puzzled.
WATSON
Sulphuric acid?
GABRIELLE
The more we find out the less sense it
makes.
HOLMES
To a graduate chemist it makes a great
deal of sense. Sulphuric acid, when
exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine
gas.
(a beat)
Would you mind clasping your hands,
Watson?
WATSON
(obeying)
Like this?
HOLMES
A little lower... Thank you.
Watson has lowered his clasped hands, and Holmes uses
them as a foothold to go scrambling up the scaffolding of
the nearby wall. Reaching the top, he looks off in the
direction of the tower.
The workman carrying the canary cage, and the two
carrying the crate of sulphuric acid are approaching the
tower. A draw-bridge comes down, and the three men cross
the moat and enter the tower.
HOLMES
(looking off)
That tower may be more interesting than I
thought -- and not just architecturally.
Out of the ruined gatehouse comes the guard with the two
mastiffs on leashes. The dogs start to snarl viciously.
WATSON
Holmes, I have a feeling we're redundant
here.
105.
Holmes leaps down from the scaffolding, wheels the tandem
around, starts back in the direction from which they
came. Gabrielle follows. Watson hurries after them with
his bicycle, casting anxious glances over his shoulder as
the dogs continue barking.
DISSOLVE TO:
The sun has just gone down behind the hills, but there is
still light in the sky. An ominous mist is beginning to
settle on the water.
Gabrielle is sitting in the stern of a rowboat, her
parasol in her lap. She is wearing Holmes' Norfolk
jacket over her dress to ward off the chill.
On the rowing seat, facing her, are Watson and Holmes,
the latter in his waistcoat. Their oars are pulled in,
and they are watching Urquhart Castle, on the opposite
side of the lake.
WATSON
We have now observed the castle from the
front, from the back, from the side, from
land, from water... what now?
Are you
planning to spend the night out here?
HOLMES
If necessary.
WATSON
You're going to catch your death of cold.
(to Gabrielle)
Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last
case were a case of pneumonia?
(with an embarrassed chuckle)
Sorry.
Gabrielle glances past them, and her eyes widen.
GABRIELLE
(pointing off)
What's that?
Holmes and Watson turn their heads.
106.
About half a mile away, moving in and out of patches of
drifting mist, is Watson's monster, its long reptillian
neck cutting through the water.
Watson leaps to his feet.
WATSON
Holmes!
Holmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat.
HOLMES
Quick, Watson. After it!
He grabs his oar, and Watson belatedly joins in. They
strain at the oars, setting a course which will intercept
the monster.
Gabrielle leans forward in her seat, trying
to peer past them through the curtains of mist.
The monster is much closer now -- no more than a quarter
of a mile away.
Suddenly Watson stops rowing.
WATSON
Holmes, what are we doing?
We should be
going away from it.
HOLMES
Keep rowing, dammit!
Watson resumes pulling on his oar.
As they row, Holmes
looks over his shoulder.
The monster has started to submerge. Its head disappears
beneath the surface of the water, and the wake it leaves
behind soon trails off into the mist.
Holmes ships his oar.
HOLMES
We've lost it.
WATSON
(stops rowing)
At least you admit there's an it, not
just a figment of my imagination.
HOLMES
Quiet.
107.
He listens intently. There is only the sound of water
slapping against the side of the boat. The mist is
heavier now, and billowing around them.
HOLMES
(to Watson)
Do you have your stethoscope with you?
WATSON
Never without it.
He removes his bowler, unwinds the stethoscope from the
inside the crown, hands it to Holmes. Holmes plugs in
the ear-pieces, leans over the side of the boat, extends
the other end of the stethoscope to the surface of the
water.
WATSON
What is it?
HOLMES
I can hear something...
We become aware of the faint beating of engines,
accompanied by a bubbling sound.
HOLMES
It's getting closer -- closer --
Suddenly the surface of the water breaks, about twenty
yards away from them, and the head and neck of the
monster rear up from the depths. Watson is first to
notice it and jumps to his feet, making choking noises.
Gabrielle sees it and screams. Watson grabs an oar,
throws it at the monster as it comes past. The backwash
hits the boat broadside, rocking it, and Holmes, Watson
and Gabrielle are spilled into the lake.
The monster moves away from them, heading in the general
direction of the castle. It disappears into the mist.
Holmes is the first to come up, looks around, sees
Gabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her.
HOLMES
Are you all right?
GABRIELLE
I lost my parasol.
108.
HOLMES
Where's Watson?
He glances around, sees Watson's bowler floating nearby,
swims over to it.
HOLMES
Watson?
He lifts the hat -- but Watson isn't under it.
As Gabrielle hoists herself into the boat, Watson
clambers over the other side. After a moment Holmes
joins them, and they sit there, sopping wet and breathing
heavily.
WATSON
I have come face to
face with man-eating
tigers -- I was once
caught in a stampede
of wild elephants --
India, you know --
but I wasn't half as
frightened. This
beast seems to have
a personal grudge
against us.
GABRIELLE
I just hope it doesn't come back.
HOLMES
I don't think it will.
(pointing off)
Look!
They glance in the indicated direction.
There is no sign of the monster. But the mist has
momentarily lifted to reveal the castle, and an odd sight
greets their eyes -- the wooden scaffolding in front of
the tower is slowly rising into the air.
WATSON
(amazed)
What strange goings-on.
HOLMES
Not really. My guess is that the
monster, after a hard day's work, has
returned home for his supper.
109.
The scaffolding in front of the tower slowly descends
back into the place, as mist once more engulfs the
castle.
DISSOLVE TO:
A gig is waiting in front of the entrance, and leaning
against it is the guide we saw earlier at Urquhart.
Holmes comes out, carrying the champagne bottle.
HOLMES
Who's minding the castle?
GUIDE
You'd better get on.
It's late.
Holmes climbs into the gig, and the guide moutns the seat
beside him.
HOLMES
Where are we going?
Some sort of party?
GUIDE
You won't be disappointed in the guest
list.
113.
HOLMES
Who's the host?
GUIDE
Jonah.
He flicks the reins. The horse starts off at a trot, and
the gig turns into the driveway.
As they drive along, Holmes glances at the guide, who is
grim and uncommunicative.
DISSOLVE TO:
The gig, with its two passengers, proceeds along the
lakeshore, approaching the entrance to Urquhart.
A workman is lighting a couple of torches attached to the
ruined gatehouse when the gig comes through the archway.
The guide reins up the horse in front of the steps
leading to the inner courtyard -- which are now covered
with a narrow red carpet.
The guide nods to Holmes, who dismounts, starts up the
steps, examining the red carpet. As he reaches the top,
he looks off.
The strip of red carpet runs across the courtyard, lit by
torches planted in the ground. A couple of workmen are
are unrolling the rest of the carpet toward the entrance
of the tower.
As Holmes passes one of the tents, the flap opens and
Mycroft steps out, dressed in his inevitable frock coat.
MYCROFT
Mr. Ashdown, I presume.
HOLMES
(turning)
The red runner, I presume.
114.
(indicates carpet)
You shouldn't have gone to all this
trouble just for me.
MYCROFT
It's not for you.
(calling into tent)
McKeller.
(to Holmes)
May I have the champagne, please?
HOLMES
(handing him bottle)
1886 -- not a very good vintage, is it?
MYCROFT
Mediocre.
But then again, it's not for
drinking.
A black-suited MAN emerges from the ten, and Mycroft
gives him the champagne.
MYCROFT
Tie it up, will you?
The man moves off toward the tower.
Mycroft pulls back
the flap of the tent.
MYCROFT
In here.
Holmes passes inside, Mycroft following.
A coach and escort approach the castle. Painted on the
door of the coach are the initials "V.R."
The gig, with the quide driving and Holmes beside him,
comes up the driveway, stops in front of the entrance.
Holmes hops down, and twirling Gabrielle's parasol in his
hand, walks into the hotel.
Holmes is leaning against the parapet, scanning the lake
through his telescope. Watson appears through the open
French window behind him.
WATSON
(excitedly)
Holmes, I saw it again -- that thing --
it came from the castle -- it's out there
--
LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY
A trial of bubbles is moving along the surface. Suddenly
there is a muffled explosion from below, and a geyser of
water shoots up into the air.
Holmes slowly lowers the telescope.
HOLMES
It was out there. Now it's gone.
WATSON
Gone?
132.
HOLMES
Forever.
Look for yourself.
LOCH NESS - THROUGH TELESCOPE - DAY
There is a great turbulence in the water. Up to the
surface pops the bottle of christening champagne, with
rope and ribbons still attached. Then a copy of the
Bible pops up.
WATSON
A bottle of champagne?... and a Bible?...
HOLMES
That's all that's left of H.M.S. Jonah.
He steps through the window as a puzzled Watson lowers
the telescope.
Mycroft's aide comes out of the hotel with Gabrielle's
suitcase, loads it into an open carriage waiting in front
of the entrance. Gabrielle emerges, carrying her parasol,
and accompanied by Mycroft. He helps her into the
carriage, gets in beside her.
135.
The aide joins the coachman, and the carriage drives off.
Gabrielle does not look back toward the hotel.
Holmes is framed in the open window, watching the
carriage. Watson comes up behind him.
WATSON
If I promised not to write a word about
it, would you enlighten me? As your
friend -- as your valet --
HOLMES
Quiet. I'm trying to read a personal
message.
WATSON
A message?
The carriage is moving away from the hotel. Gabrielle
has her parasol over her shoulder, and it opens and
closes, opens and closes.
GABRIELLE - IN MOVING CARRIAGE - DAY
She continues to signal with the parasol, unnoticed by
Mycroft.
Watson is straining forward to see out the window.
WATSON
What is she saying?
HOLMES
(slowly)
Auf Wiedersehn.
WATSON
Auf Weider---? The nerve!
136.
The carriage disappears down an avenue of trees,
Gabrielle's parasol still flashing its message.
DISSOLVE TO:
There is snow on the ground, and drifts of it piled up
along the curbs. Traffic is light. Householders are
shovelling the snow off the sidewalks, and pedestrians
are hurrying along bundled up against the cold.
