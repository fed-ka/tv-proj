                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. VIDEO STORE - NIGHT11

        A FLORESCENT LIGHT flickers with an irritating BUZZ. Two 
      hands reach up to twist the BULB out of its socket in the 
      ceiling of a quiet video store.

      Standing on a ladder, THE CLERK gently places the old bulb on 
      the shelf while reaching for a new one. He screws it in, but 
      it continues its irritating blinking.

      EXT. VIDEO STORE/INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT1A1A*

      Lydia s car pulls up. Jackson gets out in mid-conversation *
      with Lydia, arguing with her through the open window.

                                    JACKSON
                    Hoosiers is not only the best 
                      basketball movie ever made, it s 
                    the best sports movie--

                                  LYDIA
                    No.

                                    JACKSON
                    It s got Gene Hackman and Dennis 
                    Hopper--

                                  LYDIA
                    No.

                                    JACKSON
                    I swear to God you ll like it.

                                  LYDIA
                    No.

                                    JACKSON
                    I m not watching The Notebook 
                    again.

      She hits the window button closing it on him with a smile 
      behind the glass.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/102.


      INT. VIDEO STORE - NIGHT1B1B

      A fuming Jackson enters the store, searching for The 
      Notebook. But going row to row and passing by the now empty 
      ladder and replacement bulbs, he can t seem to find it.   

                                    JACKSON
                    Can somebody help me find The 
                    Notebook?

      He glances around. No response. No one at the cash register.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Hello? Anybody working here? 
                    Anybody at all?

      It seems there s not a single other person in the store. 
      Turning back to the shelves, he begins thumbing the DVD s 
      when he spots something...

      THROUGH THE WIRE FRAME of the shelf, Jackson sees TWO SHOES 
      on the floor, toes pointed upward.

      He lets the DVD s fall back. Hand now trembling, he slowly 
      steps left. Inching around the corner of the shelf, he sees 
      the two shoes and now just a bit of the legs.

      Someone is lying on the floor on the other side of the shelf.

      Chest rising with ever shortening breathes, Jackson takes 
      another step. And then another, finally discovering--

      The Clerk lies dead on the floor. Blood everywhere.

      Jackson staggers back and tumbles right into the LADDER. It 
      goes down, wires snapping with it as--

      A SPARK flies from the light fixture. With an ELECTRIC 
      CRACKLING, all of the lights flicker and die, plunging the 
      store into--

      DARKNESS.

      THE SOUND OF MOVEMENT spins Jackson around. A shelf RATTLES, 
      DVD cases trembling as something LARGE moves behind it. 
      Whatever it is, it s between him and the exit.

      INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT22*

      In the driver s seat, Lydia gazes into her camera phone, *
      pursing her lips. Then flips it around to watch the video of 
      herself.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/103.


      INT. VIDEO STORE - NIGHT33

      Jackson crouches behind a shelf, trying to steady his near-
        hyperventilating breaths. Slowly, he peers up above the 
      stacks of DVD s when--

      ONE OF THE SHELVES ROCKS FORWARD. Like dominoes, they begin 
      falling toward him, DVD s flying through the air.

      Jackson moves to dart out of the way, but one of the shelves 
      slams down on his back, pinning his body to the floor. As he 
      tries to push himself up--A shadow falls over him. 

      Jackson holds still as the store becomes ominously quiet and--
      SOMETHING GROWLS mere inches from the back of his head. A 
      clawed hand reaches over the nape of his neck where--

      The MARKS from when Derek punctured his skin are still 
      visible. Yellowish and scabbed, they look infected. Jackson 
      shudders as the tips of the Alpha s claws graze his skin, 
      pulling back and lifting up as if preparing to strike.

      INT. LYDIA S CAR - NIGHT44*

      Lydia raises her camera phone, still recording video of 
      herself when--

      THE STORE S PLATE GLASS WINDOW EXPLODES.

      Fragments shower the lot as a BLACK SHAPE hurtles past 
      Jackson s car.

      Lydia spins around with the camera phone still clutched in 
      her hand, her wide eyes staring off through the window.

      EXT. VIDEO STORE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT55

      The car door clicks open and Lydia shakily steps out.

                                  LYDIA
                      Jackson...

      INT. VIDEO STORE - NIGHT

      Lydia steps past DVD cases strewn across the floor.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Jackson?

      Then she sees a HAND jutting out from underneath an 
      overturned shelf. Terrified, she approaches. Slowly reaching 
      out, her own fingers trembling--              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/104.

                                    JACKSON
                    Don t.

      Lydia SHRIEKS, spinning around to see Jackson just standing 
      there, staring out the broken window.

      With an ELECTRIC CRACKLE, the LIGHTS flicker back on. Lydia 
      looks down to a BLOOD-SOAKED carpet. 

      Now she starts screaming.

      INT. SHERIFF STILINSKI S CAR - NIGHT66

      Sheriff Stilinski drives while Stiles searches through fast 
      food bags.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Did they forget my curly fries?

                                  STILES
                    You re not supposed to eat fries. 
                      Especially the curly ones.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I am carrying a lethal weapon. If I 
                    want the curly fries, I will have 
                    the curly fries.

                                  STILES
                    If you think getting rid of 
                      contractions in your sentences 
                    makes your argument any more 
                      legitimate, you are wrong.

      Before Stilinski can respond, the radio BUZZES to life.

                                  DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    Unit One, do you copy?

      Father and son reach for the CB at the same instant, hands 
      knocking into each other. Stilinski throws a look.

                                  STILES
                    Force of habit.

                                  STILINSKI
                          (into radio)
                    Unit One, copy.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/105.

                                  DISPATCH
                    Got a report of a possible 187.

      Stiles looks up while stuffing a handful of his father s 
      fries into his mouth. He knows exactly what a 187 is.

                                  STILES
                    A murder?

      EXT. VIDEO STORE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT77

      LIGHTS FLASHING, Stilinski s car roars into the lot, pulling 
      up next to two other Deputy Sheriff cruisers.

      INT. SHERIFF STILINSKI S CAR - NIGHT88

      Stilinski turns to his son.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Stay here.

      He hurries out to confer with his Deputies. Stiles sits 
      impatiently while taking in the store s shattered window, the 
      knocked over shelves and... Lydia and Jackson being led out.

                                  STILES
                    No. Way.

      EXT. VIDEO STORE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT99

      Stilinski turns from a crowd of bystanders to his Deputies.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Get this place locked off.

      Stiles pushes his way through the crowd.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia?

      She doesn t seem to hear him or see him while a FEMALE DEPUTY 
      guides her and an irate Jackson to the police cars.

                                    JACKSON
                    I don t need to go to the hospital. *
                    I m fine.*

      Noticing the commotion, Stilinski heads over while leaving 
      his other Deputies to keep the onlookers back.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Why the hell can t I just go home?*              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/106.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I m sorry, but the EMT s tell me *
                    you hit your head pretty hard and *
                    they need to make sure you don t *

                    failing to grasp here? I want to go *
                    home.*

                                  STILINSKI
                      I understand--

                                    JACKSON
                    No, you don t understand. Which 
                    kind of blows my mind since it 
                    should be a pretty basic concept 
                    for a minimum wage rent-a-cop like 
                    you. I just want to go home!*

      He realizes everyone is watching, pity in their eyes. 
      Including Stiles, who is clearly not happy about the rent-a-
      cop line. Until something else catches his eye.

                                  STILES
                    Hey, is that a dead body?

      The throng of ONLOOKERS rushes forward. Stilinski throws an 
      angry glare at his son who shrinks back into the shadows. 
      While all eyes focus on the video store, no one notices--

      THE ROOF ABOVE - where Scott peers over the ledge. Turning 
      back he slumps down as Derek comes forward.

                                  DEREK
                    Starting to get it?

                    I get that he s killing people. But 
                    I don t get why. I mean this isn t 
                    standard practice, right? We don t 
                    just go out in the middle of the 
                    night murdering everyone, do we?

                                  DEREK
                    No. We re predators but we don t 
                    have to be killers.

                                  SCOTT

      They turn for the opposite edge of the roof while below them 
      is something they would never notice: an ODD PATTERN carved 
      into the gravel of the rooftop.

                    You know, I have a life too.

                    What? No. I didn t see anything, I 
                    swear.

                                  DEREK
                    All I want to know is what you saw. 
                    Was it an animal? A mountain lion?

                                    JACKSON
                    I don t know. I m not lying. I 
                    swear to God.

                          (confused)
                    What? That I m not lying?

                                  DEREK
                    The other part. Tell me you didn t 
                    see anything. Slowly. 

                                    JACKSON
                    Why do you care?

                                  DEREK
                    Calm down and say the words.

      Jackson takes a deep breath.

                                    JACKSON
                    I didn t see anything.

      SOUND fades until all Derek can hear is the rhythmic rise and 
      fall of JACKSON S HEARTBEAT.

                                    JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    I m not lying.

                                  DEREK
                    I know. 

      But Derek doesn t retreat. Instead, he takes a step closer. 

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    One more thing...

      He puts his hand on top of Jackson s head. The boy squeezes 
      his eyes shut as if waiting for his neck to be snapped. But 
      Derek simply turns Jackson s head around to get a look at the 
      INFECTED CLAW MARKS on his neck. 

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    You should really get that checked 
                    out.

      Jackson lets out a gasp. His eyes flutter open. And once 
      again... 

      He s alone in the locker room.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Stiles hurries down the hall with his phone to his ear. Scott 
      picks up the line.

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - DAY1616

      Scott covers the phone, trying not to let Allison hear.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    You have any clue what s going on? 
                    Lydia s totally M-I-A, Jackson 
                    looks like he had a time bomb 
                    inserted into his face, another 
                    random guy is dead and you need to 
                    do something about it.

                                  SCOTT
                    Like what?

                                  STILES (V.O.)

                    I ll deal with it later.

      Scott powers his phone down. Then realizes they re about to 
      miss a turn.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Left, left!

      Allison slams a foot on the brake, reflexes surprisingly 
      fast. She spins the wheel like a stunt driver and charges 
      into the turn.

      As Scott slams against his seat belt, she puts a protective 
      hand over his chest.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/1018.

                      masculinity on the way back.

      She gives a laugh as they pull into--

      EXT. WOODS - DAY1717

      Streaks of sunlight peek through branches, casting shadows on 
      a well worn trail. It s idyllic. Serene. But Allison keeps 
      looking behind her, checking her phone. Scott notices.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re so not okay with this, are

      She laughs. He takes her hand pulling her forward.

      INT. MARTIN HOME/LYDIA S BEDROOM - DAY1818

      Lydia lies in bed, glazed eyes fixed on the ceiling. With a 
      knock on the door, Lydia s mom, MRS. MARTIN, peeks in.

                                  MRS. MARTIN
                      Sweetheart, there s a Stiles here

                    What the hell s a Stiles?

      Lydia s mother turns to Stiles with an embarrassed smile.

      Lydia s gaze drifts. Stiles sits on the bed next to her, 
      noticing both her look and change in demeanor.

      EXT. WOODS - DAY1919

      Allison follows Scott as they press deeper into the woods, 
      going up steeper and steeper inclines. When they traverse 
      another outcropping, Allison struggles with the climb.

      Scott looks at her with concern. But she quickens her pace, 
      keeping up. The two slip around a rocky corner and when Scott 
      reaches up to climb over the crest--

      ALLISON LOSES HER FOOTING.

      Scott grabs her with one hand as CLAWS come out of the other, 
      latching into the trunk of a tree. He pulls Allison slowly up 
      and toward him.

      Once she s on steady ground, Scott looks at his hand. The 
      claws are back in. A moment of control. When he looks back, 
      Allison has her phone out, texting.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - DAY2222

      A bare and very muscular torso moves up and down. It s Derek 
      doing chin-ups from an exposed beam on the ceiling. He drops 
      down and starts pumping out push-ups and then--

      STOPS. Halfway between a push-up, with his muscles tensed, 
      his down-turned head slowly peers up.

      THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN.

      Kate calmly walks in, followed by Leveque and Ulrich. The 
      space where Derek was just working out is now empty.

                                    LEVEQUE
                    No one home?

                                  KATE
                    He s here. He s just not feeling 
                      particularly hospitable.

                                  ULRICH
                    Maybe he s out burying a bone in 
                    the backyard.

      As he laughs at his own joke, Kate gives a withering look.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/1024.

                    When we cut her in half.

      Derek hurtles out of the darkness with a GROWL OF RAGE.

      Ulrich draws a gun, but in the blink of an eye, it s out of 
      his hand and he s tumbling to the floor.

      Kate watches with a slight smile at her lips, enjoying it.

      Derek looks up with teeth fully FANGED and leaps toward 
      Leveque. A moment later, the man s unconscious body drops to 
      the floor, rolling to Kate s feet.

      Now Derek goes for her. She stands still as if waiting to be 
      pummeled. And then with a flick of her wrist she has 
      something in her hands--

      A TELESCOPING STUN BATON which crackles with an electric 
      spark. She spins it up and touches it to Derek s skin as he 
      hurtles toward her.

      Derek CRASHES to the floor, muscles flinching and trembling 
      out of control. Kate slowly walks over.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Wow. This grew up in all the right 
                    places.

      As she waves the baton over his eyes, Derek stares at her 
      with absolute hatred. Seething at her playful smile.

      brings up the VIDEO FOOTAGE.

      Scott helps Allison across the rock near a waterfall to a 
      better vantage point. She steps onto one, almost slipping, 
      but he grabs her.

      Then he turns to step onto another rock, slipping as well. 
      But she grabs him. He turns to see her covering a laugh. He 
      looks down.

      His feet are ankle deep in the water. As she smiles down on 
      him, he pulls her forward, getting her feet as well. And then 
      pulls her into a kiss.

                    I ve never seen a mountain lion do 
                    that.

                    What am I looking at? My first 
                    instinct was a bear. But bears 
                    don t run on two legs.

      A DOG IN THE BACK begins to BAY. Deaton looks back. A very 
      different quality about him now. Nervous. He won t look 
      Stilinski in the eye.

                    Could it still be a mountain lion? 

      The dogs continue to howl. Deaton turns back.

                    I m sorry but I ve got a sick

      Scott touches her eyebrow gently with his thumb. She takes 
      his hand in hers, keeping it at her cheek.

3030INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CHEMISTRY CLASSROOM - NIGHT 

      Jackson s parents, MR. and MRS. WHITTEMORE, sit across from 
      Mr. Harris, mid-conversation.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    Jackson s a highly motivated 
                    student. In fact, I d describe him 
                    as unusually driven.

                                  MR. WHITTEMORE
                    We were hoping he might ease up on 
                    himself a little.             TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/1034.


3131EXT. WOODS - NIGHT   

      The HEADLIGHTS from Jackson s BMW illuminate a patch of trees 
      near a field. A SMALL HOOP hangs from a branch. 

      A BEER BOTTLE slips from Jackson s hand into the grass. Using 
      his other hand, he scoops up a ball with his lacrosse stick 
      and FIRES it at the hoop. It soars past, a miss.

                                  MR. WHITTEMORE (V.O.)
                    He s always been hard on himself. 
                    It s something we assumed was an 
                    effect of being adopted.

      Jackson scoops up another ball. Throws again. Misses again.

                                  MR. HARRIS (V.O.)
                    I think I understand. He s never 
                    met his biological parents.

                                  MR. WHITTEMORE (V.O.)
                    That s right. It s the need to 
                    please. The over-achieving. The 
                    desire to make someone proud. 
                    Someone he s never even met.

      Balls come one after another. Some nick the outer edge, but 
      none go through.

                                  MR. HARRIS (V.O.)
                    Well, simply as an outside 
                      perspective, something certainly 
                    seems to have re-calibrated his 
                    desire for achievement several 
                    notches higher.

      A BEER BOTTLE flies, upending through the air, smashing into 
      the hoop and the tree.

                                  MR. HARRIS (V.O.)
                    Not to be too blunt about it, but 
                    he seems almost... obsessed.

      Gasping through clenched teeth, Jackson drops to his knees. 
      He sits there, fists in the dirt, glaring at his failures.

                      Absolutely. And socially, she 
                    displays outstanding leadership 
                      qualities.

                    Boys rarely confide in their

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT3838

      Allison drives while noticing Scott can t seem to sit still. 
      He keeps looking at the clock. At the speedometer. Tapping 
      his foot.

                                  MR. HARRIS (V.O.)
                    Scott is one of my most intriguing 
                    students. You can tell there s 
                    something different about him. 
                    Something special.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL(V.O.)
                    You think so?

                                  MR. HARRIS (V.O.)
                      Definitely. But he s also going 
                    through difficult changes. He just 
                    needs a little more attention. A 
                    guiding hand through this crucial 
                    stage in his development.

      The lights of passing cars flash over Scott s face. One after 
      another. In one quick moment, however, his eyes flash back, 
      becoming REFLECTIVE as he turns his head up.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT4141

      Parents and teachers come out of the school. Amongst them are 
      Stilinski, Mr. and Mrs. Martin and the Whittemores. The 
      Argents, however, rush toward their car.

                                  ARGENT
                          (into his cell)
                    Allison, answering your cell phone 
                    would make discussing the terms of 
                    your grounding far easier. I d call 
                    me back before your punishment 
                    reaches biblical proportions. 

      He clicks off and turns to his wife who is also on her cell.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    Kate hasn t heard from her either.

                    She doesn t do this.

                    Um... excuse me.

      They turn to see Melissa approach, having overheard.

                    You re not Allison s parents, are 
                    you? I m Scott s mom. And I hate to 
                    say this... but he s not answering 
                    his phone either.

                    Funny how you said that like it was

                      I wouldn t claim it as a source of

                    Allison. In the car.

      Argent and Allison s mother come through the crowd. He turns 
      to level his gaze at Scott when--

      A SCREAM erupts. Argent whips around as pandemonium breaks 
      loose.

      Scott looks up, eyes wide with fear as SOMETHING LARGE AND 
      FAST darts through the parked cars.

      People move, trying to avoid it. There s a shout, a scream. 
      CARS swerve and HONK as a SHAPE races through the lot. 

      Scott s heightened senses kick in, all SOUND dropping out as

      He grabs her by the waist, lifting her right off her feet and 
      pulling her back as if she weighed nothing. She staggers onto 
      the pavement out of the way of the skidding car.

      Stilinski un-clips his gun holster as a panicked parent in an 
      SUV jerks out of a spot and SLAMS right into him. 

      Stilinski goes down. The SUV SCREECHES to a halt. The driver

      for it between the tires when she sees--

      Frightened, she presses against the car and holds her breath 
      until it passes. 

      Argent catches a BLUR of the four legged creature.

      Moving with quick and steady strides, he hurries to his car, 
      unlocks the passenger side and yanks the glove compartment 
      open.

      Across the lot, a mass of parents shriek. They re backed into 
      a corner when--

      A GUNSHOT rings out. 

      Everybody hits the pavement. Argent lowers the weapon. Slowly
