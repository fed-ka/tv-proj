      A street corner in a Midwestern suburban neighborhood. Some 
      kids are milling around on the sidewalk-less corner, 
      waiting for the school bus. Lindsay stands there, off to 
      the side. Millie comes up to her.                                  MILLIE
                    Hi, Lindsay.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Hey.

                                  MILLIE
                    You wanna come over my house after 
                    school?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Oh. No, I can't.

                                  MILLIE
                    Why not?

                                    LINDSAY (joking)
                    What, are you writing a book?
                            (off Millie's look)
                    I've got plans. Thanks, though.

      Millie gives Lindsay a disappointed look as we pan over to 
      find--Neal and Bill, deep in discussion, waiting for the 
      bus. Sam walks up.

                                  NEAL
                    Think about what you just said. It 
                    doesn't even sound right.

                                  SAM
                    Hey.

                                  NEAL
                    Sam, Bill thinks that Star Wars is 
                    better than Star Trek.

                                  SAM
                    It is.

                                  NEAL
                    Oh, my God. Not you too.

                                  SAM
                    Star Trek is just a bunch of talking 
                    and Captain Kirk making out with alien 
                    women.                                  NEAL
                    Yeah, and?

      SQUEEEEEAK. The school bus pulls up.


      Kim, Sue and Karen are standing at their bus stop. Sue is 
      smoking. Karen holds a large radio.

                                  KIM
                    He was supposed to come over last 
                    night and he never showed up. He's a 
                    pig, man. A total pig.

                                  SUE
                    I'll take him if you don't want him.

                                  KIM
                    And I'll kill you.

      They all LAUGH. BRUM BRUM! A rusty yellow Trans Am, 
      complete with eagle hood decal, pulls up to the corner. 
      It's Daniel.

                                  DANIEL (to Kim)
                    Hey.

      Kim turns away, acting mad. Sue looks into Daniel's car.

                                  SUE
                    Hey, Daniel. What's up?

                                  DANIEL (ignoring her)
                    Hey, Kim. You want a ride?

                                  SUE
                    She ain't talking to you, man.

                                  DANIEL
                    Fine.      Kim turns and yells over at him.

                                  KIM
                    Where the hell were you last night?

                                  DANIEL
                    I got busy. Get in the car.

                                  KIM
                    Sorry. I'm too busy.

      The bus pulls up and Sue and Karen get on. Kim gives Daniel 
      an angry, yet playful look. She points at her butt, 
      mouthing "kiss my ass." She gets on the bus as Daniel gets 
      a big smile.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      Lindsay is standing around with Daniel, Nick and Ken. Ken 
      has a cigarette behind his ear. The smoking patio is 
      crowded with students.

                                  DANIEL
                    What did Rosso want?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Nothing. He's just giving me a hard 
                    time.                                  DANIEL
                    I hear that. He's always, "Daniel, 
                    you've gotta decide what you're gonna 
                    do with your life." Like I know.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What's the point in doing anything?

                                    DANIEL, NICK & KEN
                    Really.

      Kim Kelly and her entourage come up.

                                  KIM
                    Hey, Ken, gimme a cig.

      Ken pulls the cigarette from behind his ear and holds it 
      out to Kim. She looks at it, disgusted. 

                                  KIM
                    Yeah, great. Why don't you just blow 
                    your nose in some bread and make me a 
                    sandwich, too?

                                  KEN
                    It's the only one I got.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I've got one, Kim.

      Lindsay reaches into her jacket. Kim ignores her.

                                  KIM
                    Why is she here?

                                  DANIEL
                    She's our friend.

                                  KIM
                    She ain't your friend. She's just 
                    slumming.

                                    LINDSAY
                    No, I'm not.

      Kim pushes Lindsay's shoulder, trying to start a fight.                                  KIM
                    Who gave you permission to talk to me, 
                    brain?

                                  DANIEL
                    Hey, Kim, be cool.

                                  KIM
                    You were little Miss Perfect last 
                    year. I'm supposed to think you're one 
                    of us now?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Kim, I belong out here as much as you 
                    do.

      Kim stares at her a beat, then bursts out into mean 
      LAUGHTER.

                                  KIM
                    Hey, brain, I shoplift from your 
                    daddy's store. You're just some rich 
                    kid with rich parents who's pretending 
                    she's a freak all of a sudden. What, 
                    you think that makes you cool?

      Kim starts LAUGHING at Lindsay. She takes the bottom corner 
      of Lindsay's plaid freak jacket and holds it up.

                                  KIM
                    Hey, look, she even bought her own 
                    uniform.

      Karen and Sue LAUGH along with Kim, who gives Lindsay a 
      hateful look.

                                  KIM
                    Well, if these guys wanna stand around 
                    and pretend along with you, then 
                    that's their waste of time. But I 
                    think you're full of crap and I 
                    suggest you don't come out here 
                    anymore. Got it?

      Lindsay stares, taken aback. Kim holds her threatening look 
      and takes off. Karen and Sue stare at Lindsay for a second, 
      then take off after Kim. Lindsay watches after her, looking       wounded.

                                  DANIEL
                    Don't worry about her. She's just on 
                    the rag.

                                    LINDSAY
                    ... yeah.

      Lindsay walks away and goes back into the school. The guys 
      just watch her. Then they look at each other. Ken puts the 
      cigarette in his mouth. Nick scratches his nose. Daniel 
      stares after Lindsay. Nobody knows what to say, so they 
      don't say anything.


                                  END OF ACT ONE


                                        ACT TWO


      Lindsay is under the bleachers, sitting cross legged on the 
      ground. This is where the freaks hang out. There's 
      cigarette butts and beer cans strewn around. Lindsay is 
      staring at the picture of her grandmother.

      THE PICTURE shows a smiling older woman standing in a 
      kitchen, stirring something in a mixing bowl with a wooden 
      spoon. LINDSAY stares at the picture blankly. Then, her 
      brow furrows slightly, as she seems to have a negative 
      thought.

      FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING. Lindsay looks up to see Millie, the 
      school brain, coming toward her. Millie carries a large 
      stack of papers. Lindsay tenses.

                                  MILLIE
                    Lindsay? What are you doing out here?

                                    LINDSAY
                    What are you doing out here?                                  MILLIE
                    Oh, I just had to run these papers 
                    over to Mrs. Kenner's office. It's 
                    research for the Decathlon. Whew, I've 
                    been walking around all day. Mind if I 
                    sit down? My feet hurt.

      Lindsay doesn't look pleased but shrugs "okay." Millie 
      looks at the dirty ground, then around for something to sit 
      on. Seeing nothing, she gingerly sets the stack of papers 
      down and sits on top of it. She really looks out of place.

                                  MILLIE
                            (pointing to picture)
                    Hey, that's your grandma, isn't it?

      Lindsay defensively goes to put the picture away, then 
      stops. She looks at the photo again, then looks at Millie's 
      face, studying it. Millie gives her the smile of an old 
      friend who wishes Lindsay was still her friend.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Yeah.

                                  MILLIE
                    I was so sad when she died this 
                    summer. I really liked her. (laughs) 
                    Remember when we cleaned her 
                      apartment? God, we were only like ten.

                                    LINDSAY
                          (a small smile)
                    Oh, man, I forgot about that.

                                  MILLIE
                    Remember we just kept taking stuff and 
                    putting it under the bed? And when she 
                    came home, the first thing she said 
                    was, "You girls didn't just stuff 
                      everything under the bed, did you?"

                                    LINDSAY (laughs)
                    Yeah, and you go, "We thought that's 
                    where you wanted us to put it."

      They both laugh at this. Lindsay is lightening up 
      considerably.                                  MILLIE
                    I always thought it was so neat that 
                    she didn't get mad at us. She just 
                    laughed and took us to the Dairy 
                    Queen. Remember that?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Yeah. She said if you can't do things 
                    wrong when you're ten, then you'll 
                    just end up doing things wrong when 
                    you get older.

      Lindsay is lost in the happy thought. Then she looks at 
      Millie and smiles sadly.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I really forgot about that. That was 
                    you and me, wasn't it?

      Millie smiles, happy to have the old Lindsay back, and nods 
      "yes." A nice moment passes between them. Then ...

                                  MILLIE
                    Lindsay, everybody's really worried 
                    about you.

      Lindsay gives Millie a puzzled look. Millie's face is 
      suddenly serious. 

                                  MILLIE
                    Why won't you be in the Decathlon?

      Lindsay seems to stiffen. She stares into Millie's eyes as 
      Millie waits for an answer. Lindsay sees Millie's eyes look 
      past her for a flash.

      Lindsay turns and sees MR. ROSSO is standing by the school 
      door on the other side of the football field, looking over 
      at them. He sees Lindsay look and quickly goes inside. 
      LINDSAY looks angry. We can practically hear her defenses 
      slam back down. She turns back to Millie and glares daggers 
      at her.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Why don't you just tell everybody to 
                    worry about themselves? 
                                  (MORE)                                    LINDSAY (CONT'D)
                    And the next time you feel like 
                      reminiscing, go reminisce with Mr. 
                    Rosso.

      Lindsay storms off. Millie jumps up, accidently knocking 
      over the stack of papers.

                                  MILLIE
                    Lindsay! It's not like that. Lindsay!

      Lindsay just keeps walking away. Millie looks down at the 
      papers scattered in the dirt and gets angry. Yells after 
      Lindsay.

                                  MILLIE
                    Remember how you used to hate Kim 
                    Kelly? Well, guess what? You're 
                    turning into her!

      Lindsay keeps walking but this really stings her. She 
      closes her eyes as she walks and tries to shut out the 
      outside world. But we can see by her face that it's not 
      working.


      Lindsay is sitting on the hood of Daniel's Trans Am, 
      flicking her disposable lighter, staring at the flame, a 
      million miles away.

                                  KIM (O.C.)
                    Hey, geek, I just got my third warning 
                    of the semester thanks to you.

      Lindsay looks over wearily to see Kim Kelly approaching. 
      Kim looks ready for a fight. Lindsay almost doesn't seem to 
      care.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What do you care about a warning?

                                  KIM
                    I don't. But I do care that you're the 
                    one that made me get it.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Kim, I don't know what to tell you. I 
                    exist, okay? I'm not going to 
                      disappear. So, unless one of us moves 
                    or dies, you're gonna be stuck with me 
                    around. Can't you just accept that?      Kim LAUGHS mockingly and continues walking toward Lindsay.

                                  KIM
                    God, you just think you're so smart, 
                    don't you? You just think you're the 
                    smartest person in the world and I'm 
                    just some stupid piece of white trash 
                    that you can keep control of if you 
                    talk to it the right way. That's what 
                    you think, isn't it?

      Kim has advanced on Lindsay and is within striking range. 
      Lindsay gives Kim a hard look.

                                    LINDSAY
                            (after a beat)
                    You know what, Kim? That's exactly 
                    what I think.

      This seems to take Kim by surprise. There's actually a hint 
      of vulnerability in her eyes. Just then, MR. WILKINS, the 
      parking lot security guard, pulls up in his rusty old 
      Chevette.

                                  MR. WILKINS
                    Shouldn't you girls be in class?

      Kim continues to stare at Lindsay, studying her. Then she 
      toughens again and starts to back away.

                                  KIM
                    You don't decide to be a freak, rich 
                    girl. You're just born one.

      Kim turns and heads back to the school. Lindsay watches her 
      go, then exhales, showing us she wasn't as composed as we 
      thought she was.


      The SCREAM is actually coming out of a passing car. A 
      couple of teenage guys give a primal YELL at Lindsay, who 
      is walking down the shoulder of the road that runs past the 
      high school.

                                  GUYS
                    Woooo, baby!!! Eeooowww!!!

      ZOOM! The car flies past Lindsay, blowing up a cloud of 
      dust. Lindsay's heading away from the school. There's only 
      empty fields up ahead, except for a strip mall and Italian 
      deli off in a distance intersection.

      Lindsay walks with her arms folded in front of her. Her 
      face is hard. She stares straight ahead as she walks. ZOOM! 
      Another car races by. More dust.

      We hear another car approaching. This time, the SQUEAK of 
      old brakes. CRUNCHING as the car pulls onto the dirt 
      shoulder behind Lindsay. She doesn't look back. Keeps 
      walking.

                                  VOICE (O.C.)
                    Hey, where you going?      Lindsay stops. Turns. It's Mr. Rosso in his beat-up old 
      Dodge Duster. He gets out of the car.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Nowhere.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    Seems that way.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Yeah, that's right. It's pretty ironic 
                    that I said it, huh? Well, it's true. 
                    I am going nowhere, but guess what? I 
                    want to go nowhere. And I'm more than 
                    happy to go there by myself.

      Lindsay turns and starts walking again. Mr. Rosso doesn't 
      move.

                                  MR. ROSSO
                    You know, this world is filled with 
                    people who feel exactly the same way. 
                    But I don't know if I'd want to be one 
                    of those people. Especially if I had 
                    the potential that you have.

      Lindsay spins on Mr. Rosso, her face filled with rage.

                                    LINDSAY
                    The potential for what?! I really wish 
                    that somebody could tell me what in 
                    this world is so great that I should 
                    want it so badly! 'Cause I look around 
                    and everything I see is meaningless. 
                    There's no point in any of it! So, 
                    feel free to delude yourself into 
                    thinking this all actually means 
                    something but leave me out of it! Just 
                    LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

      Her outburst is so violent that Mr. Rosso literally steps 
      back. Lindsay turns and runs off down the road. Mr. Rosso 
      just watches her go, utterly at a loss about to do. He 
      simply EXHALES.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                        ACT FOUR


      Salvatore's parking lot is the freak hangout. It's also 
      where the rest of the school goes for pizza, subs, and to 
      skip class. Lindsay is sitting on the curb, doing nothing.

        BRRRRRUUUUMMMM! Daniel's car pulls into the parking and 
      RUMBLES into a spot facing the road. Ted Nugent's "WANGO 
      TANGO" blares out of the car. The engine stops and so does 
      the music. Daniel, Ken and Nick get out of the car, 
      LAUGHING.

                                  KEN
                    So, the cop goes, "Just pinch its nose 
                    and blow" and he faints!

      They all LAUGH uproariously as they head to the deli door. 
      Just as they're about to enter, Daniel looks over and sees 
      Lindsay.                                  DANIEL
                    Oh, hey, Linds, what're you doing 
                    here? They didn't expel you for 
                    fighting, did they?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Naa.

                                  NICK
                    You wanna hang with us? Ken's dad 
                    brought some M-80s up from Kentucky. 
                    We're gonna blow up Rosso's mailbox.

                                    LINDSAY
                    You guys shouldn't do that.

                                  KEN
                    Why not?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I don't know. Rosso's okay. And why 
                    would you want to ruin a mailbox?

                                  KEN
                    I don't know. We gotta blow up 
                      something.

      Lindsay shakes her head. A car pulls into the parking lot. 
      The guys look over at it and wince.

                                  DANIEL
                    Oh, crap ...

      The car parks and Mr. Guyevski steps out. He's finishing a 
      cigarette.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    Hey, get back to school, you guys.

                                  DANIEL
                            (smiling)
                    What're you doing, Mr. G? Spying on 
                    us?

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    In order to do that I'd have to care 
                    about you, Cortez. 
                                  (MORE)                                  MR. GUYEVSKI (CONT'D)
                    I'm just gettin' some smokes. But now 
                    that we've enjoyed this chance 
                    meeting, I suggest you hightail it 
                    back to class now. Got it?

      The guys just give guilty smiles, nod and head back to 
      their car. We can see how much they like and respect Mr. 
      Guyevski.

                                  KEN
                          (to daniel)
                    I told you we should have gone to 
                    7-11.

                                  DANIEL
                    Just shut up, okay?

      They get in the car and start it up. As it RUMBLES off, Mr. 
      Guyevski looks down at Lindsay.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    Shouldn't you be getting back too?

      Lindsay looks up at him. His weathered face looks honest, 
      kind, almost grandfatherly. Lindsay's face softens, 
      saddens. Mr. Guyevski furrows his brow. Can see something's 
      wrong.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    Lindsay, are you okay?

      Lindsay's eyes well with tears.

                                    LINDSAY
                    ... no ...

      And with this, she completely breaks down. Puts her face in 
      her hands and begins to sob. Mr. Guyevski bends down and 
      grabs her gently by the shoulders.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    C'mon, let's get you out of here.

      He helps her up and leads her to the car as she continues 

      Lindsay and Mr. Guyevski stand in a small, tree-shaded 
      graveyard. It's a pretty, if rather old looking place. The 
      two are looking down at a small gravestone.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    She sounds like she was a great 
                    person.                                    LINDSAY
                    Yeah.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    But I've gotta be honest with you. I 
                    don't think she'd want you to disrupt 
                    your life like this. Look, there's 
                    nothing worse than when people you 
                    love die. Trust me, I know. (sighs) 
                    Lindsay, I hate to throw old cliches 
                    at you but life is for the living.

      Lindsay looks at Mr. Guyevski, her face filled with 
      despair.

                                    LINDSAY
                    But I don't know what "life" is 
                    anymore.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    Lindsay, what are you talking about?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I was with my grandma when she died. I 
                    used to go over everyday to read to 
                    her. And one day, she stopped me mid-
                    sentence and she said, "I'm 
                    dying." (beat) I'd always seen on TV 
                    that when people died in bed, they 
                    looked happy. They always said they 
                    saw a beautiful light or old friends 
                    or they felt like they were floating. 
                    But grandma said she saw nothing, just 
                      blackness. She said she was 
                      suffocating. She looked terrified.

      Lindsay stops herself, then kneels down and puts her hand 
      on her grandmother's grave.

                                    LINDSAY
                    She was such a good person. She 
                    shouldn't have died like that. She did 
                      everything you were supposed to do. 
                    She lived a good life, she went to 
                    church, she helped people, she was 
                    generous, she was kind. 
                                  (MORE)                                    LINDSAY (CONT'D)
                    (looks up at Mr. Guyevski) God was 
                    supposed to take care of her. But he 
                    didn't show up. Nothing showed up.

      Mr. Guyevski stares at her. Not sure what to say.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    You showed up.

                                    LINDSAY
                    And it didn't matter.

      She looks back down at the grave. Mr. Guyevski SIGHS.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    I don't know what to tell you. I'm not 
                      a religious guy. I don't pretend to 
                    know what's on the other side or if 
                    there even is another side. I'd like 
                    to think there is because then death 
                    wouldn't be such a terrifying thing to 
                    consider. But if there's not ... 
                    (thinks a beat) All I know is that if 
                    this is the only life we get, then I'd 
                    think we'd want to do everything we 
                    could, to learn everything we could, 
                    to experience everything.

                                    LINDSAY
                            (desperate)
                    But what's the point in doing 
                    anything?

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    What's the point in not doing 
                    anything? If this is it ... 
                    (shrugs) ... then do something with 
                    it. I can't believe that your grandma 
                    wouldn't want you to.

      Lindsay stares at Mr. Guyevski. He gives her a fatherly 
      smile.

                                  MR. GUYEVSKI
                    C'mon, let's get back to the school. 
                    They need us.      He turns and heads back to his car. Lindsay looks at her 
      grandma's grave again, SIGHS, and heads after Mr. Guyevski.


      Daniel, Nick, Ken and some other freaks are standing around 
      their cars, having a match fight (flicking lit matches at 
      each other's feet).

                                  KEN
                    Hey, watch it. These are my new shoes.

      Daniel and Nick look at each other, smile, and run over to 
      Ken. They both start trying to stomp on his feet. Ken YELLS 
      and runs away, as Daniel and Nick start LAUGHING. Lindsay 
      walks up.

      Stay away from them, Linds. They're morons today.                                    LINDSAY (smiling)
                    "Today?"

                                  DANIEL
                    Oh, you're funny. It must be tough to 
                    be so clever.

      Daniel runs after Lindsay who SCREAMS and tries to run 
      away. Daniel grabs her from behind, around the waist, and 
      leans back, lifting her off the ground. She LAUGHS.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Put me down!

                                  DANIEL
                    What? I'm a moron. I don't understand 
                    what you're saying.

      He puts her down. Lindsay looks happy. She smiles at the 
      guys.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Hey, what are you guys doing now?

                                  NICK
                    I don't know. We've still got the 
                    M-80s.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Oh, forget about the M-80s. You wanna 
                    go to the zoo?

                                  DANIEL
                    The zoo?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Yeah. I don't know. I haven't been 
                    there since grade school. It'd be fun.

                                  KEN
                    I never been to the zoo.

                                  NICK
                    I thought you were born there.

                                  KEN
                    Ha ha. Very funny.      The guys look back at Lindsay. Can see she's serious. She 
      gives them a big pleading smile. They look at each other 
      and shrug.

                                  DANIEL
                    Uh ... sure, I guess. Why not?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Great.

      Just then, Kim walks up. The guys see her and tense up. 
      Lindsay sees their faces change, then turns and sees Kim. 
      Lindsay's smile fades. Kim joins them. She's low key.

                                  KIM
                    Hey, guys.

                                    DANIEL, NICK & KEN
                    Hey, Kim.

      They all stand there for a beat. Then Kim looks over at 
      Lindsay.

                                  KIM
                              (acknowledging)
                    Hey.

      Lindsay is surprised but quickly gathers herself.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Hey, Kim.

      Lindsay and the guys all wait for the other shoe to drop. 
      It doesn't.

                                  KIM
                    What're you all doin'?

                                  DANIEL
                    We're gonna go to the zoo. You wanna 
                    come?

                                  KIM
                    Nah. I gotta take my ma to the 
                    doctors. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

                                  DANIEL
                    Okay. See ya.      Kim turns and leaves. Lindsay watches after her, confused 
      but pleased. She exhales, relieved. The guys exchange 
      looks. Daniel gives them a "don't say a word" look. 

                                  DANIEL
                          (to Lindsay)
                    Okay, so, you know how to get there, 
                    Dr. Doolittle?

                                    LINDSAY
                    Yeah, it's really easy.

      And they all pile into Daniel's car, happy.
