  LOVE (THINK LAUREN GRAHAM AND PAUL RUDD) ARE SEATED AT

                  Mmm.  This zucchini is great.  You

                  wanna try?  

  JAMES KNOWS WHERE THIS IS GOING.

                                    JAMES

                (BY ROTE)  No, thank you but can I

                  offer you some of my fries?

                                    LUCY

                  (MOCK SURPRISED)  Oh did you get

                  fries?  Sure, I'll try.

  SHE TAKES A HANDFUL, DUMPS SOME ON HER DISH AND SOME IN
  HER MOUTH.

                                    JAMES

                I'm all for sharing but in the future

                  maybe get a better side to trade.     "Oldyweds Pilot..."  2.

                The important thing is I finally

                  Could have been worse.  At least

                you didn't stay together until the

                dog left for college.

  JAMES RAISES HIS GLASS.

                                    JAMES

                  Now, I would like to propose a toast.

                To the people of our past.  For

                  letting us practice how to be in a

                  relationship.  For teaching us what

                we want and don't want.  And for

                  ultimately not being good enough to

                  take us off the market.

                  Yeah, I was thinking that you moving

                  into my place makes the most sense

                  since it's bigger.  And allows pets. 

                And I'm really lazy.

                                    LUCY

                But when we talked about moving in

                  together last month you said you

                  thought we should wait.  (GASPS,

                                            SCENE C

    (James, Lucy)

  LUCY IS THE MIDDLE OF MOVING IN, DIGGING THROUGH BOXES
  AND PUTTING THINGS IN DRAWERS.  JAMES RETURNS FROM WORK
  IN A SUIT.  HE DROPS HIS BRIEFCASE.

                                    JAMES

                  (BOOMING VOICE, ENJOYING THIS) 

                  Honey, I'm home!

                                    LUCY

                You just love pretending you're in

                the 1950's.

                                    JAMES

                  That's nonsense.  Now, is the roast

                big enough?  My boss needs to come

                to dinner at the last minute.

  LUCY SMILES.

                                    LUCY

                Oh, I told people about the

                  engagement today.  Everybody at the

                  store was so happy for us.

                                    JAMES

                  That's nice.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  I gotta say I wish we had gotten a

                  little more of that from our families

                and friends.  I mean these are the

                  people we're closest to in the world --

                  we've been pretending to be happy

                for them for years!

                                    LUCY

                  I think it's just because we're

                  older and people are a little more

                set in their ways.  Give them time.

  JAMES NODS.

                                    JAMES

                  Hey, how did it go with the movers?

                                    LUCY

                  Good.  You know it's actually kinda

                  cool to see our stuff blended

                  together.  Makes it feel more real. 

                  I did move one thing.

  SHE LEADS HIM OVER TO A SPOT IN THE APARTMENT.  THERE'S
    A LARGE, DECORATIVE COLUMN.

                                    JAMES

                You moved my Yankee chair.

                                    LUCY

                  Yes.

                                    JAMES

                And replaced it with...?    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  14.

                                    LUCY

                  This decorative column.

                                    JAMES

                But it's not holding anything up.

                                    LUCY

                  Column, comma decorative.

                                    JAMES

                But you could sit in the Yankee

                  chair.

                                    LUCY

                  Don't get me wrong -- I love the

                  Yankee chair.  I just didn't think

                  this was a special enough place for

                it.

                                    JAMES

                So where did you put it?

                                    LUCY

                  I think the closet is a pretty

                  special place.  (OFF HIS LOOK)  How

                  about this?  We try it for two weeks

                and if you still don't like it, the

                  Yankee chair comes back?  

                                    JAMES

                  Fine.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  15.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (I/C)


                                    LUCY

                  It's just -- this was the first big

                  purchase I made to celebrate opening

                my store.  And it reminds me of how

                  scary that time was and how far

                  I've come as a person.  It's

                  something that makes a place feel

                  like home to me.

                                    JAMES

                  Well, if it means that much to you --

                                    LUCY

                  Thank you.

                                    JAMES

                No, if it means that much to you

                  then you're crazy and should get

                  help. 

  SHE GIVES HIM A PLAYFUL SWAT

                                    LUCY

                  Hey, I was thinking of getting

                  started on the wedding planning. 

                  Looking for a dress, a location, a

                  band.  That kind of thing.  Sound

                  good?

                                    JAMES

                  Sure.  Do you need any help?

                                    LUCY

                  Nah, I think I got it.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  16.

                                    JAMES

                  (GREATLY RELIEVED)  I have never

                  been more certain that you are the

                  woman for me.

                                    LUCY

                  This is where being a little older

                is really gonna pay off.  I have

                  been to one hundred and sixteen

                  weddings.  I know what I like.  I

                  even know the dress I want.  It's

                the one my friend Amanda wore.

                                                                          FLIP TO:    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  17.

    (Lucy, Jen, Heidi, Saleswoman)

  WE ARE IN A FANCY WEDDING DRESS STORE WITH LUCY, HEIDI
  AND JEN.  LUCY IS DRESSED IN A HUGE POOFY WEDDING DRESS. 
    A SALESWOMAN STANDS NEARBY.

                                    LUCY

                  (INCREDULOUS)  What was Amanda

                  thinking?  

                                    JEN

                  Yeah, it is a little, a little...

                Bo Peep? 

                                    LUCY

                How could I have liked this?

                                    HEIDI

                We were younger when Amanda got

                  married -- what did we know?  We

                  also didn't think her husband would

                run off with a male nurse.

                  I was so sure this was the one, but

                  I think I need to see something

                  else.  Something more... modern.

  JEN, HEIDI, AND THE SALESWOMAN WAIT.  LUCY COMES OUT IN

    LINGERIE.  UNCOMFORTABLE, SHE COVERS HER CHEST.

                                    LUCY

                  It's a bit much.

                  this stripper, Lucy?" 

                                    LUCY

                  Yeah, I'd feel weird showing this

                  much breast at the wedding.  Plus

                  I've been dating for twenty years. 

                Any guy friend there will have seen

                  them already.  (TO SALESWOMAN) 

                  Maybe it's because I'm not a kid,

                but I think I want something more...

                  modest.

  THE SALESWOMAN NODS.

                  nice Grandma found love again."

                  Well, this is too old, the others

                  were too young.  Not to be too

                  Goldilocks about it, but what do

                you have by way of "just right"?

                                                                            INTERCUT WITH:


  LUCY IS ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE.  WE ARE IN HER
    STATIONERY STORE -- AN INVITING SPACE WITH RACKS OF
    CARDS, ROWS OF WRAPPING PAPER AND CANISTERS FILLED WITH
    RIBBON, ALL ATTRACTIVELY DISPLAYED.  

                                    LUCY

                Hi hon.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  23.

                                    JAMES

                  Hey, how was dress shopping?

                                    LUCY

                  Yeah, my whole "this is gonna be

                  easier because we're older" theory

                  took a real hit.  (RALLYING)  I put

                  a pin in the dress for now, next

                  thing:  I heard this amazing singer

                at a wedding a few years ago.  My

                  assistant's tracking him down.  But

                we need to tell him a date -- how's

                May ninth?

                                    JAMES

                  (AWKWARD)  Uh... I'm not sure I

                  want that to be our anniversary.

                                    LUCY

                Why not?

                                    JAMES

                It was kinda my anniversary with

                  Fiona.

                                    LUCY

                Ew!  Yuck!  Don't want to think

                  about that!

                                    JAMES

                  I know, but I wouldn't want our

                  anniversary to be on a day we had

                one with someone else.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  24.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (I/E)


                                    LUCY

                  Yeah, I guess you're right.  So for

                me, that knocks out (CHECKS CALENDAR) 

                May second, April eighteenth, March

                is shot --

                                    JAMES

                  I don't like this game.

                                    LUCY

                  Well, I guess you wait long enough,

                you pick up a couple of days with

                  associations.

                                    JAMES

                Uh huh, uh huh.  (THEN)  To clarify,

                  I had one.

    THERE'S A BEAT.

                                    LUCY

                You know what?  We'll figure this

                out later in person.  Love you.

                                    JAMES

                  (MUMBLING)  Love you too.

                                    LUCY

                  (ONTO HIM)  Is Eddie there?  You

                  feeling shy?

                                    JAMES

                Uh huh.

                                    LUCY

                  (TEASING)  Would you make kissy

                  noises into the phone for me?    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  25.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (I/E)


                                    JAMES

                  Okay, bye now.

  JAMES HANGS UP.  

                                                                          END INTERCUT.


  LUCY HANGS UP.  HER ASSISTANT, GINNY, COMES INTO THE
  ROOM FROM THE BACK.

                                    GINNY

                So I tracked down a number for that

                  singer.

                                    LUCY

                Oh, good.  I can get something done. 

                I'm telling you this guy is

                  incredible.  He's a dead ringer for

                  Frank Sinatra.  He does this great

                  version of --

                                    GINNY

                No, he doesn't.  He died.

                                    LUCY

                  What?

                                    GINNY

                He passed away.  Three years ago. 

                  He's a dead, dead ringer.

  LUCY IS IN SHOCK.

                                    LUCY

                Oh my God, this is unbelievable.

                                    LUCY (cont'd)

                  I've waited so long to get married

                  that people have actually died.  Of

                old age.

                                    GINNY

                  Would you feel better if he died

                  from a freak accident?

                                    LUCY

                  Yeah, I kinda would.  (HOPEFUL) 

                  Why?  Did he?

                                    GINNY

                No, he went peacefully in his sleep.

                                    LUCY

                  Dammit!

  AND WE...

                                                                          CUT TO:    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  27.

                                            SCENE H

    (James, Lucy, Molly, Young Bride, Young Groom, Extras)

  JAMES IS IN A WILLIAMS-SONOMA TYPE KITCHEN STORE WITH A
    SALESWOMAN, MOLLY.  ANOTHER COUPLE, IN THEIR EARLY
    TWENTIES, WAITS WITH HIM.  LUCY RUSHES IN, HARRIED.

                                    LUCY

                  Sorry! 

                                    JAMES

                No problem.  This is Molly and she's

                  going to "guide us through the

                  registering process."

  MOLLY HANDS BOTH OF THE GUYS REGISTERING GUNS.

                                    MOLLY

                  You'll use this gun to scan in any

                  item you like.

  JAMES NODS AND POINTS THE GUN AT LUCY'S BEHIND.  IT
  MAKES A LITTLE "BEEP" SOUND.  LUCY SWATS HIM PLAYFULLY.

                                    MOLLY (cont'd)

                  (POINTING)  Over here is our most

                  popular microwave oven.

                                    YOUNG GROOM

                (TO YOUNG BRIDE)  Do you have one?  

  THE YOUNG BRIDE SHAKES HER HEAD NO.  THE GROOM "SHOOTS"
  IT.  IT MAKES A "BEEP".    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  28.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (I/H)


                                    LUCY

                  (MELTS)  Aww.  They're just starting

                  out.  I wish we were getting our

                  first microwave.

                                    JAMES

                  I don't.  I wouldn't have had dinner

                for the last fifteen years.

                                    MOLLY

                And you're gonna want a coffeemaker. 

                  This is our Elegante model.

  THE YOUNG GROOM SHOOTS IT.  "BEEP".

                                    JAMES

                  Yeah, we have a coffeemaker.

                                    LUCY

                  Actually, when I moved I brought

                  mine so we have two.  And an espresso

                  machine.  And a French press.  

                                    JAMES

                (TO MOLLY)  Do you provide a service

                  where you take appliances away?

                                    MOLLY

                  Over here, basic cookware: stock

                  pot, saucepan, frying pan... 

                                    LUCY

                Got it, got it, got it.

  THE YOUNG GROOM SELECTS ALL THREE.  "BEEP, BEEP, BEEP."

                                    MOLLY

                  Here's a lovely toaster...    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  29.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (I/H)


  THE YOUNG GROOM SHOOTS THE TOASTER.

                                    LUCY

                  Seriously?  You don't have a toaster?

                                    YOUNG BRIDE

                I'm sorry, did we do something wrong?

                                    LUCY

                No, you're doing it right!  This is

                  when you should get married, when

                  you're young.  And you probably

                  won't have any trouble picking a

                  date or a dress or a singer who's

                  alive!  Unlike me who couldn't find

                any of those things and who owns

                  everything in this store, including

                  this stupid (PICKS UP BOOK)  Book

                on advanced Moroccan cooking! 

    INTRIGUED, THE GROOM POINTS THE GUN AT THE BOOK.

                                    LUCY (cont'd)

                  (PULLS IT AWAY)  You do not need

                  this!  Nobody needs this!  

                                    JAMES

                  (PULLS LUCY ASIDE)  Excuse us.  (TO

                  MOLLY)  And could you maybe look in

                the back and see if there's something

                  more exotic that we might not have?

  MOLLY NODS AND EXITS WITH THE COUPLE.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  (CASUAL)  So... what's up?    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  30.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (I/H)


                                    LUCY

                  I just wish we had met earlier. 

                  Then I could be the cute young bride

                  getting fresh new stuff and everybody

                we told would be happy for us...

                                    JAMES

                You said they just needed time.

                                    LUCY

                  I was being positive then!

    A SALESMAN APPROACHES WITH A TRAY OF SAUSAGES.

                                    SALESMAN

                Try our new honey smoked sausages?

  LUCY SHAKES HER HEAD "NO".  JAMES LOOKS INTRIGUED BUT
    DOESN'T WANT TO SEEM INSENSITIVE.

                                    LUCY

                  Just take one.

  JAMES GRABS ONE QUICKLY AND THE SALESMAN SCURRIES OFF.

                                    LUCY (cont'd)

                And your parents like Fiona better

                  than me.

                                    JAMES

                  Okay we're going wide here.  Let's

                  bring it back. 

                                    LUCY

                  I just think all of this would be

                  easier if it happened earlier.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  31.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (I/H)


                                    JAMES

                  (BEAT, CONSIDERS)  Except I wouldn't

                  have been ready for you.  I would

                  have found some way to screw it up. 

                  This is finally the right time. 

                  Right time, right person.  How many

                  people can say that?  The rest...

                  it's just details.

                                    LUCY

                  (ABSORBS THIS)  You're right.  You're

                so right.  (HUGS HIM)  That's all

                  that really matters.  

                                    JAMES

                But if the details are stressing

                you out, maybe we should think about

                  eloping.

                                    LUCY

                  Really?

                                    JAMES

                We could just meet at the courthouse. 

                  It'd take fifteen minutes and we

                  wouldn't have to deal with parents

                or annoying friends.

                                    LUCY

                Or the mean dress lady.

                                    JAMES

                (NO IDEA)  Or the mean dress lady. 

                It would be private.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  32.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (I/H)


                                    LUCY

                  Just a secret between the two of

                us.  That's really romantic.

                                    JAMES

                  Yeah?

                                    LUCY

                  Yeah.  (BEAT)  Let's do it.  Let's

                  elope.

  THEY SMILE AT EACH OTHER AND THEN KISS.

                                    LUCY (cont'd)

                Oh, man, now I want some of those

                  sausages.

  MOLLY RETURNS, EXCITED.  SHE IS HOLDING A BOX.

                                    MOLLY

                  Okay!  I think I've got it.  This

                is brand new so there's no way you

                  have it.  It's all chrome.  From

                  Italy.  It comes with a five year

                  warranty.

  LUCY AND JAMES CONSIDER IT.

                                    JAMES

                  Wow.  Sounds great.  What is it?

                                            ACT TWO

                                            SCENE J

    (James, Lucy, Eddie, Delivery Guy, Emotionally
    Unavailable Guy, Too Close to his Mother Guy, Passion
  and Drama Guy)

  LUCY IS FINISHING GETTING DRESSED FOR THE COURTHOUSE.  

                                    JAMES  (O.S.)

                You almost ready?  We have to be at

                the courthouse in twenty minutes.  

                                    LUCY

                  (PUTTING IN EARRINGS, CALLING) 

                  Yes!  Almost there!

  SHE STOPS SHORT.  WHERE  HER COLUMN USED TO BE, THERE
  IS NOW A METAL CHAIR FROM YANKEE STADIUM.  JAMES ENTERS. 
  LUCY SHOOTS HIM A QUIZZICAL LOOK.

                                    JAMES

                You said we could try your thing

                for two weeks and we did.

                                    LUCY

                  I know that's what I said but that's

                not what I meant.  

                                    JAMES

                  What did you mean?    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  34.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (II/J)


                                    LUCY

                My thing stays there forever and

                you forget about your thing.

  JAMES REACTS.  THE DOORBELL RINGS.  JAMES ANSWERS IT. 
    A DELIVERY GUY HAS JAMES SIGN FOR A PACKAGE AND EXITS.

                                    JAMES

                  Another package for you.  I gotta

                say I had no idea how much on-line

                  shopping you did until the boxes

                  started coming to this address.

                                    LUCY

                  It's stuff for us.

                                    JAMES

                  (OFF PACKAGE, SKEPTICAL)  From

                    handbagdivas.com?

                                    LUCY

                  Look, I've been buying what I want

                  with my own money for twenty years. 

                  That's not going to change.  Do you

                  want me to become one of those women

                who hides her shopping bags in the

                  trunk and sneaks them in when her

                  husband is asleep?

                                    JAMES

                  I saw that Oprah!  That was crazy!

                                    LUCY

                Hey Eddie.  It's actually not a

                  great time.  We're running out.

                                    EDDIE

                  I know.  I'm coming with you.

  LUCY LOOKS TO JAMES, CONFUSED.

                                    JAMES

                  (SCRAMBLING)  Uh, see, in order to

                  elope we need a witness to appear

                  before the judge so I invited Eddie.

                                    LUCY

                  (SHOCKED)  Really?  

                                    JAMES

                  Yeah.  

                                    LUCY

                  I can't believe you just made this

                  decision for us.  You didn't consult

                me at all.

                                    JAMES

                  I thought you wanted me to handle

                the arrangements.

                                    LUCY

                It is just that if I had one person

                to pick, it wouldn't be Eddie.  (TO

                  EDDIE)  No offense.

                                    EDDIE

                  (SINCERE)  None taken.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  36.

                                    LUCY

                  I mean, it's weird.  We (GESTURES

                TO HER AND EDDIE) used to date and

                had like zero chemistry.  (TO EDDIE) 

                No offense.

                                    EDDIE

                  None taken.

                                    LUCY

                  I guess I knew that we needed a

                  witness but I thought we would just

                ask a clerk or something.

                                    JAMES

                  You'd rather have a complete stranger

                  than Eddie?

                                    LUCY

                  Yes!  (TO EDDIE)  No offense.

                                    EDDIE

                  None taken.

                                    JAMES

                You may be impossible to offend. 

                (TO LUCY)  Eddie seemed like the

                  right choice -- after all, we

                  wouldn't be together if not for

                  him.

                                    EDDIE

                  That's right.  None of this would

                  have happened if I had been a little

                  less dull!    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  37.

                                    JAMES

                You know what buddy, I think it's

                  actually going to be easier to plead

                  your case without you here.

  EDDIE NODS, UNDERSTANDINGLY.  JAMES USHERS HIM OUT.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  Just hang tight.  We'll call you.

  EDDIE EXITS.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  Okay, I admit, I may have had a

                  small inkling of an idea that Eddie

                  would not be your dream witness. 

                But he's been my best friend forever. 

                  I just always thought he would be

                at my wedding.  (THEN)  Look, you're

                not the only one going through this

                  experience.  I have the right to

                  want things too.

                                    LUCY

                  (SOFTENING)  Of course you do.  

                                    JAMES

                So, we'll do this with Eddie?

                                    LUCY

                I'm sorry.  It just feels wrong to

                me.  If Eddie is there, then it

                  feels like other people should be

                  there.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  38.

                But you didn't want that.

    THERE'S A BEAT.  THEY SEEM TO BE AT AN IMPASSE.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  Lucy, what is it you want?  Tell

                me.

                  It's not important.

                You really want to know what I want? 

                  Okay, this is unreasonable and

                  unattainable but in my dream scenario

                  everyone we love would be there and 

                be overjoyed for us.  The whole

                  room would just be filled with love. 

                And I'd look amazing.  And we'd

                  have this day that we would always

                  remember.  (THEN)  But I don't see

                how that can happen.

    (James, Heidi, Jen, Marcia, James's Dad, James's Mom,
    Fiona, Molly, Extras )

  JAMES HAS GATHERED TOGETHER HIS PARENTS, LUCY'S MOM
    (MARCIA), HEIDI, JEN, EDDIE AND SOME FRIENDS.

                                    JAMES

                  Thank you all for coming.  Lucy and

                  I had planned to elope today.

  THE CROWD REACTS, UPSET.  JAMES PUTS UP HIS HAND TO
  QUIET THEM.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                But we have decided to include all

                of you.  It was not my call but

                  having you there was important to

                  Lucy so it's important to me.

                                    HEIDI

                  (SARCASTIC)  Awwww.

  SHE STOPS, COWED.

                But if you are going to be a part

                of this, I have some ground rules.

                  Anything you say can and will be

                  used against you at future holidays. 

                You have the right to experience

                  joy.  If you cannot fake this

                  emotion, someone will be appointed

                in your place.  Everybody clear?

  THE CROWD MURMURS THEIR AGREEMENT.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  Thank you.  You are the people that

                are most important to us in the

                  world and I need your help to pull

                  this off.  Heidi, Jen -- I need you

                to find something for Lucy to wear. 

                It doesn't need to be white.  Just

                  something she'll feel good in. 

                  Something classic.  Think Audrey

                  Hepburn.

                                    HEIDI

                Got it.

  JEN AND HEIDI EXIT.

                                    JAMES

                Did I just say "think Audrey Hepburn"

                in front of everybody I know?

                                    JAMES

                  Mom, Dad, I want you to get some

                  film and take some pictures.

                Oh, great.  We've learned lots of

                new tricks in this photography class

                  we're taking with Fiona.

                  (BUMMED)  Yeah, I know.  We gotta

                  talk about that at another time.

                No, I wanted to come and be a part

                of this.  It's important.  For

                  closure.  (BEAT)  You need this.

  JAMES STARTS TO CONTRADICT HER AND THEN LETS IT GO.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  43.

                                    JAMES

                  Thank you.  Eddie, you're in charge

                of music.  And Fiona, the dog needs

                  a bath.

  EDDIE AND FIONA LEAVE.  THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON LEFT.  

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                I'm sorry, who are you?

                                    MOLLY

                I'm Molly.  I helped you register

                at the kitchen store.

                                    JAMES

                And what are you doing here?

                                    MOLLY

                  I don't know.  I think I got emailed

                by mistake.

                                    JAMES

                  (BEAT)  Do you have rice at that

                  store of yours?

                                    MOLLY

                  Fragrant long grain Basmati rice

                  from India.

                                    JAMES

                Get some to throw at us as we come

                  down the courthouse steps.

                                    MOLLY

                I'm on it!

  SHE EXITS.  AND WE...

                                                                          CUT TO:    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  44.

                                            SCENE M

    (James, Lucy, Heidi, Jen, Eddie, Marcia, James's Mom,
    James's Dad, Fiona, Molly, Susie, Extras)

    FAMILY AND FRIENDS, HAVING COMPLETED THEIR TASKS, HAVE
    REASSEMBLED.  JAMES IS NERVOUSLY PACING.  LUCY ENTERS. 
  SHE IS AMAZED TO SEE EVERYONE THERE WITH DECORATIONS,
  FOOD ETC.  JAMES RUSHES TO MEET HER.

                                    LUCY

                  Wow.  Everybody's here.  (EVEN MORE

                  IMPRESSED)  And they look like

                  they're behaving.

                                    JAMES

                  I just had to get tough with them,

                the way I do with some of my violent

                  criminal clients. (OFF HER CONCERNED

                  LOOK)  No, I don't represent violent

                  criminals.  All innocent.  (THEN) 

                Now Heidi and Jen found you something

                to change into and your mom has

                  your bouquet.  Get going.

                                    LUCY

                  I can't believe you did all this. 

                  (BEAT)  What is wrong with you?

                                    JAMES

                  (TAKEN ABACK)  What?    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  45.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (II/M)


                                    LUCY

                No, I mean how was someone as

                  incredible as you still available? 

                  Like my friend Susie married this

                guy we all know is gay and we talk

                  about it amongst ourselves.  So

                  what is the thing about you that I

                  can't see that all my friends talk

                  about behind my back?  'Cause I

                  gotta say -- from here -- you look

                  pretty great.

                                    JAMES

                  Hey, you were still available.

                                    LUCY

                  Yeah, but we all know what is wrong

                  with me.  I'm crazy.  (THEN)  Now,

                  come on, let's have a wedding before

                you realize that and change your

                  mind!

  SHE STARTS TO EXIT.  FROM THE BACK OF THE CROWD...

                                    SUSIE

                  (DISTRAUGHT)  People think Kenny is

                  gay?

                                    LUCY

                  (BRIGHTLY, TO JAMES)  You invited

                  Susie!  That's great!

  AND WE...

                                                                          CUT TO:    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  46.

                                            SCENE P

    (James, Lucy, Judge McGrath, Heidi, Jen, Eddie, Fiona,
    James's parents, Marcia, Molly, Susie, Extras)

  JAMES WAITS AT THE FRONT WITH THE JUDGE.  LUCY ENTERS,
  CLAD IN THE BORROWED DRESS, HOLDING A BOUQUET.  SHE
  LOOKS GREAT.  JAMES REACTS TO SEEING HER.  SHE STARTS
    WALKING TO MEET HIM.  AS LUCY REACHES JAMES'S PARENTS,
    JAMES'S DAD GRABS HER AND HUGS HER.

                                    JAMES'S DAD

                  Welcome to the family.  (THEN,

                  IMPRESSED TO HIS WIFE)  She's

                  sturdier than Fiona.

                                    LUCY

                  (OUT OF PROPORTION MOVED)  Thank

                  you.

  LUCY FINALLY MAKES HER WAY TO JAMES AT THE FRONT.

                                    JUDGE MCGRATH

                  Welcome.  We are here today to join

                  James Braverman and Lucy Darrow in

                  marriage.

  AS THE JUDGE CONTINUES TO SPEAK, JAMES AND LUCY LOOK
  OUT AT THEIR GUESTS.  EVERYONE SEEMS GLAD TO BE A PART
  OF THEIR SPECIAL DAY.  WE PAN ACROSS TO SEE THAT ALL
  THE PARENTS ARE CRYING.  HEIDI AND JEN AND EDDIE ARE 
    CRYING.  MOLLY, THE WILLIAMS-SONOMA SALESWOMAN, IS REALLY
    LOSING IT.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  47.

                                    LUCY

                  (SOTTO, TOUCHING JAMES'S ARM, AMAZED) 

                  Wow.  Look at all the love.

                                    JAMES

                  Yeah.  I think this is the real

                  purpose of a wedding.  Not so much

                to get married but to force people

                to stop acting like asses.

                                    LUCY

                  Thank you for this.  I can't tell

                you what it means --

  SHE NOTICES THAT THE JUDGE HAS STOPPED TALKING AND IS
    WAITING FOR HER TO BE QUIET.

                                    LUCY (cont'd)

                Oh, sorry.

                                    JUDGE MCGRATH

                  I was just asking if you take this

                man to be your lawfully wedded

                  husband.

                                    LUCY

                Oh, I do!

                                    JUDGE MCGRATH

                And do you, James, take this woman

                to be your lawfully wedded wife?

                                    JAMES

                  I do.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  48.

                                    JUDGE MCGRATH

                  Then for as much as James and Lucy

                  have declared their solemn intention

                in this company, before these

                  witnesses and in my presence, by

                the authority vested in me, I now

                  pronounce you husband and wife.  

  LUCY AND JAMES KISS.  THE CROWD CHEERS.  AS LUCY AND
  JAMES MAKE THEIR WAY DOWN THE "AISLE"...

                                    JAMES

                  (IMPRESSED)  Hey, you didn't laugh

                  when he said, "wife"!

                                    LUCY

                  (GOOFY LAUGH)  He can say it, you

                  can't!

  AND WE...

                                                                          CUT TO:    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  49.

                                            SCENE R

    (James, Lucy)

  JAMES AND LUCY ENTER, EXHAUSTED BUT HAPPY.  

                                    LUCY

                  Some day, huh?  And you know the

                  best part, it really felt like "us."

                                    JAMES

                  Yeah.  (THEN)  Can "us" involve you

                  doing just a little bit more next

                  time?

  SHE SMILES AND NODS.  THEY KISS.

                                    LUCY

                  I think, that with our combined

                  greater wisdom, we should be able

                to handle this marriage thing, no

                  problem.

  JAMES NODS IN AGREEMENT, THEN GETS AN IDEA.  HE GRABS
  THEIR ANSWERING MACHINE.

                                    JAMES

                We gotta let callers know that we

                  made it official.

  LUCY SMILES.  JAMES PRESSES RECORD.    "Oldyweds Pilot..."  50.
    writer's draft - 3/18/08  (II/R)


                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  (INTO MACHINE)  You've reached the

                  Bravermans.

  HE NOTICES LUCY HAS A WEIRD, SLIGHTLY PANICKED LOOK ON
  HER FACE AND STOPS RECORDING.

                                    JAMES (cont'd)

                  What?

                                    LUCY

                  I just hadn't decided if I was taking

                  your name.

                                    JAMES

                (A BIT TAKEN ABACK)  Oh.

                                    LUCY

                  (THINKING OUT LOUD)  Although, I

                  guess we would want a kid to have

                the same last name as both parents

                so if we're gonna start trying soon

                  maybe it makes sense --

  SHE NOTICES THAT NOW JAMES HAS A WEIRD, SLIGHTLY PANICKED
  LOOK ON HIS FACE.  THEY SIT LIKE THIS FOR A BEAT.  THEN
  JAMES PRESSES RECORD.

                                    JAMES

                  (INTO MACHINE)  We're out.  Leave a

                  message.

                                    LUCY

                  (INTO MACHINE, CHEERY)  Bye!

  JAMES STOPS RECORDING THE MESSAGE AND THEY BOTH SIT
  BACK PLEASED AND IMMENSELY RELIEVED.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
