A frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe
house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway.
ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic,
old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other
people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM
BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head.
ANNIE
I've tried them all -- I really have --

and the only church that truly feeds
the soul -- day in, day out -- is
the Church of Baseball.
CUT TO:
Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium
carved into the center of an old Tobacco town.
People are arriving on foot from all around...
"Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air.
CLOSE ON A BASEBALL CLOWN -- MAX PATKIN, 60, at home plate
doing his famous Bill Haley routine. A comic pitcher's windup
full of twists and goofy choreography.
RECORDING OVER P.A.
One o'clock, two o'clock, three
o'clock, rock... Four o'clock, five
o'clock, six o'clock rock...
ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped
off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to
her. He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and
friend.
A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women,
dressed in tight pants, tight everything.
Friendly, eager, innocent -- THEY WAVE TO ANNIE.
FIVE PLAYERS' WIVES AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN sit in a special
box seat behind a small sign "Players' Wives".
RECORDING OVER P.A.
Seven o'clock, eight o'clock, nine
o'clock rock... we're gonna rock
around the clock tonight
CUT TO:
As Max Patkin continues his routine, players warm up, and --
THE MANAGER, JOE RIGGINS, 45, known merely as SKIP, short
for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with
his pitching coach, LARRY HOCKETT late 30's, an ex-big leaguer
whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges.
LARRY ROLLS SOME RED MAN CHEWING TOBACCO into a slab of pink
bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly
together. Larry examines it as they talk -- And shoves the
giant chaw into his mouth.
SKIP
Where's Ebby?
LARRY
Ain't he warning up?
SKIP
(cynically)
No. The guy's professional debut and
he forgets about it.
LARRY
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
A PLAYER, DEKE, 25, stuffs a hot dog into his mouth.
SKIP
Seen Ebby?
DEKE
(mouthful of food)
Nope.

CUT TO:
MAX PATKIN STILL FLAILING AWAY to "Rock Around the Clock".
RECORDING
When the clock strikes two, three,
and four and the band slows down
we'll yell for more, gonna rock around
the clock tonight.
ANNIE LOOKS THROUGH HER BINOCULARS -- Studying the players
warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his
act.
P.O.V. A LATIN PLAYER PLAYING PEPPER.
ANNIE
Number twenty-two's thighs are just
great. Who's he?
JACKSON
(reading the program)
Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg
last year.
ANNIE
Three-fourteen? Hmmm...
Look't those
thighs, Jackson.
BACK TO MAX PATKIN -- He finishes his routine.
RECORDING OVER P.A.
Gonna rock, gonna rock around the
clock tonight.
ANGLE TO ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- Millie has joined Annie and
Jackson. Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for
wisdom and insight.
ANNIE
-- Millie, you've got to stay out of
the clubhouse. It'll just get
everybody in trouble.
MILLIE
I got lured.
ANNIE
You didn't get "lured". Women never
get lured. They're too strong and
powerful for that. Now say it -- "I
didn't get lured and I will take
responsibility for my actions".
MILLIE
"I didn't get lured and I will take
responsibility for my actions".
ANNIE
That's better.
(to Jackson)
Got the radar ready?
JACKSON
Ready.
JACKSON AIMS A RADAR GUN at the plate.
THE PENINSULA WHITE SOX LEADOFF HITTER steps in.
TEDDY THE RADIO MAN (V.O.)
The word on LaLoosh is that the good
looking young lefty has a major league
fastball but sometimes has problems
with his control.
EBBY CALVIN LALOOSH WINDS UP and fires. The pitch sails over
the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the backstop,
and CRASHES INTO THE PRESS BOX.
CUT TO:
THE CATCHER TALKS TO EBBY, trying to calm him down.
CATCHER
What the hell was that?! Lighten up
a little. Awright?
EBBY
(to catcher)
Hey -- what's your name again -- I'm
bad with names --
CATCHER
Ed. You want me to write it on my
chest? Jesus ...
EBBY
Sorry. Hey, Ed, I got a question.
CATCHER
What?
EBBY
Who's the beef sitting behind the
third base dugout?
CATCHER
(slowly)
That's Annie Savoy. Nice eh? But
that's more woman than you ever
dreamed of, Rook. She could kick
your ass and have you for breakfast.
THE CATCHER RETURNS to the plate.
A circle is formed. Everybody gathers. Millie clings to Tony,
her guy of the moment. Crash and Ebby face off.
CRASH
I don't believe in fighting.
EBBY
Pussy.
CRASH
Take the first shot at me.
EBBY
I ain't hitting a man first.
CRASH
Hit me in the chest with this...
CRASH PULLS A BASEBALL from his jacket pocket, tosses it to
Ebby.
EBBY
I'd kill ya.
CRASH
From what I hear you couldn't hit a
bull in the ass with a slingshot
EBBY
Don't try me.
CRASH
Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.
EBBY
No way.
CRASH
C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause
you're starting to think about it
already, you're starting to think
how embarrassing it'll be to miss,
how all these people would laugh.
(teasing mercilessly)
C'mon, Rook -- show me that million
dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good
idea about the five cent head --
EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away,
right at Crash's chest. But, alas --
THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance.
Crash never blinks.
CRASH
Ball four.
EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him.
EBBY
Who the fuck are you?!
CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed,
effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there
stunned. He looks up.
CRASH
I'm Crash Davis. Your new catcher.
And you just got Lesson Number One --
"Don't think -- it can only hurt the
ballclub".
(beat)
Buy ya a drink?
CUT TO:
Deserted streets of the old tobacco town. Crash walks alone.
He picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can. He stops in
front of
a store window. He rolls the newspaper like a short
bat. He takes a batting stance, and --
CRASH TAKES HIS BATTING STANCE in front of the window,
studying his reflection. He taken a "swing". And another.
A GROUP OF OLD BLACK MEN stand in a doorway, watching.
CUT TO:
THE OLD BLACK MAN is tossing wadded up balls of paper at
Crash who takes beautiful, fluid swings with the rolled up
newspaper. Batting practice.
CLOSE ON CRASH'S EYES -- Studying the "pitches" with intense
concentration, endlessly working on his game.
CUT TO:
LARRY, DEKE, MICKEY AND BOBBY ARE SINGING at home plate as a
pre-game show. Larry is Diana Ross, the other three are the
Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky.
LARRY (AND THE SUPREMES)
Baby love, oh oh, baby love, I need
ya oh how I need ya, All ya do is
treat me bad, Take my heart and leave
me sad...
CUT TO:
IN THE DUGOUT -- THE GAME FROM A DUGOUT P.O.V. The players
sit, stand, stir restlessly. A combination of relaxation and
intensity not visible from the stands.
CRASH IS HANDED HIS BAT and helmet by the bat boy.
DEKE
This guy's bringing some serious
smoke out there.
DUGOUT P.O.V. THE WINSTON-SALEM PITCHER throwing hard.
CRASH
He ain't got shit.
FOLLOW CRASH INTO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE -- The ritual. The bat
boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the
bat with great care.
CRASH RISES -- Heads to the plate. Talking to himself.
CRASH
You ain't getting that cheese by me,
meat.
CRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright. Calm. Head still.
CRASH (V.O.)
Look for the fastball up. He's gotta
come with the cheese. Relax. Relax.
Quick bat. Pop the clubhead. Open
the hips. Relax. You're thinking too
much. Get outta your fuckin' head,
Crash.
CLOSE ON CRASH'S FACE -- His eyes intensely focused.
CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER -- Starts his windup.
CRASH (V.O.)
Get on top of the ball. Quick bat.
Don't let him in your kitchen --
THE PITCHER DELIVERS -- Crash strides. Curveball.
Crash swings and misses, offstride. Strike one.
CRASH QUICKLY STEPS OUT OF THE BOX and picks up dirt. Rubs
it on his hands. He's pissed.
CRASH (V.O.)
You stupid fuck, Crash. What're you
swinging at a breaking ball for?
Why's he starting me off with a
hammer? Fuck me.
(more dirt)
You're okay. Stay back. Stay back,
you dumb fuck. Wait. Wait.
P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT DELIVERY -- CURVE BALL AWAY.
CRASH STRIDES INTO THE PITCH -- Lashes a line drive down the
first base line. Just foul.
Crash has started to first. Pulls up. Returns slowly to the
plate. Picks up his bat.
CRASH
Throw that shit again, meat. Throw
that weak ass shit.
(beat)
Now he's gotta try to slip the cheese
by me. One and one. You're on top.
Now bring me the gas --
P.O.V.
PITCHER'S THIRD DELIVERY -- High and tight. Right
at Crash's head. The ball seems to accelerate. About to
explode his skull. For a moment -- THE FEAR OF DEATH...
CRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head.
CRASH CLIMBS OUT OF THE DIRT -- Brushes himself off.
CRASH
This son of a bitch throws hard.
(beat)
Annie, Annie, Annie -- who is this
Annie?
(catching himself)
Jesus, get outta the box you idiot,
where's your head? Get the broad
outta your head.
CRASH HOLDS UP HIS HAND to the ump.
CRASH
Time out.
UMP
Time out!
CRASH STEPS OUT OF THE BOX -- Motions to the bat boy for the
pine tar rag. The boy brings it over. Crash re-applies it to
his bat.
BAT BOY
Get a hit, Crash.
CRASH
Shut up.
CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE BOX -- Talking to himself.
CRASH
Awright, awright. You've seen all
his pitches. Two and one. Relax.
Wait. Quick bat. You can hit this
shit --
CRASH IN THE BATTER'S BOX -- Digs in-again. Takes his stance.
Upright. Relaxed. Ready.
CRASH
Shorten up. Bring the gas... Be quick --
be quick -- yeah, yeah...
CUT TO:
ANNIE AND JACKSON IN THE STANDS -- She's writing a note
quickly, and hands it to Jackson, who hurries off.
CUT TO:
CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT PITCH -- A major league
fastball. It explodes to the plate. Crash swings. And misses.
Strike Three.
CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE DUGOUT -- Head high, no show of
emotion. Almost proud. An old Warrior, not giving an inch
even in defeat.
HE RE-ENTERS THE DUGOUT -- Sits down and starts putting the
catcher's gear back on. Deke leans over.
DEKE
Serious heat, eh?
CRASH
He ain't got shit.
THE BATBOY TAKES THE NOTE FROM JACKSON -- And hands it to
Crash, who refuses to accept it, being busy putting his gear
on.
BAT BOY
From Annie.
CRASH
Read it.
BAT BOY
Dear Crash. You have a lovely swing
but you're pulling your hips out too
early. I'd be happy to meet you at
the Batting Cage tomorrow to discuss
it. Signed, Annie.
DEKE
Well if there's one chick'd know
when you're pulling your hips out
early, Annie's the one.
Crash doesn't seem too amused. He grabs the note, and the
pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout
wall. He scrawls a quick note.
CUT TO:
ANNIE'S PRIVATE BOX -- She's watching the players through
binoculars as Jackson returns with the note.
ANNIE
(looking through the
glasses)
What'd he say?
Jackson looks at the note uneasily, then reads --
JACKSON
It says... "I want to -- make...
love to you. Crash".
ANNIE PUTS DOWN THE GLASSES -- Takes the note.
ANNIE
Oh my...
CUT TO:
ANNIE DIGS IN AT THE PLATE -- Bat in hand. Crash a few feet
away. Annie spits on her hands, wear batting glove, pumps
the bat back and forth.
THE MECHANICAL PITCHING MACHINE DELIVERS -- Kawoosh.
ANNIE SWINGS -- Lashes out a line drive. Crash smiles.
ANNIE
See my hips?
CRASH
Yep.
ANNIE
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
CRASH
When you're hitting you shouldn't
think about anything but hitting.
(beat)
But you shouldn't think about it too
much. The trick is to use your brain
to not use your brain.
ANNIE
But you were pulling your hips last
night.
CRASH
So... Wanta make love?
ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES the next pitch.
ANNIE
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.
You had your chance the other night.
CRASH
What'you see in that guy -- he's
dim, pretty boy. A young, wild...
ANNIE
Young men are uncomplicated.
(Crash mutters)
And he's not "dim". He's just
inexperienced. My job is to give him
"life-wisdom" and help him make it
to the major leagues.
CRASH
That's my job too.
ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch.
ANNIE
Damn.
CRASH
You're pulling your hips out.
ANNIE
But they're nice hips.
(beat)
I looked up your records -- You've
hit 227 home runs in the minors.
That's great!
ANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely.
CRASH
Don't tell anybody.
ANNIE
Why not? If you hit twenty homers
this year you'll be the all time
minor league champ! The record's...
CRASH
247 home runs in the minors would be
a dubious honor, if ya think about
it.
ANNIE
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The
Sporting News should know about it.
CRASH
No. Please.
ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one.
ANNIE
Damn.
CRASH
Let me.
CRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance. The
pitch comes. Crash drills it.
CRASH
Your place or mine?
ANNIE
Despite my love of weird metaphysics
and my rejection of most Judao-
Christian ethics, I am, within the
framework of a baseball season,
monogamous.
CRASH
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a
guy like me 'cause it might be real
so you sabotage it with some bullshit
about commitment to a young boy you
can boss around --
(whack -- a line drive)
Great deal. You get to write self-
indulgent little poems all winter
about how hard it is to find a man
even though you just sent him packing --
(whack -- a line drive)
So what do you really want? You wanta
be a tragic woman figure wallowing
in the bullshit of magic?
(whack -- a line drive)
Or do you want a guy?
The pitching machine arm flaps. Empty. Silence.
ANNIE
Oh Crash... you do make speeches...
Crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate. She follows.
A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ARRIVES -- Twenty-five 10 year olds in
uniform with a couple PARENT COACHES.
LITTLE LEAGUER #1
Hey, are you Crash Davis! Can I have
a autograph?!
CRASH STOPS TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS amidst 25 Little Leaguers.
CRASH
(as he signs autographs)
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
ANNIE
You got me all confused.
CRASH
A batter has two tenths of a second
to decide whether to swing --
ANNIE
I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman.
LITTLE LEAGUER
Hey, when are you guys gonna start
winning? You're terrible!
ANNIE
It's a long season, boys.
SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche.
NUKE
Hey!
(coming over)
What're you guys doing here --
stealing my girl?
CRASH
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like
that?
(to the little leaguers)
Hey kids, this is the great Ebby
Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
LITTLE LEAGUERS
It's Nuke, it's Nuke! Can I have
your autograph?! Etc.
NUKE
No prob, kids --
And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers.
Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke.
CRASH
See you guys at the ballpark.
Crash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers.
CUT TO:
AN AGING SHELBY MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- The paint's fading, a
couple dings in the body, but loaded under the hood.
CRASH PUNCHES HIS TAPE DECK -- Sam Cooke's "You Send Me".
ANNIE BITES HER FIST watching Crash leave.
DISSOLVE TO:
NUKE ON A PAY PHONE -- In his uniform. Players warming up in
the background as the ground crew prepares the field.
NUKE
Hello? Dad? This is Ebby.
(beat)
Yeah, I know, I know -- you got the
Durham papers yet? Well I been a
little wild...
(defensively)
These hitters down here are better
than the ones in high school...
(trying to change
subject)
How's Mom? Yeah? Well I am trying
hard... I am bending my back... you're
not coming down' here to visit just
yet, are you?
(beat)
Can I talk to Mom?
CUT TO:
THE MAYOR OF DURHAM AND THE CITY COUNCIL stand at a mike in
front of home plate. 300 LITTLE LEAGUERS in uniform are lined
up along the foul line, restrained by a rope.
VOICE OVER P.A.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of
Durham, the honorable Mutt Clark...
THE MAYOR STEPS to the mike.
A classic Southern mayor.
MAYOR
Welcome to the "Atlantic Seaboard
Tobacco Growers City Council Little
League Cash Drop Night"!
As the honorable Mutt Clark drones on -- we INTERCUT:
CUT TO:
NUKE IS WARMING UP TO PITCH -- Crash and Larry watch him
closely, giving advice. As Nuke delivers --.
CRASH
Drive off your back leg. You pitch
with your legs as much as your arms --
NUKE
I thought I was --
CRASH
Don't think.
A MANGY DOG EATS FROM A DISH provided by the players. A couple
kids sit with the players.
MILLIE SITS DOWN NEXT TO A PLAYER -- BOBBY, 25.
MILLIE
Hi, I'm Millie.
BOBBY
I'm married.
JOSE FASHIONS A SMALL CROSS OUT OF CHICKEN BONES and rubs it
on his bat. Bobby notices this.
BOBBY
What's that?
JOSE
Chicken bone cross take the curse
off this bat and bring me hits.
BOBBY
You a God damn witch?
JOSE
Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very
common in Puerto Rico.
BOBBY
Will that work for me?
JOSE
If you believe in Voodoo.
BOBBY
I'm 0 for 16! Gimme some of that
shit.
BOBBY HOLDS OUT HIS BAT for Jose to rub with the cross.
JOSE
No, that is not belief. That is
desperation.
BOBBY
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
ALL HEADS TURN, A HELICOPTER APPEARS ABOVE THE FIELD
CUT TO:
BACK TO THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL -- Hair and hats blowing
from the chopper turbulence.
MAYOR
...five, four, three, two, one...
let 'er go! One thousand big ones!
THE HELICOPTER DUMPS HUNDREDS OF DOLLAR BILLS above the field.
The night sky fills with fluttering money THE ROPE IS DROPPED --
THREE HUNDRED LITTLE LEAGUERS charge across the infield to
the falling money, scooping it up wildly, brawling, shoving,
clawing for the cash.
As the money flutters down...
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE ON THE ROSIN BAG on the mound. A hand picks it up.
Puffs of rosin "smoke". Nuke is on the mound.
NUKE NERVOUSLY WALKS AROUND THE MOUND -- Just before the
first batter. He picks up the rosin bag. Digs a slot for his
lead foot to land. And CRASH APPROACHES, in full gear, mask
tipped up on his head.
CRASH
Don't try to strike everybody out.
(beat)
Strikeouts are boring. They're
Fascist. Throw some ground balls,
it's more Democratic.
CRASH TURNS AND HEADS TO THE PLATE and we hear the beginning
of Nuke's interior monologue.
NUKE (V.O.)
What's this guy know, eh? If he's so
great why's he been in the minors
for ten years? And if he's so hot
how come Annie wants me instead of
him.
CRASH TURNS AROUND HALF WAY TO THE PLATE and returns to the
mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking.
CRASH
And listen, meat. You don't know
shit. If you want to get to the Show,
you'll listen to me. She only wants
you 'cause she can boss you around,
got it?
(beat, complete tone
change)
Relax, have a ball out here. This
game's fun, okay? Fun, God damn it.
(beat)
And don't squeeze the ball so tight.
It's an egg. Hold it like an egg.
CRASH SMILES -- And trots back to the plate.
NUKE'S P.O.V. The first batter steps in. Crash gives the
sign for the pitch.
NUKE
Fun? What's he know about fun?
(beat)
Why's he calling for a curveball? I
wanta bring heat.
CRASH
Shake off the pitch. Throw what you
wanta.
NUKE SHAKES OFF THE PITCH -- Here comes Crash back out to
the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch.
CRASH
Why you shaking me off?
NUKE
I wanta throw the heater to announce
my presence with authority.
CRASH
"To announce your fucking presence
with authority"? This guy's a first
ball fastball hitter. He's looking
for heat.
NUKE
But he ain't seen my heat --
CRASH
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
CRASH RETURNS ONE MORE TIME to behind the plate.
CRASH CROSSES THE PLATE, past the hitter. He speaks to the
opposing leadoff batter.
CRASH
Fastball.
NUKE
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm
the guy driving a Porsche.
NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS -- A fastball.
THE LEADOFF HITTER TEES OFF on the pitch and sends a line
shot over the right field fence.
CLOSE ON BILLBOARD -- "Hit Cow, Win Steak" sign, The home
run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump.
The COW'S MOUTH OPENS AND MOOS.
THE BATTER STANDS AND WATCHES the home run, admiring the
shot, enjoying the moment. CRASH GETS IN HIS FACE instantly --
and gets very tough.
CRASH
What're you lookin' at?! You're
showing up my pitcher, bush -- get
your ass in gear!
THE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared.
AND CRASH HEADS TO THE MOUND where Nuke watches the Mooing
Cow and the circling batter with dismay. Crash smiles.
CRASH
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
NUKE
Well, I held it like an egg.
CRASH
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.
(beat)
Having fun yet?
NUKE
I'm having a blast.
(beat)
God, that sucker teed off on it just
like he knew I was gonna throw a
fastball.
CRASH
He did know.
NUKE
How?
CRASH
I told him.
CRASH SMILES -- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate.
NUKE SIGHS -- Takes a deep breath.
NUKE
Don't think. Just throw. Don't think.
Just throw.
NUKE'S WINDUP AND DELIVERY -- A fastball. A powerful, clean,
overwhelming fastball. Strike one.
NUKE
God, that was beautiful. What'd I
do?
NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS HIS NEXT PITCH -- A monster. An
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh fastball. Twenty feet wide of the
plate.
THE BULL MASCOT DIVES FOR COVER -- The ball hits the bat
rack. Bats go flying.
CUT TO:

SKIP
(fatherly)
Relax, Nuke, Relax...
(to Crash)
What kinda stuff's he got?
CRASH
I don't know. I haven't caught
anything yet.
SKIP
What're you thinking about out here,
Nuke?
NUKE
I'm trying not to think.
SKIP
Good. But just 'cause you ain't
s'posed to think don't mean you ain't
s'posed to use your head.
SKIP SLAPS NUKE ON THE ASS in a gruff, reassuring way, and
returns to the dugout. Leaving Nuke and Crash.
CRASH
Have some fun, God damn it.
CRASH SMILES -- And as he returns to the plate...
CUT TO:

DURHAM AT BAT -- DUGOUT -- Crash lets Jose rub his bat with
a chicken bone cross. Then steps to the plate and --

THE SIX PLAYERS' WIVES WAIT in a cluster. Three of them have
SMALL CHILDREN. The children are crying.
The long-suffering women try to calm the kids.

BOBBY
You wanted to see me?
SKIP
Yeah, Bobby, shut the door.
(he does)
This is the toughest job a manager
has...
(beat)
But the organization has decided to
make a change --
BOBBY
Skip, I know I'm in a slump but I
hit the ball hard tonight, right at
'em. A couple flares drop in, and
I'm back in the groove!
The nearly naked 25 year old man pleads helplessly -- his
career is over.
CUT TO:
THE PLAYERS EXIT -- The Groupies wait in a cluster. The wives
wait in another group. Bobby's wife sees Bobby.

There's Daddy! Wave to Daddy!
-- P.O.V. BOBBY COMING OUT OF THE CLUBHOUSE -- Another player
has his arm around Bobby, consoling him. The wife knows.
BOBBY'S WIFE
Oh God...
DISSOLVE TO:
THE DURHAM BULLS TEAM BUS is parked. Luggage is loaded. Sleepy
players arriving, escorted by wives and girlfriends.
ANNIE BIDS NUKE GOODBYE -- Off to the side. She pulls
something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke. A pair of
WOMEN'S RED PANTIES, with lace and frills.
ANNIE
I want you to wear these on the road
trip when you pitch.
NUKE
What?
ANNIE
They'll fit snugly against your balls
in such a wonderful way that you'll
start seeing things differently --
plus they'll remind you of me which
is better than thinking about those
nasty hitters.
NUKE
Jesus, Annie, I don't know --
ANNIE
You've been pitching out of the wrong
side of your brain. These'll help
move things to the right side.
NUKE
Big League pitchers don't use these.
ANNIE
They did when they were in the
Carolina League.
NUKE STUFFS THE PANTIES in his pocket, bewildered. A small
kiss from Annie, and he hurries to the bus.
CUT TO:
THE TEAM BUS PULLS OUT -- Wives and girlfriends head back to
their apartments, leaving:
ANNIE WALKING BACK ROME -- Several blocks to her house.
ANNIE
Men don't realize that women always
know when they've been unfaithful.
(beat)
The fact is, upon exact moment of
penetration -- the woman knows.
AS ANNIE WALKS BACK through Durham...
DISSOLVE TO:
THE TEAM BUS ROLLS through the North Carolina landscape.
ANNIE
This sort of spiritual awareness can
be a mixed blessing, especially if
you're dating a ballplayer. I believe
a woman oughta take care of her man
so thoroughly that he can go on the
road for a few days without having
the desire to search out another
pair of panties
(self-aware)
That is probably, however, my most
ridiculous belief.
(sigh)
I just hope the boys start winning
soon. In some profound way I fear
that a last place team is a reflection
on its women...
THE BUS ROLLS through North Carolina.
CUT TO:
MAX PATKIN COACHES THIRD in his comic routine, now, for the
Winston-Salem team, as Durham is in the field.
A WINSTON-SALEM BATTER lines a double off the wall.
CUT TO:
The bus rolls through a small town.
CUT TO:
THE TEAM BUS PULLS IN -- Players stagger off, half asleep.
TEDDY (O.S.)
(on the air)
Bulls will attempt to end a six game
losing streak against the Greensboro
Astros with Nuke LaLoosh on the
hill...
CUT TO:
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- The batter swings, and:
CUT TO:
SKIP REMOVES NUKE FROM THE GAME and he heads for the showers.
CUT TO:
As the players rise in the bus, Deke is trying to work up
excitement about the "Holiday on Ice" bus from which twenty
great looking women ice skaters are getting off.
P.O.V.
HOLIDAY ON ICE GIRLS getting off the bus.
TONY
Ice skaters. God. Look't em. that's
what we need, y'know -- one night
with some skaters and we can get
back on track...
DEKE
We need a night off just to stop our
losing streak. We need a rainout.
CRASH
I can get us a rainout.
MICKEY
It's 90 degrees, there ain't been a
cloud in the sky in weeks.
CRASH
Hundred bucks says I can get us a
rainout tomorrow.
TONY
You're on.
CUT TO:
A CAB PULLS UP in the dark. Late at night. The cab leaves,
and the four men climb over the fence.
CUT TO:
CRASH PULLS THE LID OFF A BOX -- Several valve handles.
Crash turns several handles with an iron bar, and...
THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM COMES TO LIFE -- And suddenly the field
is covered with the clicking of rain-bird sprinklers, throwing
long slow arcs of water across the entire field.
CUT TO:
NIGHT
THE FOUR PLAYERS sit on the scoreboard, watching the
sprinklers flood the field. A six-pack is passed around.
CUT TO:
A QUAGMIRE ON THE INFIELD -- The Kingston GENERAL MANAGER
stands in the muck with his ground crew. Wheelbarrows,
shovels, sand is piled around. It's hopeless.
KINGSTON G.M.
God damn it! Vandals. Damn kids!
GROUND CREW MEMBER
We can't get it ready by game time,
boss.
The General Manager studies the field. Hopeless.
He looks up at the sky. Cloudless, sunny.
KINGSTON G.M.
(to his assistant)
Call the radio and the paper.
(with disgust)
The game's been rained out.
Organ music -- "The Blue Danube Waltz".
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON NUKE'S FACE -- He takes his cap off, wipes his brow.
He's pitching. Everything in SLO-MO.
FANS IN THE BALLPARK LAUGH at Nuke, mocking his.
EXTREME CLOSE UP ON NUKE'S EYES -- Frightened.
SLOW FULLBACK ON NUKE -- HE'S STARK NAKED save for his cap
and glove. Everyone else is clothed.
NUKE WINDS AND PITCHES in the nude. SLO-MO... and as the
batter cranks up to take a vicious swing --
CUT TO:
The team bus pulls into a deserted parking lot. A few of the
players' cars are parked. Some of the wives and girlfriends.
And Annie.
THE PLAYERS SHUFFLE OFF the bus. Tired and beat.
CLOSE ON NUKE -- He looks worse than the rest. He sees Annie
and waves. She's waiting next to her old Volvo.
CUT TO:
ANNIE'S VOLVO PULLS OUT -- She drives.
Flowers and birdfeeders everywhere. And, 60 feet away in
complete, oversized catcher's gear --
JACKSON IN A CATCHER'S CROUCH -- Nuke stares, in his street
clothes, but now with a glove and ball.
JACKSON
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in
here, hum babe--
ANNIE
That's not necessary, Jackson --
(beat)
Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He does. Jackson flashes some ridiculous signs.
NUKE
This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.
ANNIE
Just do what I say. Now, which nostril
are you breathing through?
NUKE
Which nostril am I breathing through?
Annie puts her hand under his nose.
ANNIE
The right nostril. Good.
NUKE
My right nostril?
ANNIE
There are two important psychic
conduits called the "pingala" and
the "ida". The pingala starts with
the left testicle (or left ovary of
the female) and ends at the right
nostril.
She touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of
fact manner. He stares back.
ANNIE
The ida originates at the right
testicle (or ovary) and terminates
at the left nostril.
NUKE
I'm really beat. I need some serious
"z's" --
ANNIE
The pingala is the nostril used for
throwing a baseball.
(beat)
And if you discover before a game
you're in the wrong nostril, it's
easy to switch.
NUKE
Switch nostrils?
ANNIE
Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.
NUKE TOSSES AN EASY PITCH to Jackson. Annie's incensed.
ANNIE
You're patronizing me! I will not be
patronized --
NUKE
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the
kid.
ANNIE
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose
records were better than one and
six.
Nuke gets a little steamed. He feels his nostril, winds, and
fires a medium speed fastball to Jackson.
NUKE
(a bit angry)
How was that?
ANNIE
A little better.
NUKE
Gimme the God damn ball!
NUKE WINDS UP and fires a pitch to Jackson. Alas --
THE BALL SAILS THROUGH A WINDOW -- Crashing glass.
NUKE
(cynically)
How ya like that?
ANNIE
Much better. Your delivery was fully
integrated because you weren't
thinking about it 'cause you were
pissed off at me.
(beat)
This is progress.
Nuke smiles and gives in. And reaches for her.
NUKE
I give up. Let's go inside, make
love, and fall asleep till it's time
to go to the ballpark.
She takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch.
ANNIE
Or...
(taking his hand)
...We could just take that sexual
energy and save it for a few hours
and re-channel it into your pitching
tonight.
(shouting)
C'mon, Jackson, I've got some
lemonade!
Jackson runs over in full gear to join them.
SITTING ON THE BACK PORCH -- A pitcher of lemonade.
NUKE
I can't keep up with you. First you
say sex is gonna make me a better
pitcher -- now no sex is gonna do
it?!
ANNIE
It's all the same thing.
SUDDENLY NUKE'S FACE IS FILLED WITH ALARM -- He points.
NUKE
What's that?!
-- P.O.V. A CARDBOARD BOX ON A TABLE NEARBY -- Scrawled in
larged letters on the side are the words "MAX PATKIN".
ANNIE
(matter of factly)
That's Max. His ashes anyway. He
left no kin...
Nuke stares, unsettled.
NUKE
God... I think I'm gonna be sick --
ANNIE
Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing
to be scared of. It's just another
way of living. It's just a fresh
start -- kinda like spring training.
Nuke thinks about this carefully. Looks at the ashes, at
Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head.
NUKE
Death is like spring training?
ANNIE
Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in
the eyes, Nuke --
(sweetly accusing him)
You haven't been wearing my panties,
have you?
CLOSE ON NUKE -- Utterly bewildered.
CUT TO:
A BLACK GOSPEL GROUP at a mike at home plate, singing:
GOSPEL SINGER
(singing)
I come to the garden alone, When the
dew is still on the roses, And the
voice I hear, whispering in my ear,.
The Son of God discloses --
ANNIE SPRINKLES MAX'S ASHES on the pitcher's mound, as:
JACKSON SITS IN THE DUGOUT FILLING ROSIN BAGS with the extra
ashes from a box.
EXTREME CLOSE UP -- A ROSIN BAG MARKED "MAX"
DISSOLVE TO:
EXTREME CLOSE UP -- "MAX" ROSIN BAG on the mound.
NUKE ON THE MOUND -- PICKS UP the rosin bag, and paces. A
small crowd. A batter steps in to hit. Nuke looks in for the
sign.
NUKE
God, these panties feel great. That
don't make me queer, right? Right.
Whoo.
(reads the sign)
Breaking ball.
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- Breaking ball for a strike.
NUKE
I ain't queer. I know I ain't...
(reads the sign)
Fastball.
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- Fastball for a strike.
CUT TO:
ANNIE'S BOX SEAT IN THE STANDS -- She charts pitches.
JACKSON
Ninety-three miles an hour.
ANNIE
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
CUT TO:
NUKE ON THE MOUND -- He looks in for the sign.
NUKE
Fastball again? Why's he want the
heat -- I just threw heat. Don't
think, Meat -- give 'em the gas.
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- An eye-popping fastball. The batter
swings and misses. Strike three.
CUT TO:
IN THE DUGOUT -- SKIP AND LARRY LOOK AT EACH other warily.
SKIP
Jesus -- what's got into Nuke?
LARRY
I heard he's wearing women's underwear --
and he's breathing through his pingala
nostril.
SKIP
(spitting tobacco)
I'm getting too old for this game.
P.O.V. NUKES FASTBALL SHATTERS A BAT -- THE HITTER hits a
weak roller to third for the second out.
CUT TO:
BACK TO THE MOUND -- Nuke is pumped up. Paces.
NUKE
God, Annie's got a great ass... How
come her panties fit me? That's one
of the mysteries of sex I guess...
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS A VICIOUS CURVEBALL -- A check swing
dribbler to first for the third out. And the players run
into the dugout.
CUT TO:
Crash kneels, rubbing the bat handle with pine tar. He studies
the pitcher working the first two hitters.
CRASH RISES and heads to the plate.
CRASH STEPS INTO THE BOX -- Digs in.
CRASH
I dare you to throw me the hammer --
you ain't that stupid...
CRASH'S P.O.V. IN SLOW-MOTION -- The pitcher winds and
delivers. And as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand--
CRASH
Breaking ball -- you fool!
CRASH UNLOADS ON THE PITCH -- Crushing a home run deep over
the left field wall.
DISSOLVE TO:
PLAYERS TAKING GROUND BALLS and batting practice.
ANNIE (V.O.)
I figured Nuke would win a couple,
then lose, and things would get back
to normal...
PLAYERS PLAYING "FLIP" PEPPER like kids.
ANNIE (V.O.)
But it didn't happen like that...
and for one extraordinary June and
July, the Durham Bulls, for whatever
perverse reason, began playing
baseball with joy and verve and poetry --
NUKE WARMING UP in the bullpen, listening to Crash.
ANNIE (V.O.)
The two sides of my own brain were
all jumbled up and cross-wired...
while one side was being neglected,
the other was in paradise watching
our Bulls play like Big Leaguers...
MICKEY RIPS A TRIPLE UP THE ALLEY -- Slides into third.
DEKE AND TOMMY TURN A SPECTACULAR DOUBLE PLAY
ANNIE (V.O.)
We swept a four game series with
Kingston, back to back doubleheaders
with Winston-Salem, and kicked the
holy shit out of Greensboro in a
three game series...
SEVERAL PLAYERS SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS at a local mall. A line
of kids to meet them. A banner -- MEET YOUR BULLS!
ANNIE (V.O.)
They were in demand all over town --
and Crash, who kept hitting dingers,
was approaching the minor league
record... though I told nobody.
CRASH BLASTS ANOTHER HOME RUN -- Another win.
JULY 4 PROMOTION -- LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY, AND JOSE dressed as
the "Spirit of 176 Drum and Fife Corps" at home plate,
surrounded by a Boy Scout Troop.
ANNIE (V.O.)
After sweeping a July 4 doubleheader,
the Durham Bulls were tied for first.
THE WIVES, THE GROUPIES, AND MILLIE WAIT for the players
outside the clubhouse following a game.
ANNIE SITS ALONE IN HER BOX SEAT as the stadium empties.
ANNIE (V.O.)
But beautiful as the winning streak
was, I was getting damn lonely.
(beat)
Something had to be done. I needed a
man...
CUT TO:
The sounds of Diana Ross and the Supremes.
THE BUS PULLS IN -- Wives and girlfriends are waiting.
The players get off, greet their women.
ANNIE GREETS NUKE -- They head for her Volvo..
JIMMY STARTS ACROSS THE LOT on foot, dragging his luggage,
when Millie pulls up in her car.
MILLIE
Hi, Jimmy. Want a ride?
JIMMY
(nervously)
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as
your personal savior?
MILLIE
No.
JIMMY
Can I give you my testimony?
MILLIE
You can do anything you want.
(a tiny grin)
Hop in.
JIMMY NERVOUSLY GETS IN WITH MILLIE They roar away.
CUT TO:
A run of the mill cheap modern motel.
GAME IN PROGRESS -- Nuke on the mound.
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- Very high. Ball three.
CUT TO:
INSIDE THE DUGOUT -- Skip and Larry spitting tobacco.
SKIP
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't
look loose. Anything bothering him?
LARRY
He said his chakras were jammed and
he was breathing out of the wrong
nostril.
SKIP
(spitting tobacco)
Okay...
CUT TO:
BACK TO THE MOUND
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS AGAIN -- Very high. Ball four.
CRASH IS QUICKLY to the mound.
CRASH
What's wrong?
NUKE
I'm nervous -- my old man's here.
NUKE MOTIONS -- They both look.
-- P.O.V.
NUKE'S FATHER SITTING in a special box seat. The
man is 45, and is operating a home video camera taking
pictures of his son.
CRASH
Hey, he's just your father, man --
he's as full of shit as anybody.
TOMMY AND DEKE JOIN THEM at the mound.
DEKE
What the hell's going on?
TOMMY
You breathing through the wrong
fucking nostril again?
DEKE
Hey, you guys hear Jimmy and Millie
are engaged?! Wait'll I tell him
she's gone down on half the Carolina
League --
CRASH
(threatening)
Anybody says anything bad about
Millie, I'll break his neck.
NUKE
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
JOSE THE FIRST BASEMAN JOINS THEM ALL at the mound.
JOSE
Don't throw anything to me -- my
girlfriend put a curse on my glove.
NUKE
I'll take the curse off the son of a
bitch!
JOSE
Then you got to cut the head off a
live rooster.
NUKE
Shit.
MICKEY JOINS THE CROWD from third base.
MICKEY
Don't worry, man, this umpire's a
God damn racist.
P.O.V.
THE UMPIRE -- He's black.
CUT TO:
THE DUGOUT -- SKIP AND LARRY watch the growing meeting.
SKIP
What the hell's going on out there?
LARRY
It's a damn convention.
SKIP
Check it out.
CUT TO:
THE MOUND -- Larry joins the convention.
LARRY
What the hell's going on out here?
CRASH
Nuke's scared cause his nostrils are
jammed and his old man's here, we
need a live rooster to take the curse
off Jose's glove, and nobody knows
what to get Jimmy and Millie for
their wedding present -- there's a
whole lotta shit we're trying to
deal with --
LARRY
Oh. I thought there was a problem.
CUT TO:
CRASH FLIPS HIS MASK -- A runner rounds third heading for
home. Here comes the throw, on a line. It hits once on the
infield grass, takes a long hop --
AS THE RUNNER BARRELS TOWARD THE PLATE -- Crash takes the
throw.
THE RUNNER SLIDES -- Crash blocks the plate. A cloud of dust.
A close play.
THE UMPIRE SIGNALS "SAFE" -- And Crash flips out. In a second
he is nose to nose with the UMPIRE.
CRASH
I got him on the knee!
UMPIRE
You missed him!
CRASH
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't
touched the plate.
THEIR FACES ARE INCHES APART -- Screaming face to face.
UMPIRE
Don't bump me.
CRASH
It was a cocksucking call!
UMPIRE
Did you call me a cocksucker?
CRASH
No! I said It was a cock-sucking
call and you can't run me for that!
UMPIRE
You missed the tag!
CRASH
You spit on me!
UMPIRE
I didn't spit on you!
CRASH
You're in the wrong business, Jack --
you're Sears-Roebuck material!
UMPIRE
You're close, Crash, you want me to
run you? I'll run you!
CRASH
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
UMPIRE
Try it! Go ahead. Call me a
cocksucker!
CRASH
Beg me!
UMPIRE
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta
here!
CRASH
Beg me again!
UMPIRE
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta
here!
CRASH
You're a cocksucker!
UMPIRE
You're outta here!
THE UMP THEATRICALLY THROWS CRASH out of the game.
CUT TO:
Nuke knocks on Crash's door. Nobody home. Tony is arriving
with his GROUPIE GIRLFRIEND to the next room.
TONY
Crash ain't there. He never gets
back till four or five --
NUKE
Where does he go?
TONY
Well, I'd rather not say.
NUKE
They called me up to the Show and I
wanta tell Crash goodbye.
TONY COMES OVER AND GIVES NUKE a heartfelt "five".
TONY
Goddamn, that's great! Jesus!
(beat)
Listen, Crash don't like anybody to
know it but --
(beat)
Most nights he goes down to, you
know, down to Niggertown. To
Sandy's... the whorehouse.
NUKE
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
TONY
Don't tell him I told you -- he'd
break my neck.
CLOSE ON NUKE -- Disturbed.
CUT TO:
A CAB MOVES SLOWLY through a poor neighborhood. Stops at:
AN OLD HOUSE -- Decades of ad hoc add-ons.
BLACK CABBIE
That's Sandy's. Keep your extra cash
In your shoes.
NUKE GETS OUT and goes to the door.
CUT TO:
NUKE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR -- A small barred window opens.
A face appears -- a TOUGH BLACK, SANDY, 50.
SANDY
What'you want, kid?
NUKE
I'm looking for somebody.
SANDY
Who ain't?
NUKE
Looking for Crash Davis.
SANDY
Ain't here.
NUKE
I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.
SANDY
(studying him)
Your breaking ball's getting better
but ya need a change up.
The door opens. Nuke enters.
CUT TO:
Several of the Hookers follow to watch. Crash is drunk and
lost. Nuke in control.
NUKE
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
CRASH
You fuck!
NUKE
Why am I a fuck?
CRASH
Why are you a fuck?
(beat)
'Cause you got talent. I got brains.
But you got talent! You're God damn
left arm is worth a million dollars
a year.
(drunken insight)
All my limbs put together are worth
7 cents a pound -- and that's for
science and dog meat.
NUKE
You're a great catcher.
CRASH
Come over here into the light so I
can kick your ass.
NUKE
No.
CRASH
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
Crash takes a step toward Nuke. Pulls up his bare feet
quickly, stepping on a sharp stone.
CRASH
...God damn... I forgot my fucking
shoes. Honey, go get my shoes.
One of the Hookers goes inside for his shoes.
NUKE
I'll take you back to the hotel.
CRASH
(drunken, mad)
You know what the difference is
between hitting .250 and hitting
.300? I got it figured out.
(beat)
Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at
bats is 50 points. Okay? There's 6
months in a season, that's about 25
weeks -- you get one extra flare a
week -- just one -- a gork, a ground
ball with eyes, a dying quail --
just one more dying quail a week and
you're in Yankee Stadium!
CUT TO:
NUKE'S PORSCHE -- The Clubhouse Boy drags Nuke's out to the
car and loads the trunk. Annie, Larry and a COUPLE KIDS AND
DOGS are watching.
CUT TO:
NUKE TOSSES HIS BAG in the Porsche and motions to Annie.
They step away from the others.
ANNIE
Well I guess this is it.
NUKE
(smiles)
I won't be needing these anymore.
NUKE PULLS ANNIE'S RED PANTIES from his jacket pocket.
The frilly, silk lace is tattered. The panties have been
through the mill. She accepts them graciously.
ANNIE
Neither will I.
NUKE
I think I'm ready for the Show.
ANNIE
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh -- don't
think too much.
NUKE
Don't worry.
They look at each other awkwardly, sweetly, and:
NUKE KISSES ANNIE GENTLY ON THE LIPS -- They hesitate, and
Nuke heads for his Porsche.
CRASH ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY to watch. Nuke bids farewell to
his father and climbs into his car.
NUKE
I gotta go now, Dad.
FATHER
I was thinking I could fly up and
spend a week in the Big Leagues with
you -- help you get comfortable.
NUKE
No. If I screw up, I wanta do it
alone. I'll call.
FATHER
We'll be praying for you.
NUKE
Dad -- if my curveball is hanging,
God ain't gonna help me.
FATHER
We'll pray anyway.
NUKE
(kindly)
If it makes you and mom feel better,
go for it. I gotta run --
They shake hands, and:
CRASH'S P.O.V. -- NUKE ROARS AWAY in his Porsche, leaving a
trail of dust in the Stadium parking lot.
DISSOLVE TO:
MILLIE AND JIMMY'S WEDDING -- A formal wedding on the
pitcher's mound. Millie in white. Jimmy in his uniform. Skip
is the best man, also in uniform, and several players and
groupies are the attendants, Annie as the Bride's Maid.
Organ music plays the wedding march.
JIMMY LIFTS MILLIE'S VEIL and kisses her. The stands are
full of fans.
JIMMY LEADS MILLIE DOWN THE "AISLE" towards home plate.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Ninth inning. Durham is leading by a
score of 1 to 0. Two outs.
JIMMY IS PITCHING -- He delivers. The batter rockets a line
drive up the alley. A PENINSULA RUNNER races from first,
rounding third, trying to score. A relay.
CRASH WAITS AT THE PLATE -- Here comes the runner. Here comes
the throw. A close play. A terrible collision.
Crash goes rolling. The umpire waits -- and in a cloud of
dust, Crash holds up the ball.
THE CROWD ROARS -- Jimmy jumps victoriously in the air.
CUT TO:
CRASH WALKS THE STREETS ALONE -- Crash stops in front of a
window and takes his batting stroke, studying the reflection.
AND HE KEEPS WALKING INTO:
CUT TO:
CRASH DRINKING ALONE at the end of a bar.
CUT TO:
CRASH WANDERS ALONG into the residential neighborhoods.
HE STARTS ACROSS A QUIET INTERSECTION Stops. Looks at the
street signs. He CHANGES DIRECTION, walks on.
CUT TO:
The windows glow. After midnight.
CRASH STARES AT THE HOUSE -- Hesitates, then walks up the
porch stairs. Knocks at the door. Moments later:
ANNIE OPENS THE DOOR -- She looks beautiful. Almost as if
she was expecting him. At first, silence. Then:
CRASH
I got released.
ANNIE
I heard already.
SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- Crash enters Annie's house.
CUT TO:
CRASH IN HIS CAR heading for Asheville.
CUT TO:
CRASH KNOCKING ON THE BASEBALL OFFICE DOOR -- Looking for
work.
CUT TO:
NUKE IN STREET CLOTHES IN THE DUGOUT of an empty stadium.
50,000 seats. Slick. Awesome. He's being interviewed by a
BIG LEAGUE REPORTER, who has a small tape deck and has stuck
mike in Nuke's face.
NUKE
(like a big leaguer)
Y'know, I'm just happy to be here
and hope I can help the ballclub. I
just want to give it my best shot
and good Lord willing, things'll
work out... gotta play 'em one day
at a time, Y'know...
THE BIG LEAGUE REPORTER nods attentively as Nuke knowingly
delivers the clichs like a veteran.
DISSOLVE TO:
In sharpest contrast to the Big League stadium, a rickety
old wooden grandstand, carved into the pine covered hillside.
CRASH STEPS TO THE PLATE -- In a uniform we've never seen
him in, of course. The Asheville Tourists. He picks up some
dirt, rubs it on his hands. He's as intense as ever. Still
playing for keeps.
CRASH
(at the plate)
C'mon, Meat, throw me that weak ass
shit -- c'mon, bring the heat, bring
it, bring it...
CRASH'S P.O.V. -- SLO-MO AS THE PITCHER WINDS AND delivers a
fastball right down the pipe.
CUT TO:
CRASH UNLOADS A MONSTROUS HOME RUN deep into the trees. He
stands at home plate watching it... like Reggie or the Babe.
And doesn't move. For several seconds he indulges himself
uncharacteristically -- until...
THE OPPOSING CATCHER SHOVES HIM toward first.
CATCHER
Get your ass in gear...
CRASH SMILES and takes the home run trot slowly. As he heads
toward first, HE RAISES A CLINCHED FIST for a brief moment,
a tiny gesture of triumph. And then, routinely, he just
circles the bases.
A HUNDRED FANS APPLAUD ROUTINELY as he circles the bases.
CUT TO:
ANNIE AND JACKSON OPEN AN UMBRELLA in her familiar place in
the stadium. Umbrellas go up all around, as:
THE RAINS COME -- The players huddle-in the dugouts.
IN THE DUGOUT Skip and Larry reading copies of "The Tantric
Yoga of Sex". And spitting tobacco.
ANNIE (V.O.)
The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't good
enough to hold Crash's jockstrap if
ya ask me, and Nuke's replacement
had a fastball that I coulda hit
(beat)
We had a three game lead with two
weeks to go when the rains came.
THE GROUND CREW DRAGS TARPS over the mound and the plate.
ANNIE (V.O.)
It rained and rained and I thought
of driving down to Asheville to see
Crash but then I thought "No, what
you pursue, eludes you". I had to
trust Quantum Physics and the Church
of Baseball.
(beat)
It ain't always easy being this
religious...
ANNIE AND JACKSON POP OPEN THEIR UMBRELLAS and walk out of
the ballpark towards home.
CUT TO:
ANNIE AND JACKSON UNDER UMBRELLAS -- He turns down one street,
she heads toward home.
CUT TO:
AS SHE APPROACHES -- She stops. Looks up. Crash's beat up
car in the driveway.
P.O.V.
CRASH SITTING ON THE PORCH SWING Still raining.
CLOSE ON ANNIE -- She hesitates, and smiles.
ANNIE
Oh my...
ANNIE SITS DOWN on the porch owing next to Crash.
ANNIE
What happened?
CRASH
I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em
up.
A moment of silence over the significance of him quitting.
ANNIE
I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.
CRASH
There might be an opening for a
manager at Salem next spring.
ANNIE
Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the
witches were?
CRASH
Yeah... you a witch?
ANNIE
Not yet. It takes years of practice...
He smiles slightly and takes her hand.
CRASH
You think I could make it to the
Show as a manager?
ANNIE
You'd be great, just great...
(rattling quickly)
'Cause you understand non-linear
thinking even though it seems like
baseball is a linear game 'cause of
the lines and the box scores an'
all -- but the fact is that there's
a spacious-"non-time kind of time"
to it...
CRASH
(interrupting)
Annie --
ANNIE
What?
CRASH
I got a lotta time to hear your
theories and I wanta hear every damn
one of 'em... but right now I'm tired
and I don't wanta think about baseball
and I don't wanta think about Quantum
Physics... I don't wanta think about
nothing...
(beat)
I just wanta be.
ANNIE
I can do that, too.
He rises, takes her hand, and they head inside.
And as the rains fall on Durham...
