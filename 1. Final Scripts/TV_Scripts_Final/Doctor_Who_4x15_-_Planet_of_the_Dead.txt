      The London night skyline; landmarks visible, lights shining.

33INT. GALLERY - NIGHT

      A half-lit, high-ceilinged gallery.  Four armed, uniformed
      SECURITY GUARDS enter.  The SECURITY CHIEF's already there:

      A marble plinth, centre of the room.  On top, a two-handled
      medieval drinking cup.  Solid shining gold, encrusted with
      glinting jewels.  This is the CUP OF ATHELSTAN. 

                                      SECURITY CHIEF (CONT'D)

      Silence.  Guards on duty.

      PAN up the room, from the PLINTH & FX BEAMS, to... 

      The ceiling.  A panel slides open, silently -  

      Staring down: a WOMAN in a black catsuit, mask covering
      all but the eyes.  This is CHRISTINA.

      She stares down.  Clever, calculating eyes.

      Then she draws back, into darkness for a second...

      Then launches through the gap!  Her entire body whipping
      through, not touching the sides -

      She whizzes down, like she's falling to her death -

      Then stops!  She's on a wire, suspended through the gap
      above; she's hanging vertically, head lowermost.  She's
      stopped about two feet above the cup.

      Looks round.  Silence.  Guards facing out, not noticing.

      Christina reaches up.  She's got a black bag attached to
      her waist.  She unclips it.  Reaches down, the black bag
      in one hand, the other hand reaching for the Cup...

      She lifts up the Cup.  Puts the black bag in its place... 
      And as she whips the black bag off - not revealing what's
      inside yet, cut to CU Christina -

      She stares at the Cup.  Victory!

      Reaches to her waist, where there's a control for the wire
      & OOV winch, presses a button -

      She slides back up in silence.  Like she was never there.

      One guard shifts, bored, turns round...

      Now standing on the plinth: one of those tacky Chinese
        gold-plastic cat ornaments, with a waving arm.

      It waves.

      Lights, noise, shoppers, ordinary life, all busy and hectic.   
      She looks one way -

      Ahead, a good distance away, a POLICE CAR screeches up
      over the pavement, blocking the path -

      She looks behind - a good distance back, pushing through
      the crowd, more POLICE on walkie-talkies, hurrying, urgent
      (though not seeing her) - 

      Ahead - the POLICE getting out of the car, looking round -
      led by D.I. MCMILLAN, 40s, grizzled, barking orders -

      A lad called NATHAN, 20, white t-shirt & jeans, gets on

      No choice!  Christina follows him -

      from his phone, and ANGELA WHITTAKER, mumsy, 40s, laden
      with shopping bags.

                    Rhondium particles, that's what
                    I'm looking for.  This thing detects
                    them, the little dish should go
                    round, that little dish there...

                    Right now, a way out would come in
                    pretty handy.  Can you detect me
                    one of those?

      CUT TO CARMEN and LOU.  She's shivering, staring into space:

      CUT TO the Doctor and CHRISTINA, as the dish starts to
      turn, getting faster and faster -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And round.  And round.  Oh blimey.

      PRAC FX: small BANG!, the little dish goes flying, past -

                                      ANGELA
                    Excuse me.  Do you mind?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Sorry.  That was my little dish.

      But the device is still bleeping and flashing.

      THE DOCTOR's thrown to the floor -

      Stay on the Doctor. 

      Everything still, now.  The bus has stopped.  Silence.

      He shakes his head.  Groggy.  Stands...

      And as he stands, the darkness has gone...

      He lifts his head up, into the most beautiful, serene 
      yellow light.  Around him, the lower deck of the bus is 
      all twisted, broken metal, but that's irrelevant at first,
      out of focus, as the light floods in.

      Everyone recovering, looking round.  Awestruck. 

      Christina, Lou, Carmen, Nathan, Angela, Barclay, Driver...

      All gaping.  The yellow light filling every window, making
      them almost-opaque boxes of light.

      FX SHOT: three suns, blazing in the sky.

      PRAC SMOKE just dying away from the bus (and ending, in
      this scene).  BARCLAY, NATHAN & ANGELA, spreading out, not
      moving too far from the bus, all taking layers off, because
      of the heat.  DRIVER'S in his seat, trying the engine - it

      The Driver's now given up, getting out of the bus, going

                    Naah, the wheels are stuck, look
                    at them, they're never gonna budge. 

      CUT TO the Doctor, examining the sand.  Christina getting

                    Funny sort of sand, this.  There's
                    a trace of something else...

                  The 
                    me - look, if you must know, I was
                    tracking a hole in the fabric of
                    reality.  Call it a hobby.  But it
                    was a tiny little hole, no danger
                    to anyone.  Suddenly it gets big,
                    and we drive right through it.

                    there's just sand!

      The Doctor walks to the back of the bus, scoops up sand.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    All right.  If you want proof.  We

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It was the bus.  Look at the damage,
                    that was the bus protecting us. 
                    Great big box made of metal.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Slightly different dynamics, with
                      a wormhole, there's enough metal
                    to make it work.  I think.  I hope.

                                      CHRISTINA

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'd say nine-and-a-half tons, but
                    the point still stands, yes.

                    baking in there, or roasting out

                    No, I don't mind.  Carmen, what is

      All staring at Carmen; hushed and creepy, now:

                    That thing, the doorway.  Someone
                    made it.  For a reason.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    How d'you know?

                    She's got a gift.  Ever since she
                    was a little girl, she can just...
                    tell things.  We do the lottery,

                    You don't look like millionaires.

                                    LOU
                    No, but we win ten pounds.  Every
                    week, twice a week, ten pounds. 
                    Don't tell me that's not a gift!

      The Doctor looks at Carmen.  Puts his hand behind his back.

                    Try this, might help with the seats.

      She hands Nathan a small axe.

      And Nathan runs back on to the bus -

      Passing ANGELA, who's now sitting in the driver's seat,
      with the doors open.  She calls out:

                                      ANGELA
                  The 
                    I can't find the keys. 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, buses don't have keys, there's
                    the master switch, then it's one
                    button for start, the other button
                    for stop, yeah?

                                      ANGELA
                    Right.  Hold on, I've got it. 
                    Here we go, hold tight, ding ding!

      She presses the button.  The bus engine turns over, but
      groaning.  She keeps trying, but the bus only jolts.

                      Christina.  Don't move...

      He puts his hands up, Christina does the same...

      And the figure steps forward, revealing...

        A TRITOVORE!   

      It's 6 feet tall, its humanoid body in a flight-suit, with
      a simple printed insignia.  It has the head of a giant fly -
                                                          Tale
      two huge multi-faceted eyes in a bristling black skull. 
      Mandibles twitching.  This is SORVIN.  Pointing a blaster
      at them.  Aggressive chirping:  

                                      SORVIN
                    <Chirrup chirrup chirrup!>

                          (to Christina)
                    That's wait.  I shout wait, and

                          (to Christina)
                    That's begging for mercy. 

      Sorvin jabs the blaster at them. 

                                      SORVIN

      WIDE SHOT, SORVIN herding THE DOCTOR and CHRISTINA along.

      They pass around a dune and see...

      FX SHOT (DMP): the SPACESHIP.  It's industrial black metal,
      the size of a jumbo jet.  Split down the middle, cracked
      in half, and buried in the sand. 

                                      CHRISTINA

                    No!  Look at the ship, it's a wreck,
                    they crashed, just like us.

4848INT. TRITOVORE SHIP, SHORT CORRIDOR/CONTROL ROOM - DAY

      A SHORT CORRIDOR, leading to the main section.  The ship's
      been shattered; dark metal girders criss-crossing the way,
      pipes and tubes hanging down; the floor's cracked open,
      sand underfoot.  Sunlight through holes in the roof.

      THE DOCTOR & CHRISTINA walking along, at gunpoint, with
      SORVIN behind them.
                                  Writer's

      Leading into the CONTROL ROOM.  Again, the fallen girders,
      sandy floor, with broken consoles all around.  

      A second Tritovore, PRAYGAT, is waiting.  He wears the
      same suit, fussier insignia.  He takes a small device from
      the wall, clamps it to his chest and turns it on.

                    No, look, I think you're making
                    the same mistake Christina did -

                    she's honourable - but we got pulled
                    through that wormhole!  The 200
                    doesn't look like that normally,
                    it's broken, just the same as you!

                    security grid.  Look!

      Christina looking down (still head first) -

      FX: HIGH SHOT, Christina now with only HALF THE DISTANCE
      below her, but across the shaft: zig-zags of RAW
        ELECTRICITY, zapping intermittently across the shaft.

                                      CHRISTINA
                                  Writer's 
                      Excellent.  So what do I do?

                    Red button, to your left. 

      She stabs the red button, set in the wall -
                  The 

      FX: SAME HIGH SHOT, ELECTRICITY ZAPS OFF.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    Well done!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Now come back up!  I can do that.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    Oh, don't you wish?

      She presses the winch-control on her waist.  Starts
      descending down the shaft...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Slowly!

                    Yes, sir.

      And as she keeps sliding down - slowly, with every shot -
      the Doctor settles by the Well; intimate, over comms:

                    Quite the mystery, aren't you? 
                    Lady Christina de Souza.  Carrying

                    No stranger than you, spaceman.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I had this friend, once.  She called
                    me spaceman.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    And was she right?  Do you zoom
                    about the place in a rocket?

                    Creation of the universe, end of

                    and Japan.  And the Court of King

                    It's the Cup of Athelstan.  Given
                    to the first King of Britain, as a
                      coronation gift from Hywel, King
                    of the Welsh.  But it's been held
                    in the International Gallery for
                    200 years, which makes you, Lady
                      Christina... a thief.

                    Daddy lost everything.  Invested

                    No no no, if you're short of cash,
                    you rob a bank.  Stealing this...
                    that's a lifestyle.

                      Absolutely.  Except...  That little
                    blue box.  I stole it.  From my

      (As seen on screen in sc.60.)  CHRISTINA lowering slowly
      head-first through the bottom of the Well, in the roof.  A
      few feet below her: the Crystal & clamps.  All around:
      cramped, dark-metal walls, broken and jagged.

                                      CHRISTINA

      FX: One wall seems to shift: behind broken struts of metal,
      there's a STINGRAY.  Dormant.  But stirring.

      Absolute whispers:

      Reaches down...  Both hands, to hold the entire plate of
      Crystal & clamps...

      Takes hold.

      Deep breath.

                    And I've lost them.  I lost them
                    all.  Never again.  

      And MCMILLAN & SGT DENNISON are there - Dennison snapping
      cuffs on her wrists - Christina just looking at the Doctor -

                                                          Tale
                                      MCMILLAN
                    Lady Christina de Souza!  Oh, I've
                    waited a long time to say this!  I
                    am arresting you on suspicion of
                    theft.  You do not have to say
                    anything, etcetera!  Dennison,
                    take her away! 

      And they frogmarch her away, across the tarmac.

      Christina looking back, at the Doctor.  Imploring.

      But he just stands by the Tardis.  Watching her go.

      And then, quietly...

                                      CARMEN
                  The 
                    Doctor?

      He turns - good distance away, CARMEN & LOU are being led
      away for debriefing by a (friendly) UNIT SOLDIER.  But
      Carmen is staring at the Doctor; haunted, and so wise:

                                      CARMEN (CONT'D)
                    You take care, now.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And you!  Chops and gravy, lovely!

                                      CARMEN
                    No, but you be careful.  Because
                    your song is ending, sir.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...what do you mean?

                                      CARMEN
                    It is returning.  It is returning
                    through the dark.  And then,
                    Doctor...  Ohh, but then... 
                          (pause)
                    He will knock four times.

      And she turns away, so sad.  Walks away with Lou...

      The Doctor staring. 

      So many things turning in his head, now. 

      And slowly, he turns and looks...

      Good distance away: the POLICE CAR has pulled up.  MCMILLAN
      & DENNISON are putting CHRISTINA in the back seat...

      And the Doctor holds up the sonic.

                                                          Tale
      Whirrs.

      CU on Christina's handcuffs, snapping undone -

      As she gets into the car -

      - then gets out of the other side!  Running!!

                                      MCMILLAN
                    Stop that woman!  Stop her!!

                                  Writer's 
      - Christina running - and she's heading for the bus -

      - and she leaps inside!  (The bus stands alone, all the
      passengers & soldiers having been moved away, now.)

      She slams the button -
                  The 

      McMillan and Dennison run up, as the doors hisss closed -
      they bang on the doors -

                                      MCMILLAN (CONT'D)
                    I'll add resisting arrest!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'd stand back, if I were you.

                                      MCMILLAN
                          (at the Doctor)
                    And I'm charging you, too!  Aiding
                    and abetting!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yes, I'll just step inside this
                    police box and arrest myself.

      Christina at the wheel, big smile, turns it -

      McMillan and Dennison blasted back by PRAC SMOKE -

      FX: AND THE BUS SLOWLY RISES!  Just a few feet...

      MAGAMBO watching, at a distance, with MALCOLM and JENNER,
      and ANGELA, BARCLAY, NATHAN.  All smiling.  Angela cheering!

      The Doctor loving it!

      Doors hisss open.  Christina looks down at the Doctor.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    We could've been so good together.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                      Christina.  We were.

      And she smiles.  Then spins the wheel -

      FX: THE BUS lifts into the sky, then ZOOMS AWAY, gone - !

      The Doctor turns away, unlocks the Tardis door, heading
      inside.  And he's laughing!
