CLOSEUP: A slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard,
in teacherly cursive.
We PULL BACK to REVEAL STARLA GRANT, a stunningly beautiful
Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing
out, "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"
Starla glances at the classroom of high school students.
She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking,
but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the
class.
STARLA
When Darwin said 'fittest,' he
didn't necessarily mean the
strongest or the most intelligent,
or any one trait -- he merely meant
those organisms most well-suited
to their environment.
The boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks.
KYLIE STRUTEMYER, a pretty student, notices a BOY beside
her drawing Starla, only without her clothes. She hits
him. He CHUCKLES.
STARLA
We humans think we're more fit,
more evolved, because we're smarter.
But we're neophytes. We've been
around two million years, give or
take. The cockroach has been here
for 350 million. You tell me who's
the more successful species.
A BOY raises his hand.
STARLA
Will.
WILL
How's all this go with how the
Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs?
Some of the kids LAUGH at the boy.
Starla pauses, about
to answer, when the BELL RINGS.
STARLA
We'll tackle that tomorrow...
Everyone bring your boxing gloves.
The kids start to leave.
2.
A framed wedding photograph of a very young Starla and a
large man is sitting on a desk. The photo TREMBLES
LIGHTLY, with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth.
GRANT GRANT, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties,
notices the photos on his desk moving. He looks up from
his desk and out his door, where there's a GLASS WORKSHOP.
Two WORKERS are carrying a large pane of glass, looking
relieved they didn't drop it.
GRANT
Just a tremor, boys.
Grant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders
with a Sharpie.
The four cops start to remove their holsters and so forth,
finished for the day.
TREVOR
I always get afraid when that
happens, 'cause what if the ground
cracks open and you fall inside?
It's so hot in there you get all
burnt to nothin' like that --
(snaps)
Happened to my uncle Barry.
Wally and Bill LAUGH at him.
WALLY
Who told you that story, Trevor?
TREVOR
My aunt.
4.
BILL
Your uncle Barry left her for a
stripper up in Winnsboro.
Trevor looks shocked, sad.
SHELBY, a slightly dim dispatcher, on his headset at the
police operator's unit, swirls toward them, alarmed.
SHELBY
Chief! We got a 'mergency over at
the diner!
The four cops move in.
There's a COMMOTION.
Most of the
patrons are standing.
WAITRESS
Back there, Bill!
The Waitress nods back through the service window, into
the kitchen, where a large DOE is hopping around. A
DISHWASHER stands on the counter, YELPING with fear.
Bill, Wally, Trevor, Margaret, and the Waitress enter.
The doe skips around.
WAITRESS
She slipped in, was eating trash.
We seen it on TV, how they kill
ya'--
BILL
Right.
WAITRESS
So we thought we best call in.
Bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer
toward it.
BILL
Come on now, honey, door's this
way.
MARGARET
It's open season. Let's shoot
her.
BILL
She's just scared, Margaret.
5.
WALLY
Also, Bill likes to take a female
through the back door any chance
he gets.
Wally and Margaret LAUGH. Trevor snatches a dish-towel
and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. The scared doe
leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter.
BILL
She ain't a bull, Trevor!
The animal kicks off a pot, which hits Margaret.
MARGARET
Goddamn bambi-rat!
As the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped
in a telephone cord.
The cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in
place. Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for
the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.
BILL
Get back.
The other cops step away.
Bill steps slowly toward the
doe, speaking calmly.
BILL
It's okay, sweetheart.
Nobody's
gonna hurt you.
The doe looks at him, settling a bit.
His voice seems to
be soothing her. Bill gets closer.
BILL
That's right. Just gonna pull
this cord out. It's gonna be all
right.
The cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe,
breathing heavily, becomes still. Bill scoops close past
her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall.
Bill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking
Bill over, and streaks out the back door.
Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway
and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond,
dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.
BILL
Hell, she took a phone. Now them
forest critters are gonna be calling
us all hours of the night.
6.
Everyone LAUGHS.
Wally pretends to be on the phone.
WALLY
Chief of police there? This a
squirrel. Bring me a bag of
peanuts, motherfucker!
Everyone LAUGHS some more.
Grant locks his office for the day.
His SECRETARY sees
him going.
SECRETARY
'Night, Mr. Grant.
GRANT
See ya', Ashley.
Grant walks across the workshop toward the door. He sees
a crowd of WORKERS lounging around a glass-cutting table,
LAUGHING at something.
Some of them nod at Grant, and he nods back.
But he's
completely outside their circle.
Starla and Grant eat dinner in this well-decorated room.
As Grant chatters, Starla occasionally smiles politely at
him.
GRANT
Callin' for you. What the hell?
I said, 'Hank, that's a little bit
outta line don't'cha think, a single
man callin' someone's wife?' At
night, nonetheless.
Starla is quiet, almost afraid:
7.
STARLA
He's teaching environmental science,
Grant. Probably wants to borrow
my lesson plans from last semester.
GRANT
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to
borrow, this guy.
STARLA
It's just a work thing.
GRANT
Work thing hell, Starla. He just
wants to get in your pussy. Him
and most these other ones around
here. That's where their minds is
at, them sick fucks.
Grant takes a big bite of food, stuffing his mouth.
GRANT
I'll tell you, sugarplum, you're
lucky you got me. You're too damn
trusting. Without me to protect
you, you'd get kilt one of these
days.
Starla nods.
Starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her
hair. She uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling.
GRANT (O.S.)
Sugarplum, you coming into bed?
Starla turns toward the door.
She doesn't say anything
for a moment.
STARLA
Just a second.
Starla sets her brush down on the counter. She arranges
it neatly beside the others. And walks into the bedroom.
Grant turns off the TV as Starla gets into bed with him.
It's almost completely dark in here.
Grant crawls on top of Starla. He kisses her and grabs
her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without
grace.
8.
After doing this for a few moments, Starla starts to push
him off her.
STARLA
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just --
I'm not in the mood.
Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy.
GRANT
Come on, baby, it's --
STARLA
I'm sorry.
I don't just have some
switch.
GRANT
Sure you do.
Through Starla's nightgown, Grant pretends to flick one
of her nipples.
GRANT
Flip.
Then the other.
GRANT
Flip.
STARLA
That's disrespectful.
Grant, peeved, gets off of her. He sits on the edge of
the bed for a moment, in silence. Starla looks afraid.
GRANT
When are you in the mood, exactly?
Seems to me that mood's as rare as
winnin' the Goddamn lotto.
Grant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting
them on.
STARLA
Where are you going?
GRANT
I'm just some big clown to you,
ain't I?
STARLA
That's not true -- Where are you-?
GRANT
Out.
9.
Grant sits at the bar, knocking back a shot of tequila.
He's getting drunk. He taps his glass.
GRANT
Hit me again there, killer.
The BARKEEP fills his drink.
BARKEEP
Hey, Grant, how's it you come to
have the same last name as first?
GRANT
Parents thought it sounded pleasant,
I s'pose. Joke on me, ain't it?
Grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup -- BRENDA
GUTIERREZ -- staring at him from across the bar, smoking
a cigarette. Grant stares at her, trying to figure out
who she is. She slides off her stool.
She sashays toward him. She props herself on the stool
beside him, leans drunkenly in toward him.
BRENDA
Megan Halesy' little sister.
GRANT
Shit.
You're kidding me.
BRENDA
Nope.
Brenda!
GRANT
Hell, you were --
Grant holds his hand only so high.
BRENDA
I was! And I'll tell you somethin',
Grant Grant. I's in love with
you.
Grant stares at her.
BRENDA
My sister Megan, she's a big fat
cow. Was then, even more so now.
I'd be thinking, what'd you see in
her ain't in me?
GRANT
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been
eleven.
10.
BRENDA
Hell, I was game!
She LAUGHS. So does Grant. He stares at her,
contemplating sinful things. He nods at her wedding ring.
GRANT
Who's the lucky fella?
BRENDA
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn
half-Mexican.
GRANT
Already ain't.
Married a gal named --
BRENDA
Starla Covington. Don't be
ignorant. Everyone knows that.
Fucking prom queen.
Grant thinks.
GRANT
Yeah.
Grant finishes his drink, and gets up to go.
BRENDA
Where you goin'?
Grant speaks more loudly than need be:
GRANT
Starla, she gets real worried 'bout
me I stay out too late. Loves me
too much, that one.
He glances around to see if people have heard, and stumbles
out.
We see the insides of Grant's body, as if sliced in half.
We ZOOM IN on the little spore, which is jittering up
through his body, and into his neck.
The spore keys into the base of Grant's cerebellum, and
his entire brain crackles with a WHITE ELECTRICAL ENERGY.
BACK TO SCENE
Grant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front
of him, silent. He's utterly still, a wax corpse.
A hippie CAMPING COUPLE run into the area, looking for
the source of the screams. The man looks down at the
frozen Grant.
CAMPER
Over here!
The Camper crouches down beside him.
CAMPER
Hey, man. You all right?...
Dude?... Oh shit.
The Camper turns from Grant to his girlfriend.
CAMPER
I think he's d --
Grant GASPS suddenly, sitting up and grabbing the man,
like a drowning man popping up above water. The Camper
YELPS and jumps back. Grant sweats and heaves, trying to
speak, but hardly can --
GRANT
It's taking... my... brain.
13.
CAMPER
Buddy?
Grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. He heaves
there, momentarily confused. His eyes dart around, as if
seeing his surroundings for the first time. Grant stands.
CAMPER
You all right, man?
Grant looks down curiously at the camper. Then he turns
and stumbles away from them, out of the forest.
CAMPER
That might of been a stroke, buddy.
You better take it easy.
Grant drives down the road in his luxury pickup truck,
sweating and blinking rapidly.
Grant looks around the foyer.
Grant creeps into the bedroom, looking around.
We can
hear the SHOWER RUNNING.
Grant spots his face in a mirror above the dresser. He
moves in close to the mirror, and stares at his own image.
14.
He pulls on his face a little, his eyes brimming with
excitement. He smiles at himself.
Grant looks toward the open bathroom door, where he hears
the running shower. He creeps toward it.
Grant peeks around the doorway. Starla is in the shower,
soaping herself. She looks beautiful there. Grant tilts
his head to the side like a dog. He watches her,
mesmerized, even moved.
GRANT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair
in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears Air Supply's
EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD coming from the bedroom. She's
struck by it.
She moves toward the door.
Opens it.
The shades are drawn, darkening the room. A few candles
have been lit. Grant is standing there, mostly in
silhouette. He's silent, and he doesn't move.
GRANT
Hey there, sugarplum.
Starla looks at him, stirred.
STARLA
Haven't heard this for a while.
Grant walks toward her. He takes her hand in his own,
lifting it beside him. He wraps his other arm around her
waist. And he slow dances with her. Starla dances too,
a bit hesitantly, a bit shy.
STARLA
I never danced in a towel before.
GRANT
Wearing white, just like on our...
wedding day. I remember it.
Starla nods.
GRANT
I'm sorry about last night. I get
a little insecure sometimes, want
to hold on too tight. It's just
'cause you're precious to me,
Starla.
(MORE)
15.
GRANT (CONT'D)
But I swear to God, baby, I'm
turning over a new Goddamn leaf.
Okay?
Starla nods, touched.
Grant's eyes are teary.
GRANT
I love you, sugarplum.
Starla and Grant kiss, tenderly.
Grant falls to his knees in front of her. He runs his
hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock,
with as much fascination as lust. He pushes Starla back
onto the bed.
He lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little,
scrapes his teeth on it. Starla is surprised by this,
but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's
had in years.
Grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her
breasts, her face. Starla's hand moves over Grant's back,
and to his stomach. When she stops, startled.
STARLA
Grant, what's that?
She gazes down at the wound between them, on Grant's bare
abdomen, where the spore entered him. The wound is
yellowish, and surrounded by veins.
Grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down.
GRANT
Just a little bug bite is all.
Grant kisses and munches on Starla as she lies back on
the bed, enjoying it.
O.S. HUMMING.
FADE TO:
Starla is HUMMING Every Woman in the World as she drops
coins into a soda machine and chooses Tab. JANENE, a
heavyset black teacher, notices this.
JANENE
What are you so smiley about, girl?
STARLA
Oh, nothin'.
16.
Starla grabs her soda and sits down with Janene.
Janene
just stares.
STARLA
Just, Grant and I had a nice
morning. It's been a while.
JANENE
Oh! You got that fresh-fucked
glow, don't you?
STARLA
Janene.
JANENE
You slut.
STARLA
Hush.
JANENE
No shame.
You're a married woman.
STARLA
He was... considerate. Maybe this
is the start of a real change in
Grant.
Grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso.
The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is
starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. A fuzzy
bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout.
A pus oozes out.
Grant looks concerned. He squirts some Neosporin onto
his fingers. He massages it slowly into the wound.
GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around
inside. He pulls out some bread. Some cheese.
He opens the meat drawer. It's replete with cold cuts.
He pulls out some Oscar Mayer baloney. Turkey. Pastrami
and salami. He grabs every type of meat there is.
MOMENTS LATER
Grant assembles a sandwich at the table. Two pieces of
bread and some cheese. He starts putting the meat on.
But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a
little sandwich tower.
17.
He looks at it. Something seems off about it. He removes
the cheese. Better. And then the bread. Even better.
He stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts.
GRANT
Meat.
After contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and
carries off the pile of meat.
Grant enters the garage through a door from the FOYER.
He flips the lights on with his shoulder. He looks around.
Grant spots an old file cabinet. He sets the tower of
meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. It's
filled with files. He closes that drawer, and opens
another. It has manila file folders, but no files.
Grant takes out the folders. He uses a Sharpie to write
out "BALONEY" on a folder. Then he stuffs all the baloney
into the folder and files it away.
He starts writing out "PASTRAMI".
LATER
Grant flips through his alphabetically-filed meat: from
"BALONEY" through "TURKEY." But he doesn't look satisfied.
Grant stands beside the butcher's counter with a shopping
cart. He peers dreamily in through the glass at the rows
of steaks, pork chops, and so on.
GRANT
Meat.
BUTCHER
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to
the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Grant snaps out of his reverie.
GRANT
Sure thing, killer.
BUTCHER
What can I do you for?
18.
GRANT
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple
of these big ol' rib eyes.
BUTCHER
How many you need?
Grant stares at the steaks.
GRANT
Well... having us a little dinner
party... I'd say... eight. No,
no... fourteen...
The Butcher nods, starts to grab steaks.
Grant CHUCKLES.
GRANT
Hell, what am I holding back for?
Why don't you just give me
everything you got here?
BUTCHER
All the rib eyes?
GRANT
Yep. And while you're at it, get
me a few of them chicken wings...
some pork loins... and, ooo, what's
this here? Osso buco?...
Grant stands in the garage, tearing open the packing, and
letting the loose meat slide into piles onto the floor,
muttering:
GRANT
Meat.
MOMENTS LATER
Grant rolls slabs of beef over the dirty floor and into a
pile.
SOMETHING skitters across the garage and around the pile.
Grant peers around the pile and sees a RAT nibbling on
some ribs. He realizes something.
19.
GRANT
You're meat.
The rat moves away from Grant. But Grant snaps out his
arm with alarming speed, snatching the rat. It SQUEAKS
and wriggles in his grip, tearing and biting at him, trying
to get free.
Grant snaps its neck, and tosses the dead rat onto the
pile of meat. Continues on.
Starla enters the house. She heads toward a door along
the wall that leads to the garage. There's a shiny new
lock on that door as well. She touches it, baffled.
She turns to see Grant standing at the end of the foyer.
He's in shadows, a little spooky in the darkness.
GRANT
Welcome home.
STARLA
Grant? Why are there -- did you
put locks on the garage?
Pause.
No answer.
STARLA
You drilled into the driveway.
Grant walks into the light.
GRANT
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got
so excited about... your present.
STARLA
My present?
GRANT
You're my princess, aren't you?
20.
STARLA
Okay.
GRANT
I got a super-special birthday
present for you this year. I
couldn't risk you finding it, so I
had to put them locks on the doors.
Pause.
STARLA
All right... I have to clean up
before dinner.
Grant smiles at her. Starla confused, tries to smile
back, then turns and heads up the stairs. Grant watches
Starla's fine form from behind, somewhat lustily. But
his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker,
and he has a realization.
GRANT
You're meat.
Starla turns.
STARLA
What?
Grant snaps himself out of it.
GRANT
Oh, nothin'.
Nothin'.
See you in
a sec.
Starla smiles uneasily, and heads on upstairs.
OLD BARN - LATER
Grant spreads the plant life over the floor of the barn.
He arranges it, fluffs it there. His actions are very
animal-like when no one's around. He seems to be making
a nest. He sits back, looks at it.
22.
He's happy.
FADE TO:
Starla, dressed in her weekend finery, is looking in the
mirror above her dresser, and putting on earrings.
STARLA
Grant, are you almost ready?
Grant looks ill. He is leaning over the sink, sweating,
clutching his stomach.
GRANT
Yeah, hon, I'll be right there!
Grant turns and pushes open his door.
Grant sees Starla sitting on the edge of the bed, her
back to him, as she puts on her nylons. She doesn't know
he's there.
Grant stares at her, demented, and moves slowly toward
her, stalking her.
Something starts to push Grant's shirt up at his stomach,
like a bellybutton erection. The thing slips out of his
shirt -- a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward Starla's
back.
Grant looks at the nape of Starla's neck.
Her delicate
ear. He becomes confused; he softens.
Starla turns to see Grant, his body now turned away from
her. He's trying to push the tubule back down.
STARLA
What are you doing?
GRANT
You're pretty.
Starla nods, confused by his behavior.
23.
Wheelsy citizens celebrate.
A country-western band PLAYS.
Couples two-step.
Starla and Grant move through the party. Grant looks
around at the dancing and laughing bodies. Starla sees
her friend from school.
STARLA
Janene!
Janene LAUGHS heartily and the two embrace
JANENE
Hey, Grant.
GRANT
Why don't you two catch up? I'll
go see what the boys are doing.
Starla nods. She and Janene watch as Grant moves off
through the crowd.
STARLA
He's been strange the past couple
days.
Starla lies on her side, awake. She's staring at the
dirt on Grant's pants, which are hung over a valet. Grant
holds her from behind, sleeping peacefully.
FADE TO:
The front door of the precinct opens, and a confused
Mexican MAN walks inside. He is trying to keep from
crying. Three half-naked children follow him, clutching
onto his clothes. The man walks slowly through the office,
looking around for help.
Margaret sees him from her desk.
MARGARET
Sir, may I help -- ?
BRENDA'S HUSBAND
My wife, Brenda. I think something
has happened to her!
Starla enters with a shopping bag.
The lights are off.
CREEPY MUSIC plays.
STARLA
Grant?
30.
No answer.
Starla tries to turn on the lights, but nothing
happens.
STARLA
Damn fuse.
She passes the door to the garage, noticing the lock.
Starla sets down the bags on the counter, looks around.
STARLA
Grant?
Again, no one's here. She sees a potted flower on the
counter. A green INCHWORM is crawling up the stem, little
by little. She stares at it, as if it's a portent.
She hears a MOAN, coming from upstairs.
Starla moves slowly into this dark room, looking for her
husband. It seems no one is here.
STARLA
Grant, where are y -- ?
Starla turns, when Grant POPS INTO FRAME. Starla,
startled, SCREAMS. Grant is sick and trembling. But,
worse, he's been transforming. There are small pustules
all over his face.
STARLA
Grant. Oh my God. What happened
to your -- ?
GRANT
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks,
sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here.
I had a reaction to a bee sting.
He gave me a prescription. Said I
should be fine, in a couple days.
Starla stares at him, mute and horrified.
GRANT
Don't look at me like that, baby.
Please? I'm gonna go get my...
prescription filled.
Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his
pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt.
31.
STARLA
I'll get if for you.
GRANT
No!
No.
Heh.
I'll be right back.
He moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked.
It's too dark to see much in here, but we do see Grant
putting meat into a garbage bag.
Grant enters. It is almost completely dark.
He hears
WEEPING. CHAINS RATTLE.
Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting
on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS
through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is
horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous
pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away.
BRENDA
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so
fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna
die.
GRANT
Brought you munchies.
Grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead
animals out in front of her.
GRANT
Been saving for a rainy day.
CLOSEUP: Brenda's face, still mostly in darkness. She
stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed.
32.
She looks up at Grant.
BRENDA
Grant, I'm sorry if I did something
wrong! I think I gotta -- I think
I should go to a hospital!
Grant doesn't respond.
Brenda's eyes trail back down to
the meat.
Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested
pork chop, pulling it toward her.
We HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the
raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn.
Grant gets into his pickup; he trembles and YELPS as his
body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform
even more.
There's a HARD KNOCKING on Starla's door. She swings it
open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried.
Wally tries to see inside.
WALLY
Grant around?
STARLA
No.
He went to the pharmacy.
WALLY
Pharmacy?
STARLA
He's got a... rash.
Bill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means
something. Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across
the street, talking to another neighbor.
BILL
Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
Starla shakes her head.
BILL
Maybe she's ever called the house,
or -- ?
33.
STARLA
No.
What...?
BILL
She disappeared Friday night. We
got reason to believe foul play
might be involved.
WALLY
Some kids found her necklace near
Tipper Creek, as well as what might
be her blood on a rock.
BILL
The problem, Starla, is, the last
person anyone saw her talking to
was Grant.
Starla looks at him, surprised.
BILL
The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me,
we also saw him that night, with
mud all over his slacks.
Bill hands her his card.
BILL
Have him call me right away, okay?
Starla nods, distraught. Bill tries to smile kindly before
he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors'
homes.
Starla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked.
She looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage.
Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what
appears to be blood drop stains near the door.
She gains courage, and moves off toward --
Starla throws open this door. She looks at old, unused
sports equipment. She grabs an aluminum baseball bat.
Starla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the
door to the garage. She hesitates a moment. But then
she swings the bat at the lock on the door.
She swings it again, GRUNTING.
34.
And again.
Finally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door.
Starla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to
the floor.
Starla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door
into the dark garage. As she does, the horrendous stench
hits her. Terrified, she covers her face with her hand,
and enters.
Starla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of
rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets. They are neatly
divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground
Beef, Cats, Dogs. The walls and doorway have been heavily
insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home. She
looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle,
his tongue dangling out.
Starla starts to CRY.
She moves quickly back inside.
Starla runs to the front picture window, and looks out
onto the street. She can't see any of the cops.
She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone.
She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number.
The phone RINGS, and:
SHERRY (O.S.)
You've reached Chief Pardy at the
Wheelsy Police Department. Please
leave a message and your call will
be returned as soon as possible.
There's a BEEP.
Starla tries to speak through her SOBS,
pacing:
STARLA
Bill, it's Starla!
As Starla passes the large picture window, she doesn't
see Grant staring in at her, his face now that of some
diseased cephalopod.
STARLA
It's -- I think you better come
over right away -- I think Grant's
sick, he --
35.
Starla turns to see the monstrous Grant through the window.
She just stops.
They stare at each other for a moment.
And then Grant lets out a FURIOUS WAIL.
Starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house.
Grant disappears from the window.
As Starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the
front door to make sure Grant isn't following.
She runs past a wall of family photos.
Starla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to
the backyard.
She arrives at it, and flings it open --
Grant is there.
He lunges onto her. Starla SCREAMS and drops the cordless
phone, just as it starts RINGING. Grant crawls on top of
her body. Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he
pins her hands above her head. He looks into her eyes.
He's CRYING. His voice and breath are sick and raspy.
GRANT
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
STARLA
Grant, no!
GRANT
I loved you.
I loved --
STARLA
Grant, you're sick!
Grant is about to cry.
GRANT
I wanted you by my side, but you --
I can't trust you now!
Starla's WEEPING, confused. Grant rips his shirt open.
Starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the
36.
now enormous yellow spore on Grant's chest. The tubule
feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it.
It starts to poke into her skin.
STARLA
Noooo!
Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She
SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and
surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from
under him.
Starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer
ringing, and scurries behind the couch. She dials 9-1-1.
Grant thrusts the couch aside.
Starla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from
behind. He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her
back. He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as
his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her
like a snake.
Starla gasps for air. Her face turns purple.
She hears
a SLAMMING on the door.
BILL (O.S.)
Starla?!!
Starla, are you in
there?!
Starla tries to speak but she cannot.
Suddenly, we HEAR
the FRONT DOOR OPEN.
BILL (O.S.)
Starla?!
Starla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees
Bill, Wally, Trevor and Margaret burst into the living
room.
They are surprised, to say the least, to see this diseased
humanoid strangling Starla from behind.
TREVOR
Fuck!
The cops, freaked out, pull their guns. Grant makes a
SCREECHING SOUND at them. They SHOOT at Grant, nicking
him.
Grant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows,
SCREECHING in anger and pain. Starla falls to the floor.
Grant slips out the back door and away.
The cops stare, gape-jawed and frozen with shock; what
the hell was THAT?!
37.
Starla rubs her neck, COUGHING.
Bill Pardy runs toward the back door.
We PAN OVER an altar where family members have placed
little items that remind them of Brenda -- photographs,
mementos, "Come home, Mommy" cards, etc.
PASTOR (O.S.)
We ask you now for the safe return
of our beloved Brenda.
Everyone in this modest little church has their heads
bowed as the PASTOR leads the prayer service.
PASTOR
Our sister. Our daughter.
Our
mother. Our wife.
Brenda's husband, in the front pew, loses it, CRYING.
His little children, beside him, fiddle in their seats.
PASTOR
And we ask that you keep your light
alive in her heart, wherever she
may be. We ask all this in your
name, Lord. Amen
Bill Pardy is here, in full uniform, hat in hands.
BILL
CONGREGATION
Amen.
Amen.
Bill looks around the church. He spots Starla, in the
very back of church, head down, distraught, guilty.
38.
He also sees a group of OLD CRONES nearby, pointing at
Starla, and whispering about her.
Bill enters. A few COPS and SECRETARIES are bustling,
making phone calls, etc. They all look tired, as if they
haven't slept. Jack, the mayor, sees Bill.
JACK
Bill!
Bill spots him, moving quickly toward him.
BILL
Shit.
39.
JACK
Bill, we need to talk!
BILL
'Mornin', Jack.
Bill crosses the station.
Jack follows.
JACK
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's
niece. We need to find Grant
yesterday! The town council has
lit a Roman candle and stuck it up
my ass!
BILL
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities
ain't my business.
JACK
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your
post here as Chief is in dire
straits you don't work this shit
out.
They come to a desk with Wally and Trevor working away.
BILL
Don't worry, we'll find him.
(to Trevor)
Anything new?
Trevor shakes his head.
JACK
How are you going to find him?
BILL
Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many
places he can hide. Sea World,
maybe.
Jack sees a SECRETARY making copies nearby.
He speaks in
hushed tones:
JACK
That young lady heard you say
'squid.' She's gonna go out and
create a Goddamn hysteria!
BILL
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
SHERRY
Not today, Bill.
40.
JACK
Still, quit that talk! You yourself
said it was dark in there! You
don't know what you saw!
TREVOR
We saw his arm was all bendy.
JACK
Bastard obviously got lyme disease!
BILL
What?
JACK
Touch some deer feces out in the
forest. Eat a sandwich without
washing your hands. Then you got
lyme disease.
BILL
And that makes you look like a
squid?
JACK
I'll tell you what, no one with
lyme disease gonna win any damn
handsome contests!
Bill, Wally, and Trevor can't help but SNICKER.
JACK
Well, screw you all for laughin'.
SHELBY (O.S.)
Bill!
Bill looks over at Shelby, on his headset at the dispatch
unit.
SHELBY
Another ranch attack!
Up at the
Castavets'.
Bill nods for Trevor and Margaret to get up from their
desks. They do, and start to move out with Bill and Wally.
JACK
'Ranch a -'?
What 'ranch attacks'?
CLOSEUP: A property map of Wheelsy is tacked to a bulletin
board. Red Magic Marker circles are around various ranch
properties on the edge of the city, next to an enormous
forest. A finger points to one of the red circles.
BILL
So the night after Grant ran off,
a calf went missing from here, the
Raglans' ranch.
REVEAL Bill, standing beside the bulletin board. A posse
has gathered, listening intently: Wally and the usual
cops; Jack; an OLDER COP, probably pulled out of
retirement; and a couple of recruits -- a REDNECK and a
GOOD OL' BOY. Bill points to the next red circle.
BILL
Two nights ago, a mare was stolen
from this property, run by
Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with
the cleft palate.
43.
Wally whispers to Margaret, amused:
WALLY
Looks like a chipmunk.
BILL
Your momma wasn't too proud when
you came out neither, Wally.
Bill points to the next circle.
BILL
And then we get here, the
Castavets', where last night's
shit-storm took place.
TREVOR
I see. It's like as if he's going
in a pattern. Is that what you're
saying, Bill?
Bill nods and points to the next red circle.
BILL
And if he sticks to that pattern
he'll be here next. Belongs to a
family, the Strutemyers'. Now I
know y'all are tired and you've
barely seen your families. But
we're gonna have to go there
tonight, lie low and wait.
The posse nod, agreeing.
REDNECK
Let's get that son-of-a-bitch,
Chief.
BILL
Just remember, we don't know what
we're up against here. So let's
be careful.
Beside a small armory, Trevor loads a Benelli M-1 super
semiautomatic shotgun. Margaret checks the site on a
Remington 700 PSS rifle. Bill takes a Springfield M-1A
pump-action for himself, while Wally stuffs numerous
pistols and ammo into a leather satchel. Trevor notices
a dusty grenade on a shelf.
TREVOR
Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we
confiscated from them jokers wanted
to use it fish for trout?
44.
Bill looks at Trevor, considering.
BILL
Can't hurt.
As Trevor puts the grenade into a side-pocket on the
satchel, Bill sees Jack and the Older Cop, watching.
JACK
I didn't know the Russkies were
invading there, folks.
MARGARET
You seen this guy, you'd wished
they was.
Kylie is blowing on a cup of coffee. Her MOM, DAD, and
two younger SISTERS, aged 9 and 11, are relaxing after
dinner. As Kylie's Mom picks up plates --
KYLIE'S MOM
Kylie! What'd you do to your
fingers?
Kylie's Mom grabs her hand, looking at her very long
fingernails. They're painted sky blue and spotted with
minute teddy bear and bumblebee decals.
KYLIE
Kiri Goshima done 'em.
She's
Japanese.
KYLIE'S DAD
Looks like Pokemons done 'em to
me!
Kylie's sisters LAUGH out loud.
KYLIE
Foreign stuff is classy if you
knew something.
Kylie's family sees, OUT THE WINDOW, police cars pulling
up by a gravel road.
KYLIE'S DAD
Oh. There's Jack. I want y'all
to stay inside tonight. All right?
46.
Kylie's sisters nod.
Kylie too.
Inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and
it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill
peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the
trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side
as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she
snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her.
Bill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's
embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she
wants to be.
They sit there for a moment in the dark.
BILL
Hey, Starla, remember that time
when you were a kid and you came
knocking on my window in the middle
of the night?
Wally looks at them.
BILL
Starla here's twelve. Guess I was
fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what
the hell you doing out there?'
She tells me she's running away to
Hollywood to become a big star.
She said she knew I was in ROTC,
and she was gonna need a bodyguard.
Invited me along.
Wally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but
grudgingly enjoys the story.
BILL
I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody
can take care of herself, I think
it's you. I'm gonna have to
decline.'
WALLY
(to Starla)
How far'd you get?
STARLA
About the bus stop. Ranger Rick
here called my dad.
WALLY
Ha! A cop from the get-go!
You
son-of-a-bitch!
STARLA
You fucked up our fame and fortune,
Bill Pardy.
48.
BILL
Yeah, maybe I did.
Bill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the
forest. He has transformed into something much more
monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump
of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various
tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown
eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease,
he now seems to BE the disease itself.
STARLA
Grant?
Bill and Wally stare out the window, motionless.
WALLY
What we gonna do now, Bill?
Cuffs
won't even fit on 'im.
Starla musters courage.
She stands, and moves out of the
barn.
BILL
Starla, where you...?
Bill motions through the barn window to Margaret.
Kylie is running a bath.
She hears GUNSHOTS ECHO in the
distance.
She peers out a little window above the tub, trying to
see where the shots are coming from.
Bill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside.
But
they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.
BILL
Oh...
It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little
head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is
what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is
nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from
the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes,
slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be
slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The
woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin
are stained with blood.
The posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are
equally astounded.
OLDER COP
Oh, shit!
They see the source of the awful stench:
54.
Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and
horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as
they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with
flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces
with the bottom of their shirts.
The SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally.
BRENDA
Something's wrong with me.
WALLY
Uh, yeah.
Bill and Wally get in a little closer.
BILL
Brenda, um...
BRENDA
I didn't want no one to be seeing
me like this.
As the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly
LURCHES FORWARD a bit -- like whatever's inside her is
trying to get out and to the posse. Brenda SCREAMS in
agony.
The posse jump back.
They stare as she recomposes herself.
BRENDA
How are my boys, Bill?
Are they
all right?
BILL
Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's --
what's happening here, exactly?
BRENDA
I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm
so hungry. I just never knew
anybody could be so hungry.
Brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her Daddy
into giving her candy. This is creepy as hell.
BRENDA
Would you mind handing me a piece
of that possum there at your feet?
Little bit?
Trevor gags and runs out of the barn.
Bill eyes poor Brenda.
BILL
I think we best get you to a
hospital right quick.
WALLY
What the fuck they gonna do with
her in a hospital, Bill?
Again, Brenda SCREAMS.
Her body LURCHES FORWARD.
OLDER COP
Why's she doing that?!
REDNECK
Her tumors is moving.
JACK
Bill, get her to stop that shit!
BRENDA
It hurts!
Her body lurches forward AGAIN.
She sobs.
BRENDA
Help me!!
Help!!
And then AGAIN. Starla notices that Brenda's skin is
starting to SPLIT AND TEAR on her side.
STARLA
Bill!
BRENDA
Little fuckers are tearing me
aparrrr- !
Brenda SCREAMS like a woman giving a thousand evil births
at once and her body RIPS OPEN in one part; and then, in
quick succession, ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. Bill looks out
one of the windows. Grant is peering in at them, smiling.
BILL
He led us here.
And then Brenda's body BURSTS OPEN COMPLETELY, like a
water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little
SLITHERING EYELESS PARASITES with slippery black-red skin
like slugs spill forth. The horrid creatures, eight inches
long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse,
completely covering them before they can react.
56.
A parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into Wally's mouth.
He gags on it. His eyes flip back up into his head, and
his body starts to spasm.
Jack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too
slippery and it disappears inside his mouth. His body,
too, convulses, and he spits up blood.
Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of
the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their
eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. Bill sees the
things oozing up Margaret's neck.
BILL
Margaret, cover your mouth!
Bill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to
slap the parasites off. Bill yells to everyone:
BILL
Don't let 'em in your mouths!
One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he
slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face.
Starla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the
parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls
back onto the floor.
A parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when,
suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to
the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla.
Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand
firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites
away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his
free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies
and faces as closely together as possible so the things
don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them,
flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight
their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to
himself and Starla.
57.
Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and
begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off
the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound.
Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from
Starla's mouth. Starla looks around.
She sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering,
holding her shirt over her mouth. They gaze out the front
door of the barn.
Bill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at
Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton
spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous
bloody tiger rug.
He looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled
positions, their mouths and lips covered in blood, still
lightly convulsing.
He gazes out INTO THE FOREST to see the parasites rushing
away like an ugly wormy army, shaking the brush as they
head off in different directions.
CUT TO:
Kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath. Her head is back,
her eyes shut; she's enjoying the warm water. The tub
faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm.
Kylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry
sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still.
There's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward
the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the
window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail.
KYLIE'S MOM
Kylie! You're gonna turn into a
plum in there!
KYLIE
Prune, Mom.
Plums turn into prunes.
Kylie's Mom is at the bathroom door.
KYLIE'S MOM
I know what turns into what. You
got school tomorrow. Finish up in
there and get to bed.
O.S. Kylie GRUNTS in vague agreement.
Kylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door.
She KNOCKS once, then opens the door to --
Kylie's younger sisters lie in single beds, reading
Goosebumps by bed-lamps clipped to the headboards.
KYLIE'S MOM
Time to turn in, ladies.
KYLIE'S SISTER 1
Just a couple more pages, Mom?
KYLIE'S MOM
Come on now.
The girls SIGH in lazy protest, but still turn off their
reading lamps.
KYLIE'S MOM
G'night.
KYLIE'S SISTER 1
KYLIE'S SISTER 2
Night, Mom.
Night.
59.
Kylie's Mom shuts their door completely. The girls turn
on their sides and close their eyes to sleep.
And the parasites pour in through the cracked window.
They slither over the walls. Their slimy black-red bodies
contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper.
The door cracks open, and a parasite enters.
It slithers
silently over the linoleum tiles.
It arrives at the base of the tub, and crawls up the side.
Kylie continues relaxing, her eyes closed. She doesn't
see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet.
Kylie hears a SOFT SPLASHING and peers down. She spots
the creature swimming toward her between her knees.
Kylie SHRIEKS and scrambles up to get out of the tub.
As
she clamors out, she slips and falls to the floor.
The parasite squirms up Kylie's wet naked back. Kylie
SHRIEKS again, jumping up as she tries to slap the thing
off.
KYLIE
Mom!!
The parasite winds toward her lips. Kylie goes to grab
it with both hands, but it slips through them. The thing
slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it.
Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail. Her
long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there,
digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it
from sliding completely into her mouth. It wildly flaps
its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her.
60.
Kylie falls to her knees. Her eyes roll back in her head,
and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the
very tip of the parasite's tail.
We TRACK IN to a CLOSEUP of Kylie's face: a slight white
electrical-telepathic charge can be seen SPARKING inside
her mouth.
FLASH TO:
KYLIE'S VISION
We are RUSHING through some amoebic landscape, PAST
microbes and cytoplasm and cells, and to:
KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - CREATURE'S POV
Perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth. Its
eyesight is not like our own; it's in grainy black and
white and amber outlines. Various images FLASH in quick
succession, including the following:
-- We are on top of an alien ANIMAL, pinning it down.
It
HOWLS beneath us as we tear into its flesh, feasting.
-- All around us, diseased monstrous BEASTS feed on more
alien animals. They lunge toward them and pin them down,
ripping them apart, like some National Geographic
documentary shot in Hell.
-- In FAST MOTION, unfamiliar plant life around us grows
sick and withers, dying out.
-- A group of diseased monstrous beasts CRY OUT in uniform
pain. They buckle to their knees; now they're dying.
-- The diseased beasts feed on their own appendages.
BACK TO SCENE
Kylie tries to regain control of her mind. Her eyes fight
against flipping back in her head. Tears pour down her
face. She pulls the parasite out just a bit.
But then it SLAMS back into her and there are more SPARKS
inside her mouth --
KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - MANGLED INSECT POV
-- We are CLIMBING UP through a creamy, gelatinous yellow.
An opening slit widens in front of us, and we see Grant
slowly bending to look at us, the forest behind him.
61.
KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - GRANT'S POV
-- We watch Starla soaping herself in the shower.
-- We make love to Starla, our hands on her face.
-- We sit over a convulsing Brenda, impregnating her with
our tubule.
-- We see the posse members coming in toward us.
BACK TO SCENE
With a last, desperate effort, Kylie yanks at the exhausted
worm, pulling it fully from her mouth. It flaps in her
fingers. Kylie spits up blood.
Kylie tosses the parasite away from her. Though slightly
crippled, the little bastard writhes back toward her.
Kylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged
in, the red light is on. She grabs it, and swings it
into the wormy thing.
The parasite SQUEAKS and trembles with pain. Smoke rises
from it as Kylie digs the curling iron in deeper, burning
it, and, finally, killing it.
Kylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it.
The dead parasite is stuck to it, dangling from the metal.
KYLIE
Mom!!!
Kylie drops the iron. She quickly steps into her clothes
lying on the floor. She runs out of the bathroom and
into --
Kylie runs to the stairway.
KYLIE
Mom!!
Mom!!!
Kylie stops. Dozens of the things are slithering up the
stairs and up the handrail towards her.
O.S. Kylie hears her SISTERS' SCREAMS.
She looks in their
direction, running toward their room.
KYLIE
Emily!!
Jenna!!
Kylie tosses open her sisters' door.
62.
Kylie's youngest sister is on her knees on the bed, a
parasite sticking out of her mouth. Her eyes are rolled
back. Her arms flail spastically. The slithering beast
wags its tail as it disappears down her throat.
Kylie's other sister is backing into a corner, with
parasites crawling up her body. She's SCREAMING bloody
hell, trying to slap them off.
Kylie runs toward her to help. Kylie slaps the parasites
off her sister. But there's too many and they're too
fast. They slide into her sister's mouth.
KYLIE
No!!
Nooo!!
Her sister's eyes flip back in her skull as the thing
disappears completely, and she starts spitting up blood.
Kylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her.
There's a clear path toward a window. Kylie runs to the
window, and shoves it open. As the things approach her,
she crawls out --
Kylie makes sure none are inside.
She feels for the keys in the ignition.
There aren't
any.
The creatures crawl up and over all the pickup's windows,
trying to get in. Slithery shadows cover over Kylie,
leaving her in almost complete darkness.
Kylie crouches down in on herself, and WAILS.
Starla, Trevor, and Margaret stand, wide-eyed and shaken.
All three seem to be in some mild state of shock.
Bill, suppressing his desperation, is trying to make
contact on his police radio.
BILL
11-41. We're gonna need paramedics
out here right away. We got four
men down.
Bill listens for a response, but there's only STATIC.
He
presses the button again.
BILL
Shelby, you there?
Still, only STATIC.
Bill tries another frequency.
BILL
Shelby, this is Bill.
We got an
emergency here.
STATIC.
BILL
Goddammit.
Bill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get
reception. Trailing off:
BILL
Shelby?
64.
Starla sees Wally's body on the floor. His skin is white
and corpse-like. His mouth is streaked with blood. Starla
crouches beside him, and takes his pulse. Her hands are
visibly shaking.
MARGARET
Is he alive?
Starla looks at Margaret, and nods.
MARGARET
Praise Jesus.
TREVOR
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking
pushing it, Margaret.
Trevor looks about to cry.
TREVOR
What the hell were those things?!
You ever seen anything like that?
You ever heard of anything like
that?
Margaret shakes her head.
Trevor looks at Starla, who
also shakes her head.
TREVOR
Me neither. And I watch 'Animal
Planet' all the fuckin' time!
Bill re-enters.
BILL
No reception out here.
STARLA
Bill, I'll run out to your car,
call for paramedics from there.
MARGARET
That's a long ways. Them worms
are out there.
STARLA
I'll keep my mouth covered.
BILL
No. I'll go. The three of you,
you wait here. Get these folks,
out of the barn. The stench and
rot can't be any good for 'em.
Margaret and Trevor nod.
As Bill starts to leave, Starla
grabs him.
65.
STARLA
Be careful, Bill.
Bill nods. Makes a feeble attempt at a smile.
He jogs
off into the forest.
Kylie is still alone in the Luv truck. The windows are
clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as
they did with the posse in the barn. But Kylie stays in
the car, trembling, afraid to leave.
She HEARS a DOOR OPEN. She sees her parents and her
sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home.
They're also bloated and diseased. Their chins and shirts
are stained with the blood they spit up.
KYLIE'S DAD
Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on
out.
Her family lumbers up to the truck. They peer in with
their milky eyes. Her youngest sister pushes her face up
close to the window.
KYLIE'S SISTER 2
Hi, Kylie.
It's me.
Her family tries the door handles, but they're locked.
KYLIE'S MOM
Open the door, sweetie. I know we
don't look so good, but your mommy
and daddy love you.
KYLIE
Get away!!
KYLIE'S MOM
Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why
not to be with your family. This
is family fun day, isn't it?
They continue RATTLING the door handles, over and over.
They SLAP the windows.
Kylie SOBS.
Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice:
68.
KYLIE'S SISTER 1
Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-
ance.
Her Dad leans over and picks up a large rock. He carries
it toward the truck. He holds it up over the windshield.
Kylie SCREAMS as he SMASHES it down. The windshield
CRACKS, but doesn't shatter. He holds it up again.
Starla looks back to see Jack right behind her.
Starla keeps running, when she trips and falls. She looks
down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing,
now long fallen and curling on the forest floor. Starla
forces herself up, as Jack closes in.
Jack grabs onto her blouse, SCREECHING furiously.
When
he HEARS something and looks over to see:
Bill's police car, cruising over the forest floor, directly
toward him. Jack, frightened, lets go of Starla. He's
about to get hit when --
The police car suddenly stops, jammed between two trees,
inches from Jack.
Jack smiles, and moves toward Bill -- but Starla rises
behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed-
wire fence.
She thrusts it forward, hard; and it pops out the front
of Jack's neck.
Jack turns to look at Starla, and topples over into the
leaves.
Bill backs the car out from between the trees. He sees
the Older Cop and Redneck coming in toward them.
BILL
Come on!
Trevor and Starla get into the car.
The Older Cop watches
them back away and yells:
OLDER COP
Starla!!
Shelby sits at the police operator's unit, peppy.
SHELBY
You dig that rat out of the hole?
INTERCUT POLICE CAR AND STATION
BILL
Listen, you got any reports of...
I don't know what you call 'em.
They look like big slugs, only
fast.
SHELBY
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin'
about that new waitress down at
Sloan's! Ha ha!
BILL
Shelby --
SHELBY
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police
radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -
BILL
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out
for these things. If you see 'em,
keep your mouth covered. Otherwise
they'll go straight down it. All
right?
Shelby looks confused, and nods.
BILL
Are you nodding?
SHELBY
Yeah.
76.
BILL
I can't hear when you're nodding.
SHELBY
Sorry.
BILL
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Bill hangs up. Kylie is clutching onto herself, hollow-
eyed, in deep shock. She mutters, almost unintelligibly:
KYLIE
The worms are in their brains.
Starla, Bill, and Trevor look at her.
INSERT - FOREST
The CAMERA TRACKS QUICKLY FORWARD, through the forest,
and to a CLOSEUP on the Redneck, who is hunched over
Margaret's body, eating her flesh.
MATCH CUT TO a CAT SCAN of the REDNECK'S HEAD: a parasite
is imbedded into his brain; its tail hangs down his spine,
wagging just a bit.
KYLIE (O.S.)
Drivin' 'em around...
BACK TO THE POLICE CAR
Bill stares at Kylie like she's insane.
STARLA
She's right. We saw one -- one
came out of Wally's head.
TREVOR
Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came
out there --
STARLA
Kylie, how do you --
Kylie is rocking back and forth.
STARLA
Kylie, how do you know that?
Kylie shakes her head.
She doesn't want to answer.
BILL
Kylie, honey.
Please.
(MORE)
77.
BILL (CONT'D)
A lot of bad things have happened
to you today, we know. But we
need your help to find out what's
going on.
Kylie CRIES.
KYLIE
I was in the bath. It tried to go
inside me and I -- for a minute I
became it.
BILL
The worm?
KYLIE
I got it out.
TREVOR
What are they?
KYLIE
Part of him.
BILL
Who?
(pause)
Who?
KYLIE
Mrs. Grant's husband.
Starla stares at her.
KYLIE
But not always. I was -- He was...
other stuff too.
STARLA
What other stuff?
Kylie kind of points at the sky.
TREVOR
He's a fucking Martian?!
BILL
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Kylie tries to think.
KYLIE
For real it looks like a needle.
Its real face. But it always gots
another.
(MORE)
78.
KYLIE (CONT'D)
He goes from place to place,
worlds... planets... killing 'em.
He takes over half of what's alive
and eats the other half. Till
they're gone.
They stare at her, freaked out.
KYLIE
Now he's here.
He went in Mr.
Grant.
STARLA
Through a wound on his stomach?
Kylie nods.
KYLIE
He took him over. His body. His --
his brain, everything what he knew.
He's only been dumb stuff before -
amoeba-things, and rhino-things.
He liked being human. Didn't want
to change.
STARLA
And you said the worms are part of
him. They're all linked, like one
creature?
KYLIE
When one sees you they all see
you.
STARLA
An animal that doesn't procreate.
It spreads, grows. A living
disease.
BILL
(to Kylie)
So the way to stop this thing is
to stop Grant?
Kylie shrugs.
The police car starts CHUGGING.
BILL
Shit.
The car slows, and comes to a stop.
Bill fumbles for the radio controls.
BILL
Shelby!
Trevor looks out the window, watching the deer fade away
behind them.
TREVOR
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving
them things the hell out!
BILL
Shelby!
SHELBY (O.S.)
Hey there, Chief.
BILL
Shelby! We need people out here
at Cosgrove and McCammon right
away!
SHELBY (O.S.)
Don't worry, Chief.
The Buick and SUV are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this
store. Shattered vases and flowers surround them. Glass
fragments dangle from the window frame. Some fall and
CLINK to the floor.
85.
Starla lifts her battered head from the wheel. She looks
beside her to see Bill and Trevor, seemingly unconscious.
She looks back at Kylie. The impact has killed her. Her
neck is bent at an ungodly angle. Bone juts up out of
her skin.
Starla looks out her rear window and sees the SUV door
open, and the DISEASED DRIVER stumble out. His body is
battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her.
He tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a MUMBLY
MOAN comes out.
Starla struggles to get out of the car. Eventually, she
does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass
from the shattered window, and the water all over the
floor from the broken vases.
She sees the moaning driver limping toward her.
He's
still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible.
The driver gets close, ready to grab her. Starla sees a
metal bar. She grabs it. And SLAMS it into the diseased
man's shin.
He topples over.
She crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal
bar down into his head, again and again, SHOUTING and
CRYING with fury.
Starla looks down at the man, who is very dead.
Starla looks up to see dozens of DISEASED TOWNSFOLK coming
at her, from down the street, between buildings. They
see Starla there.
DISEASED TOWNSFOLK
Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!
Bill and Trevor limp up behind Starla, pulling her toward
a door on the back wall.
BILL
Come on.
Bill closes and locks the door behind them.
TREVOR
What the hell are we going to do?!
BILL
Just block the doors, any way you
can.
Bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench.
Trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal
shelving.
Starla looks doubtful of this whole activity.
But still,
she helps.
The storeroom has two doors.
They start nailing anything
over them they can.
Trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a
crack in the upper corner of the room.
TREVOR
Goddamn snakes!!
Trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting
wildly at them, BLASTING up the whole room.
Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from
other cracks in the room as well. They also BLAST at
them. Dust is all around; they can hardly see.
Bill runs out of ammo. He grabs a hand-held Black and
Decker electric circular saw and turns it on. He starts
jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting
big slices in the floor. They SQUEAK with pain.
Bill hears something POP behind him. He turns to see a
little hole in one of the doors. Three diseased fingers
slip inside, trying to pull away more.
Bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers.
An arm pops through the door.
Bill slams the circular
saw into that. Blood spurts.
Bone grinds.
87.
A man's eye peeks through another crack. Bill jams the
circular saw through the crack and into the man's face.
Bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door
across from him. He runs over to the space, when the
circular saw stops turning. Bill turns to see he's
accidentally unplugged it.
Bill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his
shotgun. Starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have
almost torn down one of the doors.
STARLA
This is stupid.
Starla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away
the planks they nailed there.
BILL
What are you doing?!
STARLA
We can't make it. Just get away,
when you get the chance.
BILL
What?
STARLA
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to
get him to take me to him! See if
you can follow me, and kill him!
BILL
No, Starla!
No!
88.
Another full metal plate is pushed off the door. A
DISEASED MAN'S face peeks through. Trevor swirls to see
it. The Man GLEEKS, hitting Trevor on his chest. Trevor
looks down, in shock.
And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The
Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over
him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor
starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab
him.
BILL
Nooo!
Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him
away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid
has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart
like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them.
Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm.
Starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door.
She throws it open. None of the diseased are on this
side of the building anymore. She moves outside.
Starla balks at the smell. She looks beside her at the
garage; the wall has been torn out, and this has become
Grant's feeding area, with rotten meat, including some
bodies, in a pile.
Starla steps slowly forward, looking around.
STARLA
Grant?
Starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here.
Starla walks into the kitchen. Cooking supplies and
condiments are scattered over the floor. She spots a
meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils.
She glances out the rear window. Diseased people are
guarding the backyard, looking away from the home.
She grabs the meat thermometer. She snaps the thermometer
part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal
spike into the seam of her skirt.
92.
Suddenly, Starla hears EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD, the song
she and Grant danced to earlier, starting to play through
tinny speakers.
Starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she
can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her.
STARLA
Grant?
We should talk.
Starla stands at the base of the stairwell.
The SONG is
louder.
STARLA
Grant?
She starts to ascend the stairs.
They CREAK beneath her
feet.
Bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the
diseased humans around Grant's. Bill can see Starla in
the home next door, walking up the stairs.
Bill runs toward the stairwell here.
Starla looks down the hall.
Most of the walls have been
torn away.
Between wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome
mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom.
In front of him, the SONG ENDS on the CD player. It starts
into the NEXT SONG on the album. Grant uses one of his
crusty tentacles to push the back button.
93.
EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD starts over.
Starla walks toward him.
Grant keeps his back to her. Starla takes in the room.
Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls:
photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family
parties.
STARLA
Hey, Grant.
Starla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth.
STARLA
You did some real interesting
decorating here.
Grant watches her from the corner of his sad, purulent
eye.
STARLA
Hey.
Starla walks by a window.
STARLA
Look, the sun's starting to come
up.
Starla starts to open the drapes.
Bill happens to look through the neighbors' kid's bedroom
and to the home across the way where Starla is pulling
the drapes away from the window. She sees Bill there.
Grant SCREECHES angrily at Starla. She quickly closes
the drapes, not letting on she saw Bill.
STARLA
Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know
you wanted it dark.
Bill walks into this young boy's bedroom, filled with
airplanes and sports memorabilia.
94.
He peeks around the window frame at the Grant bedroom
window, now closed to him. He makes sure his shotgun is
loaded.
Starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall
with the photos.
STARLA
You like these memories, huh, Grant?
Grant looks away from her.
Starla moves toward him, almost
seductively.
STARLA
You like being called Grant, don't
you?
Grant is silent.
She gets closer.
STARLA
I think you do. You really do.
You like being Grant. Like when
we danced. And when you... made
love to me here on the bed.
Remember that?
Grant looks embarrassed.
Starla becomes more brazen.
STARLA
I know you've been alone, Grant.
Almost forever. From here to there
to there to here, there's never
been another one for you.
Starla almost looks as if she's about to cry, out of
compassion for him.
STARLA
Grant. Grant, I could help you.
Be with you the way you want.
See, I want to live. I've never
had much use for this world, not
really. You and I, together, we --
She touches his tentacle with her fingers.
He moves it
back, and GROWLS a little.
Starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again. She
sets them on his tentacle once more. He glares at her
distrustfully, breathing his deep, sick breath.
STARLA
You don't trust me, I know. That's
why I brought you someone, Grant.
95.
Starla looks into his eyes.
STARLA
It's Bill. He's in the house next
door. Just look.
Bill glances down to see a diseased man looking up at
him. In fact, they're all looking up at him. Bill is
confused.
Grant looks at Starla with sad eyes, perhaps touched.
Starla smiles nervously, expectantly.
STARLA
See? I brought him here for you!
As an offering! To prove I love
you more than him!
Grant wraps his tentacle around Starla. Starla, though
obviously disgusted, touches his face with her hand.
The diseased townsfolk break down the door, moving into
the downstairs below Bill.
Bill hears them approaching. He SHATTERS the window, and
crawls onto a small mock-balcony outside.
Starla moves slowly in toward Grant, as if to kiss him.
Grant looks, well, joyful.
And then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and
JABS it into Grant's eye.
Grant SCREECHES, blind and bucking.
Starla SLAMS the
spike into his other eye.
And she STABS him again, shoving the spike into his
forehead, where it stays.
Starla leaps to the window.
She throws open the drapes.
96.
STARLA
Now, Bill!!
Kill the motherfucker!!
The WINDOW SHATTERS and the shot strikes Grant. He
SCREECHES, swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the
room in fury.
One tentacle SLAMS Starla against the wall, probably
breaking a rib or two. Another tentacle SMASHES the CD
player, squelching the song.
Grant is struck in the head. He starts slithering out of
the bedroom, feeling his way out.
Starla, clutching her ribs and barely able to move, pulls
herself up on the window.
Bill tosses her the grenade. She tries to catch it, but
misses it. It lands on the carpet. She see Grant's
tentacles slipping away. She tries to move but she's
hurt bad, bleeding.
Starla appears at the top of the stairs, clutching her
bloody side. She has the pin in one hand and the grenade
in the other.
With all her remaining effort, she lobs the grenade behind
Grant.
GRANT
Er...?
It EXPLODES.
Starla is thrown back.
Starla crawls forward to look down through the smoke:
most of the second floor has been blown away. Her mutated
husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs.
Starla and Bill pile stuff up on the cashier's counter --
Band-Aids, gauze, alcohol; Power Bars and Gatorade. The
CASHIER rings it up, staring at them because of their
wounds.
CASHIER
Comes to 32.87.
Bill pulls money out of his pants pocket. As he does,
Starla glances down. His arm pulls up his shirt, and
Starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his
stomach. She turns away, looking around, confused.
Bill pays, smiles at the cashier.
BILL
There you go.
Bill pays for the aspirin, and walks out with it.
Bill gets in the driver's seat, puts his keys into the
engine.
BILL
We'll just head up here into
Bishopville, get checked up in the
hospital. Then maybe we'll head
off to Hollywood after all, huh?
STARLA
Okay.
Bill turns to smile at Starla. She's aiming the .38 at
his face. Tears are streaming down her cheeks.
BILL
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my
best not to hurt anybody --
STARLA
You took Bill.
BILL
It's my nature.
101.
STARLA
And this is mine.
Starla pulls the trigger, the GUNSHOT CRACKS OUT.
Bill's dead body is slumped over the steering wheel.
Starla really can't bring herself to look at it, as she
reaches across it and toward the door handle.
Starla WIPES the tears away from her face. She glances
out the window to see the cashier peeking out of the
cashier's station.
Starla scoots over into the driver's seat.
She shoves
the car into drive.
And she takes off down the road, not looking back.
Starla's blanched and numb but the tears still keep coming.
CUT TO BLACK.
