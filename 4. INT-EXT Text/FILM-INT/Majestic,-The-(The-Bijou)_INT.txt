WRITER'S BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNING
Pete comes down the hall a few steps, stops.
Something's
wrong.
It's awfully quiet.
He pokes his head into the door
marked "TYPING POOL."
TYPING POOL - MORNING
A sea of black Underwoods -- all silent.
The lights in the
room are off, and hard shafts of morning sun stream in
through the windows.
One typists, LOUISE, is going from
machine to machine, pulling covers over them.
PETE
Louise... what gives?
She looks up, startled.
LOUISE
Oh Pete... they, uh, they gave
everybody the day off... while they
sort things out.
PETE
Sort what out?
Are my pages done?
LOUISE
They took 'em.
PETE
They took 'em?
Who took 'em?
Louise, what's going on...
LOUISE
Pete, I'm not even supposed to be
talking to you...
She rushes past him.
Pete doesn't quite know what to think.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Good morning, Peter.
Pete turns.
The voice belongs to Pete's agent, LEO KUBELSKY,
a rotund man in his fifties.
He wears a perfectly tailored
silk suit.
PETE
Leo... what's going on?
CUT TO:
WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAY
Prominent on the wall is a framed "SAND PIRATES OF THE
SAHARA" poster.
Pete reaches up and takes it down.
He leans
it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden
swivel chair.
He swivels around to see
A STUDIO SECURITY GUARD
standing by the door.
He's watching Pete's every move.
Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's
belongings.
Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk
drawer.
He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the
desk.
He looks at the cover of the first one:
"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"
By Peter Appleton
A United Pictures Production
February 19, 1951
Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the
second one:
"ASHES TO ASHES"
By Peter Appleton
He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box,
which contains somewhat more personal items.
A ragged gold
pillow with tassels.
Legal pads of notes.
An old tin-toy
fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn.
He turns
it around in his hands.
PETE
(musing)
Huh.
Red...
Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door.
SANDRA (O.S.)
Pete?
Pete...?
Sandra appears in the doorway.
She's in costume -- a Louis
XIV courtier.
She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and
embraces him.
SANDRA
Oh, Pete...
They kiss.
The Guard watches their every move.
SANDRA
What happened?
PETE
What exactly did you hear?
SANDRA
That you got let go.
PETE
I wasn't alone.
Wasn't Frankie
Ruskin directing the picture you're
in?
SANDRA
He was, but he got sick.
We got a
new director today.
Why?
PETE
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's
catching.
SANDRA
You mean, he was... let go, too?
PETE
(sotto, an appeal)
They're saying I'm a communist,
Sandy.
But I'm not, you know that.
I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna
win, but I'll need your help.
During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling
away from Pete.
PETE
A lot of good people are being
accused of things they didn't do.
Hell, even if I was a communist,
this is America, goddammit, a
person should be able to be
whatever they want to be!
Right?
Sandra glances at the Guard, who is watching everything.
SANDRA
(nervously)
Of course, but I... I don't know
how I... how much help I can be to
you.
This is the sort of thing...
someone saying you're a
communist... it can ruin your
career.
Pete sees where this is going.
She's edging toward the door.
PETE
Will you help me, Sandy?
SANDRA
I'll have to think about this.
I
have to get back... I should go...
And she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye.
Pete
looks at the Guard.
PETE
So nice to be a pariah.
The Guard turns away.
Pete moves back toward the boxes.
Rummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels
with barely one swig left.
He regards the bottle for a
moment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't),
pops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it.
He looks
at it thoughtfully as we
CUT TO:
A HALF-FULL BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS setting down on a bartop.
WIDER
THE FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT
The bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietly
getting stewed.
The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive,
dimly lit and full of character and characters.
It's a quiet
night and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are just
leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s.
Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of
the bar.
Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot.
Good boy, he got most of it in the glass.
JERRY
Pete.
You think maybe you've had
enough?
PETE
Bought the bottle, didn't I?
(raises the shot)
To the United States of America.
Long my she wave.
He knocks it back and Jerry pours him another.
PETE
(trying to light a smoke)
Thanks, Jerry.
Tell me something.
JERRY
What.
PETE
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
JERRY
(helps Pete light his
cigarette)
The G-man?
PETE
(thickly)
Zackly.
JERRY
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in
here wearing a dress, I wouldn't
know him.
PETE
Too bad.
He says I'm a communist.
JERRY
(glancing around)
You should watch what you say.
You
don't know who's listening.
PETE
You know I'm not a communist, don't
you, Jer?
JERRY
Sure, I suppose.
That why you're
on a bender?
PETE
This is not a bender yet.
This is
the start of a bender.
But I can
see how you were confused, they
look a lot alike.
Pete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar.
He
watches Jerry, who is not about to refill it.
Pete reaches
for the bottle, but Jerry is faster.
JERRY
Pete... go home.
Come on, I'll
call that girlfriend of yours,
what's her name... Sandy?
PETE
(laughs)
Sandra Sinclair.
JERRY
Gimmee her number, I'll have her
pick you up.
PETE
Sandra Sinclair.
Wanna know her
real name?
Bella Iskowitz.
No
one's who they really are, Jer.
Everyone's someone else.
Even you.
Even me.
Especially me.
I'm Peter
Appleton, the communist who's not
really a communist.
JERRY
I wanna close up soon.
C'mon,
let's call her.
Peter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled bills
on the bar and grabs his hat.
PETE
Nope.
Can't.
We're through.
JERRY
Then I'll call you a cab.
PETE
I'll save you the trouble.
(beat)
I'm a cab.
There.
Did it myself.
Pete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his
car keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in his
condition.
PETE
'Sides, car's right outside.
I'll
be seein' ya, Jer.
JERRY
Pete...
And he's out the door.
PETE'S CAR - NIGHT
Sitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as
though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably
be a good idea.
PETE
(mumbling)
Drive.
Drive.
Bad idea.
Too
drunk to drive.
He looks at his watch.
PETE
One-thirty.
Huh!
Early.
Can't go
home yet.
He turns the key and hits the starter.
The engine hums to
life.
Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze
and puts the car in gear.
The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt
and stalls.
PETE
Oops.
He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and
down the deserted boulevard.
DISSOLVE TO:
PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT
Pete is finally relaxed.
He takes off his hat and jams it
down in the back seat.
He takes a deep breath -- with the
wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at
peace.
He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the
fuel gauge.
INSERT - FUEL GAUGE
Pinning on "empty."
PETE
Shit.
PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)
Guess which came first.
He scans the road ahead -- nothing.
Glances to his right.
PETE'S POV
The lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance.
Pete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that
will take him toward the lights.
He passes a hand-painted
sign that gives him hope: "GAS - 1 MI."
CUT TO:
PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT
Pete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading
"LAWSON WASH," just in front of a small wooden auto bridge.
Barely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge...
HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
... his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless
possum...
Pete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the
edge...
MABEL'S DINER - DAY
Pete is fairly shoveling the pie into his mouth, pausing only
to wash it down with gulps of coffee.
MABEL
stands nearby, watching in amazement as her pie is consumed
in record time.
Pete notices that Stanton and Mabel -- and the other PATRONS,
for that matter -- are watching his feeding frenzy.
He stops
in his tracks, and starts chewing leisurely.
He smiles at
Mabel.
PETE
(mouth full)
Pie's... good.
MABEL
(wryly)
Like you could tell.
(to Stanton)
Where'd you find him?
STANTON
Down by the wash.
MABEL
We gotta put a rail on that thing
before someone else gets killed.
(to Pete)
Three people have died there,
Mister.
You're lucky to be alive.
PETE
(draining the coffee cup)
Thanks.
More coffee?
Mabel obliges.
As she pours the coffee, she looks at Pete.
MABEL
You know, you look familiar.
You
ever been in here before?
Pete shakes his head.
STANTON
He don't remember who he is, Mabel.
Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon
as he gets in.
MABEL
(distractedly)
Doc should be in for his coffee and
bear claw any minute...
(to Pete)
You sure you never been in here?
Pete looks up at Mabel and smiles winningly.
PETE
I'd remember this pie.
Mabel, thoroughly charmed, smiles back at Pete.
MABEL
(patting his hand)
I'll just get you another piece.
MABEL'S DINER - DAY
Lardner comes over to Mabel, who hands him a tall paper cup
of coffee and bags him a bear claw.
LARDNER
Mornin' Mabel, Stan.
MABEL
Mornin' Doc.
Got some new business
for you today.
Lardner and Pete make eye contact, and the doctor notices the
bump on his head.
LARDNER
Hello, son.
How'd that happen?
STANTON
He don't know.
And he don't know
his name, neither.
Found him down
by the wash.
LARDNER
You'd better come with me, son.
(to Mabel, indicating the
coffee and danish)
On my tab?
MABEL
You bet.
Lardner, Stanton and Pete rise and move to the door.
Pete
turns back, takes the three quarters out of his pocket, and
puts them on the counter, smiling brightly at Mabel.
PETE
Thanks.
Great pie.
MABEL
(blushing)
You're welcome.
Come again.
ON HARRY
seated at the opposite end of the counter.
He glances up at
Pete.
HARRY'S POV
as Pete smiles at Mabel and turns to go.
ON HARRY
His mouth falls open, his hand moves to cover it.
He's just
seen a ghost...
HARRY'S POV - SLOW MOTION...
... as the three men pass by the diner's window.
CLOSE - HARRY
HARRY
(wide eyed)
Sweet Jesus...
CUT TO:
A FINGER --
moving left-to-right, right-to-left through space.
LARDNER'S VOICE
Follow my finger.
Just use your
eyes.
That's it.
Good.
WIDER
EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
Doc Lardner is checking Pete's eyes.
Pete sits on an
examination table, his shirt off, his head freshly bandaged.
Stanton lurks in the corner, Maggie curled at his feet.
STANTON
He was passed out cold.
Maggie
woke 'im.
LARDNER
Uh-huh.
He looks familiar.
(to Pete)
Open your mouth.
Say "ah."
Pete does.
Lardner has a look as Stanton pulls out a pocket
watch.
STANTON
Said as much myself, Doc.
Can't
place him, though.
To look at him,
you'd think the cheese slid off his
cracker.
(looks at his watch)
Well, morning's half-over.
I'm
off.
PETE
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
STANTON
Don't mention it.
Whoever-you-are.
Stanton and Maggie exit.
Lardner checks Pete's ears.
LARDNER
Any idea how you got here, son?
PETE
No, sir.
Lardner sniffs him.
LARDNER
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
PETE
I don't remember.
I guess so.
Smells like it.
(smacks his lips and
frowns)
Tastes like it.
LARDNER
Well, you've been wet to the skin.
You must've fallen in.
PETE
I guess I did.
LARDNER
Lucky you got out, that water's got
quite a pull, and it empties
straight into the ocean.
Lardner takes a shirt off his counter and hands it to Pete.
LARDNER
Here, one of mine.
PETE
Thanks.
Pete puts on the shirt.
LARDNER
Do you remember if you were driving
a car?
Maybe you went over the
bridge.
No guard rail there, it's
easy to do.
It's happened before.
PETE
It's possible.
I just don't
remember.
LARDNER
And you don't know your name or who
you are, that right?
PETE
(frustrated)
I... no, I... I just can't...
LARDNER
(gently)
It's okay, son.
We just need to
call you something.
That's all.
Pete stifles a laugh.
LARDNER
What is it?
PETE
Call me... Ishmael?
LARDNER
Well, at least you remember "Moby
Dick."
CUT TO:
DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
Lardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling his
bear claw.
Pete is standing, nosing around the office --
diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks.
He zeros in on one
photo in particular.
ON THE PHOTO
one of Lardner and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.
They've been
fishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catch
than Lardner.
LARDNER
(into phone)
Stanton found him by the wash.
Not
hurt too bad, but he took a nasty
bump on the head and he can't
remember who he is.
We both think
he looks familiar, but we can't
place him.
You bet.
He'll be
here.
Lardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures.
LARDNER
That's me and my daughter Adele.
My pride and joy.
Charms the fish
right out of the lake, she does.
PETE
She's very pretty.
LARDNER
Thanks.
Well, Sheriff's on his way
over, and maybe we can get to the
bottom of who you are...
Lardner stares at him.
Pete takes note, turns toward him.
LARDNER
... sorry 'bout that, but you do
look familiar to me.
PETE
Wish I could say the same thing.
CUT TO:
DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY
Sheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete.
He's staring at
him intently.
Silence.
ELDRIDGE
No wallet, huh?
LARDNER
No identification at all.
(beat)
What're you thinkin', Cecil?
ELDRIDGE
What I'm thinkin' is we got us one
a'two things here.
A mystery or a
damn miracle.
And by god I can't
tell which.
(to Pete)
Boy, you say you have no idea who
you are?
That right?
PETE
Yes.
ELDRIDGE
You ever been in this town before,
to your knowledge?
PETE
No.
But...
ELDRIDGE
But what?
PETE
Well, this place sorta reminds me
of something.
ELDRIDGE
What's that?
PETE
"It's a Wonderful Life."
ELDRIDGE
The Jimmy Stewart picture?
I
remember that one.
Saw it over at
the Bijou.
So, you remember that,
huh?
PETE
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
ELDRIDGE
Or the Bijou.
Either one.
PETE
I remember the picture... but I
don't remember where I saw it.
The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door.
ELDRIDGE
Doc, with your permission, I want
to bring someone in here.
Maybe
it'll jar this young man's memory.
LARDNER
By all means.
Eldridge opens the door.
ELDRIDGE
(to someone offscreen)
Harry, why don't you come on in
here.
Harry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head
of snow-white hair.
He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and
slowly turns to face Pete.
He looks closer... and closer.
Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who
slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze.
Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe.
PETE
looks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face...
HARRY
has tears forming in his eyes.
A smile turns up the corners
of his mouth, and quickly lights up his whole face.
LARDNER
(softly, to Eldridge)
Are you saying that he's...
ELDRIDGE
(smiling broadly)
Shhhhhh.
Harry takes Pete in his arms and hugs him tightly, burying
his face in Pete's shoulder and sobbing.
HARRY
I knew all along.
I knew you were
alive!
Oh, Luke...
Pete doesn't quite know what to think.
He clearly has no
idea who this old man is.
LARDNER
(mouth agape in disbelief)
Mother o'god...
ELDRIDGE
(to Pete)
Give the man a hug, boy!
That's
your father!
Pete looks at Harry.
It's not so much that he remembers
anything -- he's swept up in the moment.
PETE
My father...?
Pete wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tightly,
glancing over at
ELDRIDGE AND LARDNER
who look on goofily, fighting back tears.
They smile at
Pete, who smiles back tentatively.
CUT TO:
ELDRIDGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY
Harry sits next to the Sheriff, and Luke has the back seat
all to himself.
He leans forward toward the front seat and
taps Harry on the shoulder.
LUKE
Excuse me... what's your, um, your
name?
HARRY
Harry, son.
Harry.
LUKE
And... what's my name again?
HARRY
Albert Lucas Trumbo.
But you've
been "Luke" since you were a baby.
LUKE
Ah.
(taking it for a spin)
Luke.
Luke.
I like it.
Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street.
HIS POV
Shops are open for business, TOWNSPEOPLE are going about
their lives.
A few stop and watch as the Sheriff's car goes
by.
LUKE
How long have I been gone?
Eldridge looks at Harry, who stares ahead.
LUKE
How long?
Pause.
The silence is too thick, and Harry has to answer.
He turns around in his seat and faces Luke.
HARRY
(gently)
You never came back from the war.
We were told you were missing and
presumed dead.
LUKE
When did I leave?
HARRY
You joined up one month to the day
after Pearl Harbor.
January
seventh... nineteen forty-two.
Luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in.
HARRY
Nine and-a-half years ago.
LUKE
Nine and-a-half years...
ELDRIDGE
Comin' up on the Bijou, gents.
BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
The interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by
the exterior.
Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in
shards and pieces from the walls.
It's sort of a cross
between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with
generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable
combination of questionable taste and neglect.
Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --
probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole
theater --
A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.
Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut
crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and
scatter it in a hundred directions.
TILT DOWN TO REVEAL
Luke and Harry standing below.
Luke is lost in a gulf
somewhere between surprise and disgust.
HARRY
We've been closed for a while.
LUKE
(smiling wanly)
Ah.
Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one
open.
AUDITORIUM - DAY
The ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem
to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional
row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved
itself up against the row behind or in front.
THE SCREEN
is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin,
framed by ragged red velveteen drapery.
In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old
upright piano.
Luke walks a few steps down the aisle.
He picks a seat on
the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits.
As he
does, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another
seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and
backstage.
Harry comes over and sits behind him.
LUKE
(turning to Harry)
Exactly how long has the Bijou been
closed?
HARRY
Hmmmm... after you left, it was
difficult, and then Lily -- that's
your mother -- she took ill and
died... we haven't shown a picture
since forty-eight.
LUKE
Why?
HARRY
(deep breath)
Well, after the war, with so many
of the town's boys killed, people
around here didn't much feel like
going to the movies, I guess.
Some
of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles,
Sacramento, San Francisco.
Wasn't
much to keep 'em here, I expect.
And now with this "television"
thing -- people just aren't going
out as much as they used to.
LUKE
Didn't you have any help?
HARRY
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but
they really couldn't help much.
Broke their hearts when we closed
up.
Broke mine, too.
(brightening)
But now that you're back, well,
things will be different around
here, that's for sure.
(rises, grabs Luke's arm)
C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
CUT TO:
BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY
The small apartment above the projection booth is quite a
contrast to the rest of the theater.
It's neat as a pin, and
fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains,
allowing the sun to flood the room.
A beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are
SEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS.
One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke.
It's a
Norman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue
olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder.
He has one
arm around Harry and the other around his mother.
(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even
in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)
HARRY
The day you shipped out.
That was
a proud day for your mother and me.
Last time you saw her.
Last time I
saw you.
He smiles.
HARRY
Till today.
Luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine
looking woman.
It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from
the 30's.
HARRY
That's Lily.
Your mother, rest her
soul.
LUKE
(repeating)
Mother.
(to Harry)
She's beautiful.
HARRY
(coming over)
Well, yes, that she was.
She
certainly made this place a home.
He takes the picture from Luke, kisses it, and gently
replaces it on the table.
Luke goes over to the sofa and
sits.
HARRY
(brightly)
Can I get you anything?
I can put
some coffee on or some...
Harry looks at Luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleep
on the sofa.
He goes to him, gently picks his feet off the floor, lifts
them onto the sofa.
Removes his shoes, sets them on the
floor.
CUT TO:
A BLANKET
being drawn up Luke's chest.
HARRY
stands, looks down warmly at his son.
Then, suddenly, he's
seized by a thought.
He turns and crosses to the window.
CLOSE - THE WINDOW
There's a small picture frame in the window.
Harry reaches
down, gingerly picks it up and turns it around.
ON THE FRAME
It's a single, faded gold star.
One war casualty.
Harry clutches it to his chest, looks over at the sleeping
Luke and smiles.
HARRY
(softly)
When I woke up this morning, my son
was dead.
Now, I have my boy
again.
(closes his eyes)
I have my boy again.
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
BIJOU APARTMENT - MORNING
It's early morning.
Luke is sound asleep, still in his
clothes.
In the distance, a train sounds its HORN.
Luke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly.
Slowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed.
Something's strange, though.
He frowns.
The train is
GETTING CLOSER.
Luke's eyes POP OPEN.
LUKE'S POV
As the train RUMBLES BY, shaking everything in the room, Luke
looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him.
Harry, an elderly WOMAN, and an elderly BLACK MAN.
HARRY
(smiling)
'Morning, Son.
ELDERLY WOMAN
(smiling)
Good morning, Luke.
ELDERLY BLACK MAN
(no expression)
'Mornin'.
HARRY
Sleep well?
Luke is speechless.
It he dreaming this?
HARRY
They couldn't wait to see you.
LUKE
Who... are they?
HARRY
This is the staff of the Bijou.
LUKE
Oh.
What... what time is it?
HARRY
Six-thirty.
I thought we'd get an
early start.
Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more
awake.
He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged.
The elderly woman nudges Harry gently.
HARRY
Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but
you don't... you need to be re-
introduced.
Luke, this is Mrs.
Irene Terwilliger.
Luke stands and shakes MRS. TERWILLIGER'S hand.
She's tiny,
seventy if she's a day.
She smiles and curtsies slightly.
Her eyes sparkle brightly, her manner almost coquettish.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Head cashier and refreshments
clerk.
So glad to have you back,
my boy!
(to Harry)
Much more handsome than I remember
him.
HARRY
And this fine fellow is our head
usher, resident fix-it man and
custodian.
Luke, meet Old Tim.
(to Old Tim)
You remember Luke, don't you?
OLT TIM is -- well, old.
His clothes are a tad shabby, but
well maintained, though they hang loosely on his gangly
frame.
He wears an old blue knit cap, which he quickly
removes as he shakes Luke's hand.
He's a man of few words,
his manner is painfully shy -- and he never smiles.
LUKE
Is there a young Tim?
OLD TIM
No.
LUKE
Well, then, why do they call you
"Old Tim?"
Pause.
OLD TIM
I'm old.
Harry steps forward, takes Luke's arm.
HARRY
Well, lots to do, so we'd better
get a move on...
CUT TO:
AUDITORIUM - DAY
Luke, Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger walk down the aisle toward
the screen.
Old Time lags a few steps behind.
At the
orchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit.
The
screen is a sea of repair patches.
Harry pats it.
Dust
flies.
HARRY
'Fraid this has seen better days.
Well, I was meaning to get a new
screen, anyway.
OLD TIM
I n-need me a new uniform.
Luke looks at Old Tim, then at Harry.
HARRY
(to Luke)
I promised him a new uniform when
we re-opened.
(to Old Tim)
And you'll get one, too.
LUKE
You know, I hate to bring this up,
but screens and uniforms and paint
and repairs are going to take
money, which I'm willing to bet
none of us has.
Silence from the group.
LUKE
I thought so.
Beat.
Harry brightens, clambers down the steps and races up
the aisle.
HARRY
Anyone want to see the projector?
CUT TO:
TWO CARBON ARCS
are squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fan
motor.
A puff of smoke, then -- BZZZZZZZZZTT -- LIGHT.
A
metal door is closed over the arcs.
PROJECTION BOOTH - DAY
Harry dances around to the other side of the projector and
adjusts the focus on the beam of light.
The others look on
as he gazes at the screen through the tiny window.
HARRY
Beautiful.
Bright and even from
edge to edge.
See for yourself.
The carbons sputter and die.
The light flickers out.
Harry
is crestfallen, turns off the motor.
HARRY
She's always been a bit tricky.
CUT TO:
BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
Mrs. Terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with a
ragged feather duster, a hopeless task.
Old Tim is on a
rickety ladder, replacing burned-out bulbs in the chandelier.
The orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of the
ladder.
Old Tim climbs down and catches his breath.
Mrs. Terwilliger
sneezes.
OLD TIM
Bless.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Thank you, Timothy.
They both stop their work and glance warily at the door
marked "OFFICE."
MRS. TERWILLIGER
(sotto)
What do you suppose they're talking
about?
OLD TIM
Dunno.
Boy's smart.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
(brightly)
Yes, he seems to be.
OLD TIM
Bad for us.
BIJOU OFFICE - DAY
Luke is poring over the ledger books, adding up figures on an
old manual adding machine.
LUKE
Um... Harry?
Did I ever keep the
books here?
HARRY
No, your mother did, then I did
after she passed.
LUKE
Well, I'm the first one to admit
that I don't know anything about
bookkeeping, but there are some
very interesting things in here.
He scans down a page.
LUKE
(reading)
"February 10, 1942.
Picture 'Ball
of Fire.'"
HARRY
(appreciatively)
Gary Cooper.
And Barbara Stanwyck.
Yowsa.
LUKE
(reading)
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six
admissions, receipts including
concessions, $84.75... plus one
fryer and two-dozen eggs."
He closes the book and looks expectantly at Harry.
HARRY
Yes?
LUKE
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
HARRY
Forty-two was a lean year around
here.
The war had just started...
you were gone less than a month...
and we were coming off a bit of a
drought as I recall.
Not everyone
could ante up the price of a
ticket, and a chicken's as good as
money if you ask me.
At that time,
it meant a lot to the folks around
here to be able to come to the
pictures.
LUKE
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
HARRY
(rhapsodically)
I know it's hard to believe, son,
but this place, this little place
this wasn't a theater then, this
was a palace!
Any man, woman,
child, you, me, it didn't matter,
you bought your ticket and you
walked in and you...
Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs.
HARRY
... you were in a palace.
It was
like a dream.
It was like heaven,
like you died and went to a palace
in heaven, that's what it was like.
And spotless, too.
Inspired, Harry stands, takes Luke by the arm.
HARRY
Come with me!
He drags him out of the office and into the lobby.
BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim watch as Harry leads Luke
through the lobby.
HARRY
(smiling)
Maybe you had problems and worries
out there, but once you came
through that door, they didn't
matter anymore.
In here, you were
safe.
Maybe it was just an escape
from reality, but... oh, god... it
was beautiful.
Harry leads Luke into the auditorium.
The car follows, but
Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim stay behind.
AUDITORIUM - DAY
Harry trots down the aisle and looks up at the screen.
HARRY
(exuberant)
Charlie Chaplin.
Keaton and Lloyd.
Swanson.
And later on, Clark Gable
and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy
Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart
and Becall and Judy and Mickey...
and Fred and Ginger.
He turns to Luke.
HARRY
(emphatically)
They... were... like... gods!
He points to the screen.
HARRY
And that... was the altar.
Would
you remember if I told you, we felt
lucky to be here, to have the
privilege of watching them?
(sadly)
This television thing.
Why would
you want to sit at home and watch a
little box with a little screen?
Because it's convenient?
Because
you don't have to get dressed and
put on a coat and a tie and a hat?
Because you can just... sit there?
How can you call that
"entertainment," all alone in your
living room?
Where are the other
people?
Where's the audience?
Harry comes over to Luke.
HARRY
(emphatically)
Where's the magic?
He stands behind Luke and whispers in his ear.
HARRY
I'll tell you.
In a place like
this, the magic is all around you.
All the time.
Everywhere.
In
every thing.
He turns Luke around and looks him in the eye.
HARRY
The trick... is to see it.
Pause.
LUKE
But I...
HARRY
Son, I think you loved the Bijou
even more than I did.
You've got
to remember that.
You've got to.
Still looking at Luke, Harry takes a step back, then slowly
walks up the aisle, disappearing into the lobby.
Luke walks down the aisle.
At the edge of the orchestra pit,
he stands looking up at the screen.
The orange tabby cat
MEOWS, and Luke glances toward it, standing onstage by the
edge of the screen.
They exchange looks as we
DISSOLVE TO:
LARDNER LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Doc Lardner is seated in an easy chair, his feet up, reading
Life magazine.
The radio is on, and Patti Page is singing
"The Tennessee Waltz."
There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up.
In the
entrance hall, the front door opens.
ADELE "DELLY" LARDNER
enters.
She's a strikingly beautiful woman in her late 20s.
She takes off a felt cap, and her long, auburn hair cascades
down.
ADELE
Dad?
LARDNER
Delly?
In here.
Lardner rises as Adele comes into the living room.
They
embrace warmly.
LARDNER
How'd it go?
ADELE
Not as bad as I thought it would.
I think I passed.
LARDNER
(kisses her forehead)
That's my girl!
(he hugs her again)
Did you...?
ADELE
No hiccups, which was good.
Who
wants an attorney who gets the
hiccups when she gets nervous?
("serious" lawyer voice)
"Your (hic!) honor, I (hic!)
object!"
They laugh.
LARDNER
I always told you, baby...
(taps her head)
... it's all up here.
Lardner gives her an extra squeeze, continues to hold onto
her just a bit too long.
Adele detects something amiss.
ADELE
Dad?
What is it?
Beat.
LARDNER
Well, it's...
Adele breaks away from him.
ADELE
(extreme concern)
Oh my god... who died?
CUT TO:
A GLASS OF WATER
on a kitchen table.
Offscreen, we HEAR A HICCUP.
Then
another.
Adele's hand reaches into frame.
WIDER
LARDNER KITCHEN - EVENING
Lardner stands over Adele, who is seated at the table,
holding the glass of water.
LARDNER
Drink slowly.
She raises the glass to her lips.
LARDNER
From the other side of the glass.
It's a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water,
but Adele accomplishes it with aplomb.
She waits for a
moment -- then hiccups again.
ADELE
I think (hic!) it's worse (hic!)
now.
LARDNER
That always used to work.
ADELE
Yeah, well it's not everyday you
get (hic!) news like this.
You're
sure he's (hic!) okay?
Other than
the (hic!) bump on the head?
LARDNER
(hedging)
Well...
ADELE
(hic!) Dad... (hic!)
Lardner sits at the table and takes Adele's hand.
LARDNER
He doesn't remember anything,
Delly.
Doesn't know how he got
here, doesn't remember his father,
the town, the Bijou, anyone...
ADELE
... including me.
Right?
(hic!)
LARDNER
I'm afraid not.
He looked right at
your picture without batting an
eye.
But it's probably temporary.
He got all the way to Lawson, so he
clearly knew who he was and what he
was doing until he hit his head.
I'm sure it'll all come back to
him.
It just takes a catalyst.
ADELE
You mean, (hic!) me?
LARDNER
It's possible.
Off Adele's thoughtful hiccuping, we
CUT TO:
CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
ADELE (O.S.)
When we were kids, my Dad was
mayor, and you and me and a bunch
of others used to come down here
all the time.
ON ADELE AND LUKE
looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage
room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the
window.
The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet.
ADELE
Of course, there was a lot more
room before they stuck the memorial
down here.
LUKE
(looks at the door)
How'd they get it inside?
ADELE
Through the door.
It comes apart.
She moves to the memorial.
Squinting, she examines its base.
ADELE
Your name's on here.
See?
Luke comes over.
ON THE BASE OF THE MEMORIAL -- LUKE'S NAME
ADELE
Right here.
"Albert Lucas Trumbo."
And all the others.
I knew them
all.
So did you.
We went to
school with most of them.
LUKE
It doesn't seem right, this being
down here.
It ought to be where
people can see it.
ADELE
After they commissioned it, no one
could ever agree on where to put
it.
The Methodists wanted it in
front of the Methodist Church, the
Presbyterians wanted it in front of
the Presbyterian Church, the city
council wanted it in the lobby of
City Hall.
Everyone finally got
tired of the fighting.
So they
stuck it down here.
He looks at her for a long moment.
There's an electricity
between them, and they both feel it.
LUKE
So, you're really gonna be a
lawyer?
ADELE
(suddenly defensive)
And why not?
LUKE
Whoa.
ADELE
(smiling)
Sorry.
You don't know how many
times I've heard that.
"A lady
lawyer?
Are you crazy?"
Like a
woman couldn't be as good a lawyer
as a man.
Or better, in fact.
LUKE
Have you always wanted to be a
lawyer?
ADELE
You... don't remember, but yes,
ever since I was a little girl.
LUKE
What did... what did I want to be?
ADELE
(gently)
Oh, well... I guess you... in high
school, you were a pretty good
first baseman.
And we were on the
debate team together.
But... I
think you were gonna run the Bijou.
You were brought up there, and you
loved it so much.
And I think you
knew how much the town needed a
place like that.
He turns away, rubs his head.
LUKE
I just wish I could remember some
of this.
He turns back to her.
LUKE
You don't have a boyfriend or
anyone... you know... like that?
ADELE
Actually, I was married.
For four
years.
But... well, we didn't fit
together.
I'm divorced now.
LUKE
I'm sorry.
ADELE
No, it's okay.
See, when two
people belong together, the other
person should be the... the key
that unlocks the rest of you... I'm
not making sense, am I?
LUKE
(moving toward her)
No, you are.
I know exactly what
you mean.
It's not that you're
missing something.
It's that the
other person gives something to
you... that you had all the time.
You just didn't see it until they
came along.
ADELE
(smiling)
Yeah...
Pause.
LUKE
We were in love... weren't we?
ADELE
(quietly)
Yes.
(then:)
Hic!
She instantly covers her mouth, but it's no good.
She has
the hiccups again.
LUKE
What was that?
ADELE
Nothing.
(hic!)
LUKE
Do you have the...
ADELE
I'm (hic!) fine.
Really.
(hic!)
Luke smiles and watches Adele as she makes the decision to
not struggle against the hiccups.
She has them, and that's
just the way it is.
LUKE
Were we going to get married?
ADELE
Eventually.
We were going to be
(hic!) engaged... when you came
back from (hic!) overseas...
He looks at her.
She's strikingly beautiful at this
particular moment and in this particular light -- hiccups and
all.
He moves closer to her.
She moves closer to him.
ADELE
(breathless)
... but you had to go... serve
(hic!) your country...
They kiss passionately.
She reaches up and puts her arms
around him.
He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly
realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.
ADELE
Hey... it worked.
And as she smiles and kisses him again we
DISSOLVE TO:
BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
It's very dark.
Luke is about to swing shut the heavy door,
when he looks down and sees
THE ORANGE TABBY CAT
shoot into the lobby, stopping in the middle of the floor.
It looks at Luke, and PURRS.
Luke closes the door and moves to the cat.
He crouches down
and pets it, and its back rises to meet his hand.
LUKE
Hey, fella.
So you live here, too,
huh?
How come Harry didn't mention
that?
The cat moves to the auditorium door, pausing to look back at
Luke.
Curiosity piqued, Luke follows the cat.
BIJOU BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
In the dim light, we SEE an old mop and pail, some dirty film
cans, and a large beat-up cardboard standee of "The Tramp"
with the legend, "Chaplin Short To-Day."
The cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door
at the end of a hallway.
Luke, following the cat, comes
around the same corner and looks at
THE DOOR.
Slightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as
the sound of Old Tim softly humming "It's a Long Way to
Tipperary."
Luke moves to the door and knocks.
LUKE
Um, Old Tim?
Sorry, it's late.
It's Luke.
Can I come in?
The humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open,
revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat,
stroking its fur.
OLD TIM
Found me.
LUKE
Yeah.
I hope you don't mind.
I
didn't know anyone lived here...
well, besides Harry.
And me.
Old Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow
him.
OLD TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT
The room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot,
which is perfectly made, military-style.
OLD TIM
Not used to visitors.
(gesturing)
Sit.
Old Tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to
the "kitchen" area -- a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny
icebox.
Luke sits in the chair, and Old Tim sits on the cot, facing
him.
Silence.
Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau.
ON THE PHOTO
It's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious and
handsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform.
The cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke.
He
rubs against his legs, purring.
Luke leans down to pet him.
LUKE
So I guess this fellow belongs to
you.
What's his name?
OLD TIM
Cat.
LUKE
Cat.
That's simple.
I like it.
(pets Cat)
Hi, Cat.
OLD TIM
(sudden change-of-subject)
We thought you was dead, you know.
(another new thought)
It's okay that I live here?
LUKE
Of course.
Pause, then suddenly.
OLD TIM
Do you think I'll get me a new u-u
uniform?
Luke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaks
more than a couple of words.
LUKE
I'll do everything I can.
Old Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached.
OLD TIM
T-t-thank you.
Thank you.
I... I
always... I always wanted to wear
my uniform from the Great War, but
your daddy, he always said no,
that's not an usher's u-u-uniform,
that's an army uniform and the
Bijou, she's not the army.
They
give me a medal, but I lost it in
the h-h-hospital.
I forget things
sometimes.
Since the w-w-war.
LUKE
Yeah... me too.
CUT TO:
PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY
It's a pretty typical bachelor's apartment.
The "SAND
PIRATES" poster leans up against a chair.
Pete's two boxes
of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table, the
empty bottle of Jack Daniels on top.
There's an insistent KNOCK at the door.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Appleton?
You
in there?
This is the Super, I
have the master key and I'm coming
in!
We HEAR the key in the lock and the door swings open,
revealing the building SUPER, 50s.
Behind him is Leo
Kubelsky.
They enter the room, and the Super sniffs the air.
LEO
You smell gas?
SUPER
Don't smell nothin'.
He must not
be dead in here.
LEO
Jesus.
SUPER
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Leo moves to the boxes and rummages through them.
He picks
up the empty bottle, examines it.
SUPER
You think he's drunk somewhere?
LEO
(under his breath)
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
SUPER
Well, his rent's past due and he
said to call you in case of an
emergency.
He lose his job or
somethin'?
LEO
(holding out his folding
money)
What's his rent?
SUPER
Thirty a month.
Leo peels off a hundred-dollar bill.
LEO
Here's three months rent, and a ten
spot for no more questions and to
keep an eye on his place.
Now, I
need a moment alone.
SUPER
(examining the bill)
Huh?
LEO
Take a hike.
Am-scray.
SUPER
Huh?
Oh, sure.
Just pull the door
shut when you leave.
The Super exits and Leo crosses to the phone and dials "O."
LEO
(into phone)
Police department.
I want to
report a missing person.
CUT TO:
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
ON A DOOR
It reads: "OFFICE OF THE MAJORITY COUNSEL - MR. ELVIN CLYDE"
AGENT WALTER SAUNDERS and AGENT STEVEN BRETT, both 30s and G-
men to the core, hustle into the office.
ELVIN CLYDE'S OFFICE - DAY
ELVIN CLYDE is 35, a small, thin-lipped, reptilian man in the
Roy Cohn mold.
He's on the phone at the moment.
CLYDE
(into phone)
You say you know nothing about it.
You say this, yet you offer no
proof.
How am I supposed to
believe you?
Clyde's SECRETARY knocks on the door, sticks her head in.
SECRETARY
Mr. Clyde?
Agents Saunders and
Brett need to see you.
CLYDE
(covering the phone)
You do see that I'm busy, do you
not?
SECRETARY
It's about Appleton.
Clyde's eyes brighten.
CLYDE
Tell them to come in.
(into phone)
I'll have to call you back.
I love
you too, Mother.
Saunders and Brett stride into the office.
SAUNDERS
We've got a situation developing...
CLYDE
(interrupting)
Will you take those goddamn hats
off?
They stop, shuck off their hats.
Saunders starts over again.
SAUNDERS
We've got a situation developing
out on the coast.
Appleton's just
been reported missing.
Clyde grins darkly.
CLYDE
This is good.
This is very good.
BRETT
Los Angeles Police Department
investigated.
His car's missing.
No signs of forced entry or
struggle at his apartment.
Clyde considers this for a beat, then:
CLYDE
You two are on this as of now.
Tell the LAPD their investigation
has been federalized on my order.
You find me this Appleton.
(leans back, smiling)
I want to see what this one has to
say.
CUT TO:
BIJOU OFFICE - DAY
Luke is sitting at the desk, making notes and adding up some
figures.
He puts his pencil down and rubs his eyes, then
looks up at
HARRY AND OLD TIM
who are sitting on the floor, going through piles of lobby
cards and folded one-sheets like little boys fascinated with
their baseball cards.
He shifts his gaze to
MRS. TERWILLIGER
who is straightening out and dusting the tops of the two or
three file cabinets in the corner of the office.
As she
works, she hums an old song, occasionally breaking into the
lyrics:
MRS. TERWILLIGER
(sings)
"The object of my affection, Can
change my complexion, From white to
rosy red..."
Luke takes a breath:
LUKE
Well...
HARRY
Yes?
LUKE
Between a new screen, paint,
plumbing for the concession stand,
and about a hundred other repairs
around the theater... it's going to
cost at least nine hundred dollars
to get the Bijou into shape to open
up.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Oh, my.
HARRY
(taken aback)
Nine hundred...
LUKE
And you have sixty-eight dollars
and thirty-seven cents in the bank.
Your only source of income are my
veteran's death benefit of forty
dollars a month, to which you're no
longer entitled since I'm alive,
and these ten dollar a month cash
deposits you make.
What are those?
HARRY
(glances at Old Tim)
They're...
OLD TIM
That's my r-r-rent.
LUKE
Oh.
HARRY
It's all my fault.
I was
neglectful and this is the price of
that.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Don't say that.
HARRY
Well, it's true.
Wanting to open
this place back up.
It's folly,
Irene, pure and simple.
Might as
well just call it what it is.
Off everyone's worried looks, we
CUT TO:
A TV SCREEN
It's tiny, with rounded corners, black-and-white, and a
hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow.
WIDER
LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Doc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television
set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of "Your Show
of Shows."
He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit
ears, steps back -- and is successful.
SID CAESAR And
IMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch,
and Lardner fairly roars with laughter.
He turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so,
the reception goes haywire.
He returns to the spot in front
of the TV, and the picture is perfect again.
The DOORBELL RINGS.
He's torn -- if he moves, the picture
will break up.
The doorbell RINGS again, and we HEAR Adele's
voice from upstairs:
ADELE (O.S.)
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him
in?
I'll be right down.
LARDNER
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
There's a KNOCK at the door.
LARDNER
(giving in)
Oh, hell...
He moves from his spot.
The reception goes bad, and he
marches to the door.
He opens it, and Luke is standing there, wearing a slightly
out-of-date coat and tie.
LARDNER
Evening, Luke.
LUKE
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Lardner freezes, staring at Luke.
LUKE
What's wrong?
LARDNER
(shaken from his reverie)
Uh, no... just seeing you standing
there, it reminded me... there's a
word for it...
LUKE
Oh, you mean the suit.
Harry kept
all my old clothes.
Fits okay, but
it's a little big.
Adele comes down the stairs.
Halfway down, she stops
suddenly and stares at Luke.
ADELE
Oh...
Awkward pause.
Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at
Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.
LUKE
I shouldn't have worn the suit.
Adele comes down the stairs.
ADELE
No... you were wearing that suit
the last time we went out before...
LUKE
Oh...
ADELE
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
LARDNER
That's it.
Deja vu.
Another awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other.
Lardner breaks it.
LARDNER
You kids off to the dance?
LUKE
Aren't you coming?
LARDNER
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
ADELE
(chidingly)
Besides, Daddy's still trying to
figure out how to get his new
television set working.
LARDNER
I had it, a minute ago...
He glances at the TV set.
The picture is suddenly crystal
clear.
LARDNER
... ooooh, It's back.
(encouraging them toward
the door)
Well, you kids have fun now...
Adele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights
with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living
room.
S-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the TV
carefully all the while.
The reception is staying perfect.
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business,
and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.
He stifles
his urge, and heads for his chair.
Gingerly, he sits.
Still
perfect.
Satisfied, he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up.
The picture goes completely haywire again.
LARDNER
Aw, crap.
BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
Luke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees
CAT
MEOWING at him from the sidewalk.
He holds the door open,
and Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the
auditorium.
Luke closes the door... and stops.
He HEARS
something, and so do we.
Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO.
The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby.
Luke turns toward the music, which is coming from the
auditorium.
The piano continues, building slightly in
volume.
He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively
pushes one open.
AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
Luke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering,
reflected light of
THE SCREEN.
The movie is "The Big Parade."
The old, decomposing nitrate
print is badly scratched and stained.
A young, beautiful
Renee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John
Gilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War.
Luke stares at the screen.
The look on his face is one of
bewilderment -- and awe.
ANGLE - THE PIANO
The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out-
of-tune.
But it really doesn't matter.
CLOSER
Mrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately.
She never takes
her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered
screen, except to close them when she is overcome with
emotion.
Even so, she never misses a beat.
HER HANDS
fairly dance upon the keys.
Stiff and wrinkled as they are,
they manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity
that the old piano can muster.
Luke is moved by what he's witnessing.
This is the magic...
WIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION
To the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old
Tim.
Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene
unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and
nose with a handkerchief.
He doesn't notice
LUKE
who looks up towards the projection booth.
CUT TO:
A BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT,
filling the frame.
We're looking directly into the beam of
light radiating from the projector.
PUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the
booth.
We come out of the beam and can just barely make out
the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the
projector.
WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's
face fills the screen.
He is watching the film; his eyes are
wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's
unfolding on the screen for the very first time.
The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES,
signaling the end of the reel.
Harry moves away from the
window.
PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
Never taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the
film comes to an end and flap!
falp!
falps!
out of the
projector.
He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs
apart, and the bright beam dies.
It's not the end of the
movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have.
Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades
them up.
This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back
pocket and blows his nose loudly.
He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up
reel and takes it down.
He's about to move away, when he
senses that he's not alone.
He looks over the projector to
see
LUKE,
standing there.
Their eyes meet.
Someone should say
something -- both men search for words.
Suddenly, Luke feels
very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's
interrupted a very private ritual.
Harry senses this.
Clutching the precious reel of film
tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles
warmly.
HARRY
Beautiful, wasn't it?
LUKE
(softly)
Yes.
HARRY
Well, son, I wish I could've shown
you more, but this is all that's
left.
Just this one reel that
never got sent back from a picture
we showed here a long time ago.
Nineteen twenty-five, to be
exact...
LUKE
Dad, I...
HARRY
(a tiny laugh)
Ha!
LUKE
... what?
HARRY
You know, since you've been back,
that's the first time you've called
me "Dad."
Father and son look at each other for a long moment --
searching each other's eyes.
Harry smiles a sort-of half-
smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the
rewind bench.
Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end
of the film onto an empty reel.
Slowly, he begins to turn
the crank, rewinding the film.
He stops and looks to where Luke was standing... but he's not
there.
ANGLE - PROJECTION BOOTH DOOR
Luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the
projection booth.
ONE LUKE
As he closes his eyes...
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
ON HARRY
In bed, sound asleep, snoring.
A HAND reaches into frame and
shakes him awake.
LUKE'S VOICE
Harry.
Dad, wake up.
Wake up.
Harry opens his eyes and looks up.
HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY
HARRY
(bleary)
Luke... what time is it?
LUKE
Six-thirty.
(smiles)
I thought we'd get an early start.
CUT TO:
CITY COUNCIL MEETING ROOM - DAY
A meeting of the Lawson City Council is in session, Mayor
Cole presiding.
Of the dozen council MEMBERS, we also
recognize Avery Wyatt and Roscoe Fitts.
VERA DWIGHT, the
council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading
the minutes of the last meeting.
VERA
Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and
Red Curtis seconded, that the
council form a committee to
investigate the adoption of a new
property taxation structure.
Motion carried, nine to two, one
abstention.
As Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry,
Old Time and Mrs. Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on
the unoccupied benches.
ERNIE
Thanks, Vera.
Ernie notices Luke and the trio.
ERNIE
Well, the chair notes the presence
this morning of Luke and Harry
Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou
staff.
Frankly, the chair notes
the presence of just about anyone
who ever finds their way into one
of these meetings.
G'moring,
folks.
LUKE & THE TRIO
Good morning.
ERNIE
I'm just guessing, but I bet it's
not a sudden interest in Lawson
politics that brings you all here.
Luke stands.
LUKE
Well, no...
(clears his throat)
I wanted to thank you all for
giving me such a nice welcome, and
making me feel at home.
But I...
we're... actually here on business
of a sort...
DALEY THORNHILL, 30s, the council parliamentarian, pipes up.
He's waving a copy of "Roberts Rules of Order."
DALEY
Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this
comes under the heading "New
Business," and this is not the
time...
ERNIE
I think we can make an exception
here, Daley.
DALEY
It'll need to be moved and
seconded.
Ernie rolls his eyes, then quickly and mechanically, without
inflection:
ERNIE
All right, motion to hear the
speaker out of order.
WYATT
Seconded.
ERNIE
Motion on the floor, discussion
open, discussion closed, all those
in favor signify by saying "aye."
ALL
Aye.
ERNIE
Opposed?
Hearing no opposition,
the motion is carried.
Pause.
Ernie turns to Luke and smiles.
ERNIE
Go ahead, son.
LUKE
Thanks.
Well, I'll make this short
and sweet.
The Bijou needs a lot
of repairs, and the truth of the
matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad
and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old
Tim, we can't possible afford them
all.
So, I'd like to ask your help
to... well, to scrounge around a
bit, and see if you have anything
that might help us out.
WYATT
What kinds of things are you
talking about?
LUKE
Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light
bulbs, yardage, and if you can't
come up with any of that, we can
use some old-fashioned elbow
grease.
Fitts leans forward.
FITTS
So... you do intend to fix the
place up after all?
LUKE
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I
think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit
more than it needs a super market.
And I think Lawson deserves the
Bijou.
There's not a lot that can
be done to help us get past the
pain we've all felt...
He looks at Harry and smiles.
LUKE
... but I think a good dose of
magic is as good a place as any to
start.
The council members MURMUR amongst themselves, then:
WYATT
(eagerly)
Motion to encourage the citizenry
of Lawson to help out the Bijou in
any way they can...
DALEY
(a subtle reminder)
... short of the allocation of city
funds...
WYATT
(agreeing)
... short of allocation of city
funds.
DALEY
(enthusiastically)
Seconded!
ERNIE
(brightly)
Motion on the floor, discussion
open, discussion closed, all those
in favor signify by saying "aye."
ALL
AYE!
ERNIE
Hearing no opposition, the motion
is carried!
Congratulations, Luke,
you got yourself a town to help you
out!
CUT TO:
CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - DAY
As the entire city council and the Bijou trio looks on, Luke
moves to the memorial and pulls down the huge piece of muslin
covering it.
Harry steps forward and gathers some of it in
his arms.
Ernie and Daley step forward and look up at the monument.
Ernie touches the names of his two sones inscribed on the
base of the monument.
ERNIE
(slowly)
You know, this really ought to be
out where people can see it.
Luke overhears this last, and as he smiles, he turns to
Harry, who brightens as he pulls a large section of the
muslin taut between his outstretched arms...
CUT TO:
MONTAGE - WITH SOME HARD-DRIVING BOOGIE-WOOGIE UNDER...
ANGLE - THE SCREEN
Harry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old
screen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke
and Adele, who are surrounded by a group of LITTLE KIDS,
watching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe.
Harry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen
drops down on Luke's head.
Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!!
He
raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who
scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.
AUDITORIUM - DAY
Old Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the
aisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten
carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris.
The men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just
as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to
Harry and grabs his end.
It's Carl Leffert.
A second later,
someone else grabs Old Tim's end.
BOB LEFFERT
has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his
hook.
He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow.
Luke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium.
BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
Harry, Stanton and Mrs. Terwilliger, with the help of Avery
Wyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies
and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls.
Then,
as Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and
Mrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall
paint and brushes.
Immediately, they all set to work
painting.
AUDITORIUM - DAY
Harry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to
a corner of the muslin.
It snaps into place, and voila --
new screen!
Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge,
standing below, applaud enthusiastically.
ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY
As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just
finished dusting off the piano.
She opens the keyboard cover
and trails her hand delicately over the keys.
She sits,
closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude
No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.
Even though the piano is a
bit out of tune, it's still beautiful.
As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.
Before
long, all eyes are on her.
Everyone's listening.
Transported.
After a moment, she stops.
Overcome.
Everyone applauds.
Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.
LUKE
That was beautiful.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
I taught you that.
LUKE
I can play the piano?
MRS. TERWILLIGER
(all fluttery)
Oh dear, yes.
You were an
excellent student, before all that
clarinet nonsense.
You loved
Chopin.
You used to call it
"heaven music."
"Teach me some
heaven music," you used to say.
She sits at the piano.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Sit.
Play with me.
LUKE
No, I...
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Some of it might come back to you.
Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left.
As she begins to
play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
That's good... that's good...
But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.
He's just
plunking bass notes.
But after a moment, the bass figures
he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's
transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie
woogie beat.
Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Really, Luke!
That's no way to
treat Mr. Chopin!
She stands and moves away.
Luke keeps playing, grinning
madly -- he's loving it!
After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs
over and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top
half to Luke's bass line.
OLD TIM
is tapping his foot to the beat.
He turns to Adele and says:
OLD TIM
I taught him that.
Off Adele cracking up.
THE MONTAGE CONTINUES...
MABEL'S DINER - DAY
Luke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter,
devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed
potatoes and gravy.
Luke's and Adele's hair is practically
white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are
stained with paint specks.
At the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably
with Bob Leffert.
She smiles at him warmly, then turns to
refill Harry's coffee cup.
Harry thanks her, then turns back
to the newspaper he's reading.
INSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN
Prominent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a
policeman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying
headline:
BOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S

DISSOLVE TO:
BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
Old Tim stands at attention, clutching the front door handle.
Mrs. Terwilliger, wearing a new dress, her hair newly and
perfectly coiffed, stands at the ready at her candy counter,
ready to sell tickets and refreshments.
Harry and Luke nervously pace the lobby.
Luke checks his
watch.
It's time.
He shakes Harry's hand, and nods to Old
Tim, who swings the door open...
ON THE DOOR
Immediately, PATRONS come flooding into the theater.
Luke
exchanges surprised glances with Harry -- then walks outside.
OUTSIDE THE THEATER
Luke comes out and looks down the block.
HIS POV
The line of PATRONS stretches two deep down the block and
around the corner.
Luke smiles.
Success.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- "FRED ASTAIRE - ROYAL WEDDING"
BIJOU LOBBY - DAY
Luke's selling tickets from behind the candy counter while
Mrs. Terwilliger sells refreshments to a line of CUSTOMERS.
Luke sells a ticket to a WOMAN, who moves away, revealing
BOB LEFFERT AND MABEL.
Luke smiles at Bob, who smiles back, his eyes now fairly
dancing with life.
He plunks down his admission, and Luke
hands him two tickets, which he takes with his hook-hand.
Mabel smiles at Luke, takes Bob's good hand, and they move
away, revealing A FARMER AND HIS WIFE, 50s.
The Farmer steps up and holds out a plucked chicken by its
neck.
Luke, surprised, jumps back -- then smiles, pulls off two
tickets, and exchanges them for the chicken.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL"
BEHIND THE SCREEN - NIGHT
The only light back here is the light of the movie, spilling
through the screen.
Luke is straightening up the backstage
storage area, when Adele taps him on the shoulder.
He turns,
and she throws her arms around his neck and kisses him.
She
hands him a paper to read.
ON THE PAPER
Luke angles it so he can read it by the light of the screen.
It says:
California State Bar Association
ADELE LOUISE LARDNER
has PASSED the State Bar examination.
Luke, thrilled, grabs Adele and picks her up, twirling her
around with joy.
He sets her down and kisses her
passionately.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"
PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
Harry is frantically threading the changeover projector.
The
bell on the running projector DINGS! once, signalling that
the reel is coming to an end.
Harry looks out the window at
the screen, then back to the task at hand.
BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
Luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster.
With a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring
how handsome the old place looks.
Old Tim, snappily attired
in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a
dustpan.
Mrs. Terwilliger is straightening up the candy
counter.
All is well.
Luke goes to the lobby's poster case.
He opens it, and
unfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for "SAND PIRATES" --
the same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment.
Methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the
case.
As Luke passes the auditorium doors, a MAN comes out of the
theater and crosses to the candy counter.
The door stays
open for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch
a bit of the picture.
AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
ON THE SCREEN - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"
The second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's
programmer.
It's nighttime in the desert.
A huge full moon
hangs over a B-movie soundstage version of the pyramids.
GREGORY, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is
engaged in a fierce swordfight with KHALID, the villain.
Pete takes a seat on the aisle near the door.
GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
You don't think you can win this,
do you?
Khalid lunges and draws Gregory's blood.
LUKE
(ala "Khalid")
"Ha!
I'd say I was winning!"
KHALID (ONSCREEN)
Ha!
I'd say I was winning!
Luke's look is "How did I know he was gonna say that?"
Onscreen, an EVIL HENCHMAN is sneaking up behind Gregory.
LUKE
"Gregory!
Look out!"
WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)
Gregory!
Look out!
Pete did it again.
Onscreen, Gregory turns and kills the Henchman, then quickly
dispatches Khalid.
He stands over the body, catches his
breath and says:
GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
It's all right, Rebecca.
WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)
Is he dead?
GREGORY (ONSCREEN)
Yes, Rebecca.
He's dead.
REBECCA, a beautiful American woman, comes into view and
takes our attention because she's being played by Sandra
Sinclair, Pete Appleton's ex-girlfriend...
ON LUKE
His mouth is gaping open.
He stares at the screen.
LUKE
(a whisper)
Sandra...?
Luke stands.
Confused, he stumbles backward, moving into the
lobby as the Man goes back into the auditorium with his
popcorn and the door closes.
BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
Luke is staring at the closed auditorium doors.
Old Tim and
Mrs. Terwilliger take note of his odd behavior.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Luke?
Dear, are you all right?
Without answering, Luke turns and runs to the poster case.
ON THE POSTER - "SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"
Forget the cheesy B-movie artwork.
As Luke looks at the
poster, it's clear that he's remembering something.
He looks
at the picture of Sandra -- then scans down to the credits
block at the bottom of the poster.
His eyes lock upon
WRITTEN BY PETER APPLETON
LUKE
My god... my god... no...
Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing
down on him...
... because he remembers...
PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
The warning bell DINGS! twice, but the changeover projector's
carbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying.
HARRY
(pleading)
Oh, baby, make your daddy happy...
Harry's trying to keep the projector going, as the previous
reel is about to end.
Given no other choice, he finally
gives the changeover projector a good swift kick.
It hums to life.
A perfect changeover.
Harry pets the
projector.
HARRY
You're a good girl.
No matter what
I say.
As he turns away, he feels a sudden, sharp pain in his left
arm.
Wincing, he grabs his arm, staggers back towards a
chair, and sits heavily.
He tries to clear his throat, but it dissolves into a
hacking, choking COUGH.
He tries to stand, but drops to his
knees, clutching his left arm harder than before.
HARRY
(in pain)
Oh, Jesus...
Harry falls to the floor, and as he does
THE FILM
breaks in the projector gate... flap!
flap!
flap!...
BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
Luke is still staring at the poster, lost in thought.
Offscreen, we HEAR the audience WHISTLING AND HOOTING in
reaction to the broken film.
Mrs. Terwilliger has been calling Luke's name, but he doesn't
come out of his stupor until Old Tim comes up behind him and
spins him around...
OLD TIM
Mr. Luke!
Luke stares wide-eyed at the old man.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
Luke!
Luke, something's wrong!
The film broke, and I can't raise
Harry on the house phone!
LUKE
(still dazed)
What?
MRS. TERWILLIGER
You've got to talk to them before
they tear the theater apart!
Finally, Luke pulls himself together, hears the audience
noise, and moves toward the auditorium doors.
AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
Amid the shouting and tossing of popcorn and debris, Luke
tries to regain his composure as he strides down the aisle
toward the stage.
LUKE
Come on, folks, this happens every
once in a while, just settle
down...
The crowd quiets down a bit.
Luke shields his eyes from the
light and calls up to the projection booth.
LUKE
Harry!
Harry, why don't you cut
the projector and bring up the
house lights?
No reaction.
Just the flickering beam of light.
LUKE
Harry?
Harry...?
Luke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into
the lobby.
The crowd goes silent...
BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT
Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger watch as Luke tears into the
lobby and makes for the balcony stairs...
BALCONY - NIGHT
... and charges between the seats and up the stairs to the
projection booth.
PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
Luke bursts in the sees Harry on the floor.
He rushes over
and kneels down next to him.
LUKE
Jesus...
HARRY
(with difficulty)
The film broke...
LUKE
I know, I know... keep still.
A MAN pops his head into the projection booth door.
LUKE
(to the man)
Get Doc Lardner.
CUT TO:
HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Harry is in bed, eyes closed.
Doc Lardner has a stethoscope
to his chest.
He leans up and pats Harry's hand.
He stands and comes over to Luke and Adele, who are near the
door.
Just outside, angling for a view into the room, are
Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger.
LARDNER
It's a pretty massive heart attack.
His lungs have filled with fluid,
and, well... it seems as though his
body is just... shutting down.
LUKE
Can we get him to the hospital?
LARDNER
Even if we could, and the move
didn't kill him, there'd be very
little we could do there that we
can't do here.
(puts his hand on Luke's
shoulder)
I'm sorry.
Harry's eyelids flutter.
HARRY
(weakly)
Did you... did you...
Luke rushes to Harry's side and takes his hand.
LUKE
I'm here.
HARRY
Did you... did you...
LUKE
Did I what?
HARRY
(irritated)
Did you fix the damn film?
It
broke in the last reel.
LUKE
I know.
Everyone went home.
We
offered them refunds.
HARRY
Anybody take it?
LUKE
A few.
HARRY
(closes his eyes)
Vultures...
Luke smiles.
HARRY
I'm not happy about this, mind you,
but if I have to go, at least I'm
going in my own bed, the same bed
my Lily died in, and... knowing
that my son is alive.
That's not
too shabby, is it?
LUKE
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
HARRY
Don't tell me, I know about these
things.
I've seen it before.
It's
all right.
It's... all right.
You're here.
Oh, God, I love you,
son.
Harry smiles.
Luke kisses his hand and leans up, whispering
in Harry's ear:
LUKE
And I love you... Dad.
Harry smiles faintly, looks at Luke.
He nods, then closes
his eyes.
HARRY
(softly)
Oh, so... much... lighter...
Slowly, Harry exhales.
His face relaxes, completely at
peace.
He doesn't breathe again.
Luke looks at Harry's face for a moment.
Then as the tears
well up, he leans over and ever-so-gently places a kiss on
Harry's forehead.

MABEL'S DINER - DAY
ON SHERIFF ELDRIDGE,
making short work of a steak and eggs.
As he powers down his

their dark suits and hats, enter the diner.
They take note
of Eldridge, and come over.
SAUNDERS
Are you the sheriff?
ELDRIDGE
And I got the uniform to prove it.
SAUNDERS
I'm Special Agent Walter Saunders,
this is Special Agent Steven Brett,
FBI.
May we have a word with you?
They flash identification, which Eldridge notes.
ELDRIDGE
(gesturing)
Please, sit.
They sit across from Eldridge.
As Saunders speaks, Agent
Brett pulls a photo from his coat pocket.
SAUNDERS
A couple of days ago, a county
flood control maintenance crew
pulled a car out of the Lawson Wash
ocean outlet.
They checked its
registration, and when the owner
was identified, they notified us.
Agent Brett slides the photo toward Eldridge.
ON THE PHOTO
It's Peter Appleton -- Luke.
ELDRIDGE
(smiling)
Well, that'd be Luke Trumbo.
Looks
like you boys've solved a little
mystery we've had going on for a
few months.
BRETT
Sir, that's a photo of man named
Peter Appleton.
He's been missing
from Los Angeles for close to three
months now.

Eldridge glances at Agent Saunders, who stares at Pete
impassively.
ELDRIDGE
Well, no, but these gentlemen would
like to get some answers...
PETE
I don't know what else to tell you.
I wasn't hiding out.
I hit my head
and I didn't remember anything
until a few days ago.
SAUNDERS
Now that you remember who you are,
were you planning on telling anyone
your true identity?
PETE
I already have.
SAUNDERS
Who?
PETE
My girlfriend.
If she still is...
SAUNDERS
(checking his notebook)
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
PETE
(ironic smile)
No.
No, not Miss Sinclair.
I'm
talking about Adele Lardner.
Agent Saunders glances at Eldridge.
ELDRIDGE
The doctor's daughter.
She was
Luke Trumbo's sweetheart.
Pause.
SAUNDERS
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to
believe you're holding something
back, and that just rubs me the
wrong way.

Sir, are you a communist?
PETE

No.
Absolutely not.

The FBI can't arrest you, because
you haven't done anything wrong.
PETE
Well, that's a relief.
I
understand they usually don't let
that stop them.
LEO
However... you're gonna be
subpoenaed to testify before the
Un-American Activities Committee
when they open hearings in Los
Angeles.
Now, if you play ball and
tell them what they want to hear,
they'll clear you.
PETE
And I won't be a communist anymore.
LEO
Exactly.
PETE
So it doesn't make any difference
that I'm not one now, and have
never been one.
Leo stands and walks to the window.
LEO
Kid, don't get philosophical with
me.
This is a game, but it's not
your game.
You play by their
rules, or they'll ruin you.
And
they have the power to do it.
ADELE
Doesn't it bother anyone that this
is a perversion of democracy?
Leo turns to her and smiles.
His tone is charmingly matter-
of-factly, not condescending in the least.
LEO
Darling, don't kid yourself.
We
don't have a "democracy" in this
country.
The Declaration of
Independence?
The Constitution?
These are pieces of paper with
signatures on 'em.
And you know
what a piece of paper with a
signature is?
It's a contract.
And you know what a contract is?
Something that can be re-negotiated
at any time.
It just so happens
that the House Un-American
Activities Committee is re-
negotiating the contract this time
around.
Leo takes out a cigarette, lights it.
LEO
Next time, it might be the FBI.
The time after that, it might be
the President.
But it'll always be
someone.
Count on it.
PETE
That's not the country Luke fought
for.
LEO
Lest we forget, Peter, your own
military career was somewhat less
illustrious than Luke's.
PETE
It's wrong, Leo.
LEO
Peter, don't let that stop you all
of a sudden.
Leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it to
Pete.
LEO
Here.
When you're called, read
this to them.
Just tell the
bastards what they want to hear,
and we can all get on with our
lives.
There's a knock at the door.
Leo opens it.
Standing there
is a small MAN wearing a serious suit and an even more
serious fedora.
THE MAN
Peter Appleton?
PETE
(standing)
You found him.
The Man reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a blue
backed folded document, which he hands to Pete.
As he does,
a FLASH lights the room.
At the door, a pair of PHOTOGRAPHERS and a NEWSREEL CAMERAMAN
are jockeying for position.
Pete rolls his eyes.
THE MAN
Peter Appleton, you are hereby
subpoenaed to appear as a witness
before a special session of the
House Committee on Un-American
Activities.
You are to appear in
Los Angeles, California, at the
Biltmore Hotel, at the date and
time specified herein.
Pete takes the subpoena.
There's an awkward moment, as the
newsreel camera is still rolling.
Pete cradles the subpoena
like an Oscar statuette and smiles into the lens.
PETE
("on")
This is a great honor.
I'll
treasure this always.
Thank you.
CUT TO:
THE SUBPOENA
in a partially-packed suitcase.
WIDER
PETE'S BEDROOM - DAY
Pete is sitting in a chair, reading the statement Leo gave
him.
PETE
(softly)
"I, Peter Appleton, do hereby
renounce my membership in the
American Communist Party, and by
way of purging myself of my
indiscretion, wish to provide the
following names of fellow members
to this committee, so that those
persons may have the opportunity to
do as I have done..."
He scans down the page.
It's a long list.
PETE
Jesus...
He HEARS a "meow!" And turns to look.
CAT
is standing in the bedroom doorway.
He folds up and pockets
the list.
PETE
Old Tim?
After a moment, Old Tim appears in the doorway, wringing his
knit cap in his hands.
OLD TIM
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
PETE
Sure.
Come on in.
I was just
packing.
Pete stands, gestures Old Tim to the chair, as he sits on the
bed.
PETE
Please, sit.
OLD TIM
Thanks.
He sits.
Pause.
OLD TIM
They'll come back, you know.
They'll all c-c-come back.
PETE
The customers?
I don't know...
OLD TIM
They will.
They w-w-will.
Pete turns to Old Tim, fixes him in the eye.
PETE
Tim, I have to tell you something.
OLD TIM
Oh.
PETE
It's about me.
OLD TIM
Oh.
Pause, as Pete gathers courage and tries to find the words.
PETE
I'm... I'm not Luke.
Luke is dead.
He died in the war.
He's not
coming back, and I'm not him.
I
don't even belong here.
This whole
thing started out as an accident,
and that's all it is.
An accident.
OLD TIM
Oh...
PETE
My name isn't Luke.
It's Peter.
Peter Appleton.
Old Tim stands and looks askance at Pete.
Pause.
OLD TIM
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know
that?
PETE
(taken aback)
I thought you...
OLD TIM
I know more than you give me c-c-
credit, that's for sure.
Don't you
see, it don't m-m-matter who you
are?
All that matters is what you
g-g-gave us.
And you can't take
that away now.
You're wrong, Peter
Appleton.
You do belong here.
He leans down to Pete.
OLD TIM
You hafta give us back the B-B-
Bijou.
Old Tim straightens up, nods at Pete.
Then, silently, he
picks up Cat and exits.
DISSOLVE TO:
BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM (LOS ANGELES) - DAY
The House Committee on Un-American Activities has effectively
taken over the Grand Ballroom of this magnificent hotel, and
the joint is packed to the rafters.
Members of the AUDIENCE
crane their necks to see out into the hallway, from where the
witnesses will be entering.
The COMMITTEE MEMBERS are seated at their dais, brightly lit
by the dozens of newsreel and TV lights.
Elvin Clyde is
seated at the far right.
Dead center of the dais is the
Chairman, CONGRESSMAN T. JOHNSTON DOYLE of Wisconsin, a
husky man in his late 50s.
He SLAMS his gavel down several
times and the room goes quiet -- the talking stops, and the
cameras start whirring.
LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY
Adele's in a chair, eyes glues to the TV set.
Mrs.
Terwilliger and Old Tim sit on the couch, watching
attentively.
Doc Lardner's in a straight-backed chair at a jaunty angle to
the set, holding the rabbit ears uncomfortably high aloft.
ADELE
That's perfect, Dad.
DOYLE (ON TV)
The committee and the chamber will
come to order.
Lardner forces a smile at Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim.
LARDNER
(sweating and wincing)
This television's a grand little
invention, isn't it?
BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
DOYLE
The agenda for this morning's
special session of the House
Committee on Un-American Activities
shows a number of witnesses, and
I'd like to admonish those that are
here to view the testimony of our
first witness to keep order at all
times, or this chamber will be
closed.
I'm referring especially
to the ladies and gentlemen of the
press.
I hope that's clear.
Beat.
Doyle scans the room.
He clearly means business.
DOYLE
Call Peter Appleton.
All eyes and cameras swing toward the door.
ON PETE
As he enters the chamber, dozens of FLASHBULBS fire as every
eye and every camera follows him silently to his seat.
As he
sits, he glances behind him.
PETE'S POV
Leo Kubelsky is sitting in the front row of spectators.
He
smiles and nods at Pete.
Pete doesn't acknowledge him, and turns back.
DOYLE
The witness will please stand and
raise his right hand.
Pete does as instructed.
DOYLE
Do you swear that the testimony you
are about to give before this
committee of the United States
House of Representatives will be
the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you
god?
PETE
I do.
DOYLE
Be seated and state your full name
and place of residence for the
record.
PETE
Peter Kenneth Appleton.
Hollywood,
California.
DOYLE
The chair notes that you are
appearing without the benefit of
counsel today, Mr. Appleton.
We
certainly hope this means that you
intend to be fully forthcoming with
this committee?
PETE
(faint smile)
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
DOYLE
Now, we're informed that you have a
statement you'd like to read, is
that correct?
PETE
(innocently)
A statement?
Doyle and Clyde exchange glances.
DOYLE
Yes.
A prepared statement.
PETE
Um... no.
I don't have a statement
at this time.
Pete turns in his chair and winks at Leo.
Leo rolls his eyes
and shakes his head.
LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY
Adele breathes a sigh of relief.
MRS. TERWILLIGER
I think he's doing very well, so
far.
ADELE
They haven't called out the dogs
yet.
DOYLE (ON TV)
Very well then, the questions will
be asked by the Majority Counsel,
Mr. Clyde.
The TV shot swings to see Elvin Clyde.
He puts on his
glasses and fixes Pete with an oily grin.
ADELE
I spoke too soon.
CLYDE (ON TV)
Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank
you Mr. Appleton, for appearing
today.
BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
CLYDE
Mr. Appleton, you mention that your
home is Hollywood, California.
But
isn't it true that for the last
several months, you've made your
home in a town called Lawson,
California?
PETE
Sir, that is true.
CLYDE
Mr. Appleton, do you know an
"Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
PETE
Luke Trumbo?
We never met.
But
I'd like to think I know him.
CLYDE
Is that because you were
masquerading as Luke Trumbo while
you were in Lawson?
PETE
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things
around.
I wasn't masquerading.
Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man
who gave his life for his country.
I just... happen to look a little
bit like him.
That's all.
CLYDE
(referring to notes)
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was
reported missing in action and is
presumed dead.
I also see that you
were posted stateside during the
war.
Fort Dix?
PETE
Yes, sir.
CLYDE
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to
see you came through it all right.
A few spectators titter.
MABEL'S DINER - DAY
Mabel and Bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packed
diner.
CLYDE (ON RADIO)
Now, I see that you've been running
a movie theater in Lawson called
"The Bijou," is that also true?
PETE (ON RADIO)
Yes sir.
But I didn't go to Lawson
to run The Bijou, that was... that
was something that just happened.
You see, I was involved in an
accident in Lawson, and I spent
some time recovering there.
BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
Clyde holds up copies of the Los Angeles Examiner and Los
Angeles Times with Pete's picture on the front page.
CLYDE
Anyone who reads the newspaper is
quite familiar with your...
"accident," Mr. Appleton.
An
accident which, conveniently, came
hard upon your dismissal from
United Pictures.
Tell us, this
"accident" of yours, are we given
to understand that it affected your
memory?
PETE
Yes.
CLYDE
And what is the state of your
memory now?
Beat.
Pete smiles.
PETE
I'm sorry, what was the question?
The audience LAUGHS.
Clyde nods at Pete, forces a tight
smile.
CLYDE
We... appreciate... your little
note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but
this is a very serious matter, and
it merits your fullest attention.
(back to business)
That state of your memory now, Mr.
Appleton?
WYATT'S HARDWARE - DAY
Avery Wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio.
Spencer
comes around the paint aisle, wiping his hands on his apron.
He moves to the radio and listens solemnly.
PETE (ON RADIO)
Sir, are you referring to the fact
that I was suffering from amnesia,
and I've since recovered my memory?
BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
CLYDE
(impatient)
I'm interested in knowing if you
remember things you did in your
past, or if they've been
conveniently "blotted out" as a
result of your "accident."
PETE
(smiling)
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
CLYDE
Good.
Good.
(holds up a piece of
paper)
Now, I hold in my hand a
photostatic copy of the attendance
roster for the "Bread Instead of
Bullets Club" of the University of
California, Los Angeles, dated
October 11, 1935.
A copy of this
paper is before you, Mr. Appleton.
Do you recognize it?
Pete looks on the table and finds the roster.
He's surprised
to see it.
PETE
Yes... yes, I do.
CLYDE
Referring to line thirty-seven of
the document, does your printed
name and signature appear there?
PETE
Yes it does.
CLYDE
Mr. Appleton, please tell this
committee what was the nature and
purpose of the "Bread Instead of
Bullets Club?"
PETE
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what
I knew then, or do you want to know
what I know now?
They're two
different things?
CLYDE
Start with what you knew then.
PETE
Well, I'd direct the attention of
counsel and committee to line
thirty-six of the document, and the
name printed and signed there.
CLYDE
We see it.
For the record, it
reads "Lucille Angstrom."
What's
the point of this?
PETE
Well, that's what I knew then.
Or
who I knew, I should say.
You see,
I was trying to court Miss
Angstrom.
I went to the meeting to
impress her.
CLYDE
(grinning)
Are you asking this committee to
believe that you attended a meeting
of a communist party front
organization in order to impress a
girl?
PETE
(slyly)
Well, if you'd seen Miss
Angstrom...
The audience LAUGHS.
Doyle BANGS his gavel.
PETE
You asked for the truth.
That's
the truth.
I had no idea what the
meeting was about.
I just sat
through it so I could be near her.
I'm sure even a Majority Counsel
like yourself is familiar with the
concept of impressing a girl.
The audience LAUGHS.
Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who BANGS
his gavel.
DOYLE
Chamber will come to order.
Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete.
CLYDE
All right, Mr. Appleton.
That was
what you knew then.
What do you
know now?
PETE
(takes a deep breath)
Well, I know that I lost my job
because of one meeting I went to
when I was a kid in college.
I
know that I've been branded a
communist, which I'm not, but even
if I was, it shouldn't matter, or
what do we have a Bill Of Rights
for?
CLYDE
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being
non-responsive...
A few members of the audience APPLAUD.
As Pete speaks, their
numbers grow.
PETE
(passionately)
I know that a lot of good, honest,
decent people, people that I
consider my true friends, feel
betrayed by me, not because of who
and what I am, but because of what
you say I am!
I know that I...
Doyle BANGS his gavel several times.
Pete stops and the room
falls quiet.
DOYLE
(emphatically)
Mr. Appleton, you will respond to
the questions of this committee
without elaboration or
speechmaking, or the chair will
find you in Contempt Of Congress.
You will not be warned again, is
that clear?
(he lets this sink in,
then)
Continue, Mr. Clyde.
CLYDE
(looking down at his desk)
Mr. Appleton...
Clyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at Pete.
CLYDE
Are you now, or have you ever been,
a member of the communist party?
PETE
No, sir.
CLYDE
(holding up the roster)
Are you refuting this evidence and
your previous testimony?
PETE
I'm not refuting anything.
CLYDE
Yet you're contradicting yourself.
You earlier testified that you
attended a meeting of a communist
party-run organization, yet you
just said, under oath, that you
were not now -- nor ever -- a
member of the communist party.
PETE
That's not a contradiction at all,
sir.
I went to the meeting, but I
didn't go as a member.
CLYDE
Well, then, as what did you go?
Beat.
Pete smiles.
PETE
I'm a little hesitant to say.
DOYLE
The witness need not be hesitant to
say anything before this committee,
as long as it's the truth.
Pete shifts in his chair, then leans into the microphone.
PETE
Well, I went as... a horny young
man.
The chamber erupts in LAUGHTER.
Even the other COMMITTEE
MEMBERS are laughing, except Clyde and Doyle, who BANGS his
gavel vigorously.
SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY
Sheriff Eldridge and Daley Thornhill listen to the hearing on
the radio.
They are both laughing at Pete's last comment.
ELDRIDGE
Damn, he don't wanna spar with
these boys.
They'll eat him alive.
BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
The room settles.
Doyle wags his finger accusingly at Pete.
DOYLE
(angry)
Mr. Appleton, you are making light
of a legally constituted committee
of the United States Congress.
Believe you me, you do not want to
incur our wrath.
PETE
(matter-of-factly)
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention
of making light of this committee.
And I have no intention of
incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman.
I have a few friends who have
already incurred your wrath.
They've sent me letters from jail.
CLYDE
(interrupting)
Mr. Chairman!
Mr. Chairman, the
witness is making another speech.
I would ask that Mr. Appleton be
admonished...
DOYLE
(indifferent)
Mr. Appleton, there is no question
before you at this time, but I'm
sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more
prepared, and if you'd like to
either answer them or plead the
Fifth Amendment, we can at least
get on with the business of this
committee.
LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY
Adele moves to within inches of the TV screen.
ADELE
Tell them Pete.
Tell them...
PETE (ON TV)
(wrestling with this)
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it,
the Fifth Amendment pertains to
self-incrimination, and I can't
incriminate myself because I've
done nothing wrong.
Besides,
incrimination is why you have Mr.
Clyde working for you.
CLYDE (ON TV)
Mr. Chairman...
BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
Clyde is still protesting, but Doyle waves him off.
DOYLE
Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what
is your intention?
Pete's sweating under the lights.
He's bluffed his last
bluff, and he's on the ropes.
He reaches into his pocket...
and takes out the prepared statement.
LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY
PETE (ON TV)
I... Mr. Chairman, I have a
prepared statement I'd like to
read...
ADELE
Her hand goes to her mouth.
ADELE
Oh, Pete.
No...
BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY
DOYLE
Go ahead, Mr. Appleton.
PETE
(slowly reading)
"I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..."
He stops suddenly.
Pause.
DOYLE
Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Appleton?
PETE
I... I need a drink of water.
DOYLE
Go ahead, son.
Pete fills a glass from the pitcher.
Nervously, he spills a
bit, and is splashes onto his coat.
As some of the
spectators chuckle, Pete brushes the water off.
He reaches
into his pocket, and pulls out Adele's copy of the
constitution.
The cover is wet.
He wipes it off and sets it
down on the table.
He takes a sip of water.
Looks at the book.
Picks it up.
Pete's terrified, but in control.
He speaks slowly -- he's
making this up and thinking it out as he goes.
PETE
Mr. Chairman... there's... another
Amendment... that I'd like to
invoke at this time, but it's not
the Fifth Amendment.
I wonder if
you're familiar with it.
DOYLE
Mr. Appleton, you will...
He opens the book and reads, tentatively at first.
PETE
"Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; or abridging the
freedom of speech, or of the press;
or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a
redress of grievances."
Pause.
Silence in the room.
ADELE
She's smiling at the TV.
Her eyes are filled with tears.
PETE
He looks up at Chairman Doyle.
Now fully confident.
PETE
That's the First Amendment, Mr.
Chairman.
It's the backbone of
this nation.
It's everything that
gives us the potential to be right
and good and just -- if only we'd
live up to that potential.
It's
what gives me the right to sit in
this chair and say my piece before
this committee without fear.
It's
the most important part of the
contract that every citizen has
with this country.
And even though
this contract...
(he holds up the book)
... the Constitution and the Bill
of Rights -- even though they're
just pieces of paper with
signatures on them -- they're the
only contracts we have that are
most definitely not subject to
renegotiation.
Not by you, Mr.
Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde,
not by any member of this committee
-- or anyone else -- ever.
Pin-drop silence in the room.
Pete scans the faces of the
panel.
All betray anger.
ON LEO
He can't help but smile and nod appreciatively.
PETE
And when you get right down to it,
that's really all I have to say to
this committee.
Good morning.
And with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared
statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and
walks toward the door.
The cameras swing with him, and
FLASHBULBS fire like machine guns.
Doyle BANGS his gavel
insistently.
DOYLE
The witness will resume his seat!
Did you hear me?!
You are not
excused, Mr. Appleton!
And then, slowly, APPLAUSE builds in the chamber, reaching a
crescendo as Pete reaches the door and exits.
CLYDE
Mr. Chairman!
Mr. Chairman...!
DISSOLVE TO:
LIMO (MOVING) - DAY
Leo and Pete sit side-by-side in silence for a moment.
Leo
breaks it.
LEO
That was quite a show you gave them
today.
We shoulda sold tickets.
PETE
I'm not sorry for what I said.
LEO
No, of course not, why should you
be sorry?
You're the new Peter
Appleton.
You exercised your
rights as a solid citizen, first
amendment, freedom of speech, all
that.
Very noble.
They sit in silence again for a moment until Leo reaches into
his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he
opens and offers to Pete.
LEO
Cigarette?
PETE
No thanks.
Leo takes one for himself and lights up.
Pete takes off his
hat and nervously scratches his head.
LEO
When'd you quit smoking?
PETE
Luke didn't smoke.
LEO
Oh, I see.
But you're not Luke.
You're Peter Appleton, the picture
writer.
PETE
(laughs)
Not any more.
LEO
Why not?
PETE
Leo, you were in there, you saw
what I did.
You think they're
gonna let me write pictures?
Hell,
they're probably gonna throw my ass
in jail.
LEO
(with a smile)
Not at all.
PETE
Besides, I don't even know if I
want to write anymore.
LEO
(snickering)
What, you're going to go back to
that hick town and run the
projector and marry the doctor's
daughter?
But before Pete can answer...
LEO
Peter, I'm an agent.
I buy lunches
and get deals made for guys like
you.
That's what I do.
You're a
writer.
You write pictures.
That's what you do.
And trust me,
you'll be back doing it again
tomorrow morning.
PETE
What do you mean?
LEO
Kid, you gave them what they
wanted.
This committee, it feeds
on names.
The more names, the
better.
But for some high-profile
witnesses, like yourself, any name
will do.
PETE
Leo, I didn't give them the names.
I wouldn't do that.
LEO
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille
Angstrom" isn't a name?
Pete freezes.
He slowly turns to Leo.
PETE
(warily)
Her name was right there in front
of them.
They gave it to me, I
didn't give it to them.
LEO
Well, that's not what they think.
PETE
Leo, she was... she was a girl I
knew in college...
LEO
You should keep track of your old
school chums.
Turns out she
eventually joined the communist
party.
(takes a puff)
On top of which, she's Lucy
Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she
happens to be a writer for "Studio
One" on CBS.
PETE
(realization dawning)
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
LEO
So, our lawyers had a talk with the
Committee's lawyers.
That Elvin
Clyde fella won't be too happy
about it, but we cut a deal.
They cleared you -- and they're
gonna thank you publicly for your
testimony purging yourself.
PETE
Thank me publicly?
For what?
For
ruining this woman's life?
LEO
(dismissive)
Climb down off your cross.
They
already knew about her.
(off his look)
She was subpoenaed six months ago!
Who the hell do you think named
you?
Pete is dumbstruck.
He slumps in his seat, ashen.
LEO
(he couldn't be happier)
All of which means... "Ashes To
Ashes" is gonna be made, and you've
got your job back.
(takes a puff)
Congratulations, kid.
Pete's breathing shallowly, on the verge of tears or
screaming -- or both.
PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY
The door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullen
Pete, carrying his suitcases and hat.
He sets them down and
goes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from
the studio have been gathering dust these last three months.
SUPER
(handing him a key)
Here's a new key for ya.
That Mr.
Kubelsky, he's got you paid up
through this month.
You got one
swell friend there.
The Super moves to the door and turns back.
SUPER
Good to have you back, Pete.
He exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out
the tin-toy fire truck.
Distractedly, Pete puts the toy back
in the box and replies too late:
PETE
Thanks...
He sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat.
As he
does, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat
pocket and falls open to the floor.
Pete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the
inscription inside the front cover catches his eye:
TO DELLY,
THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS.
LOVE, LUKE
Pete closes the book.
He thinks for a moment, then glances
over at the phone.
He picks it up and dials "0."
PETE
Western Union, please.
CUT TO:
