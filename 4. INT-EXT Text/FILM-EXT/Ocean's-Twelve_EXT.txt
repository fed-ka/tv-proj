A YOUNG MAN takes delivery of the flowers and carries them
through the rear of the store to the display area up front.
We stay on the tulips as we hear the following conversation:
CUSTOMER
Wow. How do they do that?

OWNER
It's an accident. It means the
flower developed a virus early
in the bulb stage. The flaws
create the unusual coloring.
CUSTOMER
Can you arrange something for me
with those?
OWNER
Of course. What kind of price range
are you looking for?
Now we SEE the customer: TESS.
TESS
Well, it's for my parent's
anniversary. They don't know I'm
coming. I just want it to be
beautiful. Can you just do whatever
you think looks best?
OWNER
I'll need a few minutes.
TESS
Take your time, please. And thank
you.
The Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the
flowers are arranged. Tess walks around, looking at the rest
of the store.
Tess looks out the window. A black sedan is pulling up at the
curb.
OWNER
That should be some surprise.
TESS
Which?
OWNER
For your parents.
TESS
Oh. Yes. I hope so.
One of the POWER TWINS gets out of the driver's side door and
crosses in front of the car. Tess starts moving away from the
window.

Which one is it?
TESS
I'm sorry?
OWNER
Anniversary.
TESS
Oh. Fortieth
OWNER
Wow. Okay. I think I have an idea.
Something classic.
The Power Twin opens the rear passenger side door, revealing
TERRY BENEDICT.
Tess turns away from the window.
TESS
Do you have a bathroom?
OWNER
Straight back, on the left. It's
unisex.
TESS
Thank you.
Tess scurries to the back.
OWNER
(to Tess, a caveat)
It's unisex!
Tess flies past the bathroom and heads for the back door. She
pushes through it and runs right into Power Twin No. 2.

TESS
Be careful, Danny. Please.
DANNY
How's work?
TESS
It's the same. I'm distracted.
DANNY
I'm sorry.
TESS
It's not your fault.
DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.)
I keep trying to figure out what I
did wrong. How did he find us?
Tess can't bring herself to tell Danny the truth, that it was
entirely her fault.

Don't get soft on us. Don't make

I won't.
Danny and Rusty nod. Okay.

Linus cools his heels.
Danny and Rusty emerge from inside.
DANNY
Is that your idea of making a

RUSTY
Her terms were scandalous. And we
were lucky to get them after what
you said.
DANNY
The deal was this close to being
blown.
LINUS
"Deal?"
What "deal?"
Danny and Rusty just look at him.
LINUS (cont'd)
I know what you guys are doing.
Danny and Rusty exhange looks. What?
LINUS (cont'd)
Look. That...person had too many
cupcakes.
They just keep staring at him.
LINUS (cont'd)
I was playing along.
RUSTY
"Playing along!"
DANNY
You called her mother a whore.

I have no idea what you're talking

DANNY
You get the tattoo removed?
RUSTY

Rusty stops walking. Danny continues, then notices he is
alone. He turns back to Rusty.
DANNY
What are you doing?
RUSTY
We're here.
DANNY
Oh.
As Danny and Rusty enter the hotel, Rusty trips on the steps.
DANNY
Nice.
Rusty bends down to look at the step. He notices that one
tile on the edge of the stop has lost some mortar. He touches
the tile and watches the lip rise up and down, up and down,
as though it's cantilevered.

RUSTY
Exactly.
SAUL
It took three hundred guys two
years to do that. You're crazy.
Nobody's ever done anything like

RUSTY
Not true. Palowski did it in `64

SAUL
Really?
LIVINGSTON
And he only had a crew of six.

His partner looks over at Isabel, who is wearing a skirt and
pretty damn good shoes. The guy checks out her legs and looks
away.

Taxes over here are brutal. People

LINUS (V.O.)
Father was a big-time
industrialist, got into the
cellphone market on the ground

This is a game for you. For us it's
survival. Are you that bored? I

TOULOUR
No. I wouldn't do that. No... The

better word is a "wager".
DANNY
What kind of wager?

Danny and Toulour sit across from each other.
The bottom
quarter of the Eifel tower is visible in the background.
TOULOUR
A gentlemen's wager with a friend
of mine -- my mentor. A few months
ago we were at his winter place in
Nicaragua and another guest
referred to me as "the greatest
thief in the world." I didn't
object, obviously, but my mentor
fell silent. Later I asked him
about it. He said if I really
wanted to say I was the best
thief...I'd have to prove I was
better than the eleven of you.

CARABINIERI OFFICER

If I had to guess I'd say I'll need
at least 25 people, a dozen
vehicles...and an on-call air unit.
CARABINIERI OFFICER

You're wasting your time. I'm going

Then they will increase the
security even more, and then I will
steal the Egg. Then Lemarc can make
his decision.
DANNY
You sound confident.

Confident? This is a very American

ISABEL'S FLASHBACK
141
Years ago. Isabel's sitting at the very same cafe reading
the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles. She
looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore.
As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty. Eight cops are
chasing him.
Rusty rushes past the cafe. As he does he notices Isabel,
they make eye contact. Then he's gone. Sprints around the
corner. The cops rush past her. She hears sirens converging
from all directions.
142
143
Isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the
newspaper, enjoying her vacation. She looks up and stops
cold.
Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored
suit, sits down three tables away from her.
She stares at him. Can't believe it. The brazenness. The
audacity of this guy. Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in
the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian.
Finally, Isabel just can't help herself.
She gets up and
walks over to Rusty's table.
ISABEL
Excuse me...
RUSTY
Yes.
ISABEL
Um...Did I...? I think I saw
you...yesterday.
RUSTY
Oh yeah?
ISABEL
The police were chasing you.
RUSTY
You sure your eyes aren't broken?
ISABEL
I'm quite sure it was you.
RUSTY
Well, then I'm not gonna argue. Can
I buy you a coffee?
93.
144

We transition back to the cafe. Isabel's phone rings.
ISABEL
Hello.
RUSTY
We've got to stop meeting like
this.
She turns. He's sitting at the table behind her.
145
145
Isabel and Rusty are being quiet for the moment.
The waiter's in the midst of an animated discussion in
Italian with one of the customers.
ISABEL
What are they talking about all the
time?!
RUSTY
Soccer.
(translating)
He doesn't like Naples....thinks
they're a bunch of...sissies.
(turns to Isabel)
Can I ask you a question?
(off Isabel's nod)
Will you come to Zanzibar with me
on Friday?
ISABEL
Stop it.

Fourteen police cars parked in front of it.
Isabel stands at a police checkpoint on the road in front of
the museum chatting with Captain Giordano, who's clearly
brown-nosing her big-time since receiving Andriotti's order.
Her phone rings. She looks at the number and answers it.
ISABEL
What do you want?
RUSTY (V.O.)
Ever heard of overkill?
ISABEL
I don't even think Toulour can get
it now.
RUSTY
If he gets it, we'll let you arrest
us. If we get it, you come away
with me to Zanzibar--
ISABEL
What is your obsession with
Zanzibar?!

Do you want to make the bet or not?

Tess, as Julia Roberts, steps out of a Mercedes limo wearing
sunglasses and carrying a puppy. Frank and Basher, as Nation

trails, dressed in the latest hip-hop clothes.
A throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her. Strobes
blind us. Fans scream out her name, thrust paper and pen at
her for autographs. It's a frigging madhouse.

Outside the front of the apartment, he shuts the door and
turns toward us. We see his face in the light for the first
time: His left eye is swollen shut. Blood is caked into his
hair and on his cheek. Somebody beat the shit out of him.

Rusty is still on the balcony.
There's a knock at the door.
He opens it to see Isabel.
ISABEL
You want to walk?

Rusty and Isabel sit on the steps of the Campidoglio.
ISABEL
I know how you're planning to do
it. I know Julia's visit is the
key.
RUSTY
Who's Julia?
ISABEL
(after a beat)
LeMarc knew when to get out. He
just quit...with his perfect record
intact. Now he's a legend.
(exhorting)
Don't do this.
RUSTY
LeMarc quit because he was 75 years
old, Isabel. He was tired. His
doctor told him if he didn't start
taking it easy he was going to have
another heart attack. You're
dramatizing it.
ISABEL
You don't know why LeMarc retired,
any better than I do. You have no
idea.

why.

ISABEL
For how long?
RUSTY
For six months.
ISABEL
You--
She's so mad she can hardly speak.
ISABEL
You knew LeMarc? You knew LeMarc
and never told me? That's the worst
thing you've ever done to me.
Nobody knows more about LeMarc than
me. How could you do that?
RUSTY
I couldn't tell you, then.
ISABEL
Really awful.
Isabel thinks.
ISABEL
Then why aren't you as good as
Toulour?
Rusty shrugs.
A beat.

ISABEL
I don't want to arrest you, Robert.
I really don't. But I will if you
make me. I will if you go for that
egg.
Rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city.
ISABEL
So many times, I waited. You can't
do that to a person.
RUSTY
Isabel--
ISABEL
I have to go.
Isabel gets up...walks away fast.
She's barely holding
herself together.
Rusty watches her go.
Several seconds, then:
175
176
Rusty is still watching Isabel, small now in the distance.
She turns the corner out of sight.

Isabel pulls up in her car.
109.

191
Three massive Ford Excursion SUV's with diplomatic plates
double park out front, completely blocking the flow of
traffic on the narrow street.
Eight FBI agents climb out of their behemoths and walk inside
like they own the place. The boss is a 55 year-old agent
named MOLLY STARR.
192
195
Linus is bundled into the back of the SUV. Agent Starr gets
in next to him. She motions to the driver. They pull out.
196
196
Agent Starr's SUV is followed by three other SUV's and
escorted by two Rome Police cars.
197
199
The motorcade of FBI SUV's pulls through the security gate
and drives toward a US government Gulfstream parked on the
flight line.
Isabel watches with Captain Giordino and Commander Andriotti.
Linus, Saul, Yen, Livingston and Reuben get out of the SUVs,
all of them beaming. They hug Linus's mom and dad and mount
the steps to the plane. Then Rusty gets out, says goodbye to
everyone, and heads for Isabel.
ISABEL
(eyes go wide)
What the-- Oh my God!

ISABEL (cont'd)
(spins to Giordano)
Call the tower! Don't let that
plane take off!
Giordano stares blankly at her.
But he doesn't move.
ISABEL (cont'd)
Do something! Do you realize
what's happening?! Do you
understand what's going on?!
CAPTAIN GIORDANO
(deadpan)
Yes, absolutely.
Isabel blinks.
It takes a second to hit her. Rusty
approaches.
RUSTY
Guys. Get on there before they
leave without you. Thanks.
CAPTAIN GIORDANO
(speaking like an
American)
Hey, no problem. Good seeing you,
man.
ANDRIOTTI
Take care. See you back home.
RUSTY
Thanks, Scooter.
Isabel is dumbstruck.

Toulour pulls up in a Ferrari.
His butler gets the door for
him.
BUTLER
How was Rome, air?
Toulour answers by handing a small velvet bag to his butler
(a bag just big enough to hold the coronation egg).
TOULOUR
Put this in the safe, would you?
(CONTINUED)

BUTLER
Of course, sir. Your guests are on
the veranda.
TOULOUR
Guests?

Isabel watches as the "US Government" Gulfstream containing
all the members of Rusty's crew that she arrested at the
museum taxis down the runway and becomes airborne. She turns
to Rusty.
ISABEL
I hate you.
RUSTY
I love you.
ISABEL
This will ruin me.
RUSTY
No, it won't. Not if you come to
Zanzibar.
ISABEL
What is it with Zanzibar?
RUSTY
It's where LeMarc is.
Rusty points nearby at another private plane.
The pilot has
just opened the door and put the stairs down.
RUSTY
That one's ours.
We can be there
in three hours.
A beat.
RUSTY
Don't you want to meet him? He
wants to meet you.
ISABEL
You're asking me to turn my back on
my whole life.
(CONTINUED)

RUSTY
Would you miss it?
ISABEL
I'm a cop.
That's who I am.
RUSTY
You're only a cop because your
father was a thief.
ISABEL
Who died in a Russian jail.
RUSTY
According to you mother.
ISABEL
What does that mean?
RUSTY
It means you should meet LeMarc.

Toulour walks out to find Danny and Tess chomping on gourmet
nuts and sipping his special reserve brandy.
TOULOUR
(to Danny)
Let me guess, you decided you did
want to give my lawyer a call. But
you lost his card.
Toulour holds out another card to Danny.
DANNY
No, nothing like that. We just
came to collect our money.
TOULOUR
Not only did you fail, half of your
crew got pinched! Your plan was
not good.
(to Tess)
And you don't look anything like
Julia Roberts! I mean your...
(motions ambiguously to
her body)
...and your...
(another ambiguous motion)
...and your ears.
(CONTINUED)

Toulour stops. Danny and Tess just look at him. Something
about their demeanor is troubling. Namely, that they look
completely untroubled.
TOULOUR
Oh, no. You stole it on the way to
Rome didn't you? I stole a replica.
203
203
A repeat of the shot of the SMALL, SECURE BOX being taken to
a truck.
The truck moves out of the garage and on to the street as
before. This time the shot continues over to a door on the
side of the building. A YOUNG KID emerges with a backpack
over his shoulder.
204
204
The BACKPACK KID passes another guy, a NORMAL-LOOKING GUY,
who, after a beat, follows Backpack Kid.
205
212
They are toasting champagne.
TOULOUR
I am feeling more French by the
minute. To my first depression.
213
216
Tess and Danny enjoy the sunrise.
TESS
When do you want to go back?
DANNY
Feel like traveling?
TESS
Yeah. Don't you?
DANNY
Yeah.
Toulour enters with THE LAST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in tow.
TOULOUR
Tess. Danny. This is Monica
Bellucci.
And indeed it is.
MONICA
Hello.
TESS & DANNY
Hello.
TOULOUR
We're thinking of taking a trip to
the states. Take a look around.
We'd love to meet some of your
friends while we're there.
Actually, one friend in particular.
217
217
We follow the Gulfstream jet.

Stunning. Classic. Rusty and Isabel pull up.
He takes her hand and leads her inside.
