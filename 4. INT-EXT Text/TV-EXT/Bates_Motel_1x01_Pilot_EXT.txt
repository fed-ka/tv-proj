      Norma stands behind Norman, beaming as Norman opens his eyes 
      to see...

      THE HOUSE AND MOTEL

      A twelve unit, single story motel circa 1950 over which looms 
      a two story, California Victorian style house.  There is 
      something odd and haunting about this place.  And it s 
      isolated -- on the edge of town.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    What do you think?

      Norman just laughs.  

                                  NORMAN
                    This is crazy, Mom.                                                                                      6.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    It s not crazy.  We re going to run 
                    this place.  We own a motel, Norman 
                    Bates!  Come on, I want to show you 
                    the house...

      She takes off like a little kid.  Norman is skeptical.



      Norman is looking in the doorway of a bedroom with a peaked 
      roof and a garret window.  

                                  NORMAN
                    I like this room.                                                                                      7.


      Norma appears behind him.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Oh.  Yeah, it s a cool room but I 
                    put you down here closer to me...

      She takes his hand and pulls him along the hallway.

      She shows him his room.  The bed is up against the wall that 
      connects to her room.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    This is your room...

      STAY WITH THEM as she pulls him into the room next to it...

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    And this is my room!

      We may or may not notice the beds are about as close as they 
      could be without actually being in the same room.  Norman 
      does not look thrilled, by any of this.  She leans toward him 
      and puts her hands on his shoulders.

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Norman, we ve been through a lot.  
                    This is a chance to start over --

                                  NORMAN
                    Maybe some people don t get to 
                    start over.  Maybe they just bring 
                      themselves to a new place. 

      She looks him right in the eye.  She knows he s anxious. She 
      wants to assure him.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    They do get to start over.  But 
                    they have to try.  And they have to 
                      believe...

      He looks at her with exhausted affection.   You re an idiot.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Are you going to ask me to clap if 
                    I believe in fairies?  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (smiles; fuck you)
                    Yes.
                          (then)
                    Norman.  For me.  It s all going to 
                    be good.   You ll see.                                                                                      8.



      Night is falling.  Norman is outside, getting some of the 
      boxes out of the U-Haul.  He stops for a moment, hears a 
      coyote howling.  Looks around.  

      NORMAN S POV - THE LANDSCAPE

      It s dark and isolated.  Thick woods and mountains. A few 
      scattered, rural properties up the road.  

      RESUME NORMAN

      He picks up the last box and heads toward the house, 
      seeing...

      HIS MOM S SILHOUETTE

      Against the shades in her bedroom.  There s something about 
      it that looks and feels both haunting and sexual.  (NOTE: It 
      should be reminiscent of the iconic silhouette from the 
      original movie.) 

      RESUME NORMAN

      Focusing on it for a long moment, like he s almost getting  
      mentally lost -- going somewhere else.  Then he comes out of 
      it.  Starts lugging the heavy box up to the house.  

                                  NORMAN
                          (sarcastic affection)
                     It s all going to be good, 
                      Norman... .

                                                              SMASH TO MAIN TITLES.

                                          END TEASER                                                                                      9.


                                            ACT ONE



      The next morning.  We are CLOSE ON NORMAN who waits at a 
      SCHOOL BUS STOP about five hundred yards from the motel, 
      listening to music on his phone, earbuds in.  He is staring 
      at the landscape, lost in his own head, pensive and stoic and 
      agitated all at once.  WE HEAR the MUSIC (OVER) - it s the 
      cacophonous and angry  EROICA  by Beethoven. 

      NORMAN S POV - THE LANDSCAPE

      Wild and isolated.  MUSIC PLAYS OVER.  Suddenly a GIRL S 
      SMILING FACE comes into frame. This is BRADLEY KENNER, 16, 
      pretty, bright, and effortlessly sexy. She has a depth to her 
      that makes her seem older than she is - in a good way.  She 
      takes the earbuds out of his ears and smiles a completely 
      winning smile.  END MUSIC.

                                    BRADLEY
                    You re new.

      A CABAL OF CUTE TEENAGE GIRLS circle around him. Fresh meat 
      in a small town.  Studying him like he s in a petri dish.  
      Norman, not used to this kind of overt attention, covers his 
      anxiety. Smiles slyly. 

                                  NORMAN
                    This must be a really small town --

      The girls, JENNA, HAYDEN, LISSA, start pummeling him with 
      questions. Overlapping each other --

                                    BRADLEY
                    What s your name?

                                  NORMAN
                    Norman Bates.

                                  JENNA
                    When did you move here, Norman 
                    Bates?

                                  NORMAN
                    Last night --

                                    BRADLEY
                    Where?  What house?

                                  NORMAN
                    Here.  The house at the motel --                                                                                    10.


                                  HAYDEN
                    Ohhh, you bought the motel --

                                  LISSA
                    You actually going to live here or 
                    are you just flipping the property?

                                  NORMAN
                    We re not flipping --

                                  LISSA
                          (to Hayden; meaningfully)
                    He s not flipping --

                                  JENNA
                    You have any brothers?

                                  NORMAN
                    An older brother.  He doesn t live 
                    here.  Just me and my mom --

                                    BRADLEY
                    You have a girlfriend?

      Everyone goes silent. Norman feels a little awkward. 

                                  NORMAN
                    Um, no.

      They all smile.  A CONVERTIBLE BMW pulls up.  The girl behind 
      the wheel, KENNEDY (17) smiles...

                                    KENNEDY
                    Want a ride?

                                    BRADLEY
                          (re: new car)
                    You got it!  Oh my God it s 
                    amazing! 

      The girls all jump in the car.  (We may or may not notice all 
      the girls have really nice, expensive clothes and accessories 
      for  small town  kids. Weird.) Bradley grabs Norman s hand --

                                    BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    C mon --

      Norman doesn t know what he s getting into but isn t about to 
      say  no, I ll wait for the bus.   He glances toward the 
      house, a little anxious, hoping his Mom isn t seeing this.                                                                                    11.



      DYLAN BATES (21), handsome and moody, sort of a James Dean 
      thing going on, sits on the back of his motorcycle in front 
      of a house that has a FOR SALE sign on the lawn, phone to his 
      ear. 

                                  DYLAN
                          (pissed)
                    Thanks for telling me you moved, 
                    Mom.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m pretty sure the last time we 
                    spoke you told me to  drop dead, 
                    bitch.   Sorry, I took it 
                      personally.

                                  DYLAN
                    So you think it s okay to not tell 
                    your own kid that you (fucking) 
                    moved?  What if I got hurt?  What 
                    if I was in the hospital?  What if 
                    I needed you?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (flat; annoyed)
                    Are you hurt?  Are you in the 
                    hospital?  

      Dylan s face hardens.  Bitch.  Then...

                                  DYLAN
                    I need some (fucking) money.  My 
                    job fell apart --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (not impressed)
                    What happened this time?                                                                                    19.


                                  DYLAN
                    My boss was an asshole and I told 
                    him that.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Always someone else s fault, isn t 
                    it, Dylan?

                                  DYLAN
                          (implying his whole life 
                          is her fault) 
                    Yeah, Norma.  Maybe it is.  Can you 
                    just cut the crap and wire me some 
                    money --

      She is silent for a long moment.  Then, HANGS UP ON HIM.

      STAY ON DYLAN

      Furious.  Puts his phone away. 

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                          (under his breath)
                    Whore.

      He starts his motorcycle and takes off OUT OF FRAME.



      It s dusk.  Norman heads up the steps, finally home from 
      school.



      CLOSE ON THE BLADES cutting through the tall grass...

      ON NORMAN -- It s early morning as he pushes the old lawn 
      mower across the front lawn.  It s hard and physical.  Norma 
      comes out, hands him some orange juice.  (We sense they 
      haven t spoken much since the previous night when she left 
      the house.)  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I brought this for you.

      He wonders if she has stopped being angry at him.  He takes 
      it.

                                  NORMAN
                    Thanks.

      He takes a long drink.  Norma looks at him, feeling bad about 
      last night with him.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Norman, I m sorry about the track 
                    team.  I m sorry I was so upset.  
                    You re right, you should be getting 
                    involved.  And I want you to.  It s 
                    just that, right now, I ve got to 
                    get this place in shape in a few 
                    weeks so we can open and start 
                    making money.  I m just -- feeling 
                    the pressure, I guess --

      Norman s body visibly relaxes. Relieved to be in his mother s 
      good graces.                                                                                      24.


                                  NORMAN
                    It s okay, Mom.  I get it.  I don t 
                    know what I was thinking --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    There will be time for all that.  I 
                    promise.  

      She takes the empty glass. Kisses him on the forehead.  
      Smiles and heads back inside.  STAY ON NORMAN, back to 
      cutting the grass.  Glad his Mom is in a good mood. All is 
      right with the world.  At least for a moment.  He PUSHES the 
      lawn mower --

      ON AN OLD TRUCK pulling up in the driveway.  Rusty and with a 
      crooked bumper.  An old BROOM sticks straight up out of the 
      side panel.

      FIND NORMAN watching a man get out of the truck.  The man, 
      KEITH SUMMERS (51), approaches Norman, who stops mowing.  
      There is something unsettling about this man.  He s 
      disheveled and his clothes look dirty and worn.  There s 
      something about his face that seems disturbed.  Agitated.  He 
      walks right up to Norman without any introduction. 

                                  KEITH
                    Norman Bates?

      Norman looks at him.  Kind of intimidated by this weird dude 
      in his face all of a sudden. 

                                  NORMAN
                    Yes...

                                  KEITH
                    You just moved in the other night.  
                    How you liking the place?

      Norman isn t sure if this is a neighbor or what.  He tries to 
      act like it s all normal.  But he doesn t like this guy. 

                                  NORMAN
                    It s fine so far.

                                  KEITH
                    You live here with your Mom?  

                                  NORMAN
                    Yeah. Do you know her?

      Keith just looks at him. Then...                                                                                    25.


                                  KEITH
                          (I hate her guts)
                    I know about her.

      Ok, this guy is starting to freak Norman out.  Norman starts 
      backing toward the house...

                                  NORMAN
                    You want me to get her?

                                  KEITH
                    Your sixteen.  From Arizona.  Your 
                    Dad died last winter --

                                  NORMAN
                    Let me get my mom --

                                  KEITH
                    And it s just the two of you --

                                  NORMAN
                    Um, yeah --

                                  KEITH
                    What do you know about running a 
                    motel?  Anything?  Because you look 
                    like a little kid.  I don t see you 
                    running anything --

      Norma s voice, strong and clear and not taking any shit, cuts 
      through the tension as she appears behind Norman...

                                  NORMA LOUISE 
                    Can I help you with something?

      Norman is relieved to see his Mom has exited the house and is 
      behind him.  She can see that this guy is bugging Norman and 
      she is in mama bear mode. 

                                  KEITH
                    I think you re the one who s going 
                    to need some help. 

      Norma looks down at him.  You re not intimidating me, 
      asshole. 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Really?  And how might that be?

                                  KEITH
                    I m Keith Summers.  This is my 
                    family property.  The house and the 
                    motel.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                  KEITH (CONT'D)
                    My grandfather built the house in 
                    1930 and my dad built the motel 
                      thirty-five years later. 

      A long moment, then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m sure it was hard for you to 
                    lose it to the bank.  I m sorry. 
                    But it is our property now.  So if 
                    there s not something I can help 
                    you with --

                                  KEITH
                    You re not getting it.  You can t 
                    run this place.  This is my place.   
                    Now be a smart girl and let me take 
                    over  --

      Norma bristles.  This guy might be crazy.  Might be drunk.  
      Might be dangerous.  But nobody calls her  girl .  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I don t know what delusion you re 
                    suffering under.  I don t need 
                    anyone to  take over  --

      Keith gets closer to her.  Utter contempt. Talks down to her 
      in a really hostile, ugly way --

                                  KEITH
                    Really.  You think you can just 
                    drive here from Arizona and take 
                    over the Sea Fairer --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    It hardly seems very complicated --

                                  KEITH
                          (cuts her off)
                    You don t know anything. 
                          (then; revealing a dark, 
                            emotional underbelly)
                    It s complicated.  There s stuff 
                    that goes on that you know nothing 
                    about --
                          (leans in)
                    I know everything about this place.  
                    Every nook and cranny.  Every leaky 
                    water pipe.  Every dirty secret.
                          (then)
                    You re in over your head.  You 
                    don t know crap about this place. 
                    About this town.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  KEITH (CONT'D)
                    About how things work here.  What 
                    makes you think you can do this by 
                    yourself?

      Something in what he says hits a raw nerve with her.  A seed 
      of truth.  Her own fear said out loud.  It makes her feel 
      terribly, terribly vulnerable.  As a result, she does what 
      she always does when she feels vulnerable.  She goes into 
      survival mode.  She gets back in his face, fierce.  The 
      lady s got a little Clint Eastwood in her...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Because I can.
                          (then)
                    Now get the hell off my property 
                    you (fucking) pathetic, dirtbag 
                    loser.  And if I ever see you here 
                    again, I ll call the cops or shoot 
                    you myself.  

      She grabs Norman and heads into the house.  Slams the door 
      behind her.  Keith looks at the house for a moment, pissed, 
      almost like he s deciding what fuck he should do. 

      Keith just stares after her.  Somewhere between furious and 
      broken.  We re not sure what side he s going to land on. 

                                  KEITH
                          (yelling after her)
                    I know the cops here!  I grew up 
                    here!  I lived in that house!  
                    That s my house!  You try and call 
                    the cops on me, you (fucking) 
                    bitch!  You just (fucking) try! 



      As he backs out of the open window -- precariously reaching 
      for a nearby tree branch with his foot.  He barely makes it.  
      Almost falls.  Then he s safe.  He starts climbing down.  



      The girls car is idling.  Norman runs up.  The back door 
      opens.  He sees Bradley s smiling face.  

                                    BRADLEY
                    Get in --



      Norman sneaks out a back door.  Just wants to get the fuck 
      out of there.  He finds the car he came in.  Reaches through 
      an open window to get his history book.  Gets it.  Starts 
      walking.  Trotting.  Running.  It s emotional. He s 
        overwhelmed.  Anxious.  Heart pounding.  Why did I come?  Why 
      did I come?  Running faster and faster.  Just wants to get 
      home --

      Then he stops at a crossroad, realizes he recognizes nothing.  
      He has no idea where he is.  He spins around in all 
      directions -- totally lost. And he s in the middle of 
      nowhere.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! 

      Norman wants his mother. 



      Norma and Norman, rigid with tension, struggle to carry the 
      dead weight of the body to one of the rooms.  It s incredibly 
      heavy and cumbersome. They are both sweating.  (Norman is 
      walking forward and Norma is walking backwards. The following 
      dialogue is said through heavy breathing and straining 
      muscles.  This is REALLY PHYSICALLY DEMANDING.)   They 
      whisper loudly and with agitation --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Don t go so fast!  I can t walk 
                    that fast backwards --

                                  NORMAN
                    It s heavy.  I just want to get it 
                    in the tub.  I m afraid I m going 
                    to drop it --                                                                                    44.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Well you are going to drop it if I 
                    fall over because you re walking to 
                    fast!  
                          (noticing)
                    Hell.  The blood is soaking through 
                    again --

                                  NORMAN
                    That s why I m hurrying --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Just -- be quiet.  Here, number 
                    four is open --

      She backs into room #4.  



      A COP CAR pulls up.  Nearby, we see Norma s car -- rolled up 
      carpeting sticking out of all the windows.



      Two cops exit the car. One, SHERIFF ROYCE ROMERO (45), dark 
      and edgy.  Eyes that see everything.  Nothing in his face 
      that let s you off the hook.  About anything.  Ever.  
      Something almost sinister about him.  With him, DEPUTY ZACK 
      SHELBY (35).  Shelby is a nice looking guy, compassionate 
      eyes.  A  likability  to him. They are both glancing in the 
      car with the rolled up carpets when Norma appears on the 
      porch, all smiles.

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Good evening, Gentlemen.  I was 
                    about to tell you we re not open 
                    for business yet but I m guessing 
                    you re not looking for a room --

      She walks to them and extends her hand.  Charming.                                                                                    47.


                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    Norma Bates.  We just moved in a 
                    few days ago.

      Shelby takes her hand.  Smiles.  Makes total eye contact with 
      her.  Clearly finds her attractive.  (She sees this and works 
      it.  All very subtle.)  

                                  SHELBY
                    No, not looking for a room tonight.  
                          (introducing)
                    Deputy Zack Shelby.  This is 
                    Sheriff Royce Romero.

      Romero just nods.  Barely.  

                                  ROMERO
                    We wanted to make sure everything 
                    was alright here.  We didn t know 
                    anyone had moved in yet and we saw 
                    the lights on.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    That s so kind of you.  But, yes, 
                    we re all fine.  My son and I are 
                    just working a little late.  
                    Pulling up some carpeting we re 
                      replacing.  Doing some updating.  
                    God knows it could use it --

      Shelby smiles.  Romero is blank.  Then...

                                  ROMERO
                    You have a son?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Yes, my son Norman.  He s 16.

      A silent moment, then...

                                  ROMERO
                    Norma and Norman.  That s -- 
                    unusual. 

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Boys take their father s name all 
                    the time --

                                  ROMERO
                          (but that makes sense)
                    Yeah.
                          (then)
                    You know it s almost two in the 
                    morning?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    48.

                                  ROMERO (CONT'D)
                    Your son has school tomorrow.  You 
                    really think this is a good idea to 
                    have him up doing remodeling for 
                    you at this hour?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Gosh is it that late already?  I 
                    had no idea.  Thank you so  much 
                    for telling me.  I ll go close up 
                    shop right now.  Thanks for coming 
                    by --

      She starts walking off, her back to them.  WE ARE FACING HER - 
      the terror seeping through her face -- the prayer that they 
      are leaving now.  JUST KEEP WALKING.  KEEP WALKING.  YOU LL 
      HEAR THE ENGINE START ANY SECOND -- 

                                  ROMERO
                    Mrs. Bates?

      Her face falls.  Her heart starts THUMPING.  She turns, 
        transformed, a sweet smile --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Yes, Sheriff?

                                  ROMERO
                    You wouldn t mind if we take a look 
                    inside, would you?

      ON NORMA.  HOLY FUCK.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                          (smiles)
                    Not at all.  

                                                                          SMASH TO:



      As Norman bursts through the cafeteria door, feeling food 
      coming back up his throat, feeling dizzy and hot, and needing 
      a place to hurl because it s happening, he leans over an open 
      trash can and starts puking.  Richard and some GUYS walk by 
      on their way in the cafeteria.  

                                    RICHARD
                    He s new.  He s not used to the 
                    food yet --

      Laughs/groans.  They disappear inside.  STAY ON NORMAN, done 
      but still leaning over the trash.  Humiliated.  Sick.  
      Disgusted.  In the middle of this reverie of self-loathing we 
      FIND...

      EMMA DECODY (15), cute and energetic.  Extremely bright.  
      Slim, athletic body.  Has a a subtle, girl-next-door sex 
      appeal to her, but maybe she s not to aware of it yet.  
      Something still childlike about her - or her perception of 
      herself.  Most notedly, she rolls a PORTABLE OXYGEN TANK 
      along with her and has the classic oxygen tube directly under 
      her nose.  Aside from that you would never know there was 
      anything wrong with her.   She looks at Norman, concerned...

                    Make sure you re done.  Don t try 
                    to cut it short just because it s 
                      embarrassing.  Get it all out or 
                    you will just have to do this 
                    again.

      Norman pulls his head out of the trash.  Sees this eccentric 
      girl standing there.  Cute, eccentric girl. 

                                  NORMAN
                    Um, I think I m done.  

      She opens a mint box from her large purse.  Offers him one.

                                  EMMA
                    Mint will calm your stomach.  

      He takes one.

                                  NORMAN
                    Thanks.

                                  EMMA
                    I m kind of an expert on vomiting.
                          (matter of fact; almost 
                            cheery)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    55.

                                  EMMA (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, I have CF so I ve been on 
                    meds my whole life.  Some of them 
                    give you any number of hideous side 
                    effects.  
                          (she laughs)
                    Puking being one of the more 
                    pleasant ones.  
                          (then)
                    Do you have some sort of chronic 
                    illness?

                                  NORMAN
                    No --

                                  EMMA
                          (slightly disappointed)
                    Oh. 
                          (then; shakes it off; 
                            smiles
                    I m Emma Decody.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Norman Bates.

                                  EMMA
                    Yeah, I think we have language arts 
                    together. 

      Awkward silence.  Then...

                                  EMMA (CONT D)
                    Well, I just wanted to make sure 
                    you were okay.
                          (she leans in; looking at 
                            him. concerned; sensing 
                            tension)
                    Are you okay?

      There s part of him that just wants to collapse.  Just tell 
      someone everything.  Admit he can t handle the pressure.  
      Give up.  Give in.  Give over.  But finally... 

                                  NORMAN
                          (lying)
                    I m okay.  

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



      Norma exits the store.  Takes a moment to look down the 
      street.  The town here is utterly charming and lovely.  She 
      looks at it, wistful.  This was not the  grand opening  she 
      wanted for her life in this place.  She glances down at her 
      cut hand.  Will I ever have a normal life?  Then her gaze 
      falls on...

      A POSTER announcing a town meeting to discuss the new HIGHWAY  
      101 BYPASS.  She looks closely at the MAP.  Her face falls...



      OARS quietly lap through the dark water.  

      FIND Norman and Norma in a row boat.  Norman rows.  Norma 
      stares out into the night.  Keith s body lies on the bottom 
      of the boat, wrapped up in sheets and tied like a UPS 
      package.  Weighted down with bricks and pieces of sawn off 
      iron piping.  Very home made.

      Norma and Norman sits in tense silence.  Norman can tell 
      there is something up with his mom.  Can tell she s upset.  
      It makes him worry.  Finally --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I suck.

                                  NORMAN
                    Mom, he attacked you --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I m not even talking about him.  I 
                    found out today that the city is 
                    building a new bypass on the far 
                    side of town.  It s going to be the 
                    new  main road .  No one s even 
                    going to drive by our motel 
                    anymore.  No one s going to see it.  
                    I bought a motel no one is ever 
                    going to know is there --

                                  NORMAN
                    Why didn t the real estate guy tell 
                    you that?                                                                                    57.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Because people suck, Norman.  
                    Everyone I have ever known has 
                    sucked.  The whole world sucks.  
                          (then)
                    Except you.  

      She looks at him for a long moment, loving him so much.  
      Then...

                                  NORMA LOUISE (CONT D)
                    You re too good for me.  I m the 
                    worst mother in the world.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Mother --

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Look at what we re doing, 
                      Norman??!!!  You should be taken 
                    away from me.  I should turn myself 
                    in and put you up for adoption.  
                    There s something wrong with me --

      Norman stops rowing.  Kind of terrified.

                                  NORMAN
                    You re kidding, right?

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Look at the life I ve given you.  
                    You deserve so much better. When 
                    you were born it was like -- God 
                    gave me a second chance.  All I 
                    ever wanted was for everything to 
                    be beautiful for you.  And look at 
                    it.  Look at what your life has 
                    been.  What good am I doing you? 

      They little boat has stopped out in the middle of the vast 
      blackness.  Two small people in the middle of infinity.  
      Norman is upset.  

                                  NORMAN
                    Mom, you re everything.  Everything 
                    to me.  I don t ever want to live 
                    in a world without you.  You re my 
                    family.  My whole family. My whole 
                    life.  My whole  -- self.  You 
                    always have been.  It s like 
                    there s a cord between our hearts --                                                                                    58.


                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    Honey, that s from JANE EYRE.  
                    Orson Wells says it to Joan 
                    Fontaine  --

                                  NORMAN
                    Oh, right. But you know what I 
                    mean.  It s you and me. It s always 
                    been you and me.  We belong to each 
                    other. 

      Norma just looks at her sweet son in the moonlight.  Moved.  

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I love you, Norman.  You are the 
                    best thing that ever happened to 
                    me.

                                  NORMAN
                    I love you too, Mom.

      A beat as they just connect.  Heal.  Then after a moment, 
      Norma turns to the water...

                                  NORMA LOUISE
                    I guess this is deep enough.

      And with great effort they hoist the body of Keith Summers 
      into the dark water.  As it splashes in, we...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

                                          ACT FIVE



      CLOSE ON TRUCK WHEELS spinning in the gravel, getting no 
      traction.  HEAR THE ENGINE SURGE...

      FIND THE SEA FAIRER MOTEL SIGN attached to some chains at the 
      rear of a professional SIGN COMPANY truck. Then the truck 
      lurches forward and we see...

      THE SEA FAIRER SIGN CRASHES TO THE GROUND.  Dust and debris.  
      As the crew prepares to erect a NEW SIGN...

      FIND NORMA

      Watching.  Something about seeing this is purging.  It s 
      gone.  Keith Summers is gone.  On to the future...



      Norma goes outside.  Excited, flips the switch for the new 
      sign.  It lights up. (We see the light from it but do not see 
      the sign - we stay on Norma.) She looks at it, moved.  It has 
      great meaning to her.  She owns something.  Something in this 
      world belongs completely to her.
