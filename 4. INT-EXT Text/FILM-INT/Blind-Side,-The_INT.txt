Looks like a government office. Not much more than a desk on
either side of which sit INVESTIGATOR GRANGER, an African-
American woman in a business suit, and Michael Oher. Michael
slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees
- a nervous trait of his.
GRANGER
Do you find it odd? Your
predicament?
(NO RESPONSE)
Michael?...
MICHAEL
Iono [I don't know]...
Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out
files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever
trouble Michael is in.
She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him
out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window,
rubs his knees some more.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Can I... can I leave now?
GRANGER
(WITH FINALITY)
No. You can't.
SUPERSCRIPT: TWO YEARS BEFORE
Michael sits in the back seat, behind STEVEN HAMILTON, 14,
and his father, BIG TONY, who drives.

Not a word is spoken as they drive through the streets of
WEST MEMPHIS - poverty ridden.

We've gone from slums to nice neighborhoods - fathers and
sons play baseball, kids tend lemonade stands, sprinklers
keep the grass emerald green.
Michael's face tells us he's never seen anything like this.
Big Tony strides down the almost empty hallway, spots a door.
BERT COTTON, football coach, cleans off his desk, ready to
leave for the day. Big Tony knocks at the door.
BIG TONY
They say you the coach.
Cotton eyes Tony, offers a hand.
COTTON
Bert Cotton.
BIG TONY
Tony Hamilton, but everybody call
me Big Tony.
COTTON
What can I do for you, Tony?
Big Tony and Cotton are mid-discussion ---
BIG TONY
You see I promised my mama Boo, on
her deathbed, that I would get
Steven outta public and into a
church school.
COTTON
I appreciate that but I'm not
involved with admissions.
BIG TONY
I figured I'd come to you; seeing
as you might need some players.
COTTON
What sport does he play?
BIG TONY
Anything with a ball. Good, too.
He has Cotton's attention for a moment, then it passes...
COTTON
Classes start in a week. It'd have
to be for next semester.
BIG TONY
I know what you're thinking, Coach,
but I got money. I'm a mechanic at
Wilson's Auto t'other side of town.
(ANOTHER TRY)
What if someone drops out or moves?
Could they get in then?

COTTON
"They?" You only mentioned one son.
BIG TONY
Steven, yessir, but I brought
another boy along.
COTTON
Another boy?
BIG TONY
Yeah, Big Mike. He stays on our
couch sometimes. It's a bad deal.
His mama's on the crack pipe and he
ain't got nobody. He just wanted
to come along with us today.
COTTON
Would... Big Mike be an applicant
as well?
BIG TONY
Yeah, sure, why not.
Cotton sighs, considers what to do.
COTTON
They'd have to fill out
applications and make an
appointment for interviews.
BIG TONY
I was hopin' you might just
interview 'em now.
COTTON
They're here?
Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven
and Michael are playing one on one basketball.
BIG TONY
The little ones Steven and the big
ONE'S --
COTTON
Big Mike.
BIG TONY
Yeah. That's right.
INTERCUT WITH:

The Board of Admissions, eight or so men and women, are
seated around a large conference table. By himself, at one
end, sits Bert Cotton.
COTTON
Are there spots available or not?
PAUL SANDSTROM, Principal, taps his fingers before...
SANDSTROM
Technically, yes, in both grades.
But we have a greater
responsibility than just filling
classrooms. Steven Hamilton's
paperwork looks acceptable and I
believe he would be capable of
succeeding here but the other kid --
Sandstrom looks through papers for the name.
COTTON
Big Mike.
SANDSTROM
Michael Oher gives us no reason to
believe, based on his record, that
he would be successful here.
COTTON
How bad could it be?
Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file,
which is a mess. She finds facts and lays them out ---

MRS. SMITH
We're not sure exactly how old he
is due to lack of records. He has
a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th
percentile. He's been enrolled in
seven different institutions,
including a gap of eighteen months
around the age of ten when he
apparently didn't attend school at
all. He repeated first grade as
well as second, there's no record
of attendance in third, and in
fourth grade --
COTTON
So they moved him ahead without
going to third grade. That says
something.
MRS. SMITH
(IGNORING COTTON)
His attendance records are abysmal
and his grade point average begins
with a zero. Zero-point-six-
Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and
science teacher, looks to the others.
MRS. BOSWELL
Everyone passed him along - gave
him D's so they could hand their
problem off to the next school.
COTTON
Brave kid.
(off their confusion)
For wanting to come here. For
wanting a quality education. An
education denied him by the poor
quality of the schools he's
attended. Most kids with his
background wouldn't come within two
hundred miles of this place.
MRS. SMITH
Coach Cotton, we understand your
interest in the young man's
athletic abilities.
SANDSTROM
He wouldn't be able to play until
he got his grades up anyway.

Forget sports! Look at the wall.
He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: "NEIGHBORLY,
ACADEMIC, CHRISTIAN".
COTTON (CONT'D)
Christian. We either take that
seriously or we paint over it. You
don't admit Michael Oher for
sports, you admit him because it's
the right thing to do.
Their faces announce that he's made a point.
It's Mrs. Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the
board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters. He
pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to
stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then...
MRS. BOSWELL
Class, this is Mike Oher and he's
new here so I expect you all to
make him feel welcome.
(with a warm smile)
Mike, take any empty seat.

She urges him with a nod. Michael walks back and sits in the
corner, looking terrified. He barely fits in the seat.
Mrs. Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row. As
students pass them back to others...
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
This is a quiz based on the
information you learned last year
in your science curriculum.
(OVER GROANS)
Don't worry. It won't be graded. I
just want to see how much of the
information we need to hit again.
Just answer whatever you know.
The student in front of Michael hands a sheet back to him and
eyes the size of his feet.
The students start to work while Michael stares at the sheet
like it's written in Greek. Mrs. Boswell watches him for a
few seconds before turning back to her work.
A bell RINGS and kids leave classrooms.
Michael sits alone while Mrs. Boswell collects the last of
the papers. She walks over to Michael, looks down at his
sheet. Nothing filled in, just his name scrawled at the top.
She tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for --
MRS. BOSWELL
It's okay.
MICHAEL
Can I leave now?
She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances
down at the sheet, turns it over and sees...
A DRAWING on the back - a boat on an ocean. On the boat is a
single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a
third grader drew it.

Michael lies on a tattered sofa. The lights are out but
Michael's eyes are open, staring at the light emanating from
beneath a closed bedroom door. We hear voices...
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S)
Why he gotta always stay here?
BIG TONY'S VOICE (0.S)
Ain't got nowhere else.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S)
And how's that your problem? You

Michael tries to shut his eyes.

A girl's volleyball game is in progress in the bg. As
latecomers move en masse for entry into the gym, a small
pretty lady on a cell phone moves.against the crowd; a salmon
on a mission. This is LEIGH ANNE Tuohy. And she's pissed.

She hangs up angry, spots a friend nearby and her frown turns
into a smile that could light up a cave.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT`D)
Hi, sweetie! We're on the Kidspace
committee together, aren't we?!
It'll be a hoot!
Leigh Anne's husband SEAN TUOHY, handsome, confidant, and
their 10-year-old son, SJ, sit, watching the game.
During a time out, Sean eyes the crowd, sees something odd.
In the upper corner of the gym sits Michael, by himself,
rubbing his knees. Others around him, all white, have moved
away. He's a very large island in the lily white gym.
SEAN
S.J., you know that kid?
SJ
What kid?
SEAN
Black kid. Up in the corner.

everyone she passes. As she sits...
LEIGH ANNE
What'd I miss?
SEAN
Collins got a dig.
SI
It's girl's volleyball, Mom. You
didn't miss anything.
Leigh Anne gives him a look then stands and shouts --
LEIGH ANNE
Collins! Move your feet!
ON THE COURT - COLLINS TUOHY, a beautiful 16-year-old, sighs
and gives her mother a look - "Don't embarrass me!"
The scoreboard tells us that the game is over. Fans file
out. The Tuohy family waits in a group as the volleyball
team exits the court.
LEIGH ANNE
Collins, we'll wait outside. And
don't double condition in the
shower - you still have homework!
COLLINS
I'm going over to Cannon's house to

Sean's eyes go to the upper stands where he sees Michael,
alone, walking slowly, then bending down, picking something
up, taking a few more steps and repeating the process.
Picking up left-over bags of popcorn.
Sean considers this for a second before leaving.
Teachers drink stale coffee and chew on donuts.
FIRST TEACHER (BOB)
Well, the big guy's been here a
month and he ain't cutting it in my

SECOND TEACHER (APRIL)
Why would Admissions do this? It's
not fair to us or the boy.
THIRD TEACHER (GLENDA)
Just setting him up to fail.
BOB
I don't think he has any idea what

And how would you know if he did?
He won't even talk.
Mrs. Boswell can't contain herself.
MRS. BOSWELL
He writes.

His name. Barely.
Mrs. Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page.
MRS. BOSWELL
He threw this in the trash can.

"I look and I see white everywhere:

(a pause for effect)
He entitled it "White Walls."
The room is dead quiet.
BOB
How's the spelling?
Mrs. Boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves.
Sean and Coach Cotton sip coffee while all around them
students eat their lunches. They are looking at Michael, who
sits by himself without a tray in front of him.
COTTON
If he makes his grades he'll be
eligible in the spring.
SEAN
If he makes his grades.
COTTON
But boy-hidey, just look at him.
Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something
else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up.
SEAN
What did you eat for lunch today?
MICHAEL
Here in the cafeteria.
SEAN
I didn't ask where you ate, I asked
what you ate.
MICHAEL
A few things.
SEAN
Do you need some money? For lunch?

I don't need any.
Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton.
SEAN
Buy him a semester lunch pass and
put it on my bill.
(off Cotton's look)
He's hungry.
COTTON
You could tell that by looking at
him?
SEAN -
I didn't grow up all that different
from him. At public school they
give you free lunch, Bert. And
when food is finite, you'd be
surprised how much time you can
spend thinking about it..
Mrs. Boswell distributes a test to the class.
MRS. BOSWELL
You'll have one hour. If you
finish early put it on my desk and
sit quietly.
She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees
Michael just staring at his test. She sighs, makes a
decision, rises and walks over.
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT`D)
Mike, come with me.
Filled with supplies and a small desk. Mrs. Boswell points
and he sits.
MRS. BOSWELL
You can take the test back here
away from everybody else. I'll sit
in there so if there's anything you
don't understand you can ask.

Michael's eyes go to the page in front of him. He rubs his
hands on his knees and stares. Mrs. Boswell waits a beat
then scoots her chair over next to him.
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
Mike, how about I ask the questions
and you tell me the answers or as
much as you know.
She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads:
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
Protozoans are classified based on:
a) how they get their food, b) how
they reproduce, c) how they move,
or d) both a and c.
Michael just stares. After a long moment
MICHAEL
Iono...
MRS. BOSWELL
Just try. Ask questions if you
don't understand.
But still Michael stares at the page. The look on her face
says she's about to give up when
He lifts his eyes to her and points to --
-- the question on the test - specifically to the word
"classified".
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
"Classified". It means how things
are grouped together.
MICHAEL
Like our "class"?
MRS. BOSWELL
Exactly. This science course is
classified based on what grade
y'all are in. Eleventh.
Michael nods understanding.
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
Okay, Mike, you ready to answer the
question?

Same group of teachers. Mrs. Boswell bursts through the
door, holding the test.
MRS. BOSWELL
He knows it!
BOB
Who knows it and what does he know?
MRS. BOSWELL
The material. Michael Oher. I
gave him this test verbally.
She holds up the test -- marked with a large red "C".
APRIL
On how big a curve?
MRS. BOSWELL
He's been listening the whole time.
It's amazing what he's absorbed.
And, trust me, he's listening to
you, too. Okay, so his reading
level is low and he has no idea how
to learn in a classroom, but...
(makes her point)
I'm not saying he's going to pass
but Big Mike is not stupid.
Leigh Anne notices Michael as she drives past him.
LEIGH ANNE
Who's that SJ?
SI
Big Mike.
LEIGH ANNE
Get your feet off my dash.
Pretty seedy. Michael walks to a sink in the back, opens his
plastic sack, pulls out an extra T-shirt and starts to wash
it.
A WOMAN, the only other patron, reads a magazine. When he
turns to look at her, she becomes quite nervous. She sets
down the magazine and walks outside.
It seems Michael was expecting this because as soon as she
leaves he takes his wet T-shirt, wrings it-out, walks to her
dryer and tosses the shirt inside to dry with her things.
As they exit the parking lot--
LEIGH ANNE
Turn on the heat!
SEAN
I don't know where it is.
LEIGH ANNE
It's fifteen degrees, you've had
this car a month and you don't know
how to turn on the heat?!

convincing in the role of... uh...
SI
Indian Number Three. I tried out
for the Chief but they gave it to
Andy Sung. I can't be sure but I
think there was some multi-cultural
bias thing working.
SEAN
Or maybe they just thought he'd
make a better Chief.
SI
Dad, he's like Chinese.
LEIGH ANNE
And you're Irish. If you weren't
the Chief how come you got the
headdress?
Si hesitates a bit before --
SI
Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of
those free Quesadilla tickets.
LEIGH ANNE

SEAN
Hey, Big Mike!
Michael stops in the crosswalk, looks to the car.
SEAN (CONT'D)
Where you headin'?
MICHAEL

Sean nods, rolls his window back up and drives as the light

LEIGH ANNE
The gym? It's nine o'clock.
No answer to this. They drive another half block,before --
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Turn around.
Sean sighs, knowing better than to argue.
Sean and SJ watch the discussion without hearing any of it.
Leigh Anne looks to Sean, then back to Michael.
SEAN
I've seen that look many times.
She's about to get her way.
Leigh Anne makes her way back to the car, with Michael in
tow. She opens the back door and he gets in next to SJ in
his headdress. Leigh Anne climbs into the front seat, closes
the door. Sean is looking at her.
SEAN (CONT'D)

Michael's eyes are frozen at the sight. To him it looks like
a mansion. Hell, it IS a mansion.

Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes.

Leigh Anne stops, stares --
The couch is totally back to normal and the sheets, blankets
and pillows are neatly stacked in almost military precision.
No sign of Michael.

With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his
pants pocket and finishes filling his plate.
Leigh Anne reenters to see Michael sitting at the dining room
table, alone, not touching his plate.
Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and

She finds one shirt, holds it out.

This isn't atrocious.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
This one? This is the one you

He nods, completely sure.
Ladies who lunch. The right sort doing their thing. Leigh
Anne sits at a table with three friends, BETH, ELAINE and
SHERRY. They sip on lemon water and nibble at salads.
BETH
The best part about Paris was the

LEIGH ANNE
Any of y'all spent much time on the
other side of town?
ELAINE
On the freeway.
SHERRY
Where exactly are you talking
about?
LEIGH ANNE
Alabama Street... Hurt Village.
BETH
Hurt Village -- that sounds like a
threat.
LEIGH ANNE
You're not far off.
SHERRY
It would "hurt" me to go there.
ELAINE
It would certainly hurt your
reputation to go there.
BETH
(tongue in cheek)
I'm actually from there but didn't
mind hard work and look where I am
now.
LEIGH ANNE
Eating an eighteen dollar salad.
BETH
And it's a little soggy to be
honest.
SHERRY
Such a shame.
BETH
(re: her salad)
Yes it is.

SHERRY
Civil rights was responsible for
some good things but those programs
- building ugly, low cost housing.
I mean how could you be creative if
you lived there? It's stifling.
ELAINE
Did you know that black men were
employed at a higher rate before
those programs? It's a fact.
BETH
They're not "black", Elaine. The
term du jour is African-American.
ELAINE
And what if they're from Jamaica,
or like Bermuda.
SHERRY
Then they're BerMUDian-Americans.
They all cringe and laugh.
ELAINE
So, why are you asking about the
projects, Leigh.Anne? Another one
of your charities?
BETH
A project for the projects. That's
catchy. Money would raise itself.
(off their laughs)
Don't laugh. Count me in, Leigh
Anne.
And they laugh harder. Leigh Anne smiles, biting her lip.
SJ and Michael sit at the island doing their homework.

talks on his cell...
SEAN

They're gonna get rid of those
stores in Florida... I'll look it
over now but I need the sales
figures by tomorrow morning.
SJ
Dad, you remember how to diagram
sentences?
SEAN
Nah.
Sean starts to leave, then stops at the door, turns around,
sighs and walks over. He leans in over Michael.
SEAN (CONT'D)
Let's see...
MICHAEL
You don't have to help.
(off Sean's. look)
I mean if you're busy or somethin'.
SEAN
I know.
(points to page)
Think of a sentence like a football
team. This is a noun here, see?
That's like the team name or what
they're known for - whether they're
a running team or a passing team.
And this is the verb. That's what
makes 'em go - like a star player --
maybe a quarterback, maybe a
running back. And this is an
adjective - everybody oohs and ahs
over adjectives but they're not as
important as verbs.
SI
They're like wide receivers.

Not exactly.
They all laugh.

Leigh Anne watches, fixated on the image of the three. Sean
has an arm on Michael's shoulder. She smiles, almost sadly.
Leigh Anne hands over clean sheets and pillows to Michael,
who starts to make the bed.
LEIGH ANNE
Do you want to stay here, Michael?
He keeps working.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Because if you want to... stay...
for awhile... longer... I'll try
and find some time to figure out a
bedroom for you.
He stops, turns to her. She walks over, examines the
structure of the couch. It sags a bit.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
I mean, look at this, you've
practically ruined a.ten thousand
dollar couch.
She moves closer to him. Her face softens.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Do you want to stay here, Michael?
MICHAEL
I don't want to go anyplace else.
She's a bit befuddled by the response.

Well,... alright then.
Leigh Anne sits in a chair reading through Michael's file.
LEIGH ANNE
I see here on the admission that
we're Michael's contact for medical
emergencies?
Mrs. Smith (from the admissions meeting) sits with her.
MRS. SMITH
Sean wrote that in last week. We
needed a contact number and the
ones listed weren't in service.
LEIGH ANNE
Love that man.
Leigh Anne pulls out another sheet, hands it over...
LEIGH ANNE (CONT`D)
What's this?
MRS. SMITH
The state makes schools measure for
career aptitude in eighth grade. It
came with his'file.
LEIGH ANNE
They try to figure out what a kid's
going to be in the eighth grade?
What does. it say about Michael?
Mrs. Smith nods and reads over Michael's results.
MRS. SMITH
Doesn't look promising. Spatial
relations - third percentile..
Ability to learn - fifth
percentile.

It's funny though. He tested in
the 98th percentile in one
category.

Leigh Anne smiles and hands the file back.
MRS. SMITH (CONT'D)
It's just so sad.
Leigh Anne considers this, then...
LEIGH ANNE
Yes, it is sad. So sad. But he
either doesn't know it or doesn't
think so and it's my job, and your
job, to make sure he doesn't find
out.
(off Mrs. Smith's look)
Michael Oher doesn't feel sorry for
himself and I'll be damned if he
starts to because of the way we
treat him.
(again off her look)
"Darned."
Now turned into Michael's room, with an armoire, a chest of
drawers, night stands, the whole nine yards. The bed is a
massive futon in an ornate stand.
Leigh Anne and Michael stand in the doorway.
LEIGH ANNE
I had to put half my samples in
storage but well, anyway, back
there's a desk.
(points as she talks)
Chest o'drawers. Night stand.
Lamps. Alarm clock. Bed. Sean
says a lot of pro athletes use
futons if they can't find a big
enough bed.
Michael doesn't dare touch anything, just stares in awe.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Well, try it out. See if it feels
okay.
He gingerly moves to the bed; touches it.

Never had one before.
LEIGH ANNE

A room to yourself?
MICHAEL
A bed.
We can see this unsettles her. She turns away a bit, trying
to contain herself.
LEIGH ANNE
Well, you got one now.
She leaves the room, walks down the hall and enters --
She.closes the door behind her, sits on the bed and starts to
tear up. She fights it unsuccessfully.

Michael stands, unsure what to do.
Mrs. Boswell gives Michael - in a RED AND BLUE RUGBY SHIRT -

SI
All you want. It's awesome.
MICHAEL
What do y'all do with the leftover

Michael's grades improved enough
that he can do spring'training for
football in March.
LEIGH ANNE
Isn't that great?
SI
Oh, man, you are gonna crush some
people!
Michael almost smiles, a little unsure.
Leigh Anne finds the book she's looking for and walks through
the stacks looking for her kids, plus Michael. She finds
them all together in the children's section, laughing.
LEIGH ANNE
Come on, your dad's already PO'ed.
Collins holds up a book. Sendak's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE.
COLLINS
Remember this one, Mom? You read

She softens, walks over, takes the book.
LEIGH ANNE
"And he gnashed his terrible teeth

He just stares at her, the answer obvious.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
No one ever...

Would that be okay with you?
MICHAEL
I don't know where he stays.
LEIGH ANNE
When's the last time you saw him,
Michael?
MICHAEL

Collins sits on the floor in the hallway near a door, smiling
sadly and secretly listening to ---
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
"Once upon a time in Spain, there
was a little bull --"

A strange sight. Leigh Anne, SJ and Michael all sit on
Michael's huge futon as Leigh Anne reads THE STORY OF
FERDINAND. No one enjoys this more than Leigh Anne...
LEIGH ANNE
"...and his name was Ferdinand.
All the other little bulls he lived
with would run and jump and butt
their heads together, but not
Ferdinand. He liked to sit just
quietly and smell the flowers"...

charity's the Lord's work but...

He won't talk about it. He's like
an onion; you have to peel it a
layer at a time.

Not if you use a knife. What if we
sent him to a child psychologist?
SEAN
Do you really expect Big Mike --
LEIGH ANNE
MICHAEL ---
SEAN
-- expect Michael to lie down and
talk about his childhood like he's
Woody Allen or something? Michael's
gift is his ability to forget.
He's mad at no one and doesn't
really care what happened in the
past.
This puts her on her heels.

There's very little on Michael.
Most of his files have been lost.
LEIGH ANNE
What is in there?
RONALD
A few case notes.
(holds one sheet up)
This one describes an incident
where officers forcibly removed
Michael and six half-siblings from
Denise Oher's care when Michael was
seven. Quite a scene evidently.
They had to split up the kids. And
it's far from the worst.

Dunno, but if you find her we have
a bunch more files we could add to.

At least a dozen, probably more.
With her drug arrest record my

remember.
Leigh Anne absorbs this.
LEIGH ANNE
We'd need her permission though,
.right?
RONALD
No. Michael is a ward of the
state. Just apply and get a Judge
to sign off on it.
LEIGH ANNE
So you would give him away without
even telling his mother?
Ronald shrugs.
Leigh Anne sits on the edge of a filthy couch and eyes.the

Denise emerges from the back of the apartment, adjusting a
wig on her head, making herself "presentable."
DENISE OHER
Awhile back. This is temporary.
Friends let me stay here.
LEIGH ANNE
When did you last see Michael?
DENISE OHER
Iono. We might have some wine in
the kitchen, if...
LEIGH ANNE
No, no that's very kind but...
DENISE OHER
How many foster kids you got living
with you?
LEIGH ANNE
Oh, I'm not a foster parent to
Michael. We were just helping him
out.
DENISE OHER
State don't pay you nothing?
LEIGH ANNE
No.
DENISE OHER
And he lives with you?
(Leigh Anne nods)
And you feed him?.
(ANOTHER NOD)
Buy him clothes, too?
LEIGH ANNE
When I can find them in his size.
DENISE OHER
You a fine Christian lady.
LEIGH ANNE
I try to be.
DENISE OHER
This is all real nice what you're
doing, but don't be surprised if
one day you wake up and he gone.

LEIGH ANNE
What do you mean?
DENISE OHER
He's a "runner". That's what the
state called him after they took
him from me.
(off her look)
Every foster home they sent him to,
he'd slip out the window at night
and come looking for me. No matter
where I was that boy would come
find me, take care of me.
(AN EXPLANATION)
I've had some . health problems.
LEIGH ANNE
Mrs. Oher, was Michael born under a
different name?
Denise tries to remember. After a few seconds...
DENISE OHER
Proctor. That was his Daddy's last
name.
LEIGH ANNE
Where is he, the father, if you
don't mind me asking?
DENISE OHER
Ain't. seen him since he left.
LEIGH ANNE
And when was that?
DENISE OHER
Week after Mike was born.
LEIGH ANNE
Do you have Michael's birth
certificate?
Denise sighs, looks around at the mess, shakes her head. And
then, unexpectedly, starts to cry softly.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
It's okay, Mrs. Oher.. I'll figure
it out.
Leigh Anne walks over, kneels and takes Denise's hands.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
You'll always be Michael's Mama.
Would you like to see him?
DENISE OHER
No... Not this way.
LEIGH ANNE
People lose birth certificates.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
DENISE OHER
It's Williams.
(off Leigh Anne's look)
His last name's Williams. Couldn't
even remember who the boy's father
is.
Leigh Anne bites her lip'and puts her arms around Denise, who
hugs back.
DISSOLVE TO:
The entire Tuohy family sits with Michael at the table.
SEAN
Michael, we have something to ask
you.
MICHAEL
What?
SEAN
Leigh. Anne and I would like to
become your legal guardians.
MICHAEL
What's that mean?
LEIGH ANNE
Well, what it means is, we want to
know if you'd like to be a part of
this family?
Michael looks to a grinning SJ, to Collins who nods and
smiles, then to Leigh Anne...

Students seated, including Michael, listen to Bob, who stands
at the front of the classroom.
BOB
You are now seniors.
Congratulations. But with that
distinction comes responsibility.
This will be one of your tougher
courses because my job is to
prepare you, at least most of you,
for the rigors of college Freshman
English. You are each holding a
class study guide which details
assignments. I won't remind you
what is due and when. Read the
materials and come prepared. At
the end of the year you will each
choose one of our literature
assignments and present a written
dissection of the piece.
The faces in the classroom tell us this is a tough course.
73
Dozens of.condiment jars and bottles are lined up on the
table. SJ has the football playbook open and is explaining
formations to Michael.
SI
See, you're the ketchup, here at
Left Tackle. On the weakside.
MICHAEL
I'm not that weak, SJ.
SI
it just means there are more
blockers on the other side. It's a
compliment, really.
MICHAEL
A compliment for a condiment.
SJ
(CHUCKLES)
Good one.
(back to work)
So the first play is simple.
"Gap." It just means you block
whoever is in front of you, or the
person on your inside shoulder if
you're not covered by a defender.
(points to condiments)
I'll be the running back and you
show me what you're supposed to do.
Ready... . Hike!
SJ, using both hands, moves Cayenne pepper back a bit, then
"hands off" to Cinnamon who "runs" toward Michael (Ketchup).
Michael moves the bottle forward, pushing back Mustard, then
Relish, as well as toppling a bottle of Vanilla Extract.
SJ (CONT'D)
Open lane to the end zone. All
there is to it.
Si slides Cinnamon forward. The bottle flies off the end of
the table and crashes on the ground just as --
Leigh Anne walks down the stairs, purse in hand --

No problem. Actually, Mom, we were
waiting for you. The new Madden
came out and me and Michael want to
go get it.
LEIGH ANNE
Honey, I've got a meeting in ten
minutes.
MICHAEL
I'll drive.

Michael drives while SJ searches for music on the radio.
SI
Look for Walker Street. That's
where we take a left.
Si finds a hip-hop station and they both groove to the beat,
dancing in the seats.
SJ (CONT`D)
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
As the beat reaches a crescendo --
Michael instinctively throws a big arm in front of SJ as --
THE-truck CRASHES into the side of a VAN.

Hello ...
The look on her face changes --
A massive traffic jam. Leigh Anne pulls her car right onto
the median, gets out and starts running. She passes stopped
cars and weaves past bystanders on her way to:
THE COLLISION INTERSECTION
As she approaches she sees -- Michael's truck -- the front end
is smashed -- The Van - its side caved in -- And --
Michael sitting on the curb, crying. She races over --
LEIGH ANNE
Michael!
He looks up, sobbing.
MICHAEL
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!
LEIGH ANNE
Where's SJ?!
MICHAEL
(POINTS)
Go help him! Please go help him!
Leigh Anne turns to see a group of PARAMEDICS kneeling around
a body. She gasps, races over and looks down at --

LEIGH ANNE AND PARAMEDIC - MINUTES LATER
While the paramedics attend to an obviously fine SJ, Leigh
Anne and a FIREMAN eye the deflated airbag.
FIREMAN
An airbag deploys at 200 miles per
hour. Your son's too small to sit
in the front seat.
LEIGH ANNE
He's okay, though, right?
FIREMAN
Busted lip, some facial bruising.
When an airbag strikes a child his
size it usually means a fractured
face, a broken neck or worse. It's
almost like the airbag started at
him then changed direction.
Defective or something. Very, very
lucky.
Leigh Anne nods thanks and looks to Michael, still on the
curb, eyes on the ground. She walks over, kneels down.
LEIGH ANNE
Michael, it wasn't your fault. It
could have happened to anybody..
He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices --
HIS ARM - red, bleeding, a large burn from the wrist all the
way up to the sleeve, which is also singed.
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
Michael, your arm... what happened?
He looks up and into her eyes...
MICHAEL
I stopped it.

Coach Cotton is addressing his team before the game.
COTTON
On the schedule it says this is a
home game but don't be deceived,
gentlemen. Three fourths of the
people in the stands are here from
Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy
and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your
helmets on 'til you're on the

COTTON (CONT'D)
Oh, one more thing. The reason
Milford traveled all that way to
come here is they expect to whup
your ass. Whup your ass and have a
party in your house. Whup your
ass, have a party in your house and
piss on your mama's new couch. Is
that gonna happen?
The team erupts with a chorus of NO'.s and HELL NO!s.

The assistant hands over the distinctive DVD marked MICHAEL

You might want to open one up.
They arrive at an empty office where Michael sits. He stands

TOM LEMMING
Wow. Just wow.
Lemming breaks out a measuring tape and smiles.
Sean and Bert stand outside and talk...

Tom Lemming runs the biggest

TOM LEMMING
Mike, I came all the way from
Chicago just to see for myself.
And now that I have, I'd like to
extend to you an invitation to play
in the Army High School All
American game at the end of the

He places an application on the desk. Michael stares at it.
The door opens and Lemming comes out shaking his head.
TOM LEMMING
I don't want to offend but... does
Mike have special needs?
SEAN
Well, he eats a lot.
TOM LEMMING
No, I meant, is he mentally... off?
SEAN
No, no, he's just...
COTTON
Shy. Really shy.
TOM LEMMING
Because the only thing he said to
me was "No." Said it three times;
every time I asked him if he'd like
to play in the Army All Star game.
I get lobbied by every player,
every father, every coach to get
into this game.

LEIGH ANNE
Did you know that to be eligible

Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA?
SEAN
Really?
LEIGH ANNE
His ACT is low and I don't see him
doing any better if he retakes it.
SEAN
What's his GPA now?
LEIGH ANNE
1.76.
SEAN
Not bad really, when you consider
where he started.
LEIGH ANNE
He needs to make A's this year.
(off Sean's laugh)
I'm serious. And that might not
even be enough.
SEAN
So he goes to Junior College.
LEIGH ANNE
Most inner city kids that go to JC

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
And these. Fifty of 'em.
SEAN
Any from Ole Miss?
LEIGH ANNE
They won't recruit until they hire
a new coach. But none of it
matters unless he makes his grades.
SEAN
So, what do we do?
Leigh Anne speaks to the assembled teachers.
LEIGH ANNE
So here's the plan. E-mail me all
assignments and let me know what
Michael has to do to make an "A".
There is laughter in the room.

doubts.
LEIGH ANNE
I appreciate your honesty, Miss
Sue.
MISS SUE
What's the situation with Michael?
LEIGH ANNE
He needs to do better in school.
MISS SUE
Obviously. But why the big push?
LEIGH ANNE
He's in line for a football
scholarship if he gets his grades
up.
MISS SUE
Is he considering Ole Miss?
LEIGH ANNE
He'd better be.
MISS SUE
I'd love to work with him.
LEIGH ANNE
When do you want to start?

Big.

A brain.
MISS SUE
A brain. Full of knowledge - like
a file cabinet with maps; shortcuts
for figuring things out. You will
learn this, Michael Oher because
I'm here to help you use those maps
and reach your destination. Like
Sacagawea helped Lewis and Clark.
MICHAEL
Sacagawea?

things they're famous for?

They work with the FBI to study the
effects of the soil on decomposing
body parts.
Michael is a bit lost.
MISS SUE (CONT'D)
When they find a body the police
want to know how long they've been
dead. The fine department at
Tennessee helps them. They have
lots of body parts - arms, legs,
hands - from hospitals and medical
schools. Do you know where they

Right underneath the football
field.
Michael's eyes widen a bit.

So, while it's fine and dandy to

ED ORGERON
Yes 'm.
LEIGH ANNE
LSU is out. Everybody knows
Saban's going to the NFL. So when
he comes for his visit to Ole Miss,
don't take him to some titty bar
and give him tequila shots. He'll
have nightmares for weeks. Feed
him Italian - he likes Fettucine
Alfredo - take him to a movie - but
not Chainsaw massacre because he'll
just cover his eyes - and put him
to bed by ten. You got it?
ED ORGERON
Yes'm. What about Tennessee?
LEIGH ANNE
It breaks my heart but they're
still in the hunt. Fulmer offered
SJ a sweet deal.

proud, come to Oxford, get that
sheepskin and help us win the SEC.
Michael nods, turns to SJ. Before SJ can raise his hand --
ED ORGERON (CONT'D)
And for you, Si, here's what I can
do. At Ole Miss we have The Grove

it before the game, surrounded by
thousands of fans. It's a sacred
ritual. And I'm in front.

Right now Michael's doing C minus,
D plus work. His best chance at

at the end of the year. It counts
for a third of his grade.
LEIGH ANNE
That's it. We're sunk.
Miss Sue works with Michael at the table.
MISS SUE
Why not write about "Great
Expectations"? You're a lot like
Pip. He was poor, an orphan and

MICHAEL
You're kidding?
SEAN
No. It's a great story.
MISS SUE
It's a poem.
SEAN
"Forward the Light Brigade!"
That's like the offense. "Charge

Michael opens his notebook, picks up a pen.
MICHAEL (V.0.)
Courage is a hard thing to figure.
You can have courage based on a
dumb idea or a mistake, but you're
not supposed to question adults, or

you either do something or you
don't. It's who you are and maybe
who you want to be. If you die
trying for something important then
you have both honor and courage and
that's pretty good.
Bob sits at his desk, reading Michael's. essay. As he turns
to the last page...
MICHAEL (V.0.)
I think that's what the writer was
saying. That you should try for
courage and hope for honor. And
maybe even pray that the people
telling you what. to do have some,
too.
Bob, visibly moved, sets down the essay and smiles.
Graduation day and Sean sits beside an empty seat in the
quick filling auditorium. He sees Leigh Anne marching up the
aisle, a big smile on her face. she pushes down the row and
plops down in the seat next to him.
SEAN
What?
LEIGH ANNE
2.52.
(off Sean's' look)
Michael's final GPA. Got it off
Paul's computer. He did it, Sean.
He did it!
Sean grins, then...
SEAN
Wait a minute. You broke into the
principal's computer?

She ignores him and opens her program, letting Sean know that
is precisely what she did.
Graduation ceremonies. Paul Sandstrom reads the names and
the graduates move across the stage to get their diplomas.
As each student walks across the stage a BABY PICTURE of their
is PROJECTED.
SANDSTROM
Michael Jerome Oher.
Even though no one is supposed to clap, a spontaneous round
of APPLAUSE gives Michael pause as he accepts his diploma.
Projected behind him is a picture of the cutest African-
American infant the world has ever seen.
ON SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE
SEAN
Where'd you find a baby picture of
Michael?
LEIGH ANNE
Scanned it off an Internet ad for a
toddler boutique.
(off his look)
Tell a soul and I'll rip your
tongue out.
IN THE CROWD: The Tuohys, Big Tony, Miss Sue, Bob and the
other teachers all clap.
Leigh Anne and Sean go over Ole Miss pamphlets with Michael.
LEIGH ANNE
You'll be living in Deaton Hall --
here. You'll have a meal plan and
you'll go to Johnson commons to
eat.
SEAN
Johnson Commons has all you can eat
self-serve ice cream.
MICHAEL
As much as you want?
SEAN
Yep, that's how Mama put on her
freshman ten.
Leigh Anne rolls up a pamphlet and whacks him hard on her way
to answer a RINGING PHONE.
LEIGH ANNE
Hello... This is Mrs. Tuohy...
As she listens she gives Sean a look - "This isn't good".
Leigh Anne walks with Michael.
LEIGH ANNE
They just want to ask you a few
questions. You've got nothing to
hide, Michael.
They arrive at a door, open it.
112
Sits Investigator Granger in the room we've seen before. She
rises, professional, but not smiling.
GRANGER
Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher? My name is
Jocelyn Granger and I'm the
Assistant Director of Enforcement
for the NCAA.
LEIGH ANNE
Please call me Leigh Anne.
Leigh Anne shakes her hand and she and Michael move to the
chairs.
GRANGER
Mrs. Tuohy, I'd prefer to speak
with Michael alone.
LEIGH ANNE
How long will this take?
GRANGER
Awhile.
Michael starts rubbing his knees, nervous as hell.
LEIGH ANNE
Michael, I'll be outside.
Leigh Anne pecks his cheek and exits, giving Michael one last
look before she leaves.
The interrogation is ongoing...
GRANGER
Your parents are friends with Coach
Bert Cotton, correct?
MICHAEL
Coach is a good guy.
GRANGER
Were you aware that Coach Cotton is
accepting a job at Ole Miss?
(Michael shakes his head)
And that this job offer came after
you signed with them?
(no response from Michael)
Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian
went to Ole Miss.
MICHAEL
He played basketball.
GRANGER
And Mrs. Tuohy attended Ole Miss as
well.
MICHAEL
She was a cheerleader.
GRANGER
Is it safe to say that Ole Miss is
their favorite school?
(MICHAEL NODS)
Do they like any other
Universities?
(MICHAEL SHRUGS)
What about, say Tennessee?
MICHAEL
They can't stand Tennessee.
GRANGER
So they wouldn't be happy if you
chose to play football there?
MICHAEL
No.
GRANGER
And your tutor...
(CONTINUED)
114
187 CONTINUED: 187
MICHAEL
Miss Sue.
GRANGER
Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.
(MICHAEL NODS)
Did Miss Sue try to persuade you to
attend Ole Miss?
(MICHAEL NODS)
Did you know that the Tuohys make
generous donations to Ole Miss?
That even Miss Sue makes donations?
That the:Tuohy's have a condo in
Oxford so they can attend as many
athletic events as possible? That,
in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy
are by our definition "boosters."
MICHAEL
What's that mean?
GRANGER
A booster is someone with an
abnormal interest in a school's
sports. Someone who-contributes
financially to the University's
athletic program.
Michael doesn't answer, just keeps rubbing his knees. Then
comes the part we've heard before...'
GRANGER (CONT'D)
Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?
(NO RESPONSE)
Mr. Oher?...
MICHAEL (V.0.)
GRANGER
Do you know, do you understand why
I'm here?
MICHAEL (V.0.)
To... investigate.
GRANGER
Yes. To investigate. I'm here to
investigate your odd...
predicament. Do you find it odd?
Your predicament?

GRANGER (CONT'D)
(NO RESPONSE)
Michael?...
MICHAEL
Iono...
she sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents -
a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in.
She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him
out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window,
rubs his knees some more.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Can I... can I leave now?
GRANGER
(WITH FINALITY)
No. You can't.
Michael's building up anxiety by the second.
MICHAEL
What do you want, ma'am?
GRANGER
What I want, what my job is, is to
discern whether something untoward
occurred in your recruitment to Ole
Miss.
MICHAEL
Unto...
GRANGER
I want the facts. I need the
truth.
MICHAEL
I didn't lie...
GRANGER
And I want to know what you think
about all this.
MICHAEL
THINK ABOUT WHAT?!
It's the first time we've ever heard Michael raise his voice.
It echoes in the room. Granger lets it die before she leans
forward and continues...
(CONTINUED)
116
187 CONTINUED: 187
GRANGER
The NCAA fears that with your
recruitment a door might be opened
that boosters from lots of schools
in the south will become legal
guardians for young athletes
without means and funnel them to
their Alma Maters.
Michael still doesn't get it, shakes his head.
GRANGER (CONT'D)
I'm not saying I believe it and I'm
not saying I don't, but there are
many people involved with this case
who would argue that the Tuohys
took you in, fed you, clothed you,
paid for your private education --
MICHAEL
(almost to himself)
No...no...no...
GRANGER
-- bought you a car and paid for a
tutor all as part of a plan to
insure that you played football for
the University of Mississippi.
Now Michael understands. He stares at the floor for a long
time then quickly stands and makes for the door.
GRANGER (CONT'D)
Michael, we're not finished.
But he's gone.
Sean and Leigh Anne sit at the kitchen table while Collins
and SJ pace in the living room.
LEIGH ANNE
(on her cell)
Well if he comes by there let me
know. Thanks.
COLLINS
(ON PHONE)
Michael, please call me and let me
know you're okay.
LEIGH ANNE
Text him SJ.
SEAN
Keep it light. Tell him you're
gonna take his truck for a spin if
he doesn't get in touch.
SJ starts texting. Leigh Anne and Sean stare at each other.
(LATER)
Sean sits in bed and Leigh Anne paces.
LEIGH ANNE
I should have followed him.
SEAN
You had no way of knowing he'd
disappear.
LEIGH ANNE
Was he right?
(off Sean's look)
What he said about us?
SEAN
Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave
clothes to a boy who had one pair
of shorts. We gave him a bed. To
hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again
tomorrow.
(CONTINUED)

A191 CONTINUED: A191
LEIGH ANNE
What about the rest of it - all the
stuff we did to make sure he got a
scholarship? A scholarship to Ole
Miss.
SEAN
He could go wherever he wanted, he
knew that.
LEIGH ANNE
Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I
know for sure I never did.
Sean considers this, then beckons.
SEAN
Come here, honey.
She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her
forehead.
LEIGH ANNE
Am I a good person?
(off his look)
Not a joke. Not rhetorical.
SEAN
You're the best person I know.
Everything you do, you do for
others.
LEIGH ANNE
Why is that?
SEAN
(with a smile)
I have not a clue. You obviously
get some sick satisfaction from it.
She looks at him. There's truth in his words.
LEIGH ANNE
Sean... what if he never comes
back?
Shitty but with good electronics. There are maybe eight
people in the apartment - partying, drinking, getting high.
Michael steps inside. Alton points to a chair. A stoned out
couple smokes on the adjacent couch.
Next to them an INFANT cries in a broken down crib. In the
other corner of the room sits David, the young man we met
before. Michael nods and David nods back. Alton hands
Michael a beer.
ALTON
It's good to see you, Big Mike.
You lookin' fit. I heard you
playin' some ball.
MICHAEL
Yeah.
ALTON
But you know that rich kid football
ain't like the public school
league. People packing knives in
their socks. Back in the day I was
a quarterback. You knew that,
right? At MLK.
(CONTINUED)
121
193 CONTINUED: 193
MICHAEL
Yeah, I heard.
(TO DAVID)
You still playing ball over at the
JC?
DAVID
Naw.
ALTON
He with me now! I'll open a spot
for you, too.
DAVID
Got tired of going to class. Always
somebody tellin' me what to do.
ALTON
Turn it up, bitch!
David jumps up and cranks the volume on a RAP SONG until the
beat is bouncing off the walls. Michael sips the beer; rubs
his knees.
ALTON (CONT'D)
You stayin' to the other side of
town, that's what Dee Dee said.
Said you got a new Mama. She fine,
too. I seen her when she come to
see Dee Dee.
MICHAEL
She came here?
ALTON
She got any other kids? She got a
daughter?
(MICHAEL NODS)
You tap that?
Michael sets down the beer, rises to leave.
ALTON (CONT'D)
Where you going? Sit down. I
wanna hear about your fine white
sister. 'Cause I like me some
mommy/daughter.
MICHAEL
Shut up.
Alton steps in front of Michael, raises his hands ---

ALTON
Shutup?You tellin' me to shut
up?I'llcap your fat ass. Cap
yourass,drive east and pay a
visittoyour Cracker Mama and her
SWEETLITTLE --
Michael shoves him hard. Alton unprepared for the force,
flies back against the wall. On the ground he reaches in his
belt for his gun, but just as he gets it out --
Michael slaps it away. He picks up Alton and throws him
across the room. The party comes unhinged as Michael grabs
Alton, holds him against the wall with one hand while
pounding him with the other. Blood flies from Alton's face -
eighteen years of subdued rage coming out in seconds.
TWO OTHER GUYS grab Michael from behind and one --
STICKS A GUN IN MICHAEL'S TEMPLE
Michael screams like a banshee, spins, grabs them and tackles
them over the couch. An errant round FIRES into the ceiling.
A table flies and the crib smashes.
Michael looks to David, frozen in the corner, then over to
the SCREAMING child on the floor.
He grabs his head and heaves, trying to make it all stop -
the music, the screams, the crying. The shots PULSE to the
music and. are INTERCUT WITH:
Michael looks at the blood on his hands and shirt and
stumbles out of the room, terrified.
Leigh Anne stands at the doorway to Michael's empty, very
neat room. She stares, missing everything about him.
Leigh Anne drives around, looking for Michael at Wingate.
When she gets in she's so nervous she hyperventilates. Her
phone RINGS and she opens the tiny purse revealing nothing
more than a wallet and the phone. She recognizes the number
and answers...
LEIGH ANNE
Michael?!!!
MICHAEL'S VOICE
Mama?...
Michael is at another session with Jocelyn Granger.
MICHAEL
I'm sorry I left the other day.
GRANGER
You were pretty upset.
MICHAEL
You ask a lot of questions.
GRANGER
I'm trying to get to the bottom of
this.
MICHAEL
But all the questions you asked
were about why everybody else
wanted me to go to Ole Miss.
(CONTINUED)
127
203 CONTINUED: 203
GRANGER
Okay...
MICHAEL
You asked about everybody but me.
You never asked why I wanted to go
there.
GRANGER
Alright, fine, Michael... why do
you want to go to Ole Miss?
MICHAEL
It's where my family goes to
school. It's where they've always
gone to school.
Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just
almost, smiles.

As the family drives home from Ole Miss, we notice that Leigh
Anne is very still. And very content. She closes her eyes.
FADE TO BLACK.
