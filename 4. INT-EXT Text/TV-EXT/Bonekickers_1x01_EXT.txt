      Lightning strikesrevealing the BBCONE LOGO and then FIVE 
      CLOAKED MEN trudging the unforgiving road. Heads bowed. Two 
      riding the same thin horse - a mark of austerity. Remaining 
      three carrying a heavy structure hidden beneath muddy sheets.

      SUBTITLE: Larkhall, Somerset - October 1307

 Between the hospice and the childrens playground.

      Shadows in the trees - the party is being watched. They lower 
      their heavy icon to the ground.

      Thunder explodes and as if this is their cue, out of the 
      trees come the ambushing SARACEN WARRIORS. Their faces are 
      hidden behind black scarves - eyes that are dark and 
      fathomless.

    The CLOAKED MEN shout in subtitled Medieval French -  We re 
      under attack!  /  How can this be? Saracens!   Impossible!  / 
       It s an ambush! 

      These bowed men suddenly throw off their cloaks revealing 
      white robes emblazoned with red crosses and chain-mail that 
      flashes like dappled water.

      TEMPLARKNIGHTS!

      Their leader - JAQUES de SAINT-OMAR - strong and righteous.

                                  JAQUES DE SAINT-OMAR
                          (Medieval French /

                    How can this be? The Saracens are 
                    abroad! In the name of Christ and 
                    the Temple of Solomon, defend the 
                    Relic! 

    The SARACENS charge.

      JAQUES de SAINT-OMAR draws his sword. The blade is long and 
      narrow, the pommel simple. (But this sword is highly 
      significant throughout the annals of History.)

    The Templarcommander holds it aloft - a simple weapon but it 
      immediately inspires his KNIGHTS.

                    Crush the heathen! For the love of 
                    God!*

    The KNIGHTS draw their swords and engage the rushing 
      SARACENS. Lightning flashes plunge us into blazing light then 
      darkness so that the battle is seen in staccato bursts.

    De SAINT-OMAR wades in to battle. The butchery is raw and 
      real and close-quarters. Hacking and panting. Blood splashing 
      into the ground.

    Two of the TEMPLARSare cut down. They fall but don t die, 
    lie squirming in agony in the mud with a dying SARACEN.

      Another SARACEN charges. De SAINT-OMAR engages with him. 
      Sword-metal upon sword-metal. The effort for the SARACEN to 
      swing his blade is immense. De SAINT-OMAR S sword feels so 
      much lighter in his grasp. The Knight cuts the SARACEN down 
      then plunges the blade full into the man. Spurt of blood 
      geysers into the air.

                    Fall back! Protect the Relic!

    The three remaining KNIGHTS protect the covered icon.

    The SARACENS encircle them.

    The KNIGHTS kiss their fingertips and gently touch the hidden 
      cargo - a beam of wood is glimpsed.

                    For the love of God.*

    The SARACENS fall upon them.

    The final slaughter of the remaining KNIGHTS is watched 
      through nearby bushes. The POVof someone unknown whose 
      breath hitches with fear.

      CUT: The bodies of the three fallen KNIGHTS sprawled together 
    on the muddy ground. One of the men twitches and then is 
      still. The rain and mud begin to smother them ...

    We DESCEND TOWARDS the campus and pick out a lone figure 
      hurrying towards the lecture halls.

      A BUILDING CONTRACTOR refers to a sheet of planned housing 
      with his SUPERVISOR. The development sign is erected behind 
      them. The SUPERVISOR S heart sinks as two archaeologists 
      trudge towards him. All khakis and rain-hoods and North Face 
      gear. 

      PROFESSOR GREGORY PARTON - the slightly florid look of a man 
    for whom middle-age just makes him more interesting. Dirty 
      twinkle in his eye.

                    Oh God, you can see it in his eyes - 
                    job s worth. He ll be on our backs 
                    like a rutting grizzly. Still, on 
                    the up-side, there s a decent pub 
                    opposite. So that s lunch sorted.

    As they reach the SUPERVISOR, a battered mud-flecked Land 
      Rover is drawing up.

                    My mum. You want to put down your 
                    layer? That s fine. But you need 
                    your PPG16. Because these days 
                    layers require forms that show you 
                    aren t building on previous layers. 
                    So we haveto take a peek. At the 
                    layers. It s all about layers.

    She jumps out of the Land Rover accompanied by the excited

                    We have a mystery.

      GILLIAN snatches the silver coin. Inspects it with 
      excitement.

                                  GILLIAN 
                    Wow. Dirham. 14th century. What the 
                    hell s a Middle Eastern coin doing

                    Well, we have a Medieval riddle to 
                    solve. So we start digging.

    She jabs the toe-cap of her boot into the soil.

      VIVIENNE DAVIS pays her taxi driver and hurries eagerly 
      towards the picket-fence cordon around the new dig site.

      A university graduate, VIV is barely in her twenties - mixed 
      race. Baseball cap, khaki shorts and work boots which look 
      fetchingly large on her. Her rucksack jingles like a timpani.Bonekickers. Ep 1. Green Amendments. By Matthew Graham. 12.12.07.  6.


    The site now consists of a broad evaluation trench.STUDENTS 
      scrape at the soil with trowels. VIV grins eagerly as she 
      climbs over the fencing. Fragments of twisted bone and 
      carbuncled metal are placed in seed trays. It s hard, muddy 
      graft. GILLIAN S hand reaches out and finds a filthy old 
      ghetto-blaster. Queen -  Don t stop me now! I m having such a 
      good time. Having a ball! 

    The STUDENTS chuckle wearily before resuming work.

    VIV tries to get a proper look at GILLIAN - fascinated and 
      nervous. But GILLIAN has her back to her.

      - The KNIGHTS surrounded and then slaughtered.

    - A flash of supernatural light silhouetting a cross that

    She points to the same patch of innocent turf GILLIAN was

      A fresh trench has been opened by the team. A small CROWD OF 
      LOCALS watch from beyond the fence. A young hospice nurse 
      named HELENA brings a couple of PATIENTS outside to watch the 
      activity. The PATIENTS are in the last throes of cancer. 
      HELENA is attentive and caring.

      GILLIAN inches into the soil with her trowel. A length of 
      bone becomes visible. GILLIAN clears it. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

    An hour later. An aerial imaging Land Rover has been brought 
    in and positioned by the fresh trench. From its roof extends 
      a 15 meter pole with a remote-control HDcamera mounted on 
      top. 

    BEN stands at the back of the Land Rover, leaning over the 
      lap-top linked to the HDcamera.

                    Everyone. Here. Check this out.

      STUDENTS gather behind BEN as the overhead image appears on 
    the lap-top. They all gaze at the collection of human bones 
      spread out along the trench floor.

    VIV picks up part of a flapping sandal which almost comes 
      apart in her hands. The nurse HELENA loiters nearby.

                    It s exciting. Patients can t stop

                    Is that the other sandal there?

      Something sticking out of the soil. VIV looks for help but 
      everyone is busy. VIV isn t sure she is qualified but tries 
    to prize the object free. HELENA comes in to help and 
      together they slide the chunk of dense mottled wood loose of 
    the earth. It comes away with a jolt, sending both girls over 
    in the mud. Filthy. They giggle.

                                  VIV
                    Look at your finger ...

                    to seal up the find, protect the 
                    site with concrete and let them 
                    build on top.

                     Dear Edward, I know why we can t 
                    beat Bin Laden. He and his lot have 
                    faith. They may be wrong but at 
                    least they have that. Whereas we 
                    have the True Faith in Jesus but we 
                    don t stand up for it. And that is

                    would light a fire in all our

      GILLIAN and BEN - truly they can not believe what they are 
      seeing. A CROWD OF PEOPLE standing dutifully behind the 
      cordon in the gloaming, facing the site as though at an 
      altar. Some praying. Many looking sick or wheeling in sick 
      relatives. And men in trench coats (not JAMES or COLM) are 
      handing out white doves. The people take the doves and clasp 
      them tightly. GILLIAN realizes suddenly that the moment is 
      being taped. The camera has a White Wings logo.

      EDWARD LAYGASS moves through the crowd, a concerned hand on 
    the shoulder here, a cupping of a child s face there.

                    His manuscript is vague and I only 
                    found it by chance on the 
                    auctioneer s site. I don t think 
                    Stephen was considered very 
                    reliable. The rest of the order 
                    went out of their way to discredit 
                    him.

      I/E. LAND ROVER - MORNING 48282

      GREGORY drives. GILLIAN on the far side and VIV wedged 
      between them. BEN in the back. They listen to radio news.

                                  RADIO NEWS
                    The beheaded body of a young muslim 
                    student in the south of the city 
                    has sparked an outcry of anger and 
                    disgust from religious leaders 
                    across the country. As the Bishop 
                    of Birmingham meets with Muslim 
                    clerics today to discuss how best 
                    to tackle the growing fury amongst 
                    all religious factions of the city 
                    ...

      GILLIAN switches it off.

                    Floozy Seat.

      Every time GREGORY changes gear he has the perfect 
      opportunity to grope VIV S leg. She slaps his hand.

                                  GILLIAN (CONT'D)
                    Stephen carved this symbol onto the 
                    back of his crucifix. Why would he 
                    desecrate his own holy cross like 
                    that? 

                                  BEN
                    Because it referred to a place that 
                    was extra special? Extra holy?

                    He carved this symbol because it

                    Don t you get it? Stephen didn t 
                    survive the ambush, they let him 
                    live. He was a Grandmontine.And he

                    didn t agree with it. Everyone 
                    might have thought the Cross was 
                    going back to the Holy Land but it 
                    was still going to Garway.
