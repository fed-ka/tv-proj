      MAGGIE emerges, bundled up and ready for work.  She trudges 
      to her car, hoping she won t have to wrestle with the scraper 
      and is delighted to find that once again the job s been done 
      for her. This is the way to start the morning.


      TREVOR comes up the porch looking very much like a pizza 
      delivery guy.  He knocks.  And waits.  No response, but he 
      hears the sound of conversation and laughter from inside. 
      Spotting the window beside the door, he stretches to look in, 
      but can t quite see.  Standing up on the railing, and 
      grabbing the window frame, he can lean out a little further, 
      and finally gets a peek inside.

      angle - Andrew & an attractive blonde sitting on the floor at 
      the coffee table drinking white wine. Although not overtly 
      romantic, it certainly isn t poker with the guys. Just before 
      he loses his f ooting and tumbles into the bushes, Trevor 
      realizes Maggie s in a world of trouble.

                                                                          FADE OUT:


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    26.


                                      ACT THREE

                                                                            FADE IN:


      POV SHOT - MAGGIE & ANDREW

      kiss goodbye at the front door.  Andrew shuts the door and 
      Maggie heads for her car.  She looks up to see --                                                                                    37.



      REVERSE ANGLE - TIM

      watches from his car.  To his surprise, Maggie crosses over 
      to him and knocks on his window.  Maggie is two parts 
      sadness, one part disdain...

                                  MAGGIE
                    Do you like your job, Tim?

                                  TIM
                          (joyless)
                    Not always.  But it s important.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I love my job.  And I love Andrew.  
                    Your job is to spoil all that.  How 
                    is that important?

      She favors him with one more sad look and heads over to her 
      own car.  Tim, emotionless, rolls up his window again.


      MAGGIE goes out to her car.  Pauses, a bit disappointed, when 
      she discovers her windshield has not been de-iced.  She 
      shrugs and gets out her scraper.


      TIM carries a thermos out of his apartment.  When he gets to 
      his car, he s surprised to discover that his windows have 
      been de-iced.  He runs his hand down the windshield almost as 
      if he believes this is a mirage that s in danger of 
      disappearing.

                                  MAGGIE (O.S.)
                          (re: the windshield)
                    Nice surprise, huh?

      TIM s head whips up.                                                                                    48.



      REVEAL - MAGGIE

      thirty feet away, across the road, an ice scraper in hand.  
      She begins walking towards him.  Tim can only manage to nod.

                                  MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    No one s done that for me for... 
                    oh... how long ago did you quit, 
                    Tim?

                                  TIM
                            (uncomfortably)
                    Nine days ago.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Nine days.  Yeah.  Weird.  That s 
                    how long it s been since anyone s 
                    scraped my windshield.
                          (beat)
                    I always thought that Starry Night 
                    poster was Andrew s.

      TIM is speechless.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Why d you quit, Tim?

                                  TIM
                    Uh, that s complicated.  Lots of 
                    things.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Andrew said something about you 
                    being in love with someone at the 
                    hospital.

                                  TIM
                    Oh, yeah.  Well... there was that.

      MAGGIE now stands just on the other side of Tim s car.  She 
      smiles big. The cat s out of the bag.  Tim realizes there s 
      nothing to be nervous about.  For the first time in the 
      scene, he allows himself to smile.

                                  MAGGIE
                          (re: his thermos)
                    You already found a new job, huh?

                                  TIM
                    Yeah.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Whaddya say you call in sick.  Play 
                    hooky.  We could get to know each 
                    other.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
      CONTINUED:


      TIM opens his car door, unlocks the passenger door 
        electronically.

                                  TIM
                    I may not even call in.

      TIM and Maggie share a smile as they get in the car.  The 
      camera stays outside, we just hear them.

                                  MAGGIE
                    We ll stop at a payphone.

                                  TIM
                    That d probably be best.

      As the car pulls away, the final image is of her reaching up 
      and obliterating all semblance of the razor-sharp part in 
      Tim s hair.
