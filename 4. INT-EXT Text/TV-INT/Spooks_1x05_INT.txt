 
  The tent is a luxurious mix of traditional and ultra 
  modern. The lamps are state of the art, battery driven. 
  They throw romantic shadows. A fire burns in the centre. 
  There is a computer with a satellite dish turned to the 
  roof. 
 
  A servant is moving about arranging dishes of food before 
  cushions. 
 
  Two Englishmen recline on cushions: HAMPTON WILDER and 
  DICK MAYNARD. 
  HAMPTON WILDER - tall, slightly stooping, a mandarin 
  manner, very aware of his long hands, doe eyes that give 
  nothing away, a mouth that often has a little smile that 
  may be read as sardonic ... His enemies hate that smile. 
 
  DICK MAYNARD - fifty, not tall, fit with chunky 
    shoulders, sandy haired, of a fair complexion with an 
  open fresh face. He stands like a boxer; he has the Jack 
  Kennedy habit of touching the middle button of his 
  jacket. The immediate impression is of a warm, sound, 
  intelligent man. There is Yorkshire in his voice, 
  smoothed by education. 
 
  MAYNARD is in a suit. 
 
  WILDER is wreathed in Arabic clothing.

                                  LERMOV (O.S.) 
                                Wilder, Maynard! 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
          Our Russian friend is off his head. Where did 
                        the Sheikh get hold of him? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            His Highness chooses his friends carefully. 
            But once chosen, they find they re treated 
                              very well indeed. 
 
  He looks at two young men and two young women who are 
  sitting in the corner of the tent, grinning and smirking 
  at them. MAYNARD - sheepishly - is enjoying himself. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            If certain colleagues in my party could see 
                                      this! ... 
 
                                        WILDER 
              My lot have killjoys too. I find it best 
                          simply to lie about fun. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                      Yes ... 
 
  MAYNARD is having difficulty breaking eye contact with 
  one of the young women. 
 
                                MAYNARD (CONT D) 
                Though, Hampton, I do have the feeling 
                    something else is expected of us. 
 
                                        WILDER 
              People like us always raise expectations, 
                                      Richard. 
                                        (Low.) 
              There s a skill in knowing how to answer 
                                        them. 
 
  A beat. They are close. MAYNARD is looking at him. Then 
  he smiles. 
 
  And into the tent come men carrying weapons, led by the 
  SHEIKH - a large energetic man - LERMOV at his wide. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D) 
                  Your Highness, all to your liking? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 3
 

                                        SHEIKH 
                A wonder. A British weapon that works. 
 
  All laugh, too loudly. The SHEIKH shakes hands with 
  WILDER then with MAYNARD. MAYNARD shakes with LERMOV. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                      You are enjoying the desert? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                            It has much to offer. 
 
  As he does so one of the young men takes a photograph 
  with a flash camera. 
 
  LERMOV clicks his fingers and holds out his hands. The 
  two boys go to him and take his hands, smiling. There is 
  a great expectation in the tent. 
 
                                LERMOV (CONT'D) 
                Your Highness, Gentlemen, shall we ...? 
 
  WILDER stands. MAYNARD does not know what to do. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                That s for you. 
 
  He nods at the girls. 
 
  All the other men and the boys go out of the tent. 
  Laughter in the dark outside. MAYNARD looks at the girls 
  - who smile. 
 
  CAPTION:  NINE YEARS LATER.  
 
  1142 
 
  The car pulls up with a screech of tyres. The doors are 
  opened. DANNY gets out quickly. 
  To his lapel. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            We are in. Close the carpark. Number 1 here? 
 
  WILDER gets out of the car. HARRY is walking towards him, 
  TESSA a step behind him. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                              Well hello Harry. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Hello Hampton. This better be about something 
                                        big. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                How about the fall of the Government? 
 
  WILDER looks around at the grim surroundings. A look of 
  fear on his face. 
 
  Close up on his face. FREEZE. 
 
  CREDITS. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 7
 

  1145 
 
  There is a table with a white cloth, champagne bucket and 
  three glasses upon it. HARRY pushes by. 
 
  TESSA is sitting at the table. TOM is standing in a 
  corner, hands in his pockets. It s all deliberately 
  arranged to unnerve WILDER. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                And you are ... 
 
  TESSA does not smile or offer her hand. TOM stares back. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                I thought we d talk somewhere congenial. 
 
  He gestures towards the table. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                    Good Lord. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Champagne? 
 
  WILDER jerks his head toward TOM. 
 
                                      Why not? 
 
  TOM opening the bottle. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  No doubt you see through all this. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                              You re poisoning me? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                It s a new interrogation technique. To 
              disorientate the subject. What do you think 
                                  of it so far? 
 
  But it is getting to WILDER. 
 
                                        WILDER 
          I am not here for an interrogation. I am here 
                  at my own request. I think I ll go. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 8
 

  WILDER realises that, threateningly, DANNY is standing 
  close behind his shoulder. 
 
                                        TESSA 
          You must realise that you remain a Category A 
                                  security risk. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                          (Straight into her face.) 
                    Oh how I ve missed tough women. 
 
  1-0 to WILDER. TESSA is infuriated. 
 
  TOM has opened the champagne and has poured out three 
  glasses. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D) 
                              Thank you very much. 
 
  Taking the glass WILDER looks up at a CCTV camera in the 
  corner. Trained on the table. He smiles wryly to himself 
  and sips. He closes his eyes with pleasure as the first 
  alcohol for a long time hits him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    (To DANNY.) 
                              Thank you number 9. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                Oh. Right. Yeah. 
 
  He turns on his heel and goes to the staircase. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                    You call each other by numbers? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            It s the latest fad. Some youth in an Armani 
                  suit advising the Joint Intelligence 
                                      Committee. 
 
  Smiles. The smiles die. WILDER suddenly looks at TOM, who 
  is stony-faced. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                            I don t want him here. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              He s just a bit of muscle in case you ... 
                                    (To TOM.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 9
 

                  Thank you we can pour from now on. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Yes Sir. 
 
  TOM gives a little bow and turns away. WILDER puts his 
  glass on the table. 
 
                                        WILDER 
            Before we talk seriously, would you mind if 
                    we joined in a moment of prayer? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  You re joking. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                (Ignoring TESSA.) 
                          Will you do the honours? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                    Of course. 
 
  HARRY and WILDER hold their hands together and close 
  their eyes. HARRY gives a daggered glance at TESSA, who - 
  furious at all this - puts her hands together and closes 
  her eyes. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D) 
            Lord of all who sees all, look down this day 
                                      upon ... 
 
 
  DANNY runs through swing doors. 
 
 
  ZOE is at her desk. She has a listening device in her 
  ear. DANNY approaches at speed. 
 
  ZOE 
  Odd having the greatest living shit in your basement. 
 
  DANNY 
  Harry s gone overboard after that pysche ops seminar on 
    disorientation effects. 
  What are they doing? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Praying.

                                        WILDER 
                                        Amen. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Thank you for that, Hampton. Now could you 
                possibly tell us why you want to see us? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                      You don t think I m sincere. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  By their fruits ye shall know them. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                            Profound, for a spook. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  Jesus said it. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                  Matthew chapter seven verse twenty. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    I am beginning to lose patience. 
 
                                        WILDER 
            My trial was a deal with the Government, of 
                course. If I shut up and went down for 
              embezzlement, I wouldn t be prosecuted for 
            treason. But once in what is laughably called 
            the prison  system , I was ... How shall I 
                put this ... Overcome with a wholesome, 
              burning hatred for all the hypocrites who 
                couldn t get enough of me when I was the 
              rising star, and who wouldn t come near me 
                                  when I fell. 
                            So I wrote my memoirs. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                      Very full, very frank memoirs. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      How were you able to do that? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            Oh everything is possible in prison, number 
                                        ...? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 11
 

  The stony look from TESSA. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT D) 
                                    (To HARRY.) 
              It s a matter of distributing favours and 
                threats. Very like running a Government 
                                      Department. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          And the memoirs tell ...? 
 
                                        WILDER 
              Everything. Oh the parties, who slept with 
              who and that kind of thing. But at a more 
                        profound level I wrote oh ... 
                                (A casual air.) 
            How I tried to arrange another super gun for 
            Iraq, dealing through a Dutch intermediary 
                                        ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    Another ... 
 
                                        WILDER 
            ... didn t work out. But a lot did. Trade is 
            trade. Backstreet designer trainers, sold off 
          the back of a lorry, uranium-tipped anti-tank 
              missiles sold on the sly to a middle east 
            customer, smuggled out with a legit cargo ... 
            What s the difference? The illegal trade in 
              arms is worth millions for this country. A 
            blind eye is turned in all kinds of corners. 
            And of course my main client was the Royal 
                family of the Confederated Gulf States. 
 
  HARRY is alarmed. It makes him very cool. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      You wrote about Sheik Rasul? 
 
                                        WILDER 
              Oh yes, a friend of Britain in a sea of 
              fundamentalist Islam? He can do no wrong - we 
              sell arms to him officially. All I did was 
              slip him the hard stuff under the counter. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            For a fat commission. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                (Ignores that.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 12
 

                            A great host, you know. 
              In my memoirs I recount ... Rather well I 
              think ... how one beautiful night in the 
                  desert, I corrupted a fellow British 
                  politician into the Sheikh s service. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                                    Ask me who. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Who? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                Richard Maynard. 
 
  It s a bombshell. WILDER savours the moment. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D) 
                Oh yes. He was like an overripe peach, 
                                  falling open. 
                        (A gesture with his hands.) 
                                      Squelch. 
 
                                        TESSA 
          Dick Maynard is one of the most respected men 
                                in Parliament. 
 
                                        WILDER 
              He s the Prime Minister s favourite in the 
            Government certainly, the bosom friend, but 
                respected? Most of his party think he s a 
                                sanctimonious shit. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      This is just vile slander ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Yes thank you Tessa. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                (Turns to TESSA.) 
            Tessa? Tess? Thomas Hardy s heroine? She knew 
                        the world was rotten fruit. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            What exactly did you write about golden boy, 
                                Richard Maynard? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            How he continues my work. How he works hand 
                in glove with the Sheikh s Mr Fixit. A 
              Russian named Sergai Lermov. Ex KGB. Do you                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 13
 

                                    know him? 
 
  They do. They are stony-faced. 
 
 
  TOM is now upstairs with the team. ZOE and DANNY are 
  listening in. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                        Lermov? That bucket of filth? 
 
                                        TOM 
              What was A section s last report on him? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            He got back from a trip to Amsterdam three 
                                    days ago. 
 
 
  WILDER is enjoying himself. TESSA and HARRY have 
    regrouped. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            If you want revenge, why tell us this? Why 
                                  not publish? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            And be damned? Yes, that was my plan. I am 
            single, I am childless, I have only myself to 
            ruin. So I hid the manuscript. I was to come 
          out of gaol, go abroad, publish it in France, 
            Holland? Make a second fortune in this life. 
                                    (A beat.) 
              But as my sentence wore on I ... Will you 
            understand this? No you won t. Christ began 
                              to work in me ... 
 
  TESSA looks up to the ceiling -  oh spare me this ...  
 
                                WILDER (CONT D) 
            I wrestled with Him. Then, five weeks ago, I 
              let Him into my life. And now I bitterly 
                          repent writing the book. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        Then why didn t you burn it? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 14
 

                                        WILDER 
                                      I couldn t. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Why not? 
 
                                        WILDER 
            I went to its hiding place but it had gone. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Gone? 
 
                                        WILDER 
          It may come as a surprise to you that prisons 
                            are full of thieves. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Did you report this to the Governor? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                Don t be absurd. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              You could have asked to see us when this 
                                      happened. 
 
                                        WILDER 
            I had to stay on the right side of cons. I 
              couldn t have anything looking like filth 
            near me. Particularly MI5 filth. This is the 
            first opportunity. I am doing my duty. I m 
                asking you to find it and destroy it. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        What you wrote. Is it true? 
 
  There is a moment of watchfulness from WILDER. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                                      Oh yes. 
                                (Very serious.) 
            Illegal arms dealing in my day was an almost 
            innocent activity. But now ... Weapons sold 
              by a Cabinet Minister, reaching terrorist 
              groups, being turned back on the country of 
              manufacture? Who could bear the scandal? The 
            Government would fall. And would America ever 
            trust us again? It s for Downing Street to 
            deal with Maynard, privately. Do not let my 
                wretched scribblings wreck my country.

  HARRY is thinking  he s good, he s very good.  
 
                                        HARRY 
              So. Where in the prison did you hide this 
                            political neutron bomb? 
 
                                        WILDER 
                          (Sipping champagne again.) 
                      I have become a keen gardener.

  ZOE is laying photographs before HARRY. She has a medium 
  file and a very fat file. 
 
    A photograph: WILDER and MAYNARD shaking hands with a 
  robed figure. Smiles all round. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            Hampton Wilder and Richard Maynard did go on 
            a visit to the Confederated Gulf States nine 
            years ago. It was a general goodwill business 
            trip, cross party. It sealed the delivery of 
          some British small arms, nothing spectacular. 
                  And there was a night in the desert. 
 
    A photograph. It shows the moment already seen in the 
  tent: MAYNARD shaking hands with the SHEIKH. HARRY peers 
  at it. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
                        Maynard s file. And Wilders. 
 
  She puts the file down on his desk but has not finished. 
  There are three more for WILDER she unloads from a box. 
 
  HARRY stares at the pile with immense weariness. 
 
  She gives him a chit to sign. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT'D) 
                                  Sign please. 
 
  HARRY signs but looks up when ZOE goes into a spiel by 
  rote. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
            No files are to be left unattended on desks. 
          All files are to be locked away in lockers at 
                the end of the day. Registry is to be 
              informed if files are to be retained more 
                          than twenty-four hours. 
 
  HARRY stares at her. ZOE goes bright red. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
            Sorry, it s the new security clamp down. We 
                  have to ... Say that. To each other. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            (The ghost of a sigh.) 
                                    Yes we do. 
                              (Signing the chit.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 17
 

          You know you are one of the brightest and the 
                                        best. 
 
  ZOE is very embarrassed by this. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        I ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          It can be hard to bear. 
 
  She hesitates, unable to say anything. Then she turns to 
  go. 
 
 
  ZOE is going home. She is locking papers in her locker. 
  She turns. TESSA waylays her. Big smile. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  Everything OK? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Fine. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        (Low.) 
              The money from that agent of mine, is it 
                                        safe? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                You mean the agent that doesn t exist? 
 
  ZOE looks around. She is horrified this conversation is 
  happening in the middle of the grid. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        It s a deep operation, Zoe. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Right. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                  Don t interfere with it, that s all. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              The money s safe. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Oh! You haven t spent it yet? 
 
  Smiles again and sweeps off towards the corridor. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 19
 

  ZOE is cowed. She turns for a moment toward HARRY s 
  office but sees that it is empty. She turns and walks 
  hurriedly towards the pods. 
 
 
  HARRY and TESSA passing. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Any result from the rose bed? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Dope, five knives, and a collection of 
                pornographic videos. No deadly memoirs. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                    That s because they don t exist. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  Why so sure? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                    Because Hampton Wilder is a liar. 
 
  HARRY is taken back by her fervour. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  He got under your skin, didn t he. 
 
  TESSA finds her feeling difficult to describe. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                There s a sense of ... evil about him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        (Not taking her seriously.) 
                MI5 doesn t  do  evil. Just treachery, 
                            treason and armageddon. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            The man lies as naturally as the rest of us 
                          breathe. Oh what the hell. 
 
  She turns to go. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          You don t get it Tessa. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    Get what? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 20
 

                                        HARRY 
                It s not a question of whether Wilder s 
              memoirs are telling the truth about Richard 
              Maynard, or even if they exist. It s about 
              the damage the very idea of them can do. 
                          Scandal works like that. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              Well then Wilder s way ahead. He s got us 
            running around, digging up prison gardens and 
              fingering the Prime Minister s best friend. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              So what do you suggest we do? Ignore the 
            whole thing? We have to check Maynard out. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                    (A beat.) 
                              Yes I can see that. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  There s a routine Ministry of Defence 
                briefing tomorrow. I ve moved heaven and 
            earth to get Maynard along. I want you to sit 
                    in, stroke him, see if he meows. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        Right. 
 
  HARRY hurries flipping through a swing door. TESSA turns 
  away, a flicker of tension. 
 
 
  TOM arrives home. He s exhausted. He collects himself 
  then opens the door, calling out ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Ellie? 
 
  He slips his coat off. His shirt is smeared with dirt 
  from digging up the rose bushes. 
 
  And MARK HODD walks out of the kitchen. He s fit, shorter 
  than TOM, sun tanned. Gold at his throat. 
 
  TOM makes an involuntary movement as if he s going to hit 
  him. But MAISIE steps from behind MARK. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 21
 

                                        MAISIE 
                              This is my Daddy. 
 
  MARK stares at TOM s dirty shirt. TOM swirls the jacket 
  and puts it back on - a single movement. TOM holds out 
  his hand. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Matthew Archer. 
 
  MARK does not shake hands. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                    Hello Tom. 
 
  MAISIE is standing in the kitchen door. ELLIE is behind 
  her. MARK is patronising. 
 
                                        MARK 
            Oh yeah the man who fiddles with computers. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Right. And you re the oilman ex? Just back 
                                  from the Gulf? 
 
                                        MARK 
                        Glamorous part of the world. 
                            (Over TOM s shoulder.) 
                    You should come out there, Ellie. 
 
  MARK has got right up TOM s nose. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Gushes, oil, doesn t it? Like you gushed 
                              promises to Ellie. 
 
                                        MARK 
                              (Squaring up to TOM.) 
                    Don t do this in front of my kid. 
 
                                        TOM 
            You haven t been  in front of  your kid for 
                                    two years! 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                        Maisie go and do a drawing. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                A drawing of what? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 22
 

                                        MARK 
                    Go on cupcake do Mummy a drawing. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                    I ll do it with a THICK crayon. 
 
  And she skips off into her room. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Cupcake? 
 
  MARK instinctively makes a move to hit TOM who steps 
  back, expertly. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                      Don t Mark, he could hurt you! 
 
                                        MARK 
                            Who the hell are you? 
 
                                        TOM 
            A man in love with the woman you walked out 
                                        on. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  Mark just go. 
 
  He waits a moment, then moves to leave. 
 
                                        MARK 
                          I m warning you, chummy. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Thank you very much. 
 
                                        MARK 
                                    (To ELLIE.) 
                                      Ring me? 
 
  ELLIE looks away. MARK looks from one to other. Then he 
  goes. 
 
 
  TOM and ELLIE are now in the middle of a blazing row. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  But you said your name was Matthew! 
 
                                        TOM 
                      It was a slip of the tongue. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
          No. It comes out of what s wrong. Your bloody 
                                        job. 
 
                                        TOM 
          So I lied to him! The man s obviously a jerk. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Oh you make moral judgements about whom you 
          lie to, do you? Well what if you decide I m a 
                                        jerk? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    I love you. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              Oh great! So I know you tell me the truth 
                  because we sleep together. Terrific. 
 
                                        TOM 
          Look ... I hardly know what my name is myself 
                                      sometimes. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
          Well boo hoo, poor you. And poor me. And poor 
                                      Maisie. 
 
  She turns away and is weeping. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        I ... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Don t say anything. Because ... Right now ... 
                      Anything you say will be wrong. 
 
  She calms herself. She does not turn back to him. She is 
  hanging on to the cold inside her to make her decision. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT D) 
              Maisie and I are going to Di s old flat.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 24
 

 
                                        TOM 
                                        Where? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    Di s flat. 
 
                                        TOM 
                You can t leave. You won t be secure. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            If the door s dodgy I ll get a deadlock put 
                                        ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                              (under his breath) 
              No you might not be safe because of me. 
 
  She stares at him. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                Safe? Oh my God. What are you saying? 
 
            TOM is really upset by having to say this. 
 
                                        TOM 
              In the service dependents can be at risk. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        Risk? 
 
                                        TOM 
                      I m talking generally, I ... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
          What do you mean, once someone s lived with a 
          spy they can t leave, for reasons of national 
                                      security? 
 
                                        TOM 
              There is a risk. It s real. It s why the 
                  service doesn t like mixed affairs. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        What? 
 
                                        TOM 
            MI5 Officers sleeping with ... Real people. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Oh they want you to sleep with each other!                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 25
 

                Well you d better go and get yourself a 
                little Mata Hari the job approves of. 
               Dependents at risk,   mixed affairs . Don t 
            you realise how horrible these things sound? 
 
  He can t go on before her hostile stare. He knows he s 
  blown it. She leaves his POV. 
 
                                  ELLIE (CONT'D) 
                I can t be part of your world, I can t. 
                  Maisie and I will move our things. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              This is so unfair. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                      Do you mean to me, or to you? 
 
  He closes his eyes. 
 
 
  HARRY is making his way toward the pods. He calls out. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Tessa! 
 
  ZOE watches TESSA hurry to the pods. 
 
  RICHARD MAYNARD comes through. Departmental officials, 
  two women and two men, are behind him. 
 
  ZOE watches HARRY and TESSA as introductions are made. 
  She gets up and goes. 
 
  Over to the Ministerial group. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 26
 

                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                        And this is Tessa Phillips. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                      How do you do, Miss Phillips. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Very well, thank you Minister. 
 
  Obviously they ve not met. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            Well Harry, haven t been briefed in the holy 
                              of holies before. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Surely you ve been to Thames House? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
              Never. Just looks like an office. I s pose 
                      it s all in the mind, secrecy. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    Absolutely. Minister, shall we ... 
 
 
  The Ministry of Defence delegation in the meeting room, 
  settling down. HARRY is there. ZOE is busying herself 
  with notes at the top of the table. There is a slide 
    projector. 
 
                                        ZOE 
            This is a briefing about the illegal sale of 
                battlefield weapons out of this country. 
            We re very eager to have interdepartmental 
                input on this, so I d like to thank the 
            Minister for being here. Now I would like all 
              of us to look at this man. Sergai Lermov. 
 
  To MAYNARD. Not a flicker on his face. 
 
                                  ZOE (CONT D) 
            Ex Cultural Attache at the Russian Embassy. 
                                That is ex-KGB. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Yes, where are all the old comrades now eh? 
 
  A rustle of amusement.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
            Well some of them like Mr Lermov have become 
            powerful men. He has moved around the world, 
              but at present is resident in London. He 
            works for a charity called Hope for Chechnya. 
            Which is trying to get food and medicine to 
          that wretched part of the planet ... no doubt 
                  wrapped up in the odd rocket grenade 
                                      launcher. 
 
  He flicks through, fast, without comment, a slew of 
  appalling scenes of destruction and suffering in Grozny. 
  Back to LERMOV s face. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                Forgive that. But sometimes you have to 
            remind yourself of the reality you re dealing 
                                        with. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                      (Glance at HARRY, gets a nod.) 
            Mr. Lermov is not only an arms dealer, but 
                    also a spy. We have had him under 
              surveillance for some months. We believe he 
                is feeding information about Chechnyan 
                  contacts back to the Sluzhba Vneshney 
              Razvedki. SVR, Russian Foreign Intelligence 
                                      Service. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Old secret policemen never die, they simply 
                            change their acronyms. 
 
  A rustle of uneasy of laughter. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                What s this man s immigration status? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    Oh we can throw him out anytime. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                  Why don t we? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Because he is also a middle man for a gun 
              running cartel. Run out of the Middle East, 
            the Confederated Gulf States. A country we 
                              are friendly with.

                                      MAYNARD 
                                      Indeed. 
 
  No sign of a crack in MAYNARD at all. HARRY clicks off 
  the image on the screen. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            What we need Minister is to liaise closely. 
                It would help us greatly if you could 
              authorise a thorough audit of all weapons 
                                      stocks. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                Massive task ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
            We suspect weapons have been stolen and sold 
                          abroad through this man. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
          Dear God. Of course we will co-operate fully. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Thank you. Well, that concludes things. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            Then on behalf of my colleagues I must thank 
                you for this briefing, so reassuringly 
                                      alarming. 
 
  Polite laughter. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        Thank you again, Minister. 
 
  Meeting breaking up. MAYNARD, confidentially to HARRY. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              I think I met him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    You met ... 
 
    CONTINUOUS 
 
 
  They have come out of the meeting room. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
              Lermov. On a trip a few years ago. Unsavory                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 29
 

              bastard I thought. I told MI6 of course. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    Of course. 
 
  HARRY smiles. MAYNARD s comments seem wholly innocent. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Would you like a personal tour of the more 
                    sensitive areas of Thames House? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                          That would be exciting. 
 
  ZOE has reached her station. She looks back, eyes on 
  TESSA who is shaking hands with the officials. 
 
  TESSA and MAYNARD make for the double doors leading to 
  the corridor. 
 
    CONTINUOUS 
 
 
  TESSA and MAYNARD walking. A polite, conversational tone. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              There are cameras. 
 
  MAYNARD looks about. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                        Where? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                Tiny, state of the art. See? It s a new 
              security drive. Since the war on terrorism 
                began there s been much more money for 
                                      everything. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                      (Neutral.) 
                                        Yes. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              It s not perfect. There s a dead spot just 
                              beyond these doors. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                      (Lightly.)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 30
 

                                  Dear oh dear. 
 
  They are going through the doors ... 
 
    CONTINUOUS 
 
 
  The doors flip shut. 
 
  TESSA turns to MAYNARD, urgently. They are very close 
  together. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                            They re out to get you. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              What do you mean? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        I can t tell you here. We... 
 
  They are looking at each other. 
 
                                  TESSA (cont d) 
              Oh god Dick, what are you involved with? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                        (not taking her seriously) 
                                Well. With you. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        Yes. 
 
  She presses into him, kissing him passionately. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              I don t think so... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                      I do... 
 
  She pulls at his clothes. 
 
  He responds, his hands running down her back and her 
  buttocks. 
 
  He pulls her skirt up from behind. She fumbles with his 
  flies. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 31
 

  They pull at each other s clothes. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                                Someone will ... 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                  Don t care ... 
 
  They almost fall over. 
 
  MAYNARD, breathless. 
 
  She cries out. 
 
  And as their lovemaking climaxes through the glass of the 
  swing doors we see a man is walking down the corridor at 
  speed, files under his arm, head down. 
 
  The doors bang open. TESSA and MAYNARD freeze, holding 
  each other, trying hard not to breathe. 
 
  And the man doesn t see them in the corner. He hurries 
  past mumbling to himself, head down, and goes down stairs 
  fast. 
 
  TESSA and MAYNARD look at each other. 
 
  TESSA laughs, high on the danger, the risk, the 
    absurdity. Then MAYNARD pushes her away, pulling at his 
  clothes. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                      You re completely mad, Tessa. 
 
  TESSA, loving the madness. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Yes, but a bonk in the MI5 building, that s 
                      got to be worth some airmiles. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                            For godsake let s ... 
 
  MAYNARD steps back and is putting his clothes to right. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                    We ve got to talk somewhere safe. 
 
 
  ZOE has had a shower and is in a bathrobe. Wet hair. Her 
  clothes are thrown about the living room in her very own 
  messy style. 
 
  She is very upset, sitting on the floor against a sofa, 
  knees up to her chin, hugging herself. A flicker of her 
  eyes. She looks at the door of Danny s room. It has a 
  notice on it:  Danny s Room  ... With a nuclear warning 
  sign. 
 
  She raises a glass of Vodka - Polish peaty coloured 
  Vodka, the best - and sips it. 
 
 
  MARK is sitting at the table. There is no window, and no 
  tape machine. The two men are standing by the door. 
 
                                        MARK 
                              I want my solicitor. 
 
                                      2ND MAN 
                              Don t be a wuzza. 
 
  DANNY comes into the room. The two men go out. DANNY has 
  a file. 
 
                                        MARK 
                                    What is ... 
 
                                        DANNY 
              Earlier you made a phone call to a Sergeant 
            Brian Malhorn at Metropolitan Central. You 
            asked him to do you a favour - to trace the 
                                car of this man. 
 
  He puts a picture of TOM on the table. MARK is terrified. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 35
 

                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
            Sergeant Malhorn has been suspended from duty 
              and, at this moment in time, is having a 
                nasty experience with Special Branch. 
 
                                        MARK 
                              You can t do this. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            We can t do everything we want with you, but 
                          we can do a great deal. 
 
  MARK goes to pieces. 
 
                                        MARK 
                          Sorry ... I think I ... 
 
  DANNY withdraws the photograph, puts it in the file, 
  stands and leaves the room. 
 
  MARK seen from high up. 
 
 
  DANNY comes in the front door. He sees ZOE s mess. He is 
  not amused. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Oh no Zoe, please. 
 
  He notices the vodka. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
                              What you drinking? 
 
  She looks back, mischievously. 
 
  He goes to his door. He feels for something at the top of 
  the door. Finds it. A sliver of matchwood. He looks at 
  ZOE who stares back. 
 
  The game between them is on! 
 
 
  SERGAI LERMOV moves expertly through the twilight. He 
  stops. Tuts. Dog mess on his shoe? No, an excuse to bend 
  down and look around. He sees no one. 
 
  He walks briskly through a gap in a hedge. A bowling 
  green. It is derelict. The hut is boarded up. 
 
  He goes behind it. There are bushes. It is well 
    concealed. There is a chalk mark, a quarter of an inch 
  long, up under the eves. He bends down. There is a small 
  drain. He lifts it. He takes out a matchbox sized packet, 
  wrapped in polythene. 
 
  TOM comes out of the bushes behind him. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 37
 

                                        TOM 
            Feel like the old KGB days, does it Sergai? 
 
  LERMOV swings round, a small automatic pistol in his 
  hand. TOM smashes the side of his hand between LERMOV s 
  nose and upper lip. LERMOV collapses, dropping the 
  pistol, his nervous system momentarily paralysed, his 
  eyes streaming, saliva pouring out of his mouth. 
 
  TOM leans over him, speaking fast. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
            We are not lifting you, do you understand? 
                              This is not a lift. 
 
 
  The door opens. DANNY takes out a little torch and shines 
  it at the light switch. 
 
  CLOSE UP(VERY CLOSE): 
 
  On the switch there is a very finely cut slither of 
    cellotape. DANNY s finger throws the switch. The 
  cellotape tears. 
 
  With the light now on he looks around the room. 
 
  He goes on all fours and crawls to an area of carpet near 
  a low chest of drawers. He looks carefully at the carpet. 
 
  CLOSE UP AT FLOOR LEVEL: 
 
  There is a dust of very fine powder over the pale blue 
  carpet. DANNY puts his hand in it. It leaves a faint but 
  clear imprint. But the powder is undisturbed; no one has 
  walked there. 
 
  He straightens up and walks on his knees to a chest of 
  drawers. He examines the edge of the top drawer. 
 
  CLOSE UP (ALMOST MICROSCOPIC): 
 
  There is a human hair along the divide between drawer and 
  the side of the chest. 
 
  DANNY frowns. 
 
  He opens the drawer. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 38
 

  All is neat inside. A men s magazine has been thrown 
  casually over folded clothes. He looks carefully at the 
  distances of the edge of the magazine compared to the 
  pattern of a pullover. 
 
  Again nothing seems to have been disturbed. 
 
  He reaches to the bottom of the drawer and takes out an 
    apparently unopened bottle of dark Polish Vodka. He peers 
  at the seal. 
 
  CLOSE UP (AGAIN ALMOST MICROSCOPIC): 
 
  The seal is unbroken. He picks at it with his thumbnail. 
  He smiles, stands. 
 
 
  DANNY comes in waving the bottle of Polish Vodka. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Want a real drink? 
 
  She watches him. He opens the vodka and drinks a slug 
  straight out of the bottle. He spews it out with disgust. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
                                  What is that! 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                    Cold tea. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                        You cow. You absolute cow. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              Twenty quid to me. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              My Polish vodka! I was saving that for a 
                          serious night of nookie. 
 
  ZOE puts her hand out. DANNY takes a twenty pound note 
  out of his pocket and throws it on the floor in front 
  her. She picks it up. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
                Lovely bit of work on the sealed top.

                                        ZOE 
                        Why thank you kindly, Sir. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                There any left? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                In the tea pot. 
 
  DANNY looks at the teapot on the table. 
 
 
  JOOLS is having a quiet drink in a small private drinking 
  club which is run by six. 
  The bar is tiny. Like a glittering little cave of bottles 
  and framed photographs, all of chorus and showgirls, some 
  from the 20s. 
 
  A large doorman comes down poky stairs - big man, 
  stooping, obviously heavy muscle - and speaks quietly. 
 
                                      DOORMAN 
                              A Mr Lermov up top. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Yes thank you Gabriel. He s a guest, please 
          show him down. And make sure anyone else goes 
                              to the upper bar. 
 
                                      DOORMAN 
                                      Yes Sir. 
 
  JOOLS sips a drink, looks at his hair and adjusts his tie 
  in the mirror behind the bar. 
 
  A grim, furious LERMOV comes down the stairs. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              Sergai. I m having a drink before the opera 
          but do join me. Help yourself we don t have a 
                                barman down here. 
 
  LERMOV crashes behind the tiny bar. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                          Call off those imbeciles. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                        You ll have to be precise. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
            You are MI6, I deal with the real toffs. Not 
                                        MI5. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          Oh those imbeciles. What have they been doing                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 43
 

                                      to you? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
              Giving me threats. Wanting to own me. Me! 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            You seem to have every security service in 
              the world claiming they run you. Maybe we 
              should all have a special tie. The  I Ran 
                              Sergai Lermov Club.  
 
                                        LERMOV 
                      Are you taking me seriously? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              Oh I ll always take you seriously Sergai. 
            Remember the first time we met? Moscow, the 
              dead boy in the Hotel Ukraine? I saved you 
                  from your masters over that affair. 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                                  We go back. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                We certainly do. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                        What did the children want? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
                                      A name. 
 
  LERMOV drinks deep and puts the glass down, panting. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            They do seem to have rattled you. Well don t 
              pricktease, you Russian baboon. What name? 
 
                                        LERMOV 
              They asked if I had dealings with Richard 
                                      Maynard. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                  Did they now. 
 
  A touch of glee from JOOLS as he sips his drink.

  HARRY and an agitated TOM. 
 
                                        TOM 
              I admired Maynard. I thought he was a good 
                                        man. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    He is. Lermov is probably lying. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            To mess us up. That s what spooks do to each 
            other, it s in our nature whatever side we re 
                                        on. 
 
                                        TOM 
                But there s a huge question mark there, 
              Harry. Get Special Branch to pull Maynard, 
                          give him a good squeeze. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              That s not wanted. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Not ... 
 
  HARRY looks at him. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT D) 
                              Oh. Downing Street? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              They want a ring of steel around Maynard s 
              reputation. They don t want him destroyed. 
                Because he s the favourite, he has many 
                        enemies. People are jealous. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Is it up to MI5 to protect a politician from 
                                    embarrassment? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                The allegations against him are highly 
            contaminated. Memoirs that may not exist, the 
                word of a slime ball double agent ... 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Is Maynard clean? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 45
 

                                        HARRY 
              We ve never had anything concrete on him. 
 
                                        TOM 
            So where s the threat to National Security? 
 
                                        HARRY 
              If Maynard goes down in a scandal about 
              illegal arms, it could open the floodgates 
          for all kinds of things. The Government could 
                                      collapse. 
 
                                        TOM 
                We re crossing a line here. We re not 
                protecting the country we re protecting a 
                                political party! 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              There is no line. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Is that official? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    As far as you re concerned, yes. 
 
  TOM is angry. But HARRY stills him. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
              But we find out everything. Knowledge is 
                                        power. 
 
  A beat. They are staring at each other. HARRY - enjoying 
  TOM s heat - grins a little. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
                            There something else? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Lermov said he had  powerful friends.  I got 
                  the impression he s being protected. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Who by? 
 
  They look at each other. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                      Oh God. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 46
 

  A muscle marbles in HARRY s jaw as he lifts a telephone. 
 
 
  Tight on JOOLS SIVITER. 
 
  Straight to his face. His cheeks are stained with tears 
  as Wotan sings his Act II monologue. 
 
  He takes a vibrating mobile out. He begins to text 
  message. a WOMAN leans into view. 
 
                                        WOMAN 
                  Do you mind awfully not doing that? 
 
  JOOLS leans into her ear and speaks low. Sound tight on 
  his words. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                            Madam are you a Nazi? 
 
                                        WOMAN 
                              I beg your pardon? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            I mean we Wagner fans are a pretty rum lot. I 
            myself bugger skinheads so kindly don t tell 
                        me what I can or cannot do. 
 
  He calmly continues to text message. The WOMAN stares 
  ahead in shock. 
 
 
  DANNY and ZOE are drinking, sitting side by side on the 
  floor backs against the sofa. He is pouring from the 
  teapot. 
 
  It s clear they have been drinking for an hour or so. Not 
  slurred but bumpy conversation. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                    So why are. You getting pissed? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Why? Are you? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                Unlucky in love.

                                        ZOE 
                                        Ah. 
 
  He looks at his watch and sighs. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Stupid. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Very stupid. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                              Danny. I m scared. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        I ... 
              (Her breathing is shallow. She swallows.) 
              I don t know whether to tell. Or not. They 
                should give us training. How to decide 
                        decisions when you re drunk. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            A pissed spooks course. I ll drink to that. 
 
  Raising his glass. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    Tessa is running phantom agents. 
 
  DANNY stares at her, galvanised. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                How do you know? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                I went to meet one. And she turned up 
                              instead. And told me. 
 
  DANNY puts his drink down. 
 
 
  They take it in turns to dunk their heads in water. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    Coffee now. 
 
 
  DANNY and ZOE are drinking coffee. He is now in a 
  bathrobe. Their heads are close together. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                  So Tessa s been taking you into her 
                                      confidence? 
 
  ZOE nods. 
 
  ZOE is overwhelmed with relief at being able to tell 
  someone. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                            She ... Gave me money. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            You mean the ten grand next door, behind the 
                                  plug socket? 
 
  She s startled. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
            Yeah I was giving your room a sweep, part o  
                                  the game ... 
 
                                        ZOE 
                    I don t want to play that anymore. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                            So what s Harry say? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              I haven t told him.

              I mean, what if it s a real op that Tessa s 
                                      running? 
 
                                        DANNY 
          That involves giving you ten grand? She s got 
                                to be bent, Zoe. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          It s just that Tessa ... 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        What? 
 
                                        ZOE 
            She was what I wanted to be. I thought she 
                        was fantastic. I still do. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                        Zoe she s eating you alive. 
 
              Go to Harry, first thing in the morning. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        I ... 
 
                                        DANNY 
              You ve laid this on me. Now I m involved. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              It s my problem ... 
 
  DANNY is angry. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          I ve got to keep squeaky clean with Harry. He 
            said I could be one of the brightest and the 
                                        best. 
 
  He stands. He goes to the tea pot, pours, there s nothing 
  in it. He slams it down. The handle comes away. He looks 
  at it in his hand. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                          He said that to me too. 
 
  They look at each other.

                                        DANNY 
                      Then we re both great spooks. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                      Think so? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            You are, you got at my vodka. Zoe ... don t 
                let Tessa mash you up. You re too ... 
 
  He can t say it ...  precious ... beautiful.  A flash of 
  sexuality between them. She puts her hand out, he takes 
  it. 
 
  The door bell rings. 
 
  Their lips are almost touching. 
 
  The doorbell again. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Go. 
 
  ZOE pulls her robe tight around her. DANNY goes to the 
  door. He looks through a spy hole. He turns to look at 
  ZOE. 
 
  She is struggling to stand. 
 
  He opens the door. 
 
  ZOE falls over the sofa on her face, behind in the air, 
  robe rucked up the back of her legs. 
 
  A young Japanese woman - ANNETTE - is standing at the 
  door. She is well dressed and carries a small overnight 
  case. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                          I ve decided to say yes. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    Ah. Great. 
 
  ANNETTE sweeps into the room, very confident. She looks 
  at the sprawled ZOE, who stands unsteadily. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
            You must be Sally. Celestine told me about 
                                        you.

                                      ANNETTE

                                  What was it?

                                  (Big smile.) 
              Street urchin? Don t worry, we can get you 
                              another pussy cat. 
                                    (To DANNY.) 
                            Where s the rest room? 
 
  Indicates the door. ANNETTE sweeps towards it closing the 
  door. 
 
  ZOE and DANNY talk fast and low. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        Speak.

                            (Screwing the paper up.) 
                            Yes this is Rodney ... 
 
 
  TOM opens the door to HARRY s office. HARRY is on the 
  phone. 
  He signals  two minutes.  Turns away. 
 
  TOM goes to his station. He sees TESSA is in position. 
  JED, carrying a file, is hurrying past. 
 
                                        JED 
                              Tom. Have you heard?

                          He s ringing the minions. 
 
 
  DANNY and ANNETTE are sleeping in each others  arms. His 
  mobile rings. 
 
  DANNY reaches out for it. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                    Unh. Unh. 
 
  He puts the phone down. ANNETTE stirs. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                                        Unh? 
 
 
  ZOE asleep. Her mobile rings. She lifts it.

                                        Unh. 
 
 
  ANNETTE wakes. She sees that DANNY is not in bed. She 
  gets up, pulling the duvet around her. 
 
  She goes into the living room. 
 
  DANNY and ZOE have got dressed, though DANNY is still 
  tucking his shirt in his trousers. They have been 
  talking, facing each other. Their heads turn sharply to 
  look at ANNETTE. DANNY looks down - zips up his trousers. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                                What s going on? 
 
                                        DANNY

                      You go back to bed, love ... 
 
  He tries to kiss her. She holds her hands up. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                  Maybe I will, maybe I won t.  Love.  
 
  She looks daggers at them both. She turns to go back to 
  the bedroom. 
 
  And ZOE looks daggers at DANNY. 
 
 
  Observed from TESSA s station. 
 
  HARRY opens his door and nods to TOM, who makes for his 
  office. 
 
 
                                        TOM 
                      Zoe and Danny are coming in.

  HARRY points at the telephone. TOM, getting the point 
  that this is very serious, lifts it.

              It s terrible tradecraft. Throw her out. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                But I like her. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        Then throw her out nicely. 
 
  DANNY s phone rings. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                              Yeah. Oh Rodney ... 
                                    (A beat.) 
                                        Right. 
 
  Off the phone. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
                                    It s off. 
 
  ANNETTE comes into the room. She is dressed and carrying 
  her overnight bag. 
  She stands looking at them. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 61
 

                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
                        Look I m coming back to bed. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                        What happened to Singapore? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                  It went away. 
 
  ZOE turns towards her door, in a filthy temper. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
                          What about the cleaning? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                              It s not that dirty. 
 
  She goes into her room, slamming the door. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Don t go. 
 
                                      ANNETTE 
            You want to sleep with her and with me? You 
                                    are insane. 
 
  She goes, slamming the front door. 
 
  DANNY alone. He slams a fist into his palm. 
 
  ZOE s door opens slowly. She leans against the door post, 
  looking at him. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                        I just want a normal life. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Yeah, I know. 
 
  She slides back into her room, closing the door softly. 
 
 
                                        TOM 
              Knifed by a bit of rough? I thought Lermov 
                              was more of a pro. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            He had a weakness for a fumble in the dark. 
            How many hardened professionals have we seen 
            destroyed by that? Tom ... You thinking what                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 62
 

                                  I m thinking? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Within twelve hours of fingering a government 
            minister for corruption, Lermov is murdered. 
 
  An alarm has gone off. They ignore it. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              So maybe Maynard s got a Guardian Angel. 
                                      (Standing.) 
                      Turn that thing off, someone! 
 
 
  TESSA and JED are by the pods. 
 
  HARRY and TOM arrive. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  What is this? 
 
                                        JED 
                      The pod has stopped someone. 
 
  HARRY types in a code on the pad. The pod opens. A 
  furious JOOLS SIVITER shoots out. 
 
  JED struggles to suppress laughter. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                  What is this, some kind of infantile 
                                  practical joke? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                    (With a glare at TESSA and JED.) 
                            Thank you Tessa, Jed. 
 
  TESSA steps back at this exclusion. TOM too, though, has 
  found JOOLS  accident funny. He tries to suppress it. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Jolly japes in the playground is it Tom? I 
            don t think you ll be bloody laughing long. 
 
  CUT TO: 
 
 
  HARRY is sitting, TOM and JOOLS are standing. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 63
 

                                        JOOLS 
              There is someone in this building who is 
              seriously disloyal. We could be looking out 
                              at him or her now. 
 
  HARRY stands, goes to the window of his office looking 
  out over the grid. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              That is a very serious allegation against 
                              your sister service. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            My  sister  should be bent over and given a 
                          good whack on her behind. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        I don t find that helpful. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
          You get an excellent asset of mine killed and 
                                  you want HELP? 
 
  JOOLS and HARRY are squaring up to each other. For a 
  moment TOM thinks they are going to hit each other. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
            Oh well, suffer the little children to come 
            unto the senior service. I suppose you want 
                    to read Hampton Wilder s memoirs. 
 
  HARRY knows JOOLS is up to something. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                          That would be ... Useful. 
 
  To TOM and HARRY s alarm JOOLS undoes his jacket and 
  begins to undo his trousers. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            I don t know if I can entrust such sensitive 
            material to this organisation but I am taking 
            pity. I suppose we are after all on the same 
                                        side. 
 
  He has a security pouch across his thigh. There is a 
  glimpse of silk underwear. He takes out a photocopied 
  manuscript. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
              Needless to say I expect your registry to                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 64
 

                            monitor all readings. 
 
  He hands the manuscript to HARRY. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                    Thank you. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                      (Putting his clothes to rights.) 
            It s been a very long night. The death of an 
              agent and one of the worst productions of 
                Wagner I have ever seen. Dear God, the 
            Valkyrie were all wearing scuba gear! So good 
                                  night to you. 
 
  He goes. HARRY looks at the manuscript in his hand. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              He s setting us up. I know it in my water. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        How? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  I don t know. 
                                    (A beat.) 
            We ll read this in the morning. And you ll 
                    interview Maynard. Go at him hard. 
 
                                        TOM 
              He s a minister, we ll need Downing Street 
                                      clearance. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Bugger Downing Street. 
 
  TOM, alert at that. Wheels are turning ... 
 
 
  DANNY and ZOE are at their station. Both looked wrecked. 
  They are not speaking (TOM is not there.) 
 
  TESSA and team are in position. 
 
  And all other sections and their desks are manned. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 65
 

  HARRY is standing outside his office. 
 
  Everyone has a copy of the memoirs before them. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Everyone! This is a speed reading job. You 
              know the procedure. No one will leave the 
              Grid until we re done. Copies are numbered 
            and will be collected by Registry. You are 
              looking for inconsistencies, errors of fact 
          ... Anything to discredit this manuscript. Or 
                    indeed to verify it. So - maximum 
                              concentration! Begin. 
 
  He turns back to his office. 
 
  Close to ZOE and DANNY. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                      Zoe ... 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        No. 
 
  She turns away. 
 
 
  HARRY can be seen in his office, sitting at his desk 
  reading. 
 
  Everyone is reading. There is an eerie silence. 
 
 
  Everyone reading. All together they turn a page. 
 
 
  HARRY turns a page. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Christ. 
 
 
  Then, like firework bangers going off at random, voices - 
  all our characters included - cry out. 
 
                                        VOICES 
              Christ! (A beat.) Christ! (A long beat.) 
                    Christ! Christ! (A beat.) Christ! 
 
  Someone laughs hysterically. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                      (Calling out to the whole Grid.) 
 
                  Margaret Thatcher on page eighty-two! 
 
  And every reader in the room is turning pages. 
 
    A moment s silence. 
 
  Then an explosion of  Christ! s. 
 
 
    Everyone s laughing: an hysteria has gripped the readers 
  of the memoirs. 
 
 
  TOM and HARRY. 
 
  The reading of the memoirs is continuing on the Grid. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Who is destroying him? 
 
                                        TOM 
                      That s what he wants to know. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        I think we ll know very soon. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          What do you mean? Harry? 
 
  HARRY looking out at the readers. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            Oh ship of state ... 
                                (Turns on TOM.) 
              What are we, on the great ship of state? 
                Engine room? Hardly. I think we re the 
            laundry. Cleaning disgusting stains from the 
                                officer s sheets. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Er ... 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 70
 

                                        HARRY 
                      Right I think everyone s done. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Can I read a copy? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Don t bother they re trash. I imagine their 
          real meaning will become apparent by tomorrow 
                                      morning. 
 
  HARRY goes out on to the Grid. 
 
    CONTINUOUS 
 
 
  HARRY comes out of his office, TOM behind him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Everyone! Please write up your notes ASAP. At 
              this moment - stay where you are. Registry 
              will collect and account for every copy. 
                          Thank you for your work. 
                                    (To Tom.) 
                                  Now we wait. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    What for? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                Truth to emerge. 
 
 
  She has just opened the door to TOM. She turns. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        Oh. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      I er ... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  You er what? 
 
                                        TOM 
              Is there anything I can do? To help you 
                                  settle in ...

  She gives him a withering look then turns and walks away 
  into the flat. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                              Are you with Mark? 
 
  She stops, turns and comes back. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  I thought ... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                      Did you do something to him? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Like what? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  His flat s empty. His mobile s dead. 
 
                                        TOM 
            He ... got a mate in the Met put a trace on 
                                      my car. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  And your zombies frightened him off? 
 
                                        TOM 
            It could have been someone trying to get to 
                                        me. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            But actually it was the father of my child. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Yeah. 
                                    (A beat.) 
                I didn t stop them ... Giving him a hard 
                                time. I m sorry. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              You re despicable. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  I m in love.

  She pushes him by the chest. He walks back until he is 
  outside the door then closes it. 
 
 
  Straight to TOM who is almost running towards his desk. 
  He has a crumpled copy of The Evening Standard in his 
  hand. DANNY is there. 
 
  Copies of the Evening Standard are all over the desks. 
 
  CLOSE UP: A headline:  Wilder Memoirs Bombshell  
 
                                        DANNY 
                      You ve seen the centre spread? 
 
  DANNY nods towards HARRY s office. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT'D) 
                                        (Low.) 
                        Someone leaked, didn t they? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Danny shut up. 
 
  TOM s phone rings. 
 
                              HARRY (ON PHONE.) 
                                      In here. 
 
 
  TOM looks down at the desk. Several copies of the centre 
  of the Evening Standard are thrown around it. The spread 
  is of two pages from the manuscript of the memoirs, with 
  names blacked out. There is a photograph of the Sheik s 
  hunting trip - we have already seen it. The huge headline                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 73
 

  is:  Desert Orgy.  
 
                                        TOM 
              No way could the leak have come from us. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            I know, I was scrupulously paranoid about the 
                                      copies. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Who then? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Remain calm. Steer the ship onward. 
 
  DANNY knocks on the door. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                  Sorry, but ... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                  No no, Danny. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          It s on the wires. Richard Maynard s resigned 
                              from the Government. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Well there we have it. Thank you Danny. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                        Right. 
 
  DANNY leaves - reluctantly, he s curious about the mood 
  in the room. 
 
 
  TESSA at her station staring at the Evening Standard. 
  There are tears in her eyes. She checks no one is looking 
  and wipes her eyes with a tissue. 
 
  JED arrives, excited. 
 
                                        JED 
            Maynard s resigned. Spectacular in t it, when 
                      politicians destroy themselves. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                      Go away, you nasty little man.

                                        JED 
                                What? Oh. Sorry. 
 
  CLOSE UP: TESSA, anger in her face. 
 
  Then she stands. 
 
 
                                        HARRY 
            So if it s not us ... And it s not Downing 
                  Street ... It s ... are you there? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Jools Siviter? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Go on. 
 
                                        TOM 
            The sisters have been using the memoirs to 
                              get rid of Maynard? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        On. 
 
                                        TOM 
            MI6 got hold of Wilder s memoirs - full of 
            hatred for Maynard - and decided to use them 
                                to destroy him? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              There you have it. 
 
                                        TOM 
              And they ve set us up to blame us for the 
                              leak to the press? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Oh yes. 
 
                                        TOM 
            But Maynard shopped Wilder to MI6. Why would 
                            they turn against him? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                I think I may ... Have drinkies with Mr 
                                      Siviter. 
 
                                        TOM 
          It smells to high heaven. Have they destroyed                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 75
 

                                    a good man? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Don t brood, Tom. Politicians are conniving, 
                wheeler-dealing scum. Don t have a fit of 
              morals over them, they wouldn t over you. 
 
  HARRY looking rugged and secure. 
 
 
  JOOLS sitting at the tiny bar, drinking alone. He is 
  reading the Phaidon edition of the text of Wagner s 
    Gotterdammerung. 
 
 
  HARRY comes down the small stairs. He is steeled for an 
  argument. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
              Ah Harry this is civilised what can I get 
                                        you? 
 
 
  TOM rings the doorbell. 
 
  WILDER opens the door. He is wearing black slacks and a 
  white shirt. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                          Why, a secret policeman. 
 
  TOM follows him into the flat. Soulless reproduction 
  regency. The flat does not look lived in at all.

  There are three big suitcases, two ready for travel. One 
  opened on the bed. MAYNARD is looking through his 
  clothes. A whiskey bottle is open on a table. 
  A knock on the door. MAYNARD stares at it. A knock again. 
  He rushes at the door. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              (Opening the door.) 
                          Look you bastards I ... 
 
  TESSA is there. 
 
                                MAYNARD (CONT'D) 
            I thought the scum had found me. They re all 
                                  over my home. 
 
  She pushes past him. She looks at the suitcases. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            You coward. You despicable coward. Are you 
                                  running away? 
 
  THEN WE CUT BETWEEN THE THREE SCENES: WILDER S FLAT, 
  MAYNARD S HOTEL ROOM AND JOOL S BAR. 
 
  GO TO: 
 
 
                                        WILDER 
              I can offer you something soft? I thought 
              alcohol would welcome me back with joy, but 
                          she s turned against me. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    No thanks. 
 
  WILDER turns to pour himself some water from a drinks 
  surface. 
 
  Tom sees a slight seepage of blood onto the back of 
  Wilder s shirt 
 
  GO TO: 
 
 
  JOOLS has poured HARRY a scotch. They crouch over their 
  drinks, faces close to each other. They have no need of                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 77
 

  the usual sparring showiness between them. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Did you throw Lermov to the wolves? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            No idea who did that. Good riddance though. 
              He was getting far too big for his murky 
                                        pond. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      I agree. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                        So what is your complaint? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            You leaked about Maynard to the press didn t 
                                        you. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                        Ah. 
 
  GO TO: 
 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                          It s over. I m done for. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                You self-pitying bastard. Fight back. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                  For what? Oh you mean my career, my 
                        beautiful, gleaming career. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                          You can t just give up. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
          I ve not left public life, it s left me. Wake 
            up, Tessa. I have been destroyed. It happens 
                              to men in my trade. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            I can t stand this. Not after what I did for 
                                        you. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            And what pray was that? Oh yes, you did shag                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 78
 

                      me in MI5 s HQ, that you did. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              You bastard. I had a man killed for you. 
 
  He looks at her. He laughs sourly and turns away. 
 
  GO TO: 
 
 
                                        TOM 
            You lied about Richard Maynard. Didn t you. 
 
  WILDER sighs. 
 
                                        WILDER 
              Yes. I don t think he ll ever forgive me. 
 
                                        TOM 
                Nor do I, you ve destroyed his career. 
 
  GO TO: 
 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                  Lermov? You had him ... How could you 
                                possibly do that? 
 
                                        TESSA 
            It was simple. I tipped off the Russians. He 
                            was two timing them. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            And why did you think ... In any conceivable 
              ... Twisted way his death would help me? 
 
                                        TESSA 
              He could have exposed you. It was a gift. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
             Gift?  A man s life? Dear God I know secret 
              services can be ruthless ... Ah well. From 
              what I hear he was a dog, good riddance. 
 
                                        TESSA

  He looks at her with contempt. 
 
  A thought comes to her:  Oh God is he really innocent?

                                        HARRY 
            You gave us the memoirs to read then leaked 
              the stuff about Maynard to the press. You 
                              were setting us up. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                              Not really Harry. 
 
  And there is a touch of a suggestion now that the Scotch 
  is doing its job. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              Oh really really. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            I was extending the penumbra of deniability. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                            It was not friendly. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                You ve not had any comeback have you? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        No. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Well there you are then proof in the pudding 
                                eaten. Another? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                                    Why what? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      Why did you destroy Maynard? 
 
  Close to JOOLS. His face is closed.

                                      MAYNARD 
              No. I never had any corrupt dealings with 
                                  Lermov, ever. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            Oh please! You shopped Wilder and took over 
                                  his network. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            What is this? I had no business arrangements 
                            with Wilder or Lermov. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                              I don t believe you. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                              That s your problem. 
 
                                        TESSA 
            If you re innocent, why did you resign? ... 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
            Political critical mass. The rumours were too 
            much. They could have damaged the PM. Even 
          he, in the end, had to ask me to go. I agreed 
                        of course. He s my friend. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                        He s left you with nothing. 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                  Not ... Exactly. I ve been offered a 
              professorship, teaching politics in Harvard. 
              It s been kept warm for me for some time. 
                                      (Grins.) 
          Have you any idea how much American academics 
                                    are paid? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                          You re going to America? 
 
                                      MAYNARD 
                I m being looked after. A new life. No 
              politics, no wife, no mistress. I m looking 
                        forward to it. Goodbye Tessa. 
 
                              MAYNARD turns away.

          Why do I always have to fall in love with men

  Drinks. 
 
  HARRY puts his face very close. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            I am going to sit here and drink your drink 
                              until you tell me. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            You think you can go one to one with me in a

              I wanted revenge. But I genuinely repented 
              writing the memoirs, I would like you to 
            believe that. I was going to destroy them. I 
            went to dig them up and they weren t there. 
 
                                        TOM 
                      Someone else had need of them.

                                        JOOLS 
            All right Harry. Richard Maynard was fast-
              tracking up through the Government ranks. 
          With his middle eastern knowledge, experience 
            at the Ministry of Defence, he would all too 
          soon have made a brilliant Foreign Secretary. 
              There was no way we or the Foreign Office 
                      were going to let that happen. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      Why not? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Because the white as snow Richard Maynard was 
                                  a CIA Asset. 
 
    A bombshell. 
 
                                  JOOLS (CONT D) 
              Oh yes. I know that as it is we re just a 
              comfortable itch in the great American boxer 
              shorts, but could we really have a British 
                Foreign Secretary who was a CIA Agent? 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        When did they recruit him?

                                    Years back. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                        When did you find this out? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            Six months ago. A drunken conversation with 
                  an American cousin in this very bar. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                Didn t the PM ... 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            The PM is blind to the fault of his friends. 
            We had to run another reason for getting rid 
              of Maynard. The memoirs were a godsend.

                                        HARRY 
                          You could have told me. 
 
                                        JOOLS 
                Don t be silly you re far too ethical. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                  Is that a compliment or an insult? 
 
                                        JOOLS 
            It s a good outcome all round Harry. A nasty 
                  foreign dead, a dodgy Brit disgraced.

                I have been involved in a filthy trade. 
              Weapons I helped to be sold illegally, have 
                  almost certainly found their way to 
              terrorists. I wrote lies that destroyed a 
            good man. You think I m irredeemable, don t 
                                        you?

                  Oh I do. But he asks a heavy price.

                                    No doubt. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                              Do you want to see?

                          I ... Really think I ... 
 
  WILDER starts to unbutton his shirt. He turns pulling it 
  off, the buttons popping. His back is lacerated: some                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 5 Page 84
 

  scars have healed, others are recently applied. 
 
                                        WILDER 
                I can t live with myself, you see. Not 
                                      really. 
 
  TOM looks, without reaction. 
 
                                WILDER (CONT'D)

                                        TOM 
                  Yes. I ll leave you to your prayers.

                We re way ahead of you, boss. Come in. 
 
 
  ZOE is sitting on the floor back against the sofa. She is

  at TOM and smiles at him.
