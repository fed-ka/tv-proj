                      Teddy Rist loves sex.  He loves 
                      wine, women and bongs.  He 
                      indulges himself in every 
                      fantasy, whim and desire his 
                      libidinous brain can imagine.  
                      At forty, he has the stamina of 
                      a twenty year old and the 
                      appetites of a pubescent teen.  
                      He is a dedicated hedonist.   
 
 
                      Teddy Rist loves money.  He 
                      enjoys earning it; having 
                      climbed from nothing to the 
                      heights of his own global 
                        corporation.  He s brilliant at 
                      making deals; sensing the 
                      weaknesses of his competition; 
                      imagining the future.  He likes 
                      to win.  He is a die-hard 
                      capitalist.   
 
 
                      Teddy Rist loves people, people 
                      around the world whom he has 
                      never met, especially children.  
                      He wants everyone on the planet 
                      to have a good education, a 
                      solid meal and a healthy life.  
                      He ll do anything to achieve his 
                      goals -- bargain with the self-
                      righteous, trade with the 
                      nefarious, even tell the truth.  
                      He s Bill Gates, Robin Hood and 
                      James Bond in one kick-ass 
                      package.  He is the world s 
                      first vigilante philanthropist.

                                            TEASER

      FADE IN:

      EXT.  RAINFOREST/ECUADOR - DAY

      Pristine, verdant, untouched by Man.  Tall trees fill an
      azure sky, deep moss covers the ground.  The HUM and BUZZ of
      insects and animals; the CAW of a green ibis.

      The face of TEDDY RIST appears, as he snaps apart two yellow
      stalks.  He's running toward the CAMERA, wearing a Balenciaga
      shirt and a pair of Rogan jeans, both are soiled and torn. 
      Over his shoulder, a bulging backpack, bearing the logo of
      Maidstone-Rist Resources.

      Oddly, he is shoeless; his feet are muddy and bleeding.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    There's a moment in time when a man
                    must ponder the meaning of life.

      A BULLET WHIZZES past TEDDY's head.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    But the rest of the time, he's just
                    gotta keep running.

      MORE BULLETS.  TEDDY, a portrait of steely determination, is
      unfazed by the GUNFIRE: he isn't running away from the danger
      but toward something else. 

                                      FEMALE VOICE (v.o.)
                    Wait a minute, wait a minute --

      As the IMAGE FREEZES,

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT.  PLANO, TEXAS - DAY

      A roadhouse near the airport.  The air is dusty dry.

                                      BETTY LYNN (v.o., cont.)
                    You expect me to believe this crap?

      INT.  ROADHOUSE - DAY

      BETTY LYNN, twenty-three, a sharp-tongued cowgirl, is
      bartending.  Her clothes are so tight they look as though
      they shrank in the dryer.  TEDDY's face is blocked by a Red
      Scarlet digital camera, which he is using to film his current
      surroundings.  She places a tequila in front of him.





                                                                (CONTINUED)      "The Philanthropist"                                      2.

                    I was trying to get the vaccine to
                    the village before all the people
                    there died.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    Boy oh boy, I have heard alotta pick
                    up lines since graduating high school,
                    yours takes the blue ribbon.

                                      TEDDY
                    I'm not trying to pick you up --
                    well, I am.  But I'm not lying about
                    the vaccine.

      BETTY LYNN pffts.  He aims the camera at her, says casually: 

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    I'm Teddy Rist.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    Teddy Rist, the billionaire? 

                                      TEDDY
                      Ninety-ninth richest man in the
                    universe.  As of last Thursday.    

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    A week ago, I had a guy in here,
                    says he's Justin Timberlake.  I'll
                    ask you what I asked him: with all
                    that dough, what're you doing in a
                    dump like this?

                                      TEDDY
                    My jet needed refueling.

      BETTY LYNN snickers a ha-ha-ha.  He lowers the camera. 

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                      A Gulfstream G550, it's next door at
                    the airport. 
                          (takes her hand)
                    C'mon, I'll show you. 

      She shakes his fingers loose.  TEDDY smiles, knocks back the
      tequila, indicates he'd like another.  She grabs the neck of
      the bottle and pours, laughing dismissively.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    Teddy Rist slogging vaccine through

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    Tuvalu, nine tiny islands in the
                    middle of the Pacific.  Usually, the
                    place is a Paradise, but on this
                      particular morning, it was Satan's
                    butthole.

      INT.  LUXURY SUITE/FUNAFUTI RESORT - DAY

      WIND HOWLS, a torrent of rain.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    I was sleeping off a night of
                      bacchanal, which is the Greek word
                    for too much of everything.

      TEDDY lies sprawled out on bed, naked, unconscious.  KNOCK
      on door. 

                                    MALE VOICE
                    Mister Rist?

      TEDDY's eyelids half open.  The back of his eyes hurt.  He
      moans, barely audible:

                                      TEDDY
                    Do not disturb, the sign says "do
                    not disturb" --

      KNOCKING, more insistent.  TEDDY's pupils start to focus and
      he sees a beautiful POLYNESIAN WOMAN next to him, asleep. 
      He only has the vaguest of memories who she is.

                                    MALE VOICE
                    Mister Rist, please --

      Groggily, TEDDY mumbles a curse, swings his legs off the bed
      and -- SPLASH, his feet land in water.

      Instantly, he is jarred into consciousness by the sensation
      and pulls his feet back out.

      TEDDY's POV -- The room is thigh-deep in water.  Pieces of
      clothing (discarded in the throes of passion) and other
      objects float by.  On top of the bedstand, still above sea
      level, rests his wallet and Windows Sg-2520 SAT phone.

      RESUME TEDDY, trying to figure out what the fuck is happening.

                                    MALE VOICE (cont.)
                    Mister Rist, please open the door --

      Resigned, TEDDY puts his feet back in the water.  He's naked
      and his clothes are soaked, so he grabs pillow and places it
      over his jewels.  He steps off bed and wades to the door,
      which he unlocks and forces open.  Standing in the hallway
      are the HOTEL MANAGER and a local POLICEMAN.

                                      HOTEL MANAGER (cont.)
                    I am sorry, Mister Rist, the typhoon
                    is stronger than was forecast.  Damage
                    to the island is massive, power lines
                    are down, homes are gone, many are
                    drowned.  The waters continue to
                    rise at a rapid pace.  We must
                    evacuate.  You must come at once.

      TEDDY presses his thumb and index finger into his eyes, trying
      to squeeze away the pain.

                                      TEDDY
                    Okay, but there better be coffee.

      He opens closet.  Shirts and pants hang above the water.  He
      slips a pair of pants off hanger, tosses it over to bed,
      where the POLYNESIAN WOMAN is just coming to.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    I hope the pants fit.

      She's so beautiful.  If there was time, he'd fuck her again.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      EXT.  FUNAFUTI RESORT/TUVALU - DAY

      Rain, wind.  The flood has reached the second floor balcony,
      where TEDDY stands, fully dressed, talking on phone; he is
      among a large crush of HOTEL GUESTS being loaded onto a
      lifeboat, which is already at capacity.  HOTEL MANAGER helps
      the POLYNESIAN WOMAN, in Teddy's clothes, get into the boat.  

                                      TEDDY
                    Yes, they're taking us to higher
                    ground, but, Maxine, I want off the
                    island, pronto.  I can't reach Dax
                    at the Gulfstream, a cop says the
                    airport's washed away --

                                      HOTEL MANAGER
                    You're next, Mister Rist.

      TEDDY is about to get into the last free seat when he sees a
      six year old native BOY, terrified and alone.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    That's when I saw him, this kid...

      The BOY's eyes lock onto TEDDY's.

                                      MAXINE
                    Worse comes to worst, I'll send a
                      helicopter from Nauru for you.

                                      TEDDY
                          (to HOTEL MANAGER)
                    Take him first.

                                      HOTEL MANAGER
                    The boy?  He is no one.  A beggar.

                                      TEDDY
                          (the boss)
                    Take him first.

      Obeying, HOTEL MANAGER lifts up the BOY and places him in
      the last remaining spot.

                                      MAXINE
                    I also have the Governor-General's
                    cell phone.

      As the boat casts off, the GUESTS, remaining on the balcony,
      panic and push brusquely forward, voices wailing.

                                      HOTEL MANAGER
                    Be patient.  There will be more boats.

                                      TOURIST
                    When?  I don't want to die --

      TOURIST forces his way through the CROWD and leaps off the
      balcony onto the boat, catching the side and causing it to
      capsize.  The PEOPLE on board disappear beneath the water.

      TEDDY watches, anxiously, as heads start to reappear -- the
      POLYNESIAN WOMAN among them.

      BUT NOT THE BOY.

      TEDDY searches the surface of the floodwaters, but after a
      two-count, he drops his phone and dives into the foam.

      Underwater: TEDDY dives, on the lookout for the BOY -- whom
      he spots, arms flailing, drowning.  TEDDY propels himself
      deeper into the water and grabs the CHILD.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    You have to understand: I am not the
                    heroic type.  Reckless, yes. 
                    Superman, hardly.  I learned long
                    ago -- no matter how much money I
                    have -- bullets don't bounce off me.  

      On the surface: TEDDY bursts out of the water clutching the
      BOY, then swims to the balcony, where he hands off the kid.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    I saved the boy but, in an odd way,
                    he saved me.

      The BOY looks at TEDDY, gratefully.  As TEDDY smiles,

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      TEDDY takes a beat, struggling to articulate the torment in
      his soul.  Instead, he says with a grin:

                    Let me get back to you on that.

      EXT.  GULFSTREAM G550 - TWILIGHT

      A glorious sun is setting, as the plane sails east into
      darkness.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    I have an amazing talent to shove
                    what is painful back into the furthest
                    reaches of my memory.

      INT.  MAIN CABIN/GULFSTREAM G550 - TWILIGHT

      TEDDY sits, rocks glass in hand, wearing a silk bathrobe,
      eyes downcast, waging an emotional war in his head.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    I forget -- until I remember.  Then
                    the memories flood my brain, like a
                    typhoon in Tuvalu.

      INT.  FLIGHT DECK/GULFSTREAM G550 - TWILIGHT

      DAX VAHAGN, late thirties, of Armenian extraction and an

                    Teddy, we're about a half hour outside
                    of New York.

      TEDDY finishes his drink.  Sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT enters,
      holding a Kiton suit on a hanger.

                    And the face of a drowning child
                    brings back all the demons.

      As TEDDY rises and drops his bathrobe,

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT.  EXECUTIVE SUITE/MAIDSTONE-RIST - DAY

      PHILIP MAIDSTONE, early forties, handsome, walks along,
      reading text message and none too happy with its contents.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    Oh, I gotta tell you about Philip
                      Maidstone, my co-CEO and best friend.

      A woman's arm reaches out and pulls PHILIP into:

      INT.  BROOM CLOSET/MAIDSTONE-RIST - DAY

      The WOMAN, arrestingly beautiful, in her late thirties, backs
      PHILIP against a wall and kisses him, passionately, long
      enough for us to hear:

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    And his wife Olivia, who runs our
                      corporation's charitable foundation. 
                    One of the most extraordinary -- and
                    sexy -- women in the solar system.

                                      BETTY LYNN (v.o.)
                    Ooo, you wanna bang her, dontcha?

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    We dated early on.  A disaster of
                    space shuttle Challenger proportions.

      PHILIP and OLIVIA break kiss.  They are a WASP power couple,
      attractive and stylish, with pedigrees dating back to the
      Mayflower and the libido of rabbits.

                                      PHILIP
                    That was one of your "I'm-happy-about-
                      something" kisses.

                                      OLIVIA
                    The big fund-raiser.  Donations just
                    topped ten million dollars.

                                      PHILIP
                    You rock.

      He kisses her this time, with equal passion.

                                      TEDDY (o.c.)
                    Do I have to hose you kids down?

      They break, turn to see TEDDY in doorway.

                    I saw on the 'net, Tuvalu had a
                    category five typhoon yesterday.

                                      TEDDY
                          (feigning ignorance)
                    Really?  Musta missed it.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I'm thinking our foundation should
                    send a check.

                                      TEDDY
                    Sure.  Checks are nice.

                                      TEDDY
                    Yeah.  You know how it is after a
                    kick-ass vacation, adjusting to the
                    real world.

                                      PHILIP
                    Speaking of the real world...

                                      OLIVIA
                    I know a "get lost" when I hear one. 
                    I'll see you both at the "Reading is

                    Yes.  You, me, Olivia -- and Morgana.

                    Burton earned his billions by being
                    a snake oil salesman, he could charm
                    the pants off the pope.

                    feel him out.  You should join us.

                                      PHILIP
                    Okay.  The most important thing is,
                    at Thursday's board meeting, the
                    four of us -- Morgana included --
                    present a united front.

                    She won't come to the meeting.  As
                    far as I can tell, the woman hasn't
                    left her apartment in weeks.

                                      PHILIP
                    Now how would you know that?  Are
                    you having her followed?

      The land of private jets.  The Lexus pulls up to a spanking
      new Gulfstream G550.  DAX, TEDDY, KYLE and SIPE step out.

                    Dax, get ready to rocket.

      TEDDY nods.  DAX goes into plane.  TEDDY looks at SIPE and
      KYLE, then decides: 

                                      TEDDY
                    Sipe, get on board.

      KYLE steps back, disappointed.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Kyle, stay on top of the Brazilian
                    perfume deal.  

      As TEDDY and SIPE walk up ramp, she asks, a little cocky:

                                    SIPE
                    Teddy, tell me -- why'd you pick me
                    over Kyle?

                                      TEDDY
                    He has a three month old.

      As SIPE's cockiness evaporates, replaced by fear,

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    nuts?  Get Teddy on the phone.

      MAXINE dials, listens.

                    He knows how crucial this meeting
                    is.  I need his ass in the chair

      GOVERNMENT GREETER and two SOLDIERS approach, as the door
      flips open.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    No, the quake was over. 

      TEDDY walks down steps, Red Scarlet digital camera filming
      everything in sight, followed by SIPE and DAX.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    I went because I'm Teddy Rist.

      GREETER bows obsequiously.  TEDDY, DAX and SIPE hand over
      their passports.

      Limousine moves slowly along the congested street, which is
      packed with TRUCKS, CARS and WORKERS, mostly poor, going
      about their day-to-day routine.

                    We made our way through the streets
                    of the capital, which was relatively
                      unaffected by the quake.

      A military jeep follows the limo.

      TEDDY and SIPE sit across from the HEALTH MINISTER, thirty-

                    Your generosity is much appreciated,

                      department has this shocking tragedy
                    under control. 

      TEDDY knows it's bullshit, makes every effort to be
      diplomatic.

                    No, thank you.  I must leave soon
                    for Puerto Napo -- that's the village
                    hit hardest by the tremors, where I
                    have established a clinic.

                    Is it nearby?

                    can travel, over the mountains, deep
                    into the rainforest.

                    Doctor Flores, we've come to help,
                    but we keep hitting road blocks. 
                      Ambassador Korman thought we might --

                    There is a case of vaccine at the
                    airport, which was supposed to be
                    delivered to my clinic days ago. 
                    When it did not arrive I drove here
                    to fetch it.  But I cannot get the
                      government officials to release the
                    box to me.

                                      TEDDY
                    A box of vaccine.  I gotta tell ya,
                    I was thinking of doing something
                    more on a Bruckheimer scale.

                                      ALICIA
                    This vaccine can cure two hundred
                    victims.  Which, in turn, will stop
                    the spread of disease to hundreds
                    more.  Big gestures often don't change
                    anything, the smallest ones do.  If
                    you only save one life, you still
                    have saved one life.

      TEDDY is impressed by this woman.  And she's hot.

                    really juicy secrets -- with you...

      She puts down her martini glass, takes his and puts it down
      next to hers.  She then reaches O.C., below his belt.  His
      mouth falls open, his toes curl.

                    Holy Mother of God.

      She heads to bedroom, peeling off her clothes as she goes. 
      On PHILIP, his dick in hyperspace,

      INT.  BAGGAGE CLAIM/MARISCAL SUCRE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

      TEDDY and SOLDIER finish the bottle of Blanton's.  The SOLDIER
      is shit-faced.

                                      SOLDIER
                      Rock'n'roll, s'all'about...

      TEDDY pats him on shoulder, then crosses to door, signals to
      DAX, SIPE and ALICIA.  They enter.

                                      TEDDY
                    Where's the baggage handler?

                                    SIPE
                    He went home.
                          (off TEDDY)
                    But he "lost" his key.

      She holds up key.  TEDDY smiles.  They unlock door.

      INT.  STORAGE/MARISCAL SUCRE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

      TEDDY enters with ALICIA, SIPE turns on LIGHT.

                                      TEDDY
                    Do you see the vaccine?

      ALICIA points to a case of vaccine marked "Le Cadeau de la
      R publique de France" with a decal of a French flag. 

                                    LOUD VOICE (o.c.)

                    Teddy, heads up.

        A grim-faced SERGEANT, gun ready, pushes DAX aside.

                                      TEDDY
                    We've come for the vaccine.  We --

                                      SERGEANT
                    Papers.  Where are your papers?

                                      TEDDY
                    My papers... Yeah, well, y'see my
                    papers have Washington, Lincoln and
                    Grant on 'em...

      TEDDY reaches into his pocket, but he's out of cash.

      SERGEANT yells at ALICIA.

      TEDDY admires her courage.  SERGEANT aims gun at ALICIA.  

                                      TEDDY
                    Hey, hey, hey, don't go pointing
                    that thing at her.

      SERGEANT shoves gun in TEDDY's face.  DAX draws his gun. 
      Drunken SOLDIER enters with his gun.  A standoff.  TEDDY is
      unafraid.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Put the gun down, Dax.  Go back and
                    guard the plane.

                                    DAX
                    But --

                    Take a walk, damnit.

      DAX lowers gun, exits.  SERGEANT laughs, takes out handcuffs.

                    You, Mister America, are under arrest.

      He rolls off her.  They both reach for receiver -- he gets

                    Philip called Ambassador Korman, who
                    sent one of his drones to bail me
                    out.  All charges were dropped.

      DOORMAN opens door.  TEDDY, ALICIA and SIPE emerge.

                                    SIPE

      INT.  BAR/QUITO HILTON - NIGHT

      4 A.M.  Almost deserted.  TEDDY sits with an empty shot glass,
      brooding.  On the jukebox, "Crazy In Love" by Beyonc  PLAYS. 
      WAITER arrives with another vodka.

                                      TEDDY
                    I hate this song.

                    You played this song.  Ten times.

      TEDDY takes the empty shot glass and fires it at the jukebox. 
      The projectile hits the top of the jukebox, which shatters,
      the SONG slows and dies.

                                      TEDDY
                    Put that on my bill.

      WAITER nods, starts to go.  TEDDY grabs his arm.

                    Andr s, my trusted friend, I'm craving
                    something a tad more potent than

                    Geez, how could I not have known.

      EXT.  CLINIC/PUERTO NAPO - NIGHT

      Jeep pulls up.  ALICIA gets out.

      INT.  CLINIC - NIGHT

      She enters the makeshift clinic and is immediately engulfed
      by the pale faces of the ill and dying.

                    Alicia, in the meantime, had returned
                    to Puerto Napo, where the situation
                    was deteriorating with heartbreaking
                    speed.

      ALICIA, defeated, sighs.  As she touches the burning forehead
      of a sickly OLD WOMAN,

      TEDDY hangs up phone, heads toward the VOICE.

      CEURO Y CAICEDO, twenty-two, handsome and lethal, stands

                                    DAX
                    I can try.

                    This is suicide.  Parachuting.  At
                    least take the Gulfstream.

                                    DAX
                    Y'can't jump out of a Gulfstream. 
                    And there's no airstrip big enough
                    on the other side of the mountains
                    to land the plane.

                                    SIPE
                          (re: the crop duster)
                    That tin bucket won't make it over
                    the Andes.  You'll crash and burn --

                    It's not you I'm concerned about,
                    it's me.  Bringing the body of Teddy
                    Rist back to New York, that's a career
                    killer.

      TEDDY laughs, slips on parachute.  SIPE, desperate, tries
      another tactic:

                    Just over the border.  Why?

                                    SIPE
                    Dax and I could take the jet down
                    there, get one of the company's
                    trucks, be back in a day or less.

                    A good leader knows when to listen
                    to his troops.  We go with your plan. 

      He hands parachute back to DAX. 

                                    DAX
                    You were scared, huh?

                    standing here?  Take off.  

      DAX slips out his gun, offers it to TEDDY who takes it and
      hides it.  DAX and SIPE go into the plane.  TEDDY's cell
      RINGS.  He answers it, as he walks away from the jet.

      EXT.  CAICEDO ESTATE - DAY

      In the mountains.  CUERO sits by the pool, in swimming trunks,
      surrounded by beautiful, bikini'd WOMEN.

                                      CUERO

                    ready in one hour.  It will take you
                    over the mountains to Misahaulli,
                    where I will have a jeep, a driver
                    and some bon-bons waiting for you.

      Another call comes in.  He sees caller ID: it's Philip.

      CU on TEDDY, that really hurt.

      CU on PHILIP, he hadn't intended to say so much.

      EXT.  THE ANDES MOUNTAINS - DAY

      The helicopter flies over an awesome mountain range.

                    We were making pretty good time,
                    almost at our destination --

      HEAR CAMERA CLICKING AND WHIRLING.

      INT.  HELICOPTER - DAY

      TEDDY sits beside the PILOT, filming.  Next to TEDDY is a
      backpack with the Maidstone-Rist logo.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    When suddenly we got a radio call
                    from the DEA.

                                      BETTY LYNN (v.o.)
                    Our DEA?

                    A joint operation with the Ecuadorian
                      authorities.  They'd been tracking
                    Cuero's activities and decided it
                    was time to flex.  They ordered us
                    to land -- or be obliterated.

      EXT.  LANDING STRIP/PROVINCE OF NAPO - DAY

      The helicopter lands amidst several POLICE VANS, local
      POL CIA and DEA AGENTS with machine guns pointed at it.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    We landed.

      TEDDY and the PILOT climb out.

                    Manos ariba, pendejos.

      Both MEN comply.  DEA AGENTS start to search them and the
      helicopter.  One of the AGENTS grabs the backpack.

                                      TEDDY
                    Careful with that.

                                    DEA AGENT
                    Shaddup.

                    Shaddup.

      DEA AGENT slugs him.  TEDDY takes the punch.  AGENT hands
      backpack to COMMANDER, who unzips the flap, pulls out a vial
      of the vaccine.

                                    DEA COMMANDER
                    What kind of drug is this?

      DEA AGENT shrugs.

                                      TEDDY
                    It's a vaccine.

      DEA AGENT pulls out DAX's gun.

                    I can explain about the gun.  It's
                      registered -- but not in Ecuador and
                    not to me --

                    Yo, Bucky, what part of "Shaddup"
                    don't you understand?

      He hits TEDDY again, knocking him face down into the dirt. 
      DEA AGENT puts his foot on the back of TEDDY's neck.  A second
      AGENT holds up a brick of coke from the copter, while a THIRD
      hands COMMANDER Teddy's passport, which he opens, recognizes
      the name.  He signals TEDDY to rise and step forward.

                                    DEA COMMANDER
                    You have five seconds to explain
                    what's going on.

                                      TEDDY
                    I'm trying to get the vaccine to
                    Puerto Napo, this gentleman offered
                    me a ride.

      The PILOT is being handcuffed.

                    May I?

      DEA COMMANDER nods.  TEDDY takes out business card.

      DEA COMMANDER contemplates the situation, then hands TEDDY
      the backpack.

                    Next time you bum a ride, Mister

                    Sorry, we're taking this scumball
                    back to Quito.

                                      TEDDY
                    How far is Puerto Napo from here?

                    Don't push your luck, sir.  

      Resigned, TEDDY reaches into backpack, takes out his SAT
      phone, turns on the GPS mode.  Full color map of area appears. 
      TEDDY slings the backpack over his shoulder, starts to walk
      off.  He hears the "Shaddup" DEA AGENT laughing, crosses to
      the AGENT, whose back is to him.

      DEA AGENT turns.  TEDDY swings and connects with the guy's
      jaw.  HEAR teeth cracking.  The AGENT drops, out for the
      count.  As TEDDY hoofs it down a desolate road,

      FADE IN:

      INT.  PHILIP'S OFFICE/MAIDSTONE-RIST - DAY

      PHILIP faces OLIVIA.

                                      PHILIP
                    He runs around the world, juiced-up,
                    his dick swinging --

                                      OLIVIA
                      I understand why you're angry --

                                      PHILIP
                    Do you?  Do you honestly?

      She is about to speak when -- INTERCOM BUZZES.

                                      ASSISTANT (o.c.)
                    DeWitt Burton is here.

      Both OLIVIA and PHILIP are surprised.

                                      PHILIP
                    Send him in.

                                      OLIVIA
                          (opens side door)
                    Believe in Teddy.

                                      PHILIP
                    I'll leave that to you, darling.

      Frustrated, she exits, as BURTON enters through main door. 
      He's far less confrontational.

                                      BURTON
                    Philip, I'll get right to the point. 
                    I didn't mean to imply mismanagement
                    on your part.  But I am critical of
                    excess -- of Teddy's excess.

                                      PHILIP
                    What is this?  Divide and conquer?

                                      BURTON
                    Give me five minutes, to talk about
                    this company's future.  Your son's
                    future.

      A beat, then --

                                      PHILIP
                    Have a seat.

      EXT.  ROAD/PROVINCE OF NAPO - DAY

      The middle of nowhere.  TEDDY's been walking a long, long
      time.  There's a farmhouse, which he approaches, yells:

                                      TEDDY
                     Hola?

      He sees a 1965 Triumph Bonneville, beaten-to-shit, by the
      side of the house.  He crosses to the motorcycle, admiring
      the craftsmanship, wondering if it works.  HEAR a GUN cock. 
      TEDDY turns to see a NATIVE MAN, holding a rifle on him.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Man, this is not my day.
                          (puts up his hands)
                    Necesito agua.

      NATIVE MAN studies him, cautiously.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Voy a Puerto Napo con vacuna para 
                    los ni os.

      He indicates backpack.  NATIVE MAN slowly lowers gun.

                                      NATIVE MAN
                     Usted anda a Puerto Napo?

                                      TEDDY
                      Desgraciadamente, s .  Unless.
                          (points to Triumph)
                     Sirve, esto?  

      NATIVE MAN nods.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                     Me Los prestas?   

      NATIVE MAN nods. 

      CELL PHONE RINGS.  TEDDY digs it out of backpack.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                     Hola?

                                      TEDDY
                    Not a good time.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Come home.  Immediately.

                                      TEDDY
                    You, the Queen of Giving, is telling
                    me to walk away?

                                      OLIVIA
                    I've learned one thing running the
                      foundation.  You can't save everyone.

                    Philip needs you here.

      The NATIVE MAN points to phone and then to his own chest.

                                      TEDDY
                    Give you this?  Gladly.

      TEDDY shuts cell, hanging up on OLIVIA.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Hello?

      TEDDY hands over cell, goes to motorcycle.  NATIVE MAN raises
      rifle, threatening.

                                      TEDDY
                    Oh, come on, dude.

                                      NATIVE MAN
                          (re: cell)
                    Esto no es suficiente.

                                      TEDDY
                     Qu  m s quieres? 

      NATIVE MAN points to Teddy's digital camera.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Not the camera.  Ninguna manera.

      TEDDY thinks for a beat, then indicates his watch.  NATIVE
      MAN shakes head no, shows TEDDY that he already has one. 
      NATIVE MAN stares up and down at TEDDY, then smiles.  He
      points to Teddy's La Sportiva hiking boots.

      NATIVE MAN's hand, delighting him,

      MORGANA is in the early stages of sculpting a clay bust. 
      MAID enters.

                    Olivia Maidstone is at the door.

      MORGANA raises her head, surprised.

      INT.  LIVING ROOM/MORGANA'S APARTMENT - DAY

      OLIVIA stands in doorway as MORGANA enters.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I worried that if I called ahead,
                    I'd be told you were out.  May I
                    come in?

                                      MORGANA
                    Sure, I'm always happy to talk to
                    ghosts.  Sit. 

      They settle into chairs.

                                      MORGANA (cont.)
                    I suppose I should be polite and
                    offer you something.  Arsenic?

                    Listen, Morgana, I know I haven't
                    been the best of friends --

                    You haven't been any kind of friend.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I hope you'll forgive me.  Or not... 
                    I'm here about Teddy.  He's been
                    crazier than usual since the divorce --

                                      MORGANA
                    It's not the divorce.

      expert efforts, he drops the bike on the road.  As he falls,
      he tries to protect the backpack containing the precious
      vaccine.  He hits the ground hard. 

      He shakes off the road burn and gets up.  More GUNFIRE.  As

      checks his feet which are muddy and bleeding.  He sits on a
      mossy log, does not see a snake -- crawling nearby slowly on
      its belly -- until too late.  It snaps and bites his ankle.

                    to Daddy.  No, don't go. 

      He takes off after the phantom.

      He runs and runs -- it's almost as if his SON is leading him
      to safety, leading him to:


                                                                (CONTINUED)      "The Philanthropist"                                     57.

      A clearing.  TEDDY sees the village of Puerto Napo.  He stops,
      breathing deeply, sweating profusely.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                     Dios mio!

      His legs give out.  As TEDDY collapses,

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT.  WORKROOM/MORGANA'S APARTMENT - DAY

      MORGANA molds the clay bust; then stops, staring at the image. 
      As she reaches over and squeezes the clay with her fingers,
      destroying her work,

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      INT.  CLINIC/PUERTO NAPO - DAY

      CU on TEDDY's face, eyes fluttering open.  As he focuses,
      CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL an ECUADORIAN BOY, gazing at him. 
      ALICIA appears next to the BOY, shoos him away. 

                                      TEDDY
                    I made it.

                                      ALICIA
                          (joking)
                    Yeah.  What took you so long?

                                      TEDDY
                    And the vaccine?

                                      ALICIA
                    Already kicking in.  Look. 

      TEDDY's POV -- PEOPLE, standing on line, getting vaccinated.

      RESUME ALICIA, who smiles.

                                      ALICIA (cont.)
                    I don't know how I will ever repay
                    you.

      As TEDDY smiles,

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

      INT.  ROADHOUSE - DAY

      TEDDY smiles at the memory.

                                      TEDDY
                    Her eyes were on fire, so alive, so
                      beautiful... We made love that night
                    under the moon...

                    Haw.

      The sound brings TEDDY out of his revelry.

                                      BETTY LYNN (cont.)
                    I ain't buying this cock'n'bull story.

                                      TEDDY
                    Come with me, I'll take you back
                    there to prove it to you.  Or to
                    Paris.  France, not Texas.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    If I go with you to the airport and
                    there's no super-duper jet, all my
                    friends who work over there are gonna
                    call me a fool.  Ansley Barber put
                    you up to this, didn't he? 

      TEDDY takes out checkbook, writes, rips the check out.

                                      TEDDY
                    Here's a check for one hundred
                    thousand dollars.

      She takes it, examines it, rips it into pieces, which she
      tosses in TEDDY's face.  He puts up his hands.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    That's it, I surrender.  I'm leaving.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    Hoo-ray.

      TEDDY exits.  BETTY LYNN clears his glass, wipes bartop. 

      On TV: CNBC -- Teddy's face is on the screen.  BETTY LYNN
      turns up the sound.

                                      BARTIROMO
                    -- Rumors are flooding Wall Street
                    that Philip Maidstone is abandoning
                    his long-time partner Teddy Rist, in
                    favor of an alliance with DeWitt
                    Burton --

      HEAR the sound of a jet.  She looks out window.

      BETTY LYNN'S POV -- A Gulfstream G550 soaring.

      RESUME BETTY LYNN, mouth agape.  As she scoops up the pieces
      of the hundred thousand dollar check and starts trying to
      reassemble it,

                                                                                  CUT TO:      "The Philanthropist"                                     59.

      INT.  GULFSTREAM G550 - DAY

      TEDDY sits, eating Bean Buddies.  SIPE is on computer.

                                      TEDDY
                    How're those numbers coming?

                                    SIPE
                    Pretty good.  If we produce the Amazon
                    perfume in Puerto Napo, instead of
                    Brazil, we'll add about five million
                    dollars to the local economy in the
                    first year alone...

      TEDDY nods, ponders the countryside passing below.  He reaches
      for phone, speed-dials.

                                      VOICE
                    The Maidstone-Rist Foundation.  

                                      TEDDY
                    Peter?  Teddy for Olivia.

      He leans down, picks up his son's metal top (from Morgana's
      apartment) and puts it on the table in front of him.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Hey... I'm on my way back... So,
                    what else needs fixing?

      TEDDY pushes down the red knob.  As the top SPINS, colors
      twirling, full of life,

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
