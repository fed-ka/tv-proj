  As we PUSH IN to the upper floors, we hear the voice of PAM.

                                    PAM (O.S.)
                    Aw c'maaaahn!


  WIDE on a 100' luxury motor yacht, skimming across the Pacific.

                                      GILLETTE (O.S.)
                    Oh, would you relax?


  On GILLETTE, dressed like Thurston Howell III, reclining in a
    swivel chair on the bridge, lazily holding a FRUITY DRINK.

                                      GILLETTE
                    You rent a boat, that money's gone. 
                    This way, we can sell it when we're
                    done.  I bet it'll come out cheaper.  

    WIDER: LANA, in her tactical attire, stands at the steering
    wheel/dashboard, intently watching the ocean as she steers.

                                    LANA
                    I wasn't talking about the boat.

    REVEAL: a handsome, shirtless, and slender young Filipino guy,
  MANU, 18, kneels on the floor massaging Gillette's bare feet.

                                      GILLETTE
                    Five grand for the week was a steal.

                                    LANA
                    So a twink escort you rent, but --

                                      GILLETTE
                    That's different!  You can't -- I
                    mean, they did ask if I wanted to
                    actually buy him, but I thought...

                                    LANA
                    What, that I'd be weird about it?

                                      GILLETTE
                    I --                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     3

                                    LANA
                    That I, perhaps due to my race, might
                    have a problem with the concept of
                    owning a human being?

  Beat.

                                      GILLETTE
                      I actually just thought I'd get tired
                    of him.

                                    LANA
                    You?  Mr. Can't Even Commit To A Pet?

                                      GILLETTE
                    Wh-?  Yeah hi, two cats!  One of whom
                    I think has FIP, so... commit that.


  As we slowly PUSH IN to the pirate fortress, from deep within
  its damp stone walls we hear a bloodcurdling scream: ARCHER.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                          Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagghhhhhhhhhh!


  Wide elevated-angle shot, looking down into the courtyard of
  the fort, where about twenty PIRATES mill about doing pirate
    things (coiling ROPE, sharpening MACHETES, cleaning ASSAULT
    WEAPONS) with most of them glaring sullenly up toward camera.

                                    NOAH (O.S.)
                    Item one.  The morale problem.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    How do we have a morale problem?


                                      BUCKY (O.S.)
                    Raja lemah!  Raja lemah!


  Bucky stands on a tree stump addressing the assembled pirates.

                                      BUCKY (O.S.)
                    Kita memerlukan raja baru!

    Archer strides in, Noah hovering behind him with the CLIPBOARD.

                                      ARCHER
                    Whoa whoa!  Bucky!  What is this?!

                                      BUCKY
                    We hold erections for king!

                                      ARCHER
                    Well, flattering, not really necessary...

                                    NOAH
                    He means elections.

                                      ARCHER
                    Okay, that makes more -- wait, what?!

                                      BUCKY
                    Time for new king!  Raja baru!

                                      PIRATES
                    [assorted grumblings and murmurs]

                                      ARCHER
                    Okay, pirates!  Hey!  Take a knee!
                          (beat)
                    Noah.  You wanna...?

                                    NOAH
                    That won't translate.  It's like
                    last week when you said "lend me
                    your ears" and they were like "Apa?"

                                      ARCHER
                    Damn it --

                                    NOAH
                    I can't do idioms.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     15

                                      ARCHER
                    Shut up.  Then unshut up, and tell
                    them I understand their frustration...

                                    NOAH
                    Saya mendengar anda!

                                      ARCHER
                    But you don't change horses in mid --

                                    NOAH
                    Idiom!

                                      ARCHER
                    Now is not the time for a new king!

                                    NOAH
                    Sekarang tidak ada raja baru!

                                      ARCHER
                    Because the king is strong!

                                    NOAH
                    Raja yang kuat!

                                      BUCKY
                    If you so strong... melawan raja!

                                      PIRATES
                    Yah!  Melawan raja!  Melawan raja!

                                      ARCHER
                    What's melawan raja?

                                    NOAH
                      King-fight.  If the king loses to a
                      challenger in one-on-one combat, he
                    has to step down.  Or just be dead.

                                      ARCHER
                    Since when?!

                                    NOAH
                    Since always.  Did you not read the
                      orientation materials?

26FLASHBACK: PIRATE FEAST -- NIGHT

    Pirates around a bonfire in background as Archer staggers into
    foreground, shirtless and wearing a crazy tropical STRAW HAT,
    a bottle of RUM in the hand that's slung over a native girl, a
    flaming BOOKLET ("Pirate King Orientation") in the other hand.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     16



                                      ARCHER
                    Mmmmore skimmed it?

  Bucky hops off the stump, raises his arms to the crowd.

                                      BUCKY
                    Enough talk!  Melawan raja!

    Archer takes off his shirt, exposing his muscular torso (NB:
  if we go OTS, make sure we still have the TATTOOS on him.)

                                      ARCHER
                          (chuckling)
                    Okay Bucky, we'll melawan raja...

                                    NOAH
                    Oh, one thing --

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah shut up and translate.
                          (to the room)
                    I accept your challenge!

                                    NOAH
                    Cabaran diterima!

                                      ARCHER
                    Because your mouth's been writing
                    checks your butt can't cash, so now
                    I am gonna hand you your shit!

                                    NOAH
                    Anda --
                          (annoyed sigh)
                    Do you even know what an idiom is?

                                      ARCHER
                      Colloquial metaphor.

                                    NOAH
                    No, it's -- well actually yes, but I
                    really think this is a bad idea --

                                      ARCHER
                    I'm not paying you to think, Noah!
                          (thinks)
                    Even if you weren't a slave.  And
                    your three-fifths of an opinion is
                    noted, so -- oh sweet Jesus Jones!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     17

    REVERSE: before the wickedly grinning pirates stands a... well,
  not quite a man, but not quite a thing.  But if you need a
    reference, The Thing will do.  Only not made of orange rocks. 
    Basically a Malaysian Hulk.  In a loincloth.  But not green.

                                    HULK PIRATE

                      [animal-like growl]

  CUT TO Noah and Archer, the latter slack-jawed in amazement.

                                    NOAH

                    See, Bucky doesn't have to fight you
                    himself.  He can choose a stand-in.

                                      ARCHER

                    Who is... huge!

                                    NOAH

                    That's what I was --

                                      ARCHER
                    Why didn't he come out for lacrosse?!

                                      BUCKY
                    You lucky I don't let him!

                                      ARCHER
                    Let him?

                                    NOAH
                    He's Bucky's girlfriend.

                                      ARCHER
                    Way to eschew traditional gender
                    roles, pirates.

                                    NOAH
                    Yeah, they're fascinating...

                                      BUCKY
                    Now we melawan raja!  And then we
                    see who is bucktooth little shit!

                                      ARCHER
                    It'll still be you.  Listen --

  As the pirates chant, Archer leans in toward Noah.

                                      ARCHER
                    Hey, maybe there's a way to make
                    some money on this.  Bet on me.

                                    NOAH
                    I would, but who'd bet on -- wait,
                    don't you have that backwards?

                                    LANA (O.S.)
                    No.


  3/4 on the yacht as it speeds toward, then past, camera.

                    Because you know what I bet?


  On Archer, a bit blood-spattered, in the Tiger Woods pose.

                                      ARCHER

  On Archer, blood-spattered, coming out of the Tiger pose...

                                      ARCHER
                    Suck it!  Cause I'm still the king!

  ... to reveal he's holding Riley's COLT .45 in the other hand.

    REVEAL: the Hulk Pirate sits on the grass clutching bloody
    fingers over his ruined kneecap, as Bucky hugs his head/neck.

                                      BUCKY
                    This no fair!  You break the rules!

                                      ARCHER
                    What rules?!  We're pirates!

                    Show me!  Show me where it says that!


  New angle on Archer, arms crossed and smug, Noah at his side.

                                      ARCHER
                    Take your time.  I'm hourly.

  CUT TO Bucky as he flips through Archer's half-burned BOOKLET.

                                      BUCKY
                    I know it in here somewhere...

                    Nooop!  Fair is -- well it wasn't
                    exactly fair, but since it wasn't
                    expressly forbidden... tough titties!
                          (thinks)
                    Wow, I never realized how much we
                    rely idioms.

                    Duh.

    SCROOWNK!  We hear Riley on the P.A., followed by feedback. 
    Archer and Noah and all the rest look skyward, confused.

    ZZZRPT!  Riley (we assume) hits a switch.  The P.A. goes silent.

    Archer sprints off, COLT .45 at the ready, followed by Noah.


  On the (unglassed, castle-like) windows of the radio room.

  LOW ANGLE: several PIRATES scale a makeshift LADDER as the
    GRENADE flies past them and down to the next level and WHOOM! 
  It explodes, flinging two PIRATES ass-over-teakettle, "A-Team"
    style, over the low parapets of whatever level they're on.

                    It's empty!  Because you emptied it!
                    Into the only radio on the island!


  The luxury motor yacht sits at anchor offshore, under a sky
    brilliant with stars and just a thumbnail sliver of moon. 

                                    LANA (O.S.)
                          (loud-ish)
                    His narrow twinky ass better not
                    steal the boat, is all I'm saying...


  On (what one assumes is) the side of the island opposite the
    lagoon, Lana (from knees up), with a black DUFFEL BAG slung
  over her shoulder, pulls a ZODIAC onto the beach by its bow
    handle and then drops it with a wet THUMP onto the sand.

                                    LANA
                    Oh!  And just, before we get in there,
                    I am not still attracted to Archer! 
                    I'm sure he's still attracted to me,
                    though, I mean, he'd have to be --

    Gillette, a DUFFEL BAG over his shoulder, walks into the shot. 
  He has a PATCH/BANDAGE over his injured eye.  He says nothing.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     35

                    Uh, blind... not to, um... I am so
                    sorry about that.  Does it hurt?
                          (no response)
                    Ray, seriously, I'm sorry.
                          (no response)
                    Oh, now you're giving me the silent
                      treatment?!  What're you, six?!

    SHUNK!  Suddenly they are illuminated by blinding FLOODLIGHTS.

                                      GILLETTE
                    No...

    REVERSE: a half dozen PIRATES are silhouetted in front of some
  huge FLOODLIGHTS, ASSAULT WEAPONS aimed Lana and Gillette-ward.

                    Just professional.

  CUT TO Lana and Gillette, their hands raised in surrender.

                    Hey, guys...
