                    Kids love to feed off the drama of 
                    things like this.  I hope this can

      Jane shrugs.  Who s to say.

                    How long has Bright Arch been

                    Uh.  Almost ten years now.

                    Was that all the students?

                                  MACLEAN
                    Yes, we like to keep a low 
                      counsellor-student ratio so that 
                    everyone gets the focused 
                    individual attention they need.

                    The gimmick, the hook.  How do you 
                    sell the place to prospective

                    It s a simple, natural, healing 
                    community where your troubled and 
                      underachieving sons and daughters 
                    will be encouraged to get in touch

                                  JANE
                    Encouraged how?

                                  MACLEAN
                    By a code of honor and discipline. 
                    By learning wilderness skills and 
                    teamwork through an up-close 
                    experience with Mother Nature.  
                    We teach them how to survive.  How 
                    to make a fire, catch a fish, make 
                    a shelter.  That s primitive, 
                    powerful stuff.  Makes you strong.  

                                  JANE
                    That s a good pitch.

                                  MACLEAN
                    It s a good program.

      There is a small KNOCK at the door and CASSANDRA  CASSIE  
      MINIVER, 16, enters with a mug of tea, (we don t notice or at 
      least pay any attention to the letter Z's that form the cup s 
      motif).  She s a tomboy through and through.  Jane notices 
    her hastily done and chipped nails.  It s the only overtly 
      feminine thing on her.  She s been crying, and struggles to 
      give Maclean a smile.  Maclean is a tiny bit unhappy to see 
      her, but covers it well.

                                  MACLEAN (CONT D)
                    Yes, Cassie?

                    Oh.  Thank you.  Yes.  That s nice 
                    of you.

    She hands the tea to Maclean and exits.

                    Tell me about Justin.  Why was he 
                    wearing an electronic monitoring 
                    device?  I don t see anyone else 
                    wearing one.

                                  MACLEAN 
                    Justin has only been with us three 
                    months.  He s still in a rebellious 
                    phase.  The day before yesterday, 
                    Justin left campus without 
                    permission for several hours.  And 
                    refused to tell us where he had 
                    been or with whom.  His punishment 
                    was spending eight hours in the 
                    reflection room and the electronic 
                    monitoring device for two weeks.

                      Confinement and dog collars would 
                    certainly encourage discovery of 
                    inner resources, I guess.  But do 
                    the kid s parents know that s part

      A small, grim bare room with four cots in it.  Each cot has a 
      wooden chest at its foot, with the student s name stencilled

    Cho and Rigsby scan the room, and unpack the meager

                    A little deprivation and discipline

      enigmatic symbols amid naive representations of rivers and

    Cho enters and sits down next to Winston, a sober drunk now; 
      cuffed, seated.  Cho occasionally scratches his neck and

                    Sorry for the misunderstanding 
                    yesterday.  Mr. Jane will comport

                    I m just kidding around with you.

                    you re scared of him.  And we are

                    Let s put a pin in that, shall we?

                    Prentiss at the home of Mr. 
                    Winston, on the night he went AWOL. 
                    He was with a group of kids that 
                    went up there on a regular basis to 
                    torment Mr. Winston.

                    Why don t you believe him?  Why 
                    would he lie?

                                  MACLEAN
                    He s a crazy old man with a grudge 
                    against the school.  Perhaps he was 
                    crazy enough to do something.  He s 
                    complained plenty times before and 
                    there was never any reality to it.

                    They re scared and their thinking

                    Orrin, we can let this go or we can

                    will have to involve lawyers and

                    Zachariah was a lumberjack, hundreds 
                    of years ago.  A log fell on him in 
                    the river and pinned him by the arm.  
                    His logging crew tried, but they 
                    couldn t get him out.  The river was 
                    rising and a snowstorm was coming 
                    and his crew figured he was done for 
                    anyway, so they left him there, left 
                    him for dead.  Zachariah was so 
                    angry at them for leaving him, that 
                    he chopped his own arm off to free 
                    himself, then went back to the 
                    lumber camp and hacked everyone of 
                    his workmates to death, chopped them 
                    up and put their heads in the trees.  

                                  JANE

                    That lumbercamp where they died?  
                    This is it, right here.  This 
                    school is in the exact same spot.

                    Where can we find Cassie right now?

                                  MACLEAN
                    I m sure she has nothing to do with 
                    this.  But I ll have someone fetch 
                    her for you.

      Maclean goes to the door and out. 


      Lisbon and Jane and Cassie and Missy Jenkins as chaperone. 
      Cassie s scared, embarrassed.  Wants to cooperate, but is 
      scared too.

                                  CASSIE
                    No, no.  We didn t, we weren t, no.

                                  JANE
                    Cassie, look at me.  It s easy to 
                    see when you re lying.  You get a 
                    little pulse going in your neck 
                    just there.  You must tell Agent 
                    Lisbon the truth. 

                                  LISBON
                    Did Mr. Maclean have sexual 
                    relations with you?

      Cassie takes a beat, relents.

                                  CASSIE
                    Yes he did.

                                  LISBON
                    One time?  Or more than that?

                                  CASSIE
                    More.  Maybe twice a week for a few 
                    months now.

                                  LISBON
                    You know that by having sex with 
                    you, Mr. Maclean was committing a 
                    crime?

                                  CASSIE
                    I guess.

                    I was scared.

      Cassie shakes her head.

      Cassie s brief angry look tells them that s the strange

                    When Cassie brought Maclean tea in a cup 
                    with Z's on it, that was a warning from 
                    you, to keep his mouth shut.  You were 
                    the first to put forth the Zachariah 
                    story.  And you ve been at the school 
                    the longest, with no desire to leave. 
                    The sacred fire confirmed my hunch.
