      INT. GOODWIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      A tight shot of college professor BENJAMIN GOODWIN, 72, wild
      hair, colorful coat -- sort of a cross between Willy Wonka
      and Doc Brown from "Back to the Future" -- sitting behind a
      desk, staring into the camera.

                                      BENJAMIN
                      Congratulations.  You are the
                    winner. 

                                      LAWRENCE (O.S.)
                    And cut!  That's it.  We're done.

      Benjamin's lawyer LAWRENCE BUTLER, mid-40s, has been
      recording him with a video camera on a tripod.  Benjamin
      smiles and swivels in his chair to look out the window.  His
      back is to us; we see only his hand on the armrest.

      CHYRON: BENJAMIN GOODWIN, AGE 72

                                      LAWRENCE (cont'd)
                    And you were worried you might die
                    before you finished.  
                          (chuckles)
                      Ridiculous, right?  Mr. Goodwin?

      Benjamin's hand goes limp. The chyron changes to:

      CHYRON: BENJAMIN GOODWIN, RECENTLY DECEASED

    We PAN OVER to a FAMILY PORTRAIT on the wall of Benjamin and
      his three children in 1989.  The oldest son, HENRY, stands
    at attention in a boy scout uniform.  The middle child, a
      girl named CONEY, is a classic nerd.  The youngest, JIMMY,
      mischievous, holds a very scared-looking family cat. 

    We push in on Henry...


      INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

      And match cut to DR. HENRY GOODWIN -- tall, handsome,
      exceedingly competent in all things -- as he examines an X-
      ray and addresses a hospital administrator.

      CHYRON: HENRY GOODWIN, AGE 36.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 2.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

                                      HENRY 
                    Yep, it's gonna rupture.  Prep him
                    for surgery, STAT.  Annie, what
                    else?

    He starts washing his hands as ANNIE, his assistant, reads
      emails from his phone.  Henry responds with blazing speed.

                                      ANNIE
                    A few reminders.  Your acceptance
                    speech for the Kaiser Foundation Man
                    Of The Year award--

                                      HENRY
                    I'll write it tonight during my
                    shift at the animal shelter.  What
                    else?

                                      ANNIE
                    Frances from the food bank--

                                      HENRY
                    Sign me up to volunteer on Sunday in
                    between hosting the Lions Club
                    brunch and my workout.  God I need
                    that workout.  What else?

                                      ANNIE
                    Your fianc e's birthday--

                                      HENRY
                    Cancel my workout.  I'll be making a
                    brooch in my metal shop that's an
                    exact replica of the one her great
                      grandmother wore.  What else?

      Suddenly Annie gasps.  She is startled by what she's read.

                                      HENRY (cont'd)
                    Annie?  What else?

                                      ANNIE
                    Your father died.

      A parade of emotions storms across Henry's face: shock,
      sadness, a little anger...

                                      ANNIE (cont'd)
                    Doctor, I'm so sorry. We should get
                    someone else to do the surgery--

                                      HENRY
                          (steely resolve)
                    No.  It has to be me.        THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 3.

    He strides out purposefully.  Annie swoons.

      INSERT:  Family portrait.  PUSH IN on young, nerdy Coney...


      INT. CLUB - NIGHT

      ...Who has grown up to become the beautiful CONEY GOODWIN,
    in a black dress, serving TEST TUBE SHOTS at a club on the
      LAS VEGAS STRIP to a COLLEGE GUY and his buddies.

                                      CONEY
                    Okay boys, who wants shots?!

                                      COLLEGE GUY
                    Aren't you a little old for a shot
                    girl?

                                      CONEY
                    Old?  I'm 28! 
                          (flirting)
                    But if anyone asks, I'm 26.

      CHYRON: CONEY GOODWIN, AGE 32

      DONNA, a much younger and bustier waitress, appears, with a
      tray full of drinks and a look of worry.

                                      DONNA
                    Coney... I still can't figure out
                    the computer.  

      Coney sighs, and quickly eyeballs Donna's tray.

                                      CONEY
                    Three cosmos, two vodka crans, three
                    beers, two champagnes, one martini
                    up, one martini rocks, and a Sprite. 
                          (doing the math
                            ridiculously fast)
                    $218.50.  Twenty percent of which is
                    43.70, which by the way...
                          (re: her boobs)
                    ...you three are earning right now,
                      girlfriend, so don't let 'em stiff
                    you.

                                      DONNA
                    Thank you!  It's so amazing how you
                    do that.  I'm so nervous.  Word is
                    they're gonna fire somebody tonight.

                                      CONEY
                    Relax, you'll be fine, just--      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 4.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

    As Coney says it, Donna drops her entire tray down some poor
      guy's white suit with a CRASH.  Oh boy.


      INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Coney sits with GARY, the douchey 23-year-old club manager.

                                      CONEY
                    Gary, please, you can't fire her. 
                    Sure, she has trouble with the whole
                    "you can't wave to Criss Angel if
                    you're holding a tray full of
                    drinks" thing, but she's sweet and
                    she's trying so hard.

                                    GARY
                    Coney.  Come on.  Why, given the
                    choice, would I fire the 22-year-old
                    with the ginormous cans?

      Coney sighs in relief.

                                      CONEY
                    You, sir, have a ginormous heart. 
                          (then)
                    Wait, what choice?

                                    GARY
                    We're letting you go.  Sorry, but
                    you're smart.  You understand. 

      Gary gets up and exits.  Coney's phone buzzes.  She starts
      listening to a voicemail, and looks shocked.

      INSERT:  The same family portrait.   We push in on Jimmy...


      EXT. MINIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY

      A prison guard unlocks the main gate, and a scruffy-looking
      JIMMY GOODWIN -- all heart, zero impulse control -- steps
      out into freedom, holding a backpack and an acoustic guitar. 
    He turns back to the guard and gives him a big hug.

      CHYRON: JIMMY GOODWIN, AGE 29

                                      PRISON GUARD
                    We're all gonna miss you, Jimmy. 
                    But I bet it feels great to be a
                    free man again.

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah.  Can I stay in jail longer?

                                      JIMMY (cont'd)
                    It's just, I owe this guy Frank,
                    like, a ton of money.  I hate to say
                    bad things about anyone, Frank's a
                    nice guy, but he says he can't wait
                    to kill me with a sledgehammer. 
                          (beat, guilty)
                    See, now I feel bad, Frank's a nice
                    guy.

                                      PRISON GUARD
                    Wish I could help, buddy.

      Jimmy nods, then suddenly punches the guard in the face.

                                      JIMMY
                          (hopeful)
                    Assaulting a guard?

                                      PRISON GUARD
                          (sympathetic smile)
                    Sorry, Jimmy.  

      Just then, Jimmy's phone rings.

                                      JIMMY
                    Oh no.  That's probably Frank...
                          (re: phone, relieved)
                    It's my sister.

                                      PRISON GUARD
                    See?  Maybe this day's not so bad
                    after all.

                                      JIMMY
                          (answering)
                    Hey Coney.

      Jimmy's face falls.  He drops his guitar.


      EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY

      Shots of the small, struggling college town of Granby Ridge,
      New Hampshire and nearby Piscataqua College.  This is where
      the three kids grew up.


      INT.  CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

      Mourners are milling about this very odd funeral.  Among
      other odd, eccentric touches: On top of the coffin sit three
      large pictures: the dog Benji, a mango, and Kirby Puckett.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 6.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

    In front, Coney -- in a way-too-short dress -- is getting a
      huge hug from a rattily-dressed Jimmy.  Henry walks up
      behind Jimmy and flicks his ear with the practice of an
      older brother who's done it for decades.

                                      JIMMY
                    Ow, quit it, Henry--
                          (realizing, happy)
                    Henry!

      Jimmy gives Henry a huge hug.

                                      HENRY
                    Good to see you, Jimmy.
                          (then)
                    No jacket?  Really?

                                      JIMMY
                    Pfft, course I got a jacket.

      Jimmy desperately looks around, swipes a jacket on a nearby
      pew, and puts it on.  It's enormous.  It looks ridiculous. 
      Meanwhile an old lady, MRS. BUTTERFIELD, approaches Coney.

                                    MRS. BUTTERFIELD
                    Coney Goodwin!  Mrs. Butterfield. 
                    Your fifth grade teacher.

                                      CONEY
                    Oh.  Yeah.  Hi.

                                    MRS. BUTTERFIELD
                    You were the smartest student I ever
                    taught.  I'll bet you must be some
                    kinda scientist by now, huh?  Huh?

                                      CONEY
                          (awkward)
                    Got my test tubes and everything.

      Henry cuts in and gives Coney a hug.  As she hugs him back:

                                      CONEY (cont'd)
                    Get me the hell out of here.

                                      HENRY
                    We can't leave, Coney.  In fact, the
                    three of us have a pretty important
                    tradition here.  And as the oldest,
                    I'm gonna insist we stick with it.

      A beat, then Henry holds up a liquor bottle in a paper bag.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 7.

      EXT. CHURCH BELL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

      The three siblings sit in a cozy open space at the top of
      the tower.  Henry pours whiskey into plastic cups for them.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Drinking in church.
                          (wistful)
                    Now it feels like home.

      They laugh.  Henry hands Coney a whiskey.

                                      HENRY
                    You're not gonna tattle on me like
                    you always used to, right?

                                      CONEY
                    I'll admit it: I was a total narc. 
                    But not anymore.
                          (re: whiskey)
                    You're my hero. 

      Henry smiles, then sees a faded graffiti heart in one
      corner: "HG + LH."  He balks a little at the sight.

                                      JIMMY
                    It's been way too long, guys.  To
                    being home!  And to Dad.

      The siblings clink cups.  

                                      CONEY
                    Man, I can't believe Dad's really
                    gone.  No more of his crazy puzzles

                    Remember all those games?

      INT. GOODWIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

      Young Coney and young Henry do homework as Jimmy eats soup. 
      Benjamin jumps into frame with a playful twinkle in his eye.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    Pop quiz!  Let's see who's been
                    studying their Morse Code!  This is
                    the hidden location of one, and only
                    one, ticket to Six Flags!   

      Benjamin turns the lamp on and off in a Morse Code pattern.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 8.

      SUBTITLE: "THE ATTIC." 

      Henry focuses really hard, trying to crack it, but he can't. 
      Coney's eyes light up immediately and she runs off.

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    That's my girl!  

      Young Henry stares after Coney, jealous.

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    You'll get her next time, boys!  

                                      YOUNG JIMMY
                    Okay, Coney may be smarter than us--

                                      YOUNG HENRY
                    She's not smarter than me!  I'm just
                    tired-- 

                                      YOUNG JIMMY
                    --but can she balance soup?

      Jimmy puts his bowl of soup on his head, stumbles, douses
      himself in soup and screams in pain.

                                                                                BACK TO:


      INT. CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY - THE PRESENT

      Back on the siblings, looking wistful.

                                      HENRY
                    Man, why was Dad always making us
                    compete for stuff?

                                      JIMMY
                    I don't know.  He thought it would
                    make us better people, I guess.

      Coney snorts.

                                      CONEY
                    Shows how wrong he was.  Now we
                    hardly ever see each other, and look
                    how great we're all doing.

    An awkward beat as the siblings nod unconvincingly.  We hear
      footsteps -- then LUCINDA HOBBES, the attractive minister of
      the church, appears.  Busted.       THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 9.

                    off in style.

      Lucinda glances at the graffiti heart, then at Henry.  It's
      clear they have some history.  As he passes her:

      INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

    As they head to the front of the church, Henry motions to
      the pictures on the coffin.

                                      HENRY
                    Look, Dad's last puzzle.  Hey Coney,
                    I bet you I can solve it before--

                                      CONEY
                    It's his name.

                          (stunned, then)
                    I knew it right away, too.  I'm just
                    tired.

                                      CONEY
                    Hey, did you prepare anything to say
                    about Dad?

      Henry gives Coney a sly, big-brother smile.

                                      HENRY
                    Nah, I thought I'd just wing it.


      INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

      Henry is at the podium, mid-clearly-memorized-eulogy to the
      rapt audience, as Coney rolls her eyes.

                    that smile... It was the same smile
                    the world saw a few months later,
                    when she won the gold medal for
                      gymnastics.  She owes her life to
                    me.  And I owe my life... to my dad.

      Huge applause.

      Moments later.  Coney is at the podium.

                                      CONEY
                    Hi.  This may sound odd, but I'm
                    gonna use my time up here to talk
                    about Dad, instead of boasting about
                    my own accomplishments.  After all,
                    this is a eulogy... not a me-logy.

      Coney smiles pointedly at Henry.


      INT.  CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

      Moments later.  Jimmy is at the podium, crying.

                                      JIMMY
                    Why did God have to take our Dad?! 
                    Such a jerk move!  See, now I feel
                    bad.  God's a nice guy...

      Henry is at the podium again.

                    My poor sister got too broken up to
                    finish her speech, so she asked me.
                          (pretending to read)
                    "Dad may be gone, but I know he's
                    still up there, watching me... waste
                    my life doing nothing in Las Vegas. 
                    Also, I stuffed my bra until I was

                    sure he'd say, "Henry, we all know
                    your constant over-achieving is just
                    a way to mask your deep, deep
                      insecurity.  We also know you kept a

      Coney stands up in the front pew.

                    What good have I done?  How about
                    not killing our family cat back in
                    1992?  That was pretty good of me!

      INT. LAWRENCE'S OFFICE - DAY

      The three children sit in silence.  Lawrence enters.

                                      LAWRENCE
                    These last few years, your father
                    often spoke sweetly of how much he
                    missed you all.  
                          (then, dryly)
                    I wish he could've seen today's
                    service.  My name is Lawrence
                    Butler.  I worked for him.

                                      JIMMY
                    Dad had a butler?!  Sweet!

                    Butler is my last name.  I'm a
                    lawyer.  Now, how much do you all
                    know about your father's financial
                    situation?

                                      HENRY
                    I know he was an underpaid math
                    professor who lived in a leaky house
                    and drove a '72 Dodge Dart.  Did I
                    leave anything out?

                                      LAWRENCE
                    Quite a bit, actually.  You see,
                    thanks to some projects he was
                    involved with at the college, your
                    father had stake in a few very
                    lucrative patents.  His entire
                    estate is currently valued at... 23
                    million dollars.

                    Here's the deal: I've decided to

      Henry, Coney and Jimmy shoot each other looks.

                    An individual who has grown into
                    full maturity and truly knows what
                    it means to be a good person.

      Coney rolls her eyes as Henry flashes her a grin: It's me.

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    I'm speaking, of course... about
                    none of you. 

      Henry and Coney instantly stand up, talking over each other.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 14.

                    But I need money now or this mostly-
                    nice guy Frank is gonna kill me!!

    As the siblings continue arguing, the lawyer quietly ejects
      the first tape, then puts another tape in the VCR.  Their
      father appears on-screen again.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    ZIP IT!  Henry, quit bragging. 
                    Coney, stop making excuses.  And
                    Jimmy?  Put.  It.  Back.

      Beat. Everyone looks at Jimmy, who removes a gold pen from
      his jacket and puts it back onto the desk.  All three
      siblings look shocked -- how does he know them so well?

      Benjamin resumes speaking.  As he does, Coney notices the
      way he TAPS HIS PENCIL in the video, but she shrugs it off.  

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    You children have so much potential. 
                    But you've let yourselves get lost. 
                    Even worse, you've let each other
                    get lost.  You're each living in
                    your own metaphorical prison.  Or,
                    in Jimmy's case, prison.

                                      JIMMY
                    I got paroled, Pop! 

                                      BENJAMIN
                    You never learned to clean up your
                    messes.  And it's my fault.  Your
                    mother died, and I... dropped the
                    ball.  I'm sorry.
                          (a somber beat, then)
                    This is my last chance to be the
                    parent I should've been, to help you

                    become the people you could be. 
                    Life is a riddle, kids.  If you want
                    this money, it's time to start
                    looking for the answer.  And in
                    order to do that, I'm going to have
                    you play one final contest.  The
                    winner... gets my inheritance. 
                    Who's in?

      The siblings give each other little smiles, then -- one by
      one -- raise their hands.

                                      HENRY
                    I'm in.

                                      CONEY
                    I'm in.

                                      JIMMY
                    I'm in.

    On the screen, Benjamin smiles playfully.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    I knew you would be.  Let the

      FADE IN:


      INT. LAWRENCE'S OFFICE - DAY

      The confused siblings stare at this enigmatic lawyer.

                                      HENRY
                    So what's this last "game"?

                                      LAWRENCE
                    I'm not at liberty to say.

                                      JIMMY
                    Will there be physical challenges? 
                    Not to brag, but I did a lot of push-
                    ups in jail.

                                      HENRY
                    Anything that ends with "in jail"
                    isn't bragging, buddy. 

                                      LAWRENCE
                    I'm not at liberty to say.

                                      CONEY
                    Wait a second.  Why don't we all
                    say, "Screw the game" and split the
                    23 million into 7.66-repeating
                    million dollars each?

                                      LAWRENCE
                    That one I can answer:  No
                    splitting.  Your father stipulates
                    the money can only go to one winner.

                                      HENRY
                    Um, you can't prevent us from
                    sharing the money once one of us
                    wins it.  That's not legal.

      Lawrence smiles cockily and plunks a 200-page legal document
      down on his desk with a THUD. 

                                      LAWRENCE
                    Try me.  The game will commence here
                    tomorrow at 9am.  Until then, go
                    home and rest up.

      INT. GOODWIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      A musty old Victorian house, cluttered with knick-knacks and
      trinkets.  The children enter and take in the memories.

                                      JIMMY
                    Wow, this place is exactly the same.

      A stuffed housecat sits on the shelf.  Coney picks him up.

                                      CONEY
                    Hey look... Finley.
                          (in cat voice)
                    "Why'd you kill me, Henry?  I know I
                    wasn't purrrrrrfect, but--"

                                      HENRY
                    I did not kill Finley!

      Coney smiles, then sees the desk in the corner of the room.

                                      CONEY
                    Oh god, that desk!  All those days I
                    wasted there with Dad...

                                                                          FLASHBACK TO:


      INT. GOODWIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK

      Twelve-year-old Coney -- as geeky and nerded out as a girl
      that age could possibly be -- is being tutored by Benjamin.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    You're going to be a great
                      mathematician, Coney.  Someday, you
                    might even help me prove The Goodwin
                      Conjecture...   

      Benjamin takes an overstuffed folder off a shelf: it reads
      "THE GOODWIN CONJECTURE." 

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    I've been stuck on this for fifteen
                    years.  Solving it could literally
                    change the world...  But no
                    pressure.
                          (picks up a test)
                    Now, your test results.  This was
                    the same calculus exam I give to
                    college seniors, and you got 73 out
                    of 74 questions correct.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 18.

                          (crushed)
                    I got one wrong?  I can do better.

                                      BENJAMIN
                          (chuckles)
                    Don't worry.  I love you anyway.

      Young Jimmy again appears with a soup-bowl on his head.

                                      YOUNG JIMMY
                    Look Dad, I'm balancing--

      The soup again falls on his head.

                                      YOUNG JIMMY (cont'd)
                          (determined)
                    I'll get there.

                    Every time I screwed up, "I love you
                    anyway," "I love you anyway."  I'm
                    so glad I left all that math crap
                    behind.

      Henry checks his cellphone.

                                      HENRY
                    No signal. I'm gonna walk over to
                    the bar to see if the reception's
                    better there.

                                      JIMMY
                    You could use the house phone.

                                      HENRY
                    Oh, in that case, I'm gonna walk
                    over to the bar to get drunk.


      INT. BAR - NIGHT

      A charming small-town bar, unspoiled by the nearby college. 
      Henry enters and sees Lucinda, reading at a corner table.  

                                      HENRY
                    Oh.  Hi.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 19.

                    Hello.

      A fraught moment.  He's about to say something when his
      phone buzzes.  He holds up a finger and answers it.

                                      HENRY
                          (on phone)
                    Hey Honey, can I--  Hydrangeas,
                    sure.  I'll call you right back.
                          (hangs up, then)
                    My fiancee.  I have a fiancee.  That
                    sounds like I'm rubbing it in.  I'm
                    not.  I just do have... a fiancee. 
                    I keep saying "fiancee."

                                      LUCINDA
                          (with a smile)
                    Yeah, stop.  Wanna sit down?

    He sits down across from her.  

                                      HENRY
                    I just want you to know I'm sorry
                    how things went.  With us.

                                      LUCINDA
                    So it was things that went?  'Cause
                    it kind of seemed like you went. 

                                      HENRY
                    You're right.  I went.  And I am so--

                                      LUCINDA
                    Hen, it's fine.  You don't graduate
                    first in your class from Harvard Med
                    just to open a practice in Granby
                    Ridge, New Hampshire.  You were on a
                    rocketship out of town.  Everyone
                    knew it.  I think I knew it too. 

                                      HENRY
                    I'm just saying, for the record,
                    what we had was special.  It was
                    more than special.  It was...

                    Sorry.  What I meant to say was...
                    the best damned sex of your life. 
                    'Cuz since you left, I've been on
                    fire.  Non.  Stop.  Booty.  Amen.

      Henry laughs, then looks pained.

                                      HENRY
                    Lu, seriously, I--

                                      LUCINDA
                    It's okay, Henry.  I forgive you.

                                      HENRY
                    You do?

                                      LUCINDA
                    I have to.  It's my job.

      Henry smiles.  Behind each of their eyes, we maybe see a
      twinge of pain, but the moment is more sweet than bitter. 


      EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOUSE - NIGHT

      Jimmy is walking outside.  His phone rings.  He looks at it. 
    We see that "FRANK" is calling.

      Jimmy puts the phone away nervously.  He looks at a nearby
      house.  A second-story window is ajar.  He ineptly scampers
    up a rain gutter, pulls himself through the window, and...


      INT. DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT

      ...collapses loudly onto the floor.  The light flicks on.

                    Hi, Daddy.

      Jimmy turns to see his eight-year-old daughter, PIPER,
      sitting up in bed.  He smiles, and hugs her tightly.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, baby bird.  I'm sorry I missed
                    your birthday.  Super-long business
                    trip.  But it looks like the
                    merger's going through, which'll
                    really help our fifth quarter--

                                      PIPER

                    I was in jail, yeah.  But I got you
                    a present.

      Jimmy hands Piper a small gift.  She unwraps it excitedly.

                                      PIPER
                    A gold pen!

                    Daddy... did you steal this?

                                      JIMMY
                    No!  Bought it.  At the... Pen Barn. 

                                      PIPER
                    Really?  Do you have a receipt?

      Jimmy has no reply.  Piper sees through him, and hands the
      pen back.  Her disappointment is heartbreaking to him.  

                                      PIPER (cont'd)
                    I think I hear Mom.

      Jimmy hurries back out the window.

      Lawrence addresses the siblings.

                    Before we begin the game, are there
                    any questions?

                                      CONEY
                    Yes.  Little thing.  Who's this guy?

      Reveal ELIJAH, a twenty-two year old African-American man,
      sitting in the fourth chair.  

                                      LAWRENCE
                    This is Elijah.  Elijah's the fourth
                    contestant in the game.

      A beat, then the siblings go ballistic.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 22.

                                      HENRY
                    But who is he?!
                          (to Elijah)
                    Who are you?!

                    Are you our long lost brother?  And
                    by brother I mean brother brother,
                    not... brother brother.  You got
                    that, right?  I have black friends.

      Elijah remains silent.  Henry tries a new tack.

                                      HENRY
                    Guys, let me handle this.  Elijah. 
                    Obviously you were important to our
                    father.  That makes you important to
                    us.  So let's get to know each
                    other.  My name is--

                    your name, or anything else about
                    you.  I'm not here to make friends. 
                    I'm here to win.

                    Oh, if you only knew his story...
                          (then, pointedly)
                    But I'm not at liberty to say.

      With some fanfare, Lawrence reaches under his desk, produces
      a Trivial Pursuit box, and places it in front of them.

                    Trivial Pursuit?  

      Henry, Coney and Jimmy share a look: uh oh.

                    You guys don't like Trivial Pursuit?

    An excited Benjamin holds up TRIVIAL PURSUIT.

      The kids all raise their hands and start playing, happy.

                    Problem was, every game we played
                    always ended the same way... 


      INT. GOODWIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER - FLASHBACK

      The end of the same game.  Young Coney leaps up and launches
      into her trademark victory dance.  Benjamin watches on.

                                      YOUNG CONEY
                          (singing a melody)

                    It's not fair, I was tired!

      Young Henry flips the board over in anger, spilling young
      Jimmy's milkshake in the process.

                                      YOUNG JIMMY

      Jimmy attacks Henry.  Henry deftly picks him up and hangs
      him on the door coathook by his belt loop.

                                      YOUNG JIMMY (cont'd)
                    Lemme down!  Lemme down!

      Young Henry storms out.  Benjamin chimes in gently.

                    Clean up your mess, kids.

                                      YOUNG CONEY
                    Yeah, losers clean up!

      Coney exits the room, laughing, leaving a helpless Jimmy
      dangling on the door hook.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, don't leave me hangin'!  Get

      The four players are now gathered around the board.  

                                      HENRY
                    Well, that was a long time ago.  For
                    $23 million, we can be civil, right?

      They all nod.  Henry rolls the die and moves his piece.

                    "Arts & Literature."

      Jimmy picks out a card and reads it.

                    "In 1992, Henry required four
                    stitches after Coney threw what book
                    at his head?"...  That's weird.  You
                    guys are named Henry and Coney.

      Henry and Coney look at each other, then quickly grab some
      cards out of the box and flip through them.  INSERT shot of
      the cards -- each question is about Henry, Coney and Jimmy.

                                      CONEY
                    All these questions are about us.

      Young Henry looks up from his reading as a furious Coney
      storms up and slams a heavy textbook onto Benjamin's desk.

      Young Henry looks over at the textbook...

      Henry reads from a card with increasing shock.

      Henry looks upset as he looks down at the card.  We see that
      the answer does indeed read "Henry."  But then something
      occurs to him, and he looks up with a grin.

                                      HENRY
                    I'm gonna need the name on the card.

      We're at the endgame -- both Henry and Coney have all six
      wedges.  They smile at each other.

                    Jimmy, you have a daughter.  If you
                    want to have a relationship with
                    her, you have to stop stealing
                    things.  It's that simple. 
                          (to Henry)
                    Sorry, I'm his sister.  If I don't
                    say it, who will? 

      This lands on Jimmy.

                                      HENRY
                    Okay, Coney, we're saying things
                    people need to hear?  How about
                    this:  Stop throwing your life away! 
                    1600 on the SATs and you're waiting
                    tables in Vegas?  Is there any
                    question who disappointed Dad the
                    most?  You had a golden opportunity
                    and you blew it.

                                      JIMMY
                    Oh, like you didn't?  You're such a
                    hypocrite.

                                      HENRY
                    Jimmy, I just defended you.

                                      JIMMY
                    How could you run away from Lucinda? 
                    You loved her.  You obviously still
                    love her.  What are you doing
                    marrying some other girl?  

      This is the most honesty any of the siblings has been
      confronted with in years.  An intense beat.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 30.

                          (re: board game box)
                    Huh, they're right -- this game is
                    fun for the whole family.

      Jimmy sits up, as if realizing something.

                                      JIMMY
                    No.  Guys, we're missing the point.  

      Inspiring music kicks in.

                                      JIMMY (cont'd)
                    Dad loved us all for who we are,
                    faults and all.  This whole game is
                    his way of letting us know that. 
                    This is a trick question. 
                          (to Elijah)
                    My answer is: he wasn't disappointed
                    in any of us.

      A beat. Elijah turns the card over and looks at it.

                                      ELIJAH
                          (reading)
                    "Coney."

      The inspiring music cuts out.

                                      HENRY
                    Ha!  I called it!

                                      CONEY
                    Gimme that.

      Coney grabs the card and looks at it.  Yep.  It says Coney.

                                      CONEY (cont'd)
                          (to herself, hurt)
                    So much for "I love you anyway..."  
                          (shaking it off)
                    No, I don't need any of this.  The
                    only thing I need... is a three.

      She rolls the die... and gets a three.  Silence.  Coney
      moves her piece to the center of the board.

                                      CONEY (cont'd)
                    Science and Nature, please.

                          (reading)
                    "Who left open the window that
                    resulted in the death of our beloved

                          (scoffs)
                    Figures you get the gimme.

      Everyone glances over at Finley.  Coney gets a sly look.

                                      CONEY
                    The answer is... Henry.

                                      HENRY
                    Wrong!  The answer is, of course...
                          (flips card over)
                    "Henry."  What?! 

                                      CONEY
                    Oh my God.  Did I just...

                                      JIMMY
                    Win 23 million bucks?  Yep.

      Coney launches into her trademark victory dance.  

                                      CONEY
                          (singing)
                    I win!  I win I win I win I win! 

                                      HENRY
                    It's not fair, I was tired! 

      Henry flips the board over in anger, spilling Jimmy's beer.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey!  My beer!

      Jimmy attacks Henry.  In a single deft move, Henry deflects
      his attack, scoops him up and once again hangs him on the
      door coathook by his belt loop.

                                      JIMMY (cont'd)
                    Lemme down!  Lemme down!

      Henry storms out.  Coney stands up, laughing.

                                      CONEY
                    Losers clean up.

      Coney exits.  A beat as Jimmy hangs on the hook.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 32.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, don't leave me hangin'!  Get
                    it?!

                                      ELIJAH
                    You guys are one weird-ass family.

      Elijah exits.  Jimmy sighs.


      INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

      Lucinda is working in a pew near the front of the sanctuary. 
      Henry bursts in, still furious.

                                      HENRY
                    You forgive me?!   

                                      LUCINDA
                    Hi Henry. 

                                      HENRY
                    We were practically engaged!  And
                    then I take a job in Boston without
                    telling you, and within three months
                    I'm dating someone else?  What kind
                    of guy does that?  It's
                      unforgivable!

                                      LUCINDA
                    You sound like you regret it.

                                      HENRY
                    I do!  
                          (clarifying)
                    ... regret how I handled it! That's
                    all!  There's nothing unresolved
                    here, if that's what you're
                    thinking.  I don't ever think about
                    you.  I am always never thinking
                    about you.  It's like you don't even--

      Henry kisses her, passionately.  He pulls back, horrified.

                                      HENRY (cont'd)
                    Oh my god.  What did we just do?!

                                      LUCINDA
                    I mostly just stood here.

      Henry is now deep into a full-on, Gene Wilderesque freakout.

                                      HENRY
                    I have a fiancee!

                    And I'm in a church!  I'm engaged! 
                    And I kissed you!  In a church!  And
                    I'm engaged!  I'm the good one! 

      Henry runs off in a panic.  Lucinda sits down, clearly more
      affected than she had been letting on in front of him.


      INT. LAWRENCE'S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING

      The players are gathered as Lawrence enters, smiling.  They
      all sit there, silent and miserable, except Coney.

                                      LAWRENCE
                    So... Trivial Pursuit.  Let's check
                    the results.  Jimmy came in fourth
                    place.  Elijah came in third,
                    somehow beating Jimmy in a quiz
                    about his own family.  Henry was
                    second.  And first place?  Coney.

      Coney smiles, preparing to receive the big check. 

                                      LAWRENCE (cont'd)
                    But of course none of that matters. 
                    Now, the real question: after you
                    finished playing, who cleaned up?  

      Coney stops smiling. The four of them look at each other.  A
      beat.  Slowly, Jimmy raises his hand.  Lawrence grins, and
      presses play on the VCR.  Benjamin reappears on the screen.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    "Clean up your mess." That's a
                    lesson I never taught you kids well
                    enough.  And now look at the messes
                    in all of your lives...

    On Henry:

                                      BENJAMIN  (O.S.) (cont'd)
                    You've hurt people who loved you.

    On Jimmy: 

                                      BENJAMIN  (O.S.) (cont'd)
                    You've let down people who need you.

    On Coney: 

                                      BENJAMIN  (O.S.) (cont'd)
                    You've run away from what makes you
                    special.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 34.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

      But then, Coney notices something. As Benjamin continues on
      the TV, we push in on the PENCIL that he's tapping
      absentmindedly on his desk -- or is he?  Subtly, Coney
      transcribes dots and dashes onto a notepad.

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    And worst of all, you've lost the
                    one thing that can set you right
                    again: each other.  
                          (beat, then fondly)
                    You kids are the best puzzle I ever
                    made.  But what's a puzzle if the
                    pieces don't fit together?

      A beat as this lands on the siblings.  

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    And yes, I know what you're
                    thinking: "Dad's crazy, this whole
                    thing's insane, blah blah blah." 
                    But I bet each one of you heard some
                    things you needed to hear today. 
                    And be honest: for a minute there,
                    wasn't it kinda fun playing Trivial
                    Pursuit together again?  I wish I
                    could've been there to see it...  
                          (beat, then)
                    That being said, only one of you can
                    win the game.  And so...

      Benjamin pauses just long enough for Lawrence to say...

                                      LAWRENCE
                    Jimmy.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    You, my dear, dear--

                                      LAWRENCE
                    Son.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    -- showed strong character by
                    cleaning up.  Congratulations.  You
                    are the winner... 

      Jimmy can't believe it!  On-screen, Benjamin takes a beat.

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    ... of five points.

      Huh?  Confused silence.  Benjamin continues:      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 35.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    As you'll soon find out, this game
                    is about much more than simply
                    winning my inheritance.
                          (playful smile)
                    But I don't want to spoil the
                    surprise just yet.  

      Benjamin winks and the video ends.  Lawrence walks over to a
      chalkboard divided into quadrants (one for each contestant),
      and writes a "5" in the box labeled "James."

                                      CONEY
                    Five points?  I thought we're
                    playing for 23 million bucks.

                                      LAWRENCE
                    You are.  Trivial Pursuit was the
                    first game in that competition.  

                                      ELIJAH
                    The first game?

                                      LAWRENCE
                    The second game starts tomorrow at
                    9AM precisely.  But for today's
                    victory, Jimmy, you get three
                    hundred dollars.

      Lawrence starts counting out the money to Jimmy as the three
      other contestants act completely stunned.

                                      JIMMY
                    Nice!

                                      HENRY
                    I need a drink.

                                      CONEY
                    Um, me too. Winner pays.

                                      HENRY
                          (to Elijah)
                    Join us?

                                      ELIJAH
                    Nah.  I'm gonna rest up for
                    tomorrow.  But yeah, you all go out,
                    get drunk, stay up late.

                                      HENRY
                    Seriously...who are you?

      Elijah takes a deep breath.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 36.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

                                      ELIJAH
                    Okay, I'll tell you.  I'm your
                    father's illegitimate son.
                          (off their shock)
                    Or maybe I'm a noble stranger who
                    saved his life once...  Or maybe I'm
                    a ruthless extortionist who knows
                    his deep, dark secret...  
                          (chuckles, then)
                    No, seriously, here's who I am: I'm
                    the guy who's gonna win all that
                    money.  I dare you to find out more
                    about me.  See ya tomorrow, Henry.

      Elijah exits.  A confused beat.

                                      HENRY
                          (oddly touched)
                    He remembered my name.

      Coney finishes deciphering her Dad's Morse Code message on
      the pad.  It reads simply, "THE ATTIC."

                                      JIMMY
                    So...bar?

                                      CONEY
                    I'll meet you guys.


      INT. GOODWIN HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

      Coney enters the attic to discover an overstuffed folder on
      the floor: THE GOODWIN CONJECTURE.  She finds a POST-IT on
      the front, which reads: "YOUR NEXT PUZZLE..."  There's a
      little arrow indicating she should flip it over.  She does.

    It reads, "I LOVE YOU ANYWAY."

      Coney can't help but smile, then she starts crying.  For the
      first time, she realizes her father is really gone. 


      INT. BAR - NIGHT

      Henry and Jimmy drink beers together. 

                                      HENRY
                    I still don't get it.  Why did Dad
                    think I killed Finley?

                                      JIMMY
                    Because you did.  You left that
                    window open when you snuck out to
                    see Lucinda.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 37.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

                                      HENRY
                          (stunned)
                    Are you serious?  But...why did you
                    take the blame?

      Jimmy just shrugs.

                                      JIMMY
                    We're brothers.

      Henry looks at Jimmy in amazement, a bit moved.

                                      HENRY
                    Yeah.  We are.

      Henry then notices Lucinda, at her table across the bar. 
      They share a curious, confused look, then she turns away and
      leaves.  Henry tries to shake it off.

                                      HENRY (cont'd)
                    Hey Jimmy, how about another round?

                                      JIMMY
                    Can't.  I'm broke.

                                      HENRY
                    You blew through three hundred bucks
                    in one night?

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah...  I had to pay off a debt.


      INT. BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

      Piper walks into her bedroom, and discovers an adorable
      giant stuffed bird on her bed -- with a receipt taped right
    in the middle of its belly.  She smiles.


      INT.  BAR - MOMENTS LATER

      Coney arrives, smiling at her brothers.  A certain
      overstuffed folder peeks out of her bag.  She nods over to
      the bar's shelf of games, books, etc.

                                      CONEY
                    Guess what I found over there?

      Coney holds up a tattered bar copy of Trivial Pursuit, and
      asks an unspoken question.  Jimmy and Henry smile.  

                                      HENRY
                    Sure, why not?       THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 38.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

      She starts setting up the board.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, how long do you think this
                      "competition" will last, anyway?

                                      CONEY
                    Not too long, I hope.  I gotta get
                    back.  I mean, I could probably stay
                    for a few days...  

                                      HENRY
                    Yeah, I don't need to be back in
                    Boston immediately.  I can cancel
                    some stuff.  I mean, if necessary.

      Jimmy looks at both of them, incredulous. 

                                      JIMMY
                    Oh, shut up.  Being back here is
                    kinda nice and you both know it.

      A beat as Henry and Coney share a look.  Although they'd
      never admit it -- Jimmy's right.

                                      HENRY
                    So we'll stick around.  Can't take
                    more than a few days.  A week, tops.

    As the siblings ad-lib agreement and start playing...


      INT. LAWRENCE'S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

      Lawrence ejects the tape and opens the door labeled "TAPE
      CLOSET."  Behind this door we find...


      INT.  TAPE CLOSET - NIGHT

      ...a massive warehouse, stretching back an almost impossible
      distance -- filled, floor-to-ceiling, with videotapes.  The
      Goodwin Games have only just begun...


      INT. BAR

      BACK ON the Goodwin siblings playing Trivial Pursuit --
      laughing, connecting like they haven't in years -- three
      pieces of a puzzle, finally back together...

                                                                                FADE OUT.
