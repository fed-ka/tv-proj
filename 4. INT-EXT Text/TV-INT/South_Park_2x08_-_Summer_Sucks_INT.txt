               Mr. Garrison stands in front of the students.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay children, I know that today is 
                         the last day of school, and that the 
                         last day of school involves pranks... 
                         But this is GOING TOO FAR!!

               The kids all stare blankly.

               Mr. Garrison is holding is right arm up, but nothing is on 
               it.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Now what have you done with Mr. Hat?!

               The kids don't move.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         CHILDREN! I WANT MR. HAT BACK RIGHT 
                         NOW! THE PRANK IS OVER!!

               The kids don't move.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You think I can't get along without 
                         Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't 
                         live without him?! Well I can! He's 
                         just a puppet! I don't need him! You 
                         see? Watch...

               Mr. Garrison folds his hands on his desk and tries to look 
               normal. But he's obviously shaking.

               The kids just stare on.

               Finally, Garrison breaks.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         GOD DAMMIT WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU 
                         PUT MR. HAT?!?

               The school bell rings.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, no you don't! The school year is 
                         over, but Summer vacation doesn't 
                         start for you little bastards until 
                         Mr. Hat is BACK ON MY DESK! Now I'm 
                         going to turn around, and when I 
                         turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat 
                         lying right here!

               Garrison turns around. He sits with his back to us for several 
               seconds, then:

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay... I'm going to turn around 
                         now.

               Garrison turns back around to see that everybody is gone. 
               Except for Pip.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         SHIT!

                                     PIP
                         Where did everybody go?


               Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny enter the store.

               STU, a big fat guy who breathes heavy and wears a shirt that 
               doesn't fully cover his belly, stands behind the counter.

                                     STU
                         Hi, fellas.

                                     THE BOYS
                         Hi, Stu.

                                     STU
                         What can I do you for?

                                     KYLE
                         We wanna buy m-80's.

                                     STAN
                         The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's 
                         ass.

               Stan, Kyle and Kenny laugh.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay! That does it! Screw you guys! 
                         I'm going home!

               Cartman walks away.

                                     KYLE
                         What a baby.

                                     STAN
                         So, we'll have ten m-80's please.

                                     STU
                         I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?

                                     STAN
                         Heard what?

                                     STU
                         All fireworks have been banned in 
                         Colorado.

                                     KYLE
                         What'dya mean?

                                     STU
                         It was in the paper this morning.

               Stu shows them the paper. On the front page is a picture of 
               a LITTLE BOY who has no hands. Under the picture, the caption 
               reads, "NORTH PARK BOY LOSES HANDS IN FIRECRACKER ACCIDENT."

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, just cuz some stupid North 
                         Park kid blew his hands off, we don't 
                         get to buy m-80's?!

                                     STU
                         Right.

                                     STAN
                         How can they do this to us? Doesn't 
                         anyone believe in tradition anymore?

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, we've been playing with 
                         firecrackers our whole lives.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


               Back to the present.

                                     STAN
                         A summer without firecrackers is 
                         like... I don't know what it's like, 
                         but it sucks ass.

                                     KYLE
                         Yea, now what are we suppose to do?

               Stu pulls out a bunch of lame Fourth of July paraphernalia.

                                     STU
                         I can still sell snakes!

               Stu lights the little black disc, and the short, stupid 
               uneventful ash snake comes out.

                                     BOYS
                         Aww!!


               The mayor is sitting behind her desk, yelling into the phone.

                                     MAYOR
                              (into the phone)
                         This is absurd! We need fireworks 
                         for our Fourth of July celebration 
                         at the lake.
                              (pause)
                         I don't care that some twerp blew 
                         his hands off. We've got to have 
                         fireworks for our picnic -- Hold on 
                         I've got another call...

               She switches over.

                                     MAYOR
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         No I don't know where Mr. Hat is! 
                         Jesus, Garrison I've got bigger 
                         problems!!

               She switches back.

                                     MAYOR
                         Hello? Yes, now what am I supposed 
                         to do about our Fourth of July Show 
                         at the Lake?
                              (pause)
                         No, I don't want snakes! This is an 
                         outrage! Get me the mayor!
                              (beat)
                         I know that, smart ass, I was being 
                         ironic!

               She slams down the phone.

               Suddenly, Barbrady comes out from under the desk.

                                     BARBRADY
                         I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't 
                         find the little man in the boat.

                                     MAYOR
                         Well, keep looking.

               He disappears back under the desk.

                                     MAYOR
                              (to herself)
                         This is ridiculous. We can't have a 
                         celebration without fireworks. Who 
                         ever heard of a Fourth of July picnic 
                         with snakes?

                                     BARBRADY
                              (From under the desk)
                         Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and 
                         they grow and grow...

                                     MAYOR
                         Wait a minute. That's it! I've got 
                         it! This Fourth of July, South Park 
                         will make history by having the 
                         largest snake in the world! The press 
                         will love it. I'll be on the front 
                         page... Oooh.

                                     BARBRADY
                         I found him.


               Jimbo and Ned are in the van heading South.

                                     JIMBO
                         Buckle your seatbelt, Ned.

                                     NED
                         Where are we going?

                                     JIMBO
                         Mexico, my amigo.

                                     NED
                         Why are we going to Mexico?

                                     JIMBO
                         To buy fireworks. Just cuz some kid 
                         blew off his hands, doesn't mean the 
                         rest of us have to suffer, now does 
                         it?

                                     NED
                         Are fireworks legal in Mexico?

                                     JIMBO
                         Hell, everything's legal in Mexico. 
                         It's the American way.


               The Mayor and her aides are listening to a presentation by 
               the DYNO-MIGHT firework company. The Mayor is sitting at her 
               desk with her fingers on her chin, as CHARLIE, the DYNO-MIGHT 
               owner talks with diagrams and a pointer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         At the Dyno-might firework company, 
                         we have a commitment to excellence. 
                         Our focus is on safety while --

                                     MAYOR
                         Just cut to the chase and tell us 
                         about the snake!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, okay...

               Charlie flips through a few of his presentation boards, past 
               the ones that say 'Introduction' and 'Safety Features' and 
               'We Value the Customer', and finally settling on one that is 
               a diagram of the huge disc itself.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now, the disc that we're making is 
                         approximately 5,000 times bigger 
                         than an average snake.

                                     MAYOR
                         Ooh!

                                     CHARLIE
                         We'll have to fly it in with three 
                         Comanche Helicopters, and lower on 
                         to the ground at the lake.

                                     MAYOR
                              (scribbling)
                         Comanche helicopters...

               Now Charlie flips the diagram to another one.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then, we'll need 57 flamethrowers, 
                         all set up around the perimeter of 
                         the disc, that are triggered to all 
                         fire at the same time.

                                     MAYOR
                         Flamethrowers... Triggered at the 
                         same time.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Once lit, the snake will grow...

               He flips to yet another diagram. This one a drawing of the 
               snake emerging happily from the disc.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And good times will be had by all.

               The aide flips to a photo of Abe Vigoda tipping his hat and 
               smiling. The Mayor and her aides applaud.

                                     AIDE #2
                         Wonderful.

                         Well, you see? The fireworks at the 
                         lake will not only go on, but perhaps 
                         be the best ever!
                              (suddenly)
                         Wait a minute! We're gonna need an 
                         orchestra to play the Stars and 
                         Stripes!

                         Hey! How about the elementary school 
                         orchestra! They did a great version 
                         of 'Mary Had A Little Lamb' at their 
                         last concert.

                                     MAYOR
                         Yes! Get the school Principal on the 
                         phone! And we need somebody to dress 
                         up like Uncle Remus!

                         Sam?

                         OF COURSE I DO, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!


               Mr. Garrison is just sitting in his chair, doing nothing. 
               Mr. Hat is still nowhere to be seen.

               Finally, the phone rings. Garrison reaches over and answers 
               it immediately.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         HELLO?!

                                     VOICE
                              (sounds suspiciously 
                              like Mr. Mackey)
                         Hello, is Mr. Hat there?

               Mr. Garrison thinks.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Is this some kind of joke?!

                                     VOICE
                              (laughing)
                         Yes.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         You go to hell! You go to hell and 
                         you DIE!!

               The voice just keeps laughing.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I'm gonna find out who you are!

                                     VOICE
                         I don't think you can, mmkay...

               The line goes dead.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         God Dammit!

               Garrison grabs the remote and turns on the television. He 
               flips through the channels.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               The title reads 'Shari Lewis and Friends!'

               Shari Lewis appears wearing her hand puppet, Lambchop.

                                     SHARI LEWIS
                         So, Lambchomp, what would you like 
                         to do today?

                                     LAMBCHOMP
                         Well, I'd like to sing you a song!

                                     SHARI LEWIS
                         Hey, let's sing one TOGETHER!

               Music begins.

               ANGLE - GARRISON

               He's resting his head on his hand and looking really pissed 
               off.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               Shari and Lambchop sing.

                                     SHARI AND LAMBCHOP
                              (singing)
                         As long as we're together we can do 
                         anything! We can take on the whole 
                         darn world!

               ANGLE - GARRISON

               Just sitting there, pissed.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

                                     SHARI AND LAMBCHOP
                         We're happy as clams! With plenty of 
                         pearls! Through thick and thin, we've 
                         always been to-geth-er!

               ANGLE - GARRISON

               ZOOM IN on Garrison's face -- into his thoughts...

               ANGLE - TELEVISION

               Now, as Shari and Lambchop continue to sing, Garrison appears 
               next to them.

               He grins an evil grin, then pulls out a hatchet.

               He chops off Shari's arm with the hatchet. She screams. He 
               takes lambchomp from the severed hand, and throws it on a 
               nearby grill.

                                     SHARI LEWIS
                         NOO!! LAMBCHOP NOOO!!!

               Lambchop lies dying on the hot grill.

                                     LAMBCHOP
                         Shari... Help me...

                                     LAMBCHOMP
                         It burns!!! It burns!!!!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


               Garrison is back sitting in his chair, with a huge smile on 
               his face, as the stupid singing continues from the television.


               CHET, a newscaster, sits behind a desk.

                                     TOM
                         Fourth of July is finally here, and 
                         with a Statewide ban on fireworks, 
                         people from all over Colorado are 
                         flocking to South Park. Here with a 
                         special report is a normal looking 
                         guy with a funny name.


                                     JIMBO
                         Alright, Ned, now we're coming up to 
                         the American border. They can't know 
                         that we have fireworks in the trunk. 
                         Just let me do the talking.

               Jimbo thinks about what he just said a laughs a little.

                                     JIMBO
                         I guess that goes without saying, 
                         doesn't it...

               Jimbo laughs. Ned doesn't.

               A uniformed American Border Patrol officer holds his hand 
               out Jimbo stops his Hummer.

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Good evening, gentlemen.

                                     JIMBO
                         Hello there, fellow American. We're 
                         just anxious to get back to our 
                         homeland.

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Alright, I just need to ask you a 
                         few questions.

                                     JIMBO
                         Fire away, we have nothing to hide.

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Is anyone other than the two of you 
                         traveling in this vehicle?

                                     JIMBO
                         No sir.

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Do you have any firearms or explosives 
                         in the car.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yes.

               Ned looks at Jimbo, horrified.

                                     JIMBO
                         I mean NO!! NO!!

                                     BORDER PATROL GUY
                         Open your trunk please sir.

               The border patrol guy heads to the back. Jimbo snacks his 
               head repeatedly against the steering wheel.

                                     JIMBO

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         And I can't sleep or think... Where 
                         would he have gone? Why would he 
                         leave?

               Sitting across from Mr. Garrison is DR. KATZburg with his 
               fingers on his chin, and shaking.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Well... let me ask you this. Why... 
                         Where... Where do you think Mr. Hat... 
                         went?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         How the fuck should I know, if I 
                         knew that I wouldn't be seeing a 
                         fucking psychiatrist would I?!

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Well, I... guess I see what you're 
                         saying. Yeah.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         At first I was sure one of the 
                         children took him, but then I 
                         remembered that Mr. Hat and I had 
                         actually had a fight that morning --

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Um, are you gay?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         WHAT?!?!

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         It's... It's just a question.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Are you propositioning me?!

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         No.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well, I can tell you that I am 100 
                         percent NOT gay!

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Well, I believe you. I absolutely 
                         believe you.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Mr. Hat, on the other hand...

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Mr. Hat was gay?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Sometimes he fantasies about same 
                         sex relations.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         I see.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend 
                         he was in a Sauna with Brett Farvre 
                         and a bottle of Thousand Island 
                         dressing.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         That I did not need to know.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well, I'm just sayin'.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat 
                         was actually YOUR gay side trying to 
                         come out... You see it's, it's you 
                         that's gay, but, but you're in denial, 
                         so you act out your gay persona with 
                         a homosexual puppet.

               Mr. Garrison just sits there and thinks.

                                     DR. KATZBURG
                         What do you think about that?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I think YOU'RE the loony one in this 
                         room.

               The giant snake bursts through the glass, killing Katzburg 
               instantly.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Serves you right you gay bashing 
                         homo.


               Jimbo and Ned are sitting on the prison floor looking bored.

                         Yup.

                                     JIMBO
                         Dammit! Those poor kids must have 
                         been so disappointed to have nothing 
                         but them stupid wussy snakes to light.

                                     NED
                         Well, better luck next year.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try 
                         again...

               Ned reads a small index card.

                                     NED
                              (reading)
                         Is anyone other than the two of you 
                         traveling in this vehicle?

                                     JIMBO
                         No.

                                     NED
                              (reading)
                         Do you have any firearms or explosives 
                         in the car?

               Jimbo thinks.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yes?

               Ned shakes his head.

                                     JIMBO
                         DAMMIT I GOT IT WRONG AGAIN?! What's 
                         the answer again?

               But just then, another branch of the giant snake blasts 
               through the cell wall.

                                     JIMBO
                         HOLY SMOKES! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!

                                     NED
                         IT LOOKS LIKE MY X-WIFE!

                                     JIMBO
                         Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The 
                         hummer's outside!!


               We are inside a foggy Sauna. As the fog clears, we see Mr. 
               Hat perched on one of the sauna seats.

               We HEAR a DOOR OPEN, and in walks BRETT FARVRE wearing only 
               a towel and his Packer's Jersey. He takes off the Jersey and 
               sits down next to Mr. Hat.

                                     BRETT FARVRE
                         Hi. I haven't seen you in here before.

               CLOSE UP on Mr. Hat, he glances at Farvre.


               A new reporter, this one more professional and sophisticated 
               stands out front of the blackened Mayor's office.

                                     REPORTER
                         As more and more cities are affected 
                         by the growing ash, and the death 
                         toll rises to three thousand, People 
                         from all over the country are looking 
                         to the Mayor of South Park for 
                         answers.

               People start bustling. The Mayor's aides walk down the steps.

                                     REPORTER
                         And it appears as if the Mayor is 
                         going to explain matters now!

               The Mayor's assistants take their places at a podium.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Uh... Ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor 
                         of South Park regrets that she cannot 
                         be here herself, but she is... sick.

               The reporters are outraged. Everybody SHOUTS AND JEERS.

                                     NEWSGUY
                         SICK?! WHAT KIND OF LAME EXCUSE IS 
                         THAT?!

                                     NEWSGUY #2
                         YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!

                                     NEWSGUY
                         Oh this is ridiculous!

                                     NEWSGUY #2
                         We want answers.

                                     ASSISTANT #2
                         She's having her period.

               Suddenly, everyone gets quiet.

                                     NEWSGUY
                         Oh.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         We do, however, have an official 
                         statement for all the concerned cities 
                         about the matter with the giant snake 
                         that we can't seem to put out.

               The assistant nudges the other assistant, who takes out a 
               piece of paper and reads it.

                                     ASSISTANT #2
                         We're sorry. Our bad.

               He folds the paper back up.

                                     ASSISTANT
                         Thank you, that is all.

               The assistants quickly run back upstairs.

               Again the reporters burst out into shouts and Jeers.
