      A large two story house stands menacingly on a bluffside by
      the water in a torrential downpour.  LIGHTNING flashes,
      THUNDER rolls.  Large drops of rain whipped by heavy winds
      pelt the windows.


      Jennifer races by, an overcoat thrown over her nightgown. 
      She jumps in her car parked in the driveway, starts the engine
      with a ROAR and peels out.


      The car is driven recklessly at high speed through the
      darkness -- the rain and wind blasting.  Puddles in the road
      splash violently as the car tires plow through.


      The car slams to a halt just outside a cemetery.  Jennifer
      races out of the car, hysterical, and bolts through the
      graveyard -- tombstones strobing by as she runs.

                            (whispering; echoey)
                      Jennifer...  Jennifer...

      Jennifer is drenched.  She stumbles through the rain-soaked
      grounds, finally throwing herself down in front of a
      tombstone.  She's crying, breathing coming in labored gasps.

                                      JENNIFER
                    Alec...  What do you want...? What
                    do you want?

      She collapses on the grave site, crying.  TILT UP to reveal
      the tombstone in front of her reads: "ALEC HILL, BELOVED
      HUSBAND."

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


      Bright, blue, nothingness fills the screen.

      TILT down from the cloudless sky to REVEAL two bare-chested
      men framing a house that sits on a high bluff.

      These are Duncan MacLeod and ALEC HILL (35), a strong man
      with short, sandy hair, a moustache and a farmer's tan. 
      They work as they speak.

      Alec smokes a cigar while he works.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I never thought I'd see you west of
                    the Mississippi.

                                    ALEC
                          (shrugs)
                    San Francisco was Genevieve's idea.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why am I not surprised?

                                    ALEC
                    She wanted a fresh start.
                          (beat; a smile)
                    When could I ever deny her anything?

      The moment is interrupted as a buckboard rides up, a woman
      driving.

      This is Alec's mortal wife, GENEVIEVE.  She looks a lot like
      Jennifer -- if it weren't for the 150 years separating their
      birth, they could easily be mistaken for sisters.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Alec)
                    And who could blame you?  You're a
                    lucky man, Alec.

                                    ALEC
                    Took me a hundred and fifty years to
                    find the right woman.  The first
                    time I saw her, I knew we'd be
                    together, whatever it took.
                          (beat)
                    Even moving to the end of the world.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's California, Alec, not Timbuktu.

      Genevieve climbs down from the wagon and indicates a basket
      of food.

                                      GENEVIEVE
                    Anybody hungry?

      Both men swing down from their perches eagerly.  Alec falls
      to one knee and begins to sing as Genevieve takes a cloth
      from the basket and spreads it on the ground.

                                    ALEC
                          (singing)
                    "Aura Lee...  Aura Lee.  Maid of
                    golden hair."

      MacLeod joins in in rough harmony.

                                    ALEC & MACLEOD
                    "Sunshine came along with thee, and
                    swallows in the air."

      Genevieve smiles and applauds.

                                      GENEVIEVE
                    Bravo...  bravo.

      Alec steps inside the frame of the house and bows with a
      flourish.

                                    ALEC
                    Your front parlor, my lady.

                                      GENEVIEVE
                          (teasing)
                    You promised you'd only smoke in the
                    study.

      Alec drops the cigar and stubs it out.  He reaches for
      something from the basket.  She slaps his hand and looks him
      over -- sweaty and covered with sawdust.

                                      GENEVIEVE (CONT'D)
                    Wash.

      She tosses him a bar of soap.

                                      GENEVIEVE (CONT'D)
                    On second thought, scrub.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes, ma'am.

                                    ALEC
                    But I'm starving.

      MacLeod, smiling, grabs a nearby bucket.

                    Come on.  It does no good to deny
                    the lady.

      They move off.


      POV camera lurks in the trees, watching Genevieve.


      Genevieve is stooped over a small fire, warming coffee.

      A small breeze blows tossing her hair about.  A horse
      WHINNIES.  She turns.  Nothing's there.

      She goes back to what she was doing with an uneasy look on
      her face.  She hears a twig crack.

      She spins.  Again nothing there.  She slowly turns back and
      is suddenly startled by a man standing before her.  Only the
      small cooking fire separates them.

      Meet GERARD KRAVEN -- 40, an angular face, tall with a touch
      of arrogance.  Dressed in expensive but well-worn clothes.

                                      GENEVIEVE
                    Oh my God.

      Gerard looks her over.  She steps back away from him.

                                      KRAVEN
                    Hello, Genevieve.  You're looking a
                    little haggard.

      Her eyes shift, looking past him.  No sign of MacLeod or
      Alec.

                                      GENEVIEVE
                          (edgy)
                    What do you want?

                                      KRAVEN
                    Have you lost your manners already?
                          (beat)
                    It would be polite to offer me some
                    coffee.

      His tone is deceptively casual, the threat only implied.

      She leans down to pour it, not taking her eyes off him.  Her
      hand is shaking.  He puts his hand over hers.

      She pulls away from his touch.  The coffeepot spills.

                                      KRAVEN (CONT'D)
                    You used to like it when I touched
                    you.
                          (moving closer)
                    Remember when I found you, Genevieve. 
                    Outside that sweaty little tenement. 
                    You were wasting away.  Your parents
                    couldn't even afford to feed you.

                                      GENEVIEVE
                    I was fine.

                                      KRAVEN
                    You were nothing.

                          (in protest)
                    I was thirteen.

                    Now my portraits of you hang in New

                    You used me.

                                      KRAVEN
                    I made you.  Your speech.  Your walk. 
                    You are who you are because of me.

                    And you ran away.

                    I fell in love.
                          (beat)
                    Alec will be back any moment.

      Genevieve looks again for Alec or MacLeod -- still nothing. 
      She backs carefully toward the wagon -- and eyes the shotgun
      just out of Kraven's sight in the back.

                                      KRAVEN
                    Pity we can't stay.  Our ship sails

      GENEVIEVE

      has reached the wagon.  She grabs for the shotgun.

      KRAVEN

      pounces.  He gets her by the waist, hauls her back before
      she can get the gun.

                                      KRAVEN (CONT'D)
                    Now that's not very friendly.

      He pulls her back against him, hisses in her ear:

                    Did you think California was far
                    enough away, Genevieve?  Did you

                    There's nowhere on earth I won't

      Genevieve opens her mouth to scream, but Kraven puts a bowie
      knife to her throat.

      MacLeod and Alec are moving away from the stream toward camp,

      Suddenly, they both react as they get the BUZZ.  Alec drops
      the water bucket and they both sprint toward --


      Alec and MacLeod burst from the woods and stop, seeing Kraven
      trying to force Genevieve into the wagon.

      She tries to move forward, but Kraven holds her firmly, the
      blade is now back at her throat.

                    Don't be foolish.

      Alec pulls his sword in a fury.

                                    ALEC
                    You son-of-a-bitch.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Alec!  Stop!

                                      KRAVEN
                    Listen to your friend, Alec.

      Kraven takes a step back.  Getting closer to the edge of the
      bluff.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Release her and you walk away alive.

                                    ALEC
                    It's too late for that.

      Alec moves toward Kraven.

                                      KRAVEN
                    Stay where you are!

      Kraven stands at the edge of the bluff, his knife at
      Genevieve's throat.  He takes a quick look over his shoulder. 
        A stalemate.

                                    ALEC
                          (re the cliff)
                    Nowhere to go.

      Kraven pauses, Genevieve quivering in his arms.  Then --

                                      KRAVEN
                    Oh yes there is.

      Suddenly, Kraven leaps backward with her in his arms.  They
      both plunge over the cliff, Genevieve screaming.

      MacLeod and Alec rush to the edge.

                                    ALEC
                    NO!

      He leaps after her.  MacLeod grabs at him as he goes, but is
      a split-second too late.

      MACLEOD S POV - OVER THE EDGE

      The three bodies lie splayed on the rocks below.

      MACLEOD

      races for the nearest path down.


      Alec is coughing back to life as MacLeod races down from the
      bluff.  Genevieve's broken and bloody body lies lifeless on
      the rocks.  Kraven is gone.

      Alec crawls to Genevieve's side and cradles her in his arms.

                                    ALEC
                    No...  No...  not now...  not yet.

      He holds her body, rocking it.  MacLeod slowly steps over to
      him, puts a hand on his shoulder, trying to comfort him.

      Alec looks up at him, shattered.

                                    ALEC (CONT'D)
                    She was my life, Duncan, my life...

      MacLeod looks on, his heart breaking.

                                    ALEC (CONT'D)
                    I'm gonna see that bastard dead even
                    if I have to come back from the grave
                    to do it.
                          (beat)
                    Duncan, swear to me.  Swear if I die
                    before I can kill him, you'll finish
                    it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I swear.

      Alec turns and looks back at his dead wife lying in his arms.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:



      The city by the bay glimmers in the cool night air.

      SUPER:  SAN FRANCISCO


      A studio complex out of town, weeds growing through the
      railroad tracks out back, a couple battered trucks in the
      parking lot.  A light rain covers everything with a reflective
      sheen.

      MacLeod drives up in his rental car toward the studio.  His
      mind is on the business at hand and his friend Alec.

      TWO BURLY GRIPS

      move by MacLeod pushing a fake wall and window of a Victorian
      house.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      The windows of the Victorian.  The light that seeps from its
      windows is dim, flickering.  MacLeod approaches.  He hears a
      haunting version of "Aura Lee."

                                      MACLEOD
                    Alec.

      MacLeod steps on the front porch.  It creaks under his weight. 
      The sound of the chanting stops and is replaced by a more
      familiar voice.

                                    ALEC (O.S.)
                    Go away.

      MacLeod moves closer to the door.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Alec, it's me, Duncan.

      As the droning continues, MacLeod steps through the door and
      enters.


      MacLeod steps out into the night.  The music follows him,
      hauntingly.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      MacLeod gets out of the rental, reaches into the back seat
      and takes out his sword.


      The sound of a harmonica drifts out.  The song is "Aura Lee."


      Richie's bike is parked in a narrow driveway blocking the
      back entrance to the parking lot.

                                      RICHIE (V.O.)
                    It was last summer.  I was on the
                    road.  My bike died outside some old
                    movie studio.

      He repeatedly jumps on the kick start but the engine won't
      turn over -- it's dead.

      The frustration shows on his face.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Piece of crap!

      He jumps off the bike, pissed as hell, and starts fiddling
      with the engine.  As he digs around he slices his finger on
      a sharp piece of metal.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    DAMN IT!

      He yanks his hand out.  Suddenly, a car horn BLARES.

                                      RICHIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I was pissed.  He was pissed.  It
                    happened.

      Richie catches a BUZZ as he turns and sees the car pulling
      into the driveway.  The driver, Alec, leans on the horn again.

      Richie stares him down.  Alec sticks his head out the window.

                                    ALEC
                    Move the bike, kid.

                                      RICHIE
                    Find another way in.

                                    ALEC
                    I said move the bike.  I got an
                      appointment to keep.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yeah, well, life's full of little
                      disappointments, ain't it?

                                    ALEC
                    I'm not gonna tell you again.  Move
                    the damn bike before you get hurt.

      Richie explodes.

                                      RICHIE
                    You wanna move it, come out here and
                    move it yourself!

      Alec jumps out of the car, pumped up for his fight with
      Kraven.

                                    ALEC
                    You shoulda moved the bike.

                                      RICHIE
                    Screw you.

      ALEC

      pulls his sword and swings on Richie.

      RICHIE

      grabs his blade and counters.  (NOTE: Due to the time frame,
      Richie uses his former sword, from before "End of Innocence.")

      ALEC

      gives better than he gets.

      RICHIE

      backs away against the studio wall.

      ALEC

      tries a move.

      RICHIE

      blocks the move and runs Alec through.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    I've seen that one before.

      Alec falls to his knees.

      Richie raises his sword.  As he brings it down --

                                                                      TRANSITION TO:


      MacLeod is getting out of his car when he hears...

      BLAM!

      The last shot.  He races into the building.
