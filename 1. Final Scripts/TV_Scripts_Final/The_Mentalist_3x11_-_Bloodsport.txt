      FADE IN:

      INT. ARENA - NIGHT (N/1)11

      Two Mixed Martial Arts FIGHTERS are going at it in the CAGE.  
      MANNY FLACCO (20 s), an up-and-coming contender, fights with 
      grace and intelligence against ROWDY MERRIMAN (30 s), a 
      brutish journeyman fighter.  At cage-side, we establish SUGE 
      LIMA and LEN ARTASH -- we ll be properly introduced to them 
      later..

      In the crowd, Rigsby sits with a pretty DATE.  She seems 
      reasonably demure at first glance.

                                  DATE
                    Yes!  Hit him again!
                    Again!  Kill him!  Kill the 
                      sonofabitch!

      Rigsby looks a little uncomfortable.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (calm down gesture)
                    Uh...

                                  DATE 
                    Yeah!  Break his face!  

      In the cage, Flacco executes a brutal takedown of Merriman.

22INT. BACKSTAGE. ARENA - NIGHT 

      A food VENDOR pushes her CART along a hallway.  She notices 
      something on the floor and frowns.  She bends down to look 
      closer.

      CU on a RED DROPLET on the linoleum floor.  The Vendor 
      reaches down and touches it -- BLOOD.  She looks up.  There s 
      another one, further down the hallway.  

33INT. ARENA - NIGHT 

      The two Fighters are in their corners.  The hot Date turns 
      back to Rigsby.

                                  DATE
                    So, you must hit a lot of guys uh?

                                  RIGSBY
                    I m a cop.  Comes with the job 
                      sometimes, but it s only ever --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     2.
      CONTINUED:33

                                  DATE
                    -- That s so hot.  I d love to see 
                    you hit someone.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Um, maybe, I mean... 

      The BELL RINGS to start the next round.  The two fighters 
      come out of their corners and exchange exploratory jabs.

44INT. BACKSTAGE. ARENA - NIGHT 

      The blood spots form a trail that leads the Vendor toward a 
      WALL LOCKER.  The Vendor approaches the locker, looks at it 
      curiously.

55INT. ARENA - NIGHT 

      Flacco counters Merriman s attack with a series of lightning-
      fast combinations.  The crowd ROARS.  Rigsby s Date is on her 
      feet, screaming.  Rigsby glances at his watch.

66INT. BACKSTAGE. ARENA - NIGHT 

      The Vendor reaches out and opens the locker...

77INT. ARENA - NIGHT 

      Merriman is driven back into the walls of the cage.  A hard 
      jab sends him reeling, then a roundhouse kick sends him 
      crashing to the canvas.

88INT. BACKSTAGE. ARENA - NIGHT 

      The locker OPENS and a BODY falls to the floor.  The Vendor 
      SCREAMS.   

99INT. ARENA - NIGHT 

      The crowd ROARS as the REF counts Merriman out.  Merriman 
      lies dazed as flashbulbs FLARE.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BACKSTAGE. ARENA - LATER1010

      A FLASH illuminates the murder victim lying sprawled on the 
      floor.  She is a woman in her late 20 s or early 30 s. 

                                  ARTASH (O.S.)
                    Charlotte Mitchell was her name.  

      The front of her shirt is stained with blood from TWO GUNSHOT 
      WOUNDS.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     3.
      CONTINUED:1010

      Rigsby is overseeing the FORENSICS TECHS, while fight 
      promoter LEN ARTASH (50 s, shiny suit) watches in horrified 
        fascination.  

                                  ARTASH (CONT D)
                    ...She was a book writer.  Writing 
                    a book.

      LISBON and CHO flank Artash.

                                  CHO
                    We ve got control of the crime 
                    scene, but it s looking like a wide 
                    suspect list.

                                  LISBON
                    Get a statement from every security 
                    guard, vendor, and attendant.  Find 
                    out who could get backstage.

                                  CHO
                    Right.  It s going to be in the 
                    hundreds, at least.

      Shaking his head in dismay, Cho heads off.  Artash tears his 
      gaze from the body. 

                                  ARTASH
                    Look, just to be clear, 
                    I don t own this arena.  I simply 
                    promoted the fight.  I have no 
                    liability here.

      JANE stands next to Lisbon, gazing intently at Artash. 
      Throughout the whole conversation, he doesn t take his eyes 
      off him.  In fact, Jane is miles away, and Artash just 
      happens to be in his eyeline, but Artash is increasingly 
        discomfited.

                                  LISBON
                    What was Charlotte Mitchell s 
                      connection to you?

                                  ARTASH
                    She was writing a book, about this 
                    fight.  About my guy Manny Flacco 
                    and Rowdy Merriman.  Said it was a 
                    microcosm of whatever.  I figured 
                    any PR for my boy Manny is good PR.  
                    That s the kind of kid he is. 

      Rigsby approaches.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     4.
      CONTINUED: (2)1010

                                  RIGSBY
                    Shot twice.  Close range.  Still got 
                    her purse, money and jewelry intact.  
                    M.E. estimates time of death to be 
                    between 8:30 to 9:00 pm.  

                                  ARTASH
                    That was right in the middle of the 
                    fight.

      Rigsby gets a PHONE CALL, frowns when he sees the number...

                                  RIGSBY
                    Excuse me... 

      He walks away.  Lisbon continues with Artash.

                                  LISBON
                    When was the last time you saw Ms. 
                    Mitchell?

                                  ARTASH
                    We were supposed to sit together 
                    during the fight.  She never showed 
                    up.  Sir, why are you staring at me 
                    like that? 

      Jane shakes his head, comes back from a distant reverie.

                                  JANE
                    Oh, was I staring?  I m so sorry, 
                    my mind was somewhere else 
                    entirely.   

      Lisbon looks askance.  Jane seeks to show he s on the ball -- 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                          (beat, recalls data)
                    Charlotte Mitchell, right?  And 
                    you re Leonard Artash, promoter. 

      Artash looks quizzically to Lisbon.  This is the CBI?

                                  LISBON
                      Consultant.

                                  JANE
                    Let s talk to the fighters, shall 
                    we?

                                  LISBON
                    Really?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     5.
      CONTINUED: (3)1010

                                  JANE
                    Rigsby just told us it wasn t a 
                    robbery and we know it wasn t 
                    sexual.  And it looks cold-blooded, 
                    not a crime of passion.  So what 
                    does that leave?  I ll bet your 
                    pension it s something to do with 
                    the fight. 

                                  ARTASH
                    But Manny and Merriman were in the 
                    cage when she was shot. 

                                  JANE
                    Are you a detective? 

                                  ARTASH
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    Well then...

1111INT. FLACCO S LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 

      Manny Flacco getting dressed in a sharp suit.  SUGE LIMA, his 
      cornerman and manager ties his tie for him, whispering to him 
      as if to a horse.

                                  LIMA
                    ...You the man, kid, you the man,

                    you re gonna be champion of the 
                    world, yes you are, champion of the 
                    world...  

      A PHOTOGRAPHER stands nearby snapping pictures.  Several 
      sportily dressed SECONDS and various HANGERS ON hang about, 
      high-fiving each other and generally celebrating as if they 
      all had won the fight.  Flacco s wife BEATRIZ stands between 
      him and Jane and Lisbon.

                                    BEATRIZ
                    You have to deal with this now? 

                                  LISBON
                    Yes we do, ma am.

                                  FLACCO
                    What s the problem Bea?  Who are 
                    those guys?  

                                    BEATRIZ
                    They re cops.

                    Let the boy enjoy his win.  Talk to 
                    him after we ve checked in with the 
                    doctor.

                    Better safe than sorry, right?

                                    BEATRIZ

      INT. HALLWAY. ARENA - CONTINUOUS1212

      Jane finds Merriman s dressing room, goes to open the door. 
      There s a BIG MAN standing casual sentry, holds up a hand.

      Merriman is dressed in sweats and sunglasses, pacing up and 
      down, punching lockers and walls, very angry.  Everybody 
      turns to look at Jane.  The room is decidedly hostile to 
      outsiders.

      INT. HALLWAY. ARENA - CONTINUOUS1414

      Lisbon is moving toward Merriman s dressing room, when the 
      door flies open and Jane hurries out, shutting the door 
      firmly behind him.

      Jane hastens down the hallway.  Merriman and several of his 
      Hangers On come busting out of the dressing room to have it 
      out with Jane.  They follow him down the hallway.

      LaRoche nods to himself thoughtfully, makes some more 
      notations, then looks up with an off-putting smile.

                    Thanks, Agent Rigsby.  That should 
                    do it.

      Rigsby gets up and leaves.  

                                  LISBON
                    So you ll let me know next time you

      With that he shambles out, leaving Lisbon vexed.

1717EXT. INNER CITY COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY 

      Van Pelt and Rigsby approach a rundown building.  A SIGN says 
      it s the CARELLA GARDENS COMMUNITY CENTER.  From inside comes 
      the SOUND of SINGING.

1818INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY 

      JOE REYES (30 s-40 s) is leading a small CONGREGATION in a 
      hymn.  Van Pelt and Rigsby enter.

                    We have newcomers, brothers and

      Rigsby and Van Pelt get up to go.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Why d you kill that man back in 
                    2001?  If you don t mind my asking.

      Van Pelt and Rigsby walk back toward their car.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Seems clean, but we should keep an 
                    eye on him, don t you think?

      Rigsby doesn t say anything, lost in his thoughts.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    You okay?

                                  VAN PELT
                    You re being quiet.  Like

      He gets in the car.  Van Pelt looks at him, sensing

2222INT. CHARLOTTE MITCHELL S HOUSE - DAY 

      The living room matches the outside; quaint, old-fashioned, 
      everything just so.  TOM MITCHELL (60 s) -- an old-time 
        newspaperman who looks like he has a fedora perched on the 
      back of his head even when he doesn t -- sits on a couch with 
      LOIS (50 s), a lady friend.  On the television is a VIDEO of 
      Charlotte Mitchell a few years ago, fresh out of college. 

                                  TOM MITCHELL
                          (stopping the video)
                    She was a good girl.  A fine human 
                    being.  

      Trying to mask his sorrow, he turns a sob into a cough, and 
      Lois takes his hand.  Lisbon and Jane sit nearby.

                                  LISBON
                    We re sorry for your loss, Mr.

                    Would you mind if I looked around a 
                    bit?

      Tom Mitchell nods vaguely, gets up.

2323INT. OFFICE. CHARLOTTE MITCHELL S HOUSE - DAY 

      A small, neat room.  A desk under the window, bookshelves and 
      filing cabinets along the walls.

                    living room. 

      Mitchell nods mutely, mopping at his eyes.  Lois leads him 
      out.  Lisbon picks up the most recent notebooks.  Jane starts 
      looking around.

                    I won t be a minute.  

      Lisbon nods, follows Tom Mitchell and Lois.  Jane is alone in 
      a room full of books, PHOTOGRAPHS, awards, and FRAMED 
      COLUMNS: from this he can learn the story of Charlotte 
      Mitchell s life.

      grief.

                    Merriman took a fall?  Can t see 
                    it.  Worth killing over though.  
                    Lot of money to be made on a sure

                    I think we should talk to the 
                    promoter, Artash.  See what he has 
                    to say about fight fixing.

2828INT. BENTON S GYM  - DAY 

      Two YOUNG FIGHTERS are sparring in the ring under the 
      watchful eye of FLOYD BENTON, (50 s) an ex-boxer who owns the 
      gym.  Artash is nearby, on the phone.

      Lisbon and Jane enter.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Artash.  

      He holds up a finger -- wait...

                                  ARTASH
                          (to phone)
                      Sixty-forty split.  With an option 
                    for his next three fights.  

      He listens for a moment.

                                  ARTASH (CONT'D)
                    Hey, alternatively, go eat a 
                    shoelace.  I want the deal done by 
                    Friday.  Call me back.  

      Artash stashes his phone, smiles broadly at Jane and Lisbon.

                                  ARTASH (CONT D)
                    We got it.  Manny s fighting for 
                    the title, six months time.  Two 
                    million dollar purse.  Can I pick 
                     em or what?

      He points to the ring.

                                  ARTASH (CONT D)
                    See the tall kid?  He s going to be 
                    my next champion.  Mark my words.

      Jane hears that, heads towards the ring.

      EXT. BENTON S GYM - DAY2929

      A rundown building in a rundown neighborhood.  Artash steps 
      out into the parking lot with Lisbon.

                                  LISBON
                    Fight fixing: what can you tell me?

                                  ARTASH
                    Doesn t happen.  Like I told 
                    Charlotte -- it s not financially 
                    viable in this day and age.
                    She d been reading about past fixes 
                    in boxing, wanted to know if it 
                    exists in MMA.  It doesn t.

                                  LISBON
                    How come?  

                                  ARTASH
                    The Board finds out about a fixed 
                    fight, everybody involved is done, 
                    forever.  So first, there s that.  
                    Second, you need a fighter willing 
                    to take a dive.  

                                  LISBON
                    You re saying Merriman wouldn t do 
                    it?

                                  ARTASH
                    You met him, right?  Egomaniac.  
                    He d never agree to such a thing.  

                                  LISBON
                    How d he get along with Charlotte 
                    Mitchell?

                                  ARTASH
                    He resented her a little, I think.  
                    He wanted her to portray him as a 
                    good guy and she wasn t buying it. 

                                  LISBON
                    He s not a good guy?

                                  ARTASH
                    Flacco s the good guy, Rowdy s the 
                    villain.  That s how we sold the 
                    fight, because that s who they are. 
                    Manny s a sweetheart, Rowdy s a 
                    natural jerk.

                                  ARTASH
                    I don t know, the way he acted

                                  ARTASH
                    Coarse, lascivious, like it would 
                    be a bad idea to let him get her 
                    alone. 

      INT. BENTON S GYM - DAY3030

      Jane is watching the two fighters.  Artash s PROSPECT is 
      quick and wary, darting in with quick jabs and then dancing 
      back.

      Beside Jane, FLOYD BENTON, the gym s owner, yells advice at 
      the Prospect s heavier OPPONENT.

                                  BENTON
                    Stick the jab, then shoot!  Stick 
                    and shoot!

                                  JANE
                    Your fighter looks bigger and 
                    stronger.  Shouldn t he be winning?

                          (disgusted)
                    He s slower and dumber. 
                    Keep walking, bub.  I need advice,

                                  JANE
                    So, what aspect of the fight would

                    Artash s prospect there has a tell.  
                    Taps his forehead before he throws 
                    the right upper cut.  When he does 
                    that, your man should step to his 
                    right and throw a hook.

      Benton looks at Jane with new respect.

      He hangs up, heads back to where Cho and Dawn are talking.

                                  DAWN KERR
                    I got two kids I m trying to raise 
                    right, who don t know what kind of 
                    life I used to lead --

                    Thank you, ma am.  We ll be in

                          (to Cho)
                    Let s go.  Gotta get back.

      They head back to the car.

                                  CHO
                    Says she was at parent-teacher 
                      conference night before last.  
                    Should be easy to check.

      He looks over at Rigsby, who looks preoccuppied.  

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    Anything wrong?  Who called?

      Rigsby looks at him, about to say something.  Then --

                                  RIGSBY
                    Nothing.  Nobody.

      He gets in the car.

      INT. INTERVIEW ROOM. CBI HQ - DAY3333

      Rigsby sits across from LaRoche.

                                    LAROCHE
                    Sorry to bother you again, Agent 
                    Rigsby, just a few things that 
                    don t seem to match.  

      He looks at his notes.

                                    LAROCHE (CONT D)
                    You said there d been no contact, 
                    but phone records show six phone 
                    calls from your father between June 
                    and July of 2008.

                    What does this have to do with 
                    somebody burning a cop killer to 
                    death here in CBI?

                                    LAROCHE
                    It doesn t, directly.  But it 
                    speaks to character.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    You re questioning my character?

                                    LAROCHE
                    Did you know there are 
                      criminological studies that posit 
                      criminality as a heritable trait?  
                    Like eye color, or a baritone 
                    voice.

                                  RIGSBY
                    What?

                                    LAROCHE
                    I just mean it s not necessarily 
                    your fault, Agent Rigsby.  You may 
                    simply be predisposed to criminal 
                    behavior.  Scientifically speaking.

                                  RIGSBY
                    My father called me about a mix-up 
                    with his parole officer.  Was I 
                    supposed to ignore him?  Hang up?

                                    LAROCHE
                    You forgot that conversation?  Or 
                    chose not to speak of it?

      Rigsby stands up.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Are we done?  I think we re done.

      He leaves.  LaRoche watches him go.

      INT. HALLWAY/BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY3434

      Rigsby walks right past Van Pelt without acknowledging her as 
      she greets him.  Van Pelt, takes a beat and walks on to -- 

3535INT. LISBON S OFFICE - DAY 

      Van Pelt puts her head in the room.  Lisbon s at her desk.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I got something.  A security guard 
                    had a run-in with Charlotte 
                    Mitchell before the fight.

                                  LISBON
                    How come we didn t hear about this 
                    before now?

                                  VAN PELT
                    He left the arena before the fight 
                    ended.  He was filling in for a guy 
                    and his wife went into labor.  He 
                    didn t connect it to the murder 
                    until he saw Charlotte Mitchell s 
                    picture on the television. 

                                  LISBON
                    So what d he see?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Charlotte Mitchell was trying to 
                    get in to the dressing room area  
                    before the fight.  Because she 
                    didn t have the right kind of 
                    access laminate, the guard wouldn t 
                    let her in.  She was agitated, made 
                    a scene, and he threw her out.  
                    This was at approximately six-
                    thirty. 

                                  LISBON
                      Six-thirty?  That puts her in the 
                    arena an hour before the M.E. s 
                    estimate.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Yup.  And that means Flacco and 
                    Merriman both had opportunity.  
                    They re suspects, too.

                                  LISBON
                    Bring them both in.  Let s see what 
                    they have to say under questioning.

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - NIGHT (N/2)3636

      Merriman strolls arrogantly through CBI, followed by a 
        thuggish-looking POSSE.  Cho meets him. 

                                  CHO
                    Mr. Merriman, your associates are 
                    going to have to wait outside.

                                  CHO
                    They re cool outside.

      Merriman stops, his eyes narrow.  Across the room, Flacco 
      stands talking with Lisbon.  His manager Lima and his wife 
      Beatriz are with him.

                                  MERRIMAN
                    Flacco, you little punk.  You used 
                    plastered wraps, didn t you?  A 
                    punk like you can t hit like that, 
                    I know.    

      Flacco is calm and unaffected by Merriman.  

                                  FLACCO
                    Hey, good to see you, Rowdy.  Nice 
                    fight

      Merriman starts across the room toward Flacco.

                                  CHO
                    Mr. Merriman, come back.

      He starts after Merriman.

                                  MERRIMAN
                    You want to go again, Manny?  I ll 
                    knock you out right here.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. and Mrs. Flacco, why don t we 
                    go into my office?

                                  FLACCO
                    Sure.  Come on, Bea.

                                  MERRIMAN
                    Running away, Manny?  Just like you 
                    did in the cage, huh?

      Flacco turns to Merriman with a smile.

                                  FLACCO
                    Two million people saw me kick your 
                    butt.  Live with it. 

      That s too much for Merriman, who goes for Flacco.  Lima 
      jumps on Merriman before he can get to Flacco, and then 
      Merriman s posse goes for Lima.  Beatriz screams angrily, 
      starts swinging her purse. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     30.

      Merriman sits sullenly across from Cho.  He looks like he got 
      the worst of it in the brawl.

                                  MERRIMAN

                    Tssst.  If I slap a bitch, she 
                    asked for it.  Bitches like to get

                    No she didn t.  I asked her for it 
                    though.  You know?  But she was

      Lisbon is sitting across from Flacco and Beatriz.  Van Pelt

      nods, turns to address Flacco and Beatriz.

                    Mr. Flacco, do you want your wife 
                    present during our interview?  
                    Normally we do this alone.

                    She s doing fine.  The Glock?

                                  LOPEZ
                    I lost it.

      Cho and Rigsby sigh.  Nothing is ever easy.

                                  CHO 
                    You lost it?

      Lopez nods affirmatively, unaware of Cho and Rigsby s 
      skepticism.

                    About four years ago.  In a club.  
                    That place Narcissus -- you know 
                    it?  There was a scuffle.  I had to 
                    run out of there after some punk, 
                    and next time I look, the nine was 
                    gone.  It was a sweet gun, but what 
                    can you do? 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Uh-huh.  Where were you two nights 
                    ago?

      Now Lopez notices Rigsby s skepticism, seems even more 
      amused.  

                                  LOPEZ
                    I was here.  Any of these guys can 
                    tell you.  Don t believe me, lie 
                    detect me.  I ain t worried.

      Lopez goes back to his game.  Rigsby follows Cho, who s 
      reading a text message off his phone.

                                  RIGSBY 
                    What d you get?

                                  CHO
                    That guy LaRoche.  He wants to talk 
                    to me.  Wants me to come in.  

      Rigsby reacts with alarm.  Cho doesn t notice.  Glances at 
      Rigsby.  

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    What d he talk to you about?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Okay, the thing is, I have to tell 
                    you something.  I should ve before, 
                    but I didn t.  Here goes.

      He glances at Cho, takes a deep breath.

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    Two years ago my dad called me.  He 
                    was getting hit with a parole 
                      violation.  Seen consorting with 
                    known criminals.  Looking at a full 
                    twenty year bit in Folsom.  

      Cho shakes his head.

                                  CHO
                    So you alibied him out. 

                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     40.

                    Yeah, I said he was with me at the  
                    time.  But I m family, so the 
                    Parole Officer asked if there was 
                    anybody else there -- you know, to 
                    verify it.  And I said you.

                                  CHO
                    What?

                                  RIGSBY
                    It just came out of my mouth.  I 
                    swear to God, if I could ve taken 
                    it back I would ve.  But they never 
                    checked back with you and so 
                      everything seemed fine and I just 
                    kind of forgot about it.  Until 
                    LaRoche started in on me.

      Cho is stony cold.

                                  CHO
                    You involved me in your perjury and

                    If LaRoche finds out I lied over 
                    this, my career s over.

                                  CHO
                    Yes it is.  Unless I lie as well.

      Cho gets in the car and drives away.  Rigsby watches him go.  

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - NIGHT (N/3)4343

      Jane sits on the couch, watching TELEVISION.  ARTASH is ON 
      SCREEN MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT.  

      Behind Jane, Rigsby sits at his desk, solemn and quiet.  Cho 
      is nowhere to be seen.

                                  ARTASH (V.O.)

      Jane DOODLES idly in Charlotte Mitchell s NOTEBOOK as he 
      watches.

                    Did you find anything in Mitchell s

      Jane puts down the pen and points at the television.

                    Not a thing.  Manny Flacco s

4444INT. BENTON S GYM - NIGHT 

      Flacco is working out in the ring with a SPARRING PARTNER 
      while Lima watches.

                    Sweep the leg!  Come on, 
                      transition!

      Artash stands off to the side, talking with a grizzled-
      looking old SPORTS REPORTER.  

                                  SPORTS REPORTER
                    You think Flacco s ready for this

                                  ARTASH
                    He was born ready.  The question is 
                    whether the Champ is ready for what 
                    Flacco s going to bring.

                                  JANE
                    Hey Artash, I ve got some questions 
                    for you.

      Jane walks toward Artash, Lisbon following behind.

                    You were born here in America?

      Artash nods.

                                  ARTASH
                    That s right.

                                  JANE
                    But your parents were born in

                    It s not.  It s what she called

                    Just one more question.

      Jane suddenly pulls the notebook from his pocket.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You recognize this?

      He opens the notebook to the back, revealing pages written in 
      some kind of code.   Artash stares at it.  Lisbon arriving, 
      stares at it as well.

                                  ARTASH
                    No.  What is it?

                                  JANE
                    I found it in the back of Charlotte 
                      Mitchell s notebook.  I don t know 
                    what it is.  Code, most likely.

      The old REPORTER glances at it over Artash s shoulder.

                                  SPORTS REPORTER
                    That s shorthand.  I had to learn 
                    it back when I was a cub reporter.  

                                  LISBON

                    But people developed their own

                                  JANE
                    Charlotte Mitchell learned 
                    shorthand from her father.  He was 
                    an old-time newspaperman.

                                  SPORTS REPORTER
                    Nobody uses shorthand anymore.  
                    We ve got these.

      He holds up a digital recorder.

                    She wasn t using it in place of a 
                    recorder.  She was using it to hide 
                    something she d learned.  

      He looks over at Lisbon.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    The doctors said that Tom Mitchell 
                    had taken a turn for the better.  
                    They expect him to be conscious in 
                    twelve to twenty-four hours, don t

      Lisbon nods.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    So there we are.  I ll bet Tom 
                    Mitchell can read this.  And then 
                    we ll know what it was Charlotte 
                    Mitchell learned that got her 
                    killed.

      Jane turns and walks away.  Lisbon goes with him.  Artash and 
      the Reporter watch them go.

                                  LISBON
                    I went through that whole book.  
                    There was no shorthand in it.

                                  JANE
                    Really?  How strange.  I wonder

      FADE IN:

      INT. INTERVIEW ROOM. CBI HQ - DAY (D/4)44A44A

      LaRoche opens the door of the interview room and directs Cho 
      inside.

                                    LAROCHE
                    You served in the military, didn t 
                    you, Agent Cho?

                                  CHO
                    Yes.

                                    LAROCHE
                    Rangers, was it?

                                  CHO
                    Special Forces.  

                                    LAROCHE
                    Hmm. 

      He takes a beat, makes a note...

                                    LAROCHE (CONT D)
                    So you understand the idea of 
                    honor.

      That doesn t sit well with Cho.  He looks stoney.  He pushes 
      a file across the table to Cho.

                                    LAROCHE (CONT D)
                    That s an affidavit Wayne Rigsby 
                    signed, saying you and he spent an 
                    afternoon with Agent Rigsby s 
                    criminal father.  You remember that 
                    day, Agent Cho?

      Cho stares down at the file, not saying a word.

                                    LAROCHE (CONT D)
                    Agent Rigsby initially claimed to 
                    have no contact with his father, 
                    then became evasive when confronted 
                    with his falsehood.

      LaRoche folds himself into a chair, eyes never leaving Cho.

                                    LAROCHE (CONT D)
                    Looking into it, I discovered that 
                    Wayne provided an alibi that kept 
                    his father out of jail.  
                                  (MORE)
                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     46.

                                  LAROCHE (CONT D)
                    And you were part of that alibi.  
                    So I just need you to confirm -- on 
                    your honor -- that you were indeed 
                    there that day.

      Cho shuts the file and slides it back across to LaRoche.

                                  CHO
                    Yes I was.  I was there with Rigsby 
                    and his father. 

                                    LAROCHE
                    Okay.  Good.  What did you do that 
                      afternoon?  The three of you.  Give 
                    me some details.

                                  CHO
                    I don t recall.  

                                    LAROCHE
                    Nothing at all?  Strange.

                                  CHO
                    I was there.  I ll swear to it.  Do 
                    I need to sign something to make it 
                    official?

      LaRoche eyes Cho measuringly.

                                    LAROCHE
                    No.  That won t be necessary. 
                    That ll be all.  Thanks, Agent.

      Cho leaves.

44B44BINT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY 

      Cho walks into the bullpen, stops at Rigsby s desk.

                                  CHO
                    I told him I was there.

      Rigsby stares up at Cho with disbelief and gratitude.  Before 
      he can say anything, Lisbon enters.

                                  LISBON
                    Alright, let s go.  We ve got to 
                    get to the hospital.  Jane and Van 
                    Pelt are already there.

      She looks from Cho to Rigsby, sensing something unspoken 
      going on.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    You two okay?

        CONTINUED:44B44B

      Cho nods, not wanting to go into anything.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Okay.  Come on.  I ll explain on 
                    the way.

4545INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

      Behind a curtain a shadowy figure lies in a hospital bed.  
      OVER we HEAR the creepy, mechanized SOUND of a RESPIRATOR.  
      The door to the room opens, and Cho sticks his head in, 
      glances around.  He speaks into his radio mike.

                                  CHO
                          (into radio)

      He shuts the door.

      INT. WAITING AREA. HOSPITAL - DAY4747

      Rigsby sits reading a magazine.  He looks around, speaks into 
      his radio mike.

                                  RIGSBY
                    All clear here.

4848INT. ELEVATORS. HOSPITAL - DAY 

      Van Pelt stands near the elevators, watching as the doors 
      open and people walk off. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Wait a minute.

      For a moment, we catch a glimpse of Joe Reyes, walking 
      purposefully.  Then he turns a corner and is gone.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    I think I saw Reyes.  He s heading 
                    your way.

4949INT. WAITING AREA. HOSPITAL - DAY 

      Rigsby sits up as Reyes walks past him.

                    I see him.  Cho, cut him off.

      Rigsby gets up and falls in behind Reyes.

5050INT. HALLWAY. HOSPITAL - DAY 

      Cho hurries down the corridor and turns the corner.  Up ahead 
      of him, Reyes stops.  Rigsby approaches from behind Reyes.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Mr. Reyes.  What are doing here?

      Reyes turns around in surprise.  Cho moves in toward him.

                                  REYES
                    I was just coming to pay my 
                    respects.

      Cho and Rigsby grab Reyes, and start hustling him back the 
      way he came.  

                                  REYES (CONT D)
                    I swear, I didn t mean anything...

      The CAMERA watches them go, then creeps back around the 
      corner, finds a WHITE-COATED FIGURE opening the door to Tom 
      Mitchell s room and slipping inside.

5151INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

      The white-coated figure shuts the door and turns to reveal 
      that it is Suge Lima.  He picks a pillow up from off a bed as 
      he heads toward the shrouded figure and the mechanized 
      breathing of the respirator.  He takes a tighter grip on the 
      pillow, pulls aside the curtain...

      ...And stares in shock at the creepy-looking  Rescue Annie  
      CPR training doll hooked up to the respirator, rubberized 
      chest going up and down.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Lima, put your hands up where I 
                    can see them.

      Lima turns to find Lisbon -- gun drawn -- and Jane in the 
      doorway. 

                                  JANE
                    Mr. Mitchell got out of the

                    notebook?

      Jane shakes his head.

                                  JANE
                    No.  I wrote the shorthand code 
                    myself.  If Charlotte Mitchell was 
                    murdered because she discovered a 
                    secret, I knew I just had to 
                    convince the killer that the secret 
                    didn t die with her.  Eh voila.

      Lisbon pats down Lima, finding a 9 MM GLOCK HANDGUN tucked 
      into the waistband of his pants. 

                                  LIMA
                    But it wasn t me!

                    Save it.  This is the gun that shot

                                  CHARLOTTE MITCHELL
                    I know that blood was Manny s, not 
                    yours, Lima.  If Manny gets in the 
                    cage, he could die.

      INTERCUT WITH:        THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     52.


      INT. BENTON S GYM - DAY (D/1)5555

      Lima is on the phone.  Behind him, Flacco jumps rope.

                                  LIMA
                    What the hell you talking about, 
                    lady?  And how d you get your hands 
                    on those tests?

                                  CHARLOTTE MITCHELL
                    Stop the fight, Lima.  Or else.

                                  LIMA
                    Alright, alright.  I ll stop the 
                    fight.  Don t you worry.

      He hangs up the phone, redials.  

                                  LIMA (CONT D)
                    Len?  We got a problem.

      INT. LISBON S OFFICE. CBI HQ - DAY5656

      Flacco stares at Lisbon numbly.

                                  FLACCO
                    Suge and Artash wanted to keep me 
                    from finding out I m sick.

                                    BEATRIZ
                    Those sons-of-bitches!  They risked 
                    your life!

                                  LISBON
                    They couldn t let anybody know.  No 
                    MMA authority would let you in the 
                    cage if it got out.

                                  FLACCO
                    So they killed Charlotte because of 
                    me. 

                                  LISBON
                    Half of two million dollars makes 
                    people do crazy things.

      FLASHBACK

      INT. BACKSTAGE. ARENA - NIGHT (N/1)5757

      Suge Lima is grasping Charlotte Mitchell s arm in the empty 
      backstage hallway.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     53.

                                  LIMA
                    It s one doctor s opinion.  He 
                    looks fine to me.

                                  CHARLOTTE MITCHELL
                    Do you really think you can get 
                    away with this?  I m going to tell 
                    everyone.  You ll never get away 
                    with it.

      She tries to get away from Lima.

                                  CHARLOTTE MITCHELL (CONT D)
                    Let go of me!

      They struggle.  There is a muffled BANG.  Then ANOTHER.  
      Charlotte Mitchell looks down in surprise at the gun in 
      Lima s hand.

5858INT. ELEVATORS. CBI HQ - DAY 

      Beatriz and Flacco walk with Jane toward the elevators.  

                                    BEATRIZ
                    Poor woman.

                                  FLACCO
                    I m never going to fight again, am 
                    I?  So what am I going to do?  

                                  JANE
                    Give up, I expect.  Too bad you ve 
                    got those kids.  Otherwise you 
                    could always --

      Jane mimes hanging himself.  Beatriz gasps in horror at the 
      thought.  Flacco puts an arm around her protectively.

                                  FLACCO
                          (outraged)
                    What the hell s the matter with 
                    you?  

                                  JANE
                    What?  You asked.

                                    BEATRIZ
                    Shut up.

      She turns to Flacco.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST     "Bloodsport"     PROD. 10/29/10     54.

                    You got skills, baby.  There s lots 
                    you can do, lots you got to offer.

      The elevator arrives, and she pushes Flacco in, turns back to 
      Jane.

                                    BEATRIZ (CONT D)
                    You re just bitter because you re 
                    alone.

      She wraps her arms around her husband.

                                  JANE
                    That s true. 

      The elevator doors shut.  Jane heads back into the office.

5959INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY 

      Coming out of the kitchen, Lisbon falls in step with Jane, 
      mug of coffee in hand.

                                  LISBON
                    You do have to feel for Flacco.  
                    He s lost his livelihood.

                                  JANE
                    Meh.  Lost a life of getting hit in 
                    the head, but got his marriage back.  
                    Seems like a good trade to me.

                                  LISBON
                    Aren t you the romantic.

                                  JANE
                    Makes the world go round.

      He sits down on his couch.  Lisbon goes.  Rigsby glances up 
      at Cho, who has his head down, working.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Hey.  Cho.
                          (Cho looks up)
                    Thank you.

      Cho holds his gaze a beat, looks down.  Not a word.  Rigsby 
      goes back to his work.  Jane watches them, curious.  And we --

                                                                          FADE OUT.
