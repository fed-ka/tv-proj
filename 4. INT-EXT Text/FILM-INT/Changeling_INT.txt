A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE
COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to
shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves
OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.
She throws water on her face as the music continues. She
looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead.
She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day.
The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she
smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.
Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS
is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see
much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's
important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the
following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect.
CHRISTINE
Walter...time for school, honey.
She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair.
WALTER
Just ten more minutes --

Sorry, champ.

You can sleep in all you want

WALTER
It's cereal, it's supposed to be
cold.
She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits
on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again.
Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in
her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to
an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that
only a few other kids have arrived.
CHRISTINE
We're here, sweetie.
Come on.
She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward
the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the
school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as
Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there.
She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it
rumbles away.
Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room
is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy
wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening
and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.
Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created
by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator
to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns
at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane
toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.
CHRISTINE
Okay Sandy, what's the prob--
The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off.

She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end
as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches.
MR. HARRIS

CHRISTINE
Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just

Tell them to take the plug and shove

She hangs up. She doesn't like this, but there's no way out
of it. She straightens and heads out of the room.
A disappointed Walter sits on the couch as Christine puts
things together quickly.

There's a sandwich and milk in the
icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley

it can to reunite mother and child,

But given its position as the most
violent, corrupt and incompetent
police department this side of the
Rocky Mountains, that's not saying
a great deal.
There's APPLAUSE and cheering from the pews.
He lets it pass.
REV. BRIEGLEB
Every day, new bodies show up along
Mulholland, or in ditches, the work
of Police Chief James Davis and his
so-called "gun squad." Every day
the needs of honest citizens are
put second to greed and personal
gain. Every day, the city sinks
deeper into a cesspool of fear,
intimidation and corruption. Once

now a place where our protectors
have become our brutalizers...where
to be the law...is to be above the

But we will not be silent. We will
continue to put their offenses and
their failures in full view of the

The place erupts into applause and cheering.
POLICE CHIEF JAMES E. DAVIS, 40s, hard-edged and tall, stands
looking out the window as the radio drones on behind him.
REV. BRIEGLEB (on radio)
Because while the "gun squad" speaks

Christine walks past the door to his bedroom. Looks inside.
Goes over to the bed. Her hand lingers, touching it, UNDER:

Christine and Mr. Harris, the floor manager, approach the
doors to the switchboard room.

The police are doing all they can,

It's been almost a month, and...it
wouldn't do any good to find Walter
and bring him home if he doesn't
have a home to come back to, right?

Of course.
He smiles as he says it, but there's the sense that he doesn't
think Walter's coming back. It's been too long. She senses
it, but moves past it, pushing open the door and entering

Several women approach and hug her as the noise level begins
to climb, but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier.
MR. HARRIS
Well...I'll leave you to it, then.
She nods as he exits, then heads off herself.
Christine moves from station to station, the noise level still
noticeably low. Every time she approaches an operator, they
lower their voices, as if not to bother her.
One operator holds up a pink request sheet. Christine starts
toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor
and hands it off. Knowing she has to do something about this,
she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says:
CHRISTINE
Excuse me, can I have your attention?
The room grows quiet.
Everyone is looking at her.
CHRISTINE
Listen, everyone, I appreciate your
consideration, but I'm not made of
porcelain. I won't break down and
cry if the station to station call
to Kankakee doesn't go through.

Actually, I...promised myself that
I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself

another, what....

Point is...I like the noise here.

He approaches the door, slowing as he HEARS Christine inside.

would you let me know? Thanks, I
appreciate it. Goodbye.

He glances in the open doorway.
Christine sits at a table, phone in hand, a list of phone
numbers in front of her. The list reads LAS VEGAS MISSING
PERSONS DEPARTMENT, SACRAMENTO MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT,
SAN FRANCISCO MISSING PERSONS DEPARTMENT...on and on...with
each having multiple checks beside it, indicating all the
times she's called. Her lunch sits untouched beside her.

glancing over papers, then looks over at --

She slows, unable to look away, a growing dread settling in

gets out of the way, revealing the boy.
Christine stops. Staggers so hard she almost falls. She

He smiles at her.

with soot from the train ride.
He turns, and heads up the stairs.
She follows.
Carrying a pair of pajamas, Christine comes into the hall and
stops in front of the bathroom door. Knocks.
CHRISTINE
I found you a pair of pajamas. I
bought them for Walter but he didn't

Ow!
She hears him fall and pushes the door open.
She helps "Walter" stand, discreetly turned away from us.
CHRISTINE
Are you all right?
"WALTER"
I fell.
Stupid tub.
CHRISTINE
Did you hurt yourself?
Let me see --
She stops suddenly, reacting to something we don't see.
Looks slowly looks up to his face.
CHRISTINE
...circumcised....
She takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom.
She places him against the wall where she measured Walter's
growth over the years. The marks put him four inches shorter
than the one labeled March. She looks at him, very serious.

The last time I measured Walter --
the last time I measured my son --
he was four inches taller than you
are right now.

CHRISTINE
I don't know who he is, or why he's
saying he's Walter, but there's
clearly been some kind of mistake.
JONES
We agreed you would give him time
to adjust --
CHRISTINE
He's four inches shorter than Walter.
Boys his age don't shrink. If
anything, he should be taller.
JONES
Maybe your measurements are off.
Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for --
CHRISTINE
He's circumcised. Walter wasn't.
Jones glances back, uncomfortable about discussing circumcision
with a woman in public view. He lowers his voice.
JONES
Mrs. Collins...your son was missing
for four months. For at least part
of that in the company of an as-yet
unidentified drifter. Who knows
what such a disturbed individual
might have done? He could have had
him...circumcised... might have --

Made him smaller? Captain, please --
He's on the move again, stepping into --

-- why won't you listen to me?
JONES
I am listening, damn it, I --

Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce
back as my son if you coated him in

He sits, shaking his head.
JONES
Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins?
You seem perfectly capable of taking
care of the boy, your work pays you
enough to attend to his personal
needs...so I don't understand why
you're trying to run away from your
responsibilities --
CHRISTINE
I'm not running away from anything,
least of all my responsibilities.
I'm even taking care of that boy
because right now I'm all he has.
What worries me is that you've
stopped looking for Walter.
JONES
Why should we look someone we've
already found?
CHRISTINE
But you haven't found him. He's
still out there somewhere, lost,
maybe hurt....
JONES
His identity has been confirmed by
the best minds in the field of child
identification, people who know
what they're doing.
CHRISTINE
And I don't? Captain, look, I don't
want to cause trouble for you or

I know you've done everything you
can...but there's been a terrible
mistake, and I need your help if

Christine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings. She
opens the door to find a police officer and DR. EARL W. TARR,
sixties, mildly eccentric in appearance.
DR. TARR
Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr.
Captain Jones sent me. I consult
with him from time to time on
juvenile cases. May I come in?
CHRISTINE
Oh...yes, of course.
She steps aside, and Dr. Tarr enters, looking around.
CHRISTINE
Thank you for coming. I'm surprised
Captain Jones moved so quickly. I
was starting to think he didn't
believe me.
DR. TARR
Well, I'm here now, and we'll put
all that to rights. Where is the
boy?
He looks up as "Walter" comes downstairs. Noting that he
said "the boy," not "your son," Christine looks relieved.
DR. TARR
Ah! There he is. A handsome young
man. He has your eyes, doesn't he?
And a little bit of the nose. Very
fit, in spite of all his travails.
A very resilient boy you've got
here, Mrs. Collins.
As he bends down to look more closely at "Walter," Christine
stiffens...she can't have heard that right.
CHRISTINE
Doctor Tarr, I thought you were
here to help me.
DR. TARR
I am. Captain Jones said the boy
had gone through some extreme
physical changes, and asked me to
look in on him...to reassure you in
this your time of motherly concern.
CHRISTINE
My "motherly concern" isn't for him
because he's not my son.

DR. TARR
Statements like that will hardly

(beat)
Captain Jones said something about
a change in height...?
CHRISTINE
He's four inches shorter than --
DR. TARR
Ah, well...hardly a mystery, Mrs.
Collins. We've known for some time
that trauma can affect the growth
of children. Given the stress of
the last four months his spine may
have actually shrunk. It's uncommon,
but within the realm of possibility.
CHRISTINE
What about the circumcision?
DR. TARR
Very likely his abductor thought it
appropriate. After all, circumcision
is hygienically sound. Must have
been quite traumatic at the time.
No wonder he's submerged the memory.
CHRISTINE
Look, doctor --
DR. TARR
As you can see, there's a perfectly
sound medical explanation for all
of this. But it's good for you to
raise these questions. You should
be apprised of all changes the lad
went through during his absence.
CHRISTINE
Wouldn't I know whether or not he
was my son? I'm his mother.
DR. TARR
Which means you're in no position
to be objective. You are looking
through the prism of extreme emotion
at a boy who has changed from what
you remember. He isn't the same
boy that left here, just as a boy
who goes off to war and returns

Before she can react, he takes Walter by the hand and leads

She hangs up. Hard. The events of the day have her teetering
on the edge, but she's holding on. She pulls herself together
and goes to the sink, furiously doing dishes for a silent
BEAT before "Walter" looks up from his now-empty plate.
"WALTER"
I'm finished. Can I go to my room
now?
CHRISTINE
Yes.
Go on up.
"Walter" rises, as Christine continues to clean dishes, not
looking back at him. Exhausted mentally, physically and
emotionally. He goes to the door, stops, turns.
"WALTER"
G'night, Mommy.
Christine fumbles the plate and it SMASHES to the floor.
She
turns furiously to "Walter."
CHRISTINE
Stop saying that! I'm not your
mother! And you're not my son!
She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last.

WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING
THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY

He tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes.

"Walter" is in bed, his back to the door, as Christine appears
in the hallway. She steps into the room, sits on the bed.

He doesn't move.
Her voice is soft, but firm.
CHRISTINE
I was wrong to yell at you. You're
still a child, and I think you don't
really understand what you're doing,
the hurt you're causing. Maybe
this is all just some big game of
pretend to you, but I need you to
understand. Walter is...he's all I
have, he's everything to me, and
every day we lose because of this
puts him further away from where I
can help him.

Whatever the police think, whatever
the world thinks, we know the truth,
don't we? We both know you're not

may be the only chance I have to
straighten this out before it's too
late. Maybe you're afraid of getting
in trouble, that you're in too deep.
But you're not. You don't have to
tell me who you are, you just have
to tell them who you're not. Just...
tell them the truth.
He doesn't respond. She gives it a moment in case he might
open up, then rises and heads back into the hallway. She
switches off the light and heads off down the hallway.

Does a gap like that get smaller
with age? Because that's what

DR. MONTGOMERY
In some cases, yes, it's possible.
But the muscle between Walter's

They can never come together without

The lights are low. Christine sits on the floor, sorting
through a box containing artifacts of affection: class projects
made by Walter, trees and houses and clay dogs; a heart-shaped

Code twelve.
The matron turns Christine over to two large male ORDERLIES,
who take her by the arms and lead her into the psycho ward.
CHRISTINE
No, please, you have to listen to
me...wait...please!
They force-march her down the hall, the screams of the insane
growing louder, falling deeper into the nightmare.
Christine is ushered into the room by a NURSE.
NURSE
Take off your clothes.
CHRISTINE
Why?
NURSE
Physical examination, body cavity
search and de-lousing. Required
for all new patients.
The nurse begins putting on a pair of rubber gloves.
CHANGELING A True Story

CHRISTINE
That's not necessary --
NURSE
You can remove your clothes yourself,
or I can have the orderlies do it
for you. Which do you prefer?
Reluctantly, Christine begins to remove her clothes.
ON CHRISTINE'S FACE as she stands in a spray of water and
disinfectant, some coming from the showerhead above, some
from a hose sprayed on her by the Nurse in BG. Christine's
eyes are closed, trying to shut out the sense of violation.
NURSE
Spread your legs.
(a beat)
Wider.
Biting her lip, Christine complies.
Wet hair plastered to her face, dressed in a hospital gown,
Christine is led down a long hall by the Nurse. As she passes
the closed doors, we HEAR women weeping, talking to themselves,
crying out, screaming, beating on the walls. Fingers poke
through narrow viewing slits in the doors.
The Nurse pulls out a key-ring and unlocks one of the doors.
NURSE
Inside.
Christine enters --
Bare, forbidding, four white walls and a narrow slit of a
window. It's a two-person room. Sitting on the other bed is
another PATIENT.
NURSE
This is your room. The doctor's
left for the day. He'll see you in
the morning.
CHRISTINE
The morning? But...wait, I've got
to talk to someone in authority --
NURSE
Sorry.

PATIENT
My room...no, no...this is...this

CHRISTINE
Then if I could just use the phone.
NURSE
Phone privileges are earned by good
behavior. You're not allowed
newspapers, magazines, radio, books
or sharp objects. This is for your
own good.
The Nurse exits, closing and locking the door.
CHRISTINE
Wait...please! There's been a
terrible mistake!
Nothing. She's alone with the other Patient, who doesn't
much like the noise and disturbance.
PATIENT
My room. My room.
They SAID it
was MY ROOM!
CHRISTINE
I'm sorry, I --
PATIENT
MY ROOM!
MY ROOM!
MY ROOM!
MY
ROOM!
She starts SCREAMING.
Christine covers her ears.
The door BANGS against the wall. Flies buzz around the place.
The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a
mess. Ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen. No sound
except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters
Old, musty, shadowed. The ticking of an old grandfather clock.
There's no one in sight. Ybarra moves down the hall, glances
into two adjoining rooms. Nothing. He continues into
Curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world.
Ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then STOPS at a creak of
wood from a CLOSET. He moves toward it. Pauses. Reaches
for the doorknob...as suddenly a clock CHIMES loudly and the
closet explodes outward and --
-- SANFORD CLARK, 15, runs out. He slams into Ybarra, knocking
him down. They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on
the floor as Sanford tries to escape.
YBARRA
Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your
face through the floor!
Breathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling.
Ybarra
cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back.
YBARRA
On your feet.
Sanford stands, and as Ybarra leads him out, we PAN TO a mantle
and a photo that shows Sanford Clark and a man we recognize
as the one we saw by the road earlier: Gordon Northcott.
Ybarra locks Sanford in the car, then climbs in the driver's
side. He checks a cut on his face in the rear-view mirror.

YBARRA
Jesus...what the hell's wrong with
you? Don't you know assaulting a

SANFORD
What difference does it make now?
YBARRA
We're just sending you back to
Canada, son, it isn't the end of
the world.
SANFORD
What?
YBARRA
You can't just stay in the U.S. as
long as you want, pal. We've got a

Suddenly Sanford starts laughing. It's a nearly hysterical
laugh, half fear and half relief...Ybarra isn't there for the
reasons he thought. Ybarra is puzzled by his reaction.
YBARRA
Didn't know Canada was that funny.
Ybarra puts the car into gear and drives off.
Gustav Briegleb sits behind the microphone, waiting to go on
the air. He looks at the clock. 7:59. Glances to an AIDE.
BRIEGLEB
No word from Mrs. Collins?
(aide shakes head)
Get on down to her house, make sure
she's all right. If she's not there,
call the LAPD, see what they know.
The aide hurries off as Briegleb turns back to the microphone
and touches a switch. The ON THE AIR lamp glows to life.
BRIEGLEB
This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb
of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,
bringing you the Lord's word on

Christine is in bed, wide awake, the sounds of the asylum
somewhat lessened now. Her face is dimly lit by moonlight.
BRIEGLEB (V.O.)
I had hoped to have a guest with us

been delayed. Since she can't be

Gordon Northcott makes his way to the ticket booth.
GORDON

TICKET VENDER
Don't have anything going that far

on a train for Seattle. From there
you can transfer to one of the locals
or drive across the border.
GORDON
That'll be fine.
TICKET VENDER
Round-trip?
GORDON
One way.
The vender moves away to pull the ticket. Gordon glances at
a cop heading his way. Stiffens. The cop continues past
him. Gordon relaxes as the vender slides the ticket across.

That'll be fifteen dollars.
Gordon pays for the ticket and heads toward the boarding gates.

Christine is on top of the bed, eyes open, not having slept
all night. She's staring at the woman on the next cot. THe
woman is staring back at her. The second-hand on a clock
behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud BELL
goes off, announcing the start of the day.
We hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall. Christine
stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in
the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown...
looking like someone who actually belongs in this place.
The door opens and she steps into the hall as a NURSE passes.
CHRISTINE
Can I see the doctor?
Or someone
in charge --
NURSE
Breakfast is half an hour.
CHRISTINE
But I --
NURSE
Down the hall. The doctor will
call for you when he's ready.
(beat)
Go or stay, either way I lock the
door.
Christine doesn't want to stay, so she moves off.
Christine and the other patients sit at long tables. A few
talk in quiet whispers, but most eat silently, staring vacantly
ahead. Some have scars showing lobotomies or electro-
convulsive (shock) therapy. It's a scary bunch. Christine
isn't eating.
Another female patient, CAROL DEXTER, thirties, watches
Christine then slides closer. A BEAT, then:
CAROL DEXTER
You should eat. Eating is normal.
You got to do everything you can to
look normal. That's the only chance
you've got. Besides, you'll need

Christine is startled by the level-headedness of the advice
from someone she assumed was probably nuts. Reluctantly, she
begins eating the cold-looking oatmeal.
CAROL DEXTER
My name's Carol Dexter.
What's
yours?
CHRISTINE
Christine.
Christine Collins.
Christine reacts to the taste of the food, which is awful.
CAROL
DEXTER
Finish it all.
I know it's hard,
but you have to
try. Lunch isn't

but not as --
CHRISTINE
I won't be here that long. As soon
as I can talk to a doctor, they'll
realize there's been a terrible
mistake and --
CAROL DEXTER
Yeah, that always works.
(beat, quieter)
I heard them talking. You're here
on a code twelve, police action.
The doctors, the staff, they figure
that if the police sent you here,
there must be a good reason for it.
CHRISTINE
Then I'll just have to prove that
I'm not insane.
CAROL DEXTER
Yeah? How? The more you try to
act sane, the crazier you start to
look. If you smile too much, you're
delusional or stifling hysteria.
If you don't smile, you're depressed.
If you're neutral you're emotionally
withdrawn and potentially catatonic.
CHRISTINE
You seem to have given this a great
deal of thought.
CAROL DEXTER
I have. Don't you get it? You're

for the same reason.

We pissed off the cops.

Christine sits back heavily, starting to understand the world
more than she ever wanted to.
CAROL DEXTER
What, you thought you were the only
one?
(points os)
The lady over there was married to
a cop who kept beating her up.
When she tried to tell somebody,
they sent her here. And that one?
The police beat the crap out of her
brother, broke both his arms. When
she complained to the papers, they
picked her up and...
CHRISTINE
What about you?
CAROL DEXTER
I...work nights.
(Chris doesn't get it)
I mean, I work nights. Downtown.
In some of the clubs. You know.
It gets through.
Hooker.
Christine nods.
CAROL DEXTER
This one client started hitting me,
and he wouldn't stop. So I filed a
complaint. Turns out he was a cop.
Next thing I know, I'm here.
CHRISTINE
But how can they --
CAROL DEXTER
You're kidding right? Hey, everybody

They're all emotions, no logic,
nothin' goin' on upstairs. And
sometimes, like when they say
something that's a little, y'know,
inconvenient...they just go fucking
nuts, pardon my French. If we're
insane, nobody has to listen to us.

She nods to an older woman whose upper temples are marred by
surgical scars. Lobotomized. Christine turns away.
CAROL DEXTER
Better finish up your oatmeal.
Want to look sane for the doctors.
Then I want to hear what they nailed
you for.
Numb with horror, Christine forces down the oatmeal.
Sanford Clark sits near several other juveniles being held.
Pensive, nervous, he watches a kid absently tapping a ruler
against his knees.
FEATURE the ruler.
Rising.
Falling.
Tapping.
Then back --
-- on Sanford as we hear it continuing to tap OS.
PUSH IN ON
his face. Then, suddenly --
FLASHBACK
-- on a HATCHET, rising and falling in tune with the ruler
tapping. There's blood on the hatchet.
Gordon Northcott's eyes glitter insanely as he brings the
hatchet down again and just as it comes right AT US we flash --
BACK TO SCENE
As Sanford CRIES OUT with the memory. We PULL BACK to see
the others in the room staring at him. He turns away, won't
meet their gaze. Something's terribly wrong.
Just then, an ADMINISTRATOR comes in.
ADMINISTRATOR
Clark...Sanford Clark.
Sanford rises, goes to the Administrator.
ADMINISTRATOR
Paperwork's come through. You'll
be deported back to Canada day after
tomorrow. The police there will to
decide what to do with you next. I
hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border
illegally in future.
He starts to turn and walk away when:

SANFORD
Wait, I...I want to talk to the
officer who brought me in.
ADMINISTRATOR
I'm sure he has far more important
things to do than --
SANFORD
Please.
It's important.
The Administrator senses that he's sincere, and troubled.
ADMINISTRATOR
He's off-duty until tomorrow, but...
I'll see what I can do. No promises.
And with that, the administrator heads away.
Wearing a bandage on one arm, Christine is escorted down the
hall by one of the nurses. She's led into --
-- where DOCTOR JONATHAN STEELE stands as Christine enters.
He's in his fifties, heavy-set, serious.
STEELE
Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele.
Please, have a seat.
The nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs
in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair.
Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane.
STEELE
I hope your stay has been comfortable
so far.
CHRISTINE
Fine.
Thank you.
STEELE
Really? I'd think it would be quite
difficult at first.
CHRISTINE
(catching herself)
Well, it was. Difficult, I mean.
But comfortable.
He makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going
well. He motions to the bandage on her arm.
STEELE
I see they took a blood test.
CHRISTINE
Wasserman Test. To check for
syphilis. Apparently it can affect
the mind.
STEELE
The idea that someone thinks you
should be checked for syphilis...did
that upset you?
CHRISTINE
No. Not at all. I'm sure it's...
standard procedure.
She smiles a forced smile.
Trying to appear level-headed.
CHANGELING A True Story

STEELE
Yes. Exactly. Standard procedure.
We have to cover all bases, and --

(covering her bases)
But...at the same time...I imagine
that it would be...would probably
be upsetting to...some people that
someone else might...suspect that
of them.
(beat)
However inappropriate that might
be.
She flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks
up the report on his desk, glances it over.
STEELE
According to your file, you believe
the police have substituted a fake
boy for your son. Is that true?
CHRISTINE
I didn't say they substituted a fake
boy, just...not the right boy.
(beat)
They brought back the wrong boy.
Not my son. He's still missing.
He starts pulling out papers from his file.
STEELE
That's strange...you see, I have
here a newspaper article with a
photo of you at the train station,
welcoming your son home. That is
you in the photo, isn't it?
CHRISTINE
Yes.
STEELE
So at first he was your son, but
now he's not your son.

Has this been going on for a long

The police are here to protect us.
CHRISTINE
That's right.
He nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to
hear. It's a chess match that ends with:
STEELE
That's odd, because according to
the head nurse, when you were
admitted you accused the police of
conspiring to do this deliberately,
to punish you. So either she and
the interns are also conspiring
against you...or you're changing
your story.

Do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?
He sits back.
Christine's face tells the story.
It's raining.
The Administrator enters with Detective Ybarra.
ADMINISTRATOR
I'm sorry to bring you out in this
weather, detective, but the boy has
been quite insistent.
YBARRA
It's all right, I'll just see what
he has to say so I can go home and
get dry. Where is he?

YBARRA
Well?
SANFORD
Look, I -- this isn't easy, okay?
YBARRA
Nothing is.

Sanford composes himself, begins:
SANFORD
My cousin's Gordon Northcott. He
owns the ranch where you found me.
He let me live there in exchange
for watching the place when he was
gone, doing chores, stuff like that.
Said I could stay on as long as I
wanted to. I figured that also
meant I could leave whenever I wanted
to, but he wouldn't let me.
YBARRA
Are you saying he held you prisoner?
(sanford nods)
Bull. When I got to the ranch you
were running around free as a
jaybird. Could've left any time
you wanted. So what's this, some

No...no, it's nothing like that.

What did he make you do?
Sanford closes his eyes.
Takes a long beat.
Finally....

Ybarra freezes, the cigarette not moving in his hand.

I don't know...I never knew their

The electro-shock room. Carol struggles against the orderlies
who force her down onto the gurney. A nurse behind her applies
conductor jelly to her temples as another orderly shoves a
rubber bite-guard into her mouth.
Then a pair of metal pincers, points covered in cloth, are
pressed against her temples. A button is pushed...and her
body goes RIGID as a jolt of electricity blasts through her
body. (This was, remember, fairly common practice for violent
behavior in the 1920s.)
Then she passes out, her eyes rolling up in her head.

Christine, sobbing, collapses slowly to the floor, caught in

Detective Ybarra is sitting at his desk, not happy about a
lot of his life at this moment. He's turning over the photos
of the missing kids identified by Sanford Clark and arranging
them on his desk the way you might arrange cards, playing
solitaire. He looks up --
-- to see Sanford being led out of one of the holding areas,
hands cuffed, clothes in his hands. Being transferred to a
waiting bus. The two exchange a look. Ybarra looks away.
Sanford continues toward the bus.
Finally, in agony, Ybarra can't take it any more. He rises,
goes to the officer standing by the door to the bus.
YBARRA
It's all right, I'll take it from

YBARRA
We need him for questioning.

He leads Sanford away, then stops two passing officers.

He hurries off.
The officers follow, not sure what's up.
Christine sits beside Carol's bed. She's awake but dazed.
Christine dabs a wet cloth against her forehead.
CHRISTINE
You shouldn't have done that.

Carol takes her hand, holds it.

Hell, yeah...there are times...that's

He slides the door open and walks to the far end. The dirt
here is a strange white-yellow color. Ybarra follows, still
keeping a wary eye out for trouble. He looks down at where
Sanford has stopped. Several bags marked LYE are nearby.
YBARRA
This it?
You're sure?
Sanford nods.
Ybarra edges toward a shovel, hands it to him.
YBARRA
Dig.
(off sanford's look)
You put 'em in the ground, you can
take 'em out of the ground. Go on.
Sanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of
dirt and lye, dust rising around them. Ybarra watches,
pensively, as the other officers edge their way in. He's
looking the other way when one of the officers reacts:
OFFICER
Holy god....
Ybarra glances back...to see a child's shoe being unearthed.
And beside it...bones. And then...a skull.

who is still digging, crying as he goes.
YBARRA
You can stop now, son.

You can stop now. It's over. We

Sobbing, Sanford drops the shovel and collapses on the ground,

Steele passes down them in review. Stops in front of

The orderlies move all of the other patients away, except for
Christine, who shares a glance with Carol. Several other

Steele unfolds the paper, looks at the headline, which we
don't see. His reaction, though, is ominous and serious.
The nurse behind Christine applies the conductor jell to her
temples. She's fighting the best she can, but it's hopeless.
The nurse picks up the electro-shock pincers. Places them on
Christine's temples. Reaches for the button --
-- as suddenly the door opens, and a nurse steps in, stopping
the process. The nurse goes to the one at the controls,
whispers in her ear. The nurse then says something quietly
to the orderly, who starts to undo the straps that hold
Christine to the gurney.
NURSE
The doctor wants to see you.
They pull her up off the gurney.
Christine is ushered inside, where Steele is waiting.
He
looks upset about something.
STEELE
Mrs. Collins.
She forces herself to stand straight, not easy given what
she's just been through. He approaches.
STEELE
One last time. Are you, or are you
not, prepared to sign that letter?
She looks up into his face, her resolve unshaken, her voice

She hesitates a second, looks to the orderly, being careful

STEELE
That's right.

See to it.
The orderly nods. She takes one last look around, then gets

that had been laying face-down on his desk, looks at it, and
shakes his head.

looks on, crying.
Christine comes to the area where she was checked in. No one
is looking at her. She passes the nurse's station and heads
toward the door. Opens it. Fresh air comes in. Freedom.
She steps out the front door as --

an admissions official, having not seen her.
BRIEGLEB

Captain Jones is pacing nervously in the hallway for a long
BEAT when another officer steps out of an office with a brass
nameplate that reads CHIEF OF POLICE JAMES E DAVIS.
OFFICER
The chief will see you now.
Jones straightens his tie and steps into
lots of dark wood and filtered light. Davis is sitting at
his desk, looking at a series of newspapers in front of him
as Jones steps up and stands before the desk.
DAVIS
I don't know if you're aware of it,
Captain, but I have an exceptionally
good vocabulary. I'm a terror at
Scrabble, crossword puzzles, but
even I'm in awe of the vocabulary
that the press and the city council
have been exercising in reference
to this department courtesy of the
Christine Collins...incident.
(scans papers)
Incompetent. Cowardly. Bullying.
Reprehensible. Mendacious and
invidious...those two courtesy of

Especially invidious. Hard to work

he managed it, all right.
CHANGELING A True Story

JONES
Sir, I --
DAVIS
The key, of course, is the context
in which words like this get used.
You have to do that in scrabble,
you know, when somebody challenges
a word...show how it's used in a
sentence. So "incompetent," as in --
(reads)
"A department so incompetent that
they never realized that up to twenty
children were being kidnapped and
murdered under their very noses."
(looks over)
And here: "So incompetent that they
insisted they knew better than a
mother the identity of her own child,
forced him upon her, and then
incarcerated her when she confronted
them with evidence of their own
reprehensible behavior." That was
a two-fer. Incompetent and
reprehensible in the same sentence.
Guy must be a real terror at
crossword puzzles.
Davis gets up and crosses the room, looking out through the
slatted windows at the busy Los Angeles street outside.
DAVIS
Captain, your handling of the Collins
case has exposed this department to
public ridicule. There is even the
potential for civil and criminal
liability.
JONES
Sir, nobody could have known what
was going on up at that ranch. Not
us, not the Sheriff's Department,
the Marshall's Office...as for the
Collins woman....

There were four other photos of

DAVIS
Maybe he was...which raises the
obvious question: so what?
JONES
Sir?
Davis turns back to him from the window.
DAVIS
The Mayor wants this to go away. I
want this to go away. The way you
do that is to stop insisting that
Walter Collins was not among those
kids killed up at that goddamned
ranch. Because if the boy you
brought back isn't Walter Collins,
and he's not dead up at that ranch,
then where the hell is he? People
will want to know why we haven't
found him. Why we aren't we doing
our job.

But if, on the other hand, he is,
or could be among those poor boys
killed up in Wineville...then the
inquiries stop. It's a momentary
embarrassment that you'll have to
live with...but better a short
inconvenience than a lingering
problem, wouldn't you say, Captain?
Jones doesn't like it, but he swallows his pride.
Nods.
JONES
Yes, sir.
DAVIS
The boy's been gone for nearly a
year. If he was going to be found,
it would've happened by now. Whether
he was up at that ranch or not, the
truth is he probably is dead
somewhere. Better his mother accepts
that now rather than later, don't

DAVIS
Let me worry about the commission.
But it wouldn't hurt to find out
just who the fuck that kid is you

Did you check the wire services?
Ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet.
YBARRA
Checks out. The report was filed
by his divorced mother, who lives
in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's
grandmother. Apparently he didn't
like living with the old lady, she
didn't let him get away with the
stuff he usually got away with, and
one day...he up and left.

What about the man he showed up
with at the diner?
YBARRA
Just some drifter. The boy was
hungry, ran into this guy who said
he knew how to get some food and
not have to pay for it. Only when
they finished, he left the kid behind

coffee would be lovely.
She heads off to get some coffee. As one of the men puts his
coat behind the sofa, we see that it contains a sawed-off
shotgun. Briegleb looks out the window, to where a police
car sits, watching the house.
DISSOLVE TO:
She's dressed in her best dress, putting on a hat and a pair
of gloves. Her hands are shaking. She squeezes them together,
closes her eyes. Focuses. With one final, deep breath, she
heads out.
This is a big room, and one thousand observers fill every
available chair with more standing along the wall in back.
It's a circus. Christine sits with Hahn.

Briegleb is in a seat behind the main section.

SUPERIMPOSE: OCTOBER 24, 1928
THORPE
There are nearly one thousand people
gathered in this chamber, more than
have ever been in this room before.
HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Hahn is moving quickly down the hall toward a courtroom door,
Christine following.
HAHN
-- the police decided it was best
to keep this off the main docket in
order to avoid exactly the sort of
chaos we have across the street.
He gets to the door, pauses. Looks back to her.
She nods.
He opens the door and they enter
CHANGELING A True Story
110.
Dead silence, in marked contrast to the city council room.
As she enters, she sees people sitting silently in the
gallery...row after row of couples, mothers and fathers, some
weeping softly. Some of them notice Christine's entrance and
nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common
bond...they are all carrying the same grief.
One of the couples, MR. AND MRS. CLAY, see Christine and go
to her, speaking softly. They should be distinct enough in
appearance that we will recognize them instantly when we see
them again later.
MRS. CLAY
Mrs. Collins? I'm Leanne Clay,
this is my husband, John...I just
wanted to pass on my sympathies.
What we went through, waiting to
hear anything about our son David,
was bad enough, and now this....
(beat)
But there was no call for what the
police did to you...no call at all.
She nods her thanks as a door at the other end of the courtroom
opens. They take their seats as a judge and two attorneys
take their places, preceded by a bailiff.
BAILIFF
All rise.
They do. The judge takes his seat. The rest of the room
also sits. He nods to the bailiff, who in turn opens another
door, leading to the holding area.
As Christine looks on, Gordon Stewart Northcott is ushered
into the courtroom for his initial plea. Some women break
into tears at the sight of him. He first seems startled by
the presence of so many, then he smiles. An audience.
As he takes his place beside his attorney, he looks down the
room and meets the gaze of Christine Collins. Her face pales,
as though slapped...but she doesn't look away.
GORDON
Hey...I saw you in the papers. You
got a lot of moxie, standing up to
the police like that.
The bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge.
Christine's hands grip the seat she's in until her knuckles
turn white...but she doesn't allow him the satisfaction of
seeing her react to his comments. The judge looks up.
CHANGELING A True Story
111.
JUDGE
Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have
been charged with three counts of
murder in the first degree, with an
additional seventeen counts under
review by the district attorney's
office. How do you plea?
GORDON
Not guilty, your honor.
He glances back at his audience.
The bailiff rights him again.
JUDGE
In light of the defendant's penchant
for international travel, no bail
will be set. This court will receive
preliminary motions by tomorrow
morning, with a trial date to be
set for the earliest opening on the
court's calendar.
(beat)
The defendant is remanded into
custody. Bailiff....
The bailiff removes Gordon, who shares one last look with his
audience, and Christine in particular. He winks at her. She
doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction.
But once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes,
fighting tears. Hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says
nothing. There's nothing to say.
JONES (V.O.)
The boy, Walter Collins, was reported
as missing on March 10, 1928.
Jones is at last on the stand. Hahn stands before him, the
rest of the City Council, Christine and the huge audience
looking on.
JONES
We then instituted a nationwide
search. On July 10, we received a
cable indicating that a boy matching
his description had been found in
De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning,
he admitted to being Walter Collins,
and we made arrangements to transport
him back to California.
HAHN
Where Mrs. Collins told you the boy
was not her son.
CHANGELING A True Story
112.
JONES
Yes. She denied his identity in
spite of all evidence pointing to
the contrary.
HAHN
But as subsequent events have
demonstrated, she was correct. So
what prompted you to send her for
psychological evaluation?
JONES
Whether or not this was in fact the
correct boy was not relevant to my
decision. Throughout this period,
she acted strangely. She was often
cool, aloof and unemotional,
especially when presented with the
boy we located in De Kalb, and in
our subsequent conversations. It
was because of her disturbing
behavior that I submitted her for
observation to the psychopathic
ward of Los Angeles County General
Hospital.
HAHN
Just like that. You snap your
fingers and an innocent woman is
thrown into the psycho ward.
JONES
She wasn't --
Hahn turns away, playing to the council and the audience.
HAHN
Every home in this state is in grave
danger when a Police Captain can
take a woman into his office and,
five minutes later, have her thrown
into the psychopathic ward on his
own authority!
The crowd applauds and cheers.
Joes fights to be heard.
JONES
(over the crowd)
She wasn't --
HAHN
What was that, Captain?
JONES
She wasn't thrown.
She was...
escorted.
CHANGELING A True Story
113.
There's laughter from the gallery.
He doesn't like it.
HAHN
Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't
matter, Captain. What does matter
is that her incarceration was ordered
without a warrant.
Hahn goes to the exhibit table, picks up several papers.
HAHN
I am holding a carbon copy of the
affidavit of insanity that was issued
in the case of the State of
California vs. Christine Collins.
Who signed the affidavit?
JONES
I did.
HAHN
And what is the date on this
document?
JONES
September 12th.
HAHN
But Mrs. Collins was incarcerated
on September 6th.
JONES
The form is backdated.
HAHN
Yes, so it would appear. The bottom
of the page is reserved for recording
where and when the warrant was
served. But it has not been filled
in. May I assume from this that
the warrant was never served?
JONES
That's correct. There was no need
to serve the warrant since she was
at that time already in custody.
HAHN
Let me see if I have this straight.
A woman was thrown into the
psychopathic ward without a warrant,
because no warrant existed, and
when it was finally written six
days later, there was no need to
sign it or go to a judge because

CHANGELING A True Story
114.
HAHN (Cont'd)
she was already in the asylum!
Is
this correct, Captain?
JONES
Technically...yes.
More murmuring from the crowd.
JONES
Extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing with an
extraordinary situation! Is it our
fault that we were being deceived
by the boy who claimed to be Walter
Collins? No. In light of his claims
and her behavior, who wouldn't begin
to wonder if there was something
wrong with her?
HAHN
Because she questioned you.
JONES
Because she wouldn't listen, because
she insisted on being obstinate and
taking matters into her own hands
best left to qualified officers,
because --
HAHN
Because she was fighting for the
life of her son! A boy who may
have still been alive while you
were wasting valuable time denying
you had done anything wrong!
This silences both Jones and the crowd. You could hear a pin
drop. Hahn approaches Jones, and now speaks softly.
HAHN
And in the end, that's what happened,
isn't it? At some point, while all
this was going on, Walter Collins
died along with as many as nineteen
other youths on the Northcott Ranch
in Wineville. Is that correct,
Captain?
Jones looks to Chief Davis.
It's a moment.
Then:
JONES
Yes.
It is.
Christine's face falls into her hands.
The place erupts.
CHANGELING A True Story
115.
HAHN
No further questions.
Hahn walks away from a devastated looking Jones.
Christine is sitting on Walter's bed. She runs a hand along
the sheets, straightening and smoothing them out, her eyes
moist but not crying. We HEAR a knock on the front door
downstairs, and the door opening.
CHANGELING A True Story
117.
CHRISTINE
I'm up here, Reverend.
She continues as Briegleb comes up the stairs and enters the
room. Sees her. Takes off his hat. A show of sympathy.
CHRISTINE
When Walter was...when he was here,
I'd walk past his bedroom when he
was asleep, and even if I couldn't
see him, or hear him, I could...feel
him in here.
REV. BRIEGLEB
Mothers and their children are
connected in amazing ways. My uncle
joined the army during the big war,
and the day he died, before we ever
heard a word about it, my grandmother
woke up in the middle of the night
and said, "Bobby's gone." She
just...knew.
Christine nods, taking it in, then:
CHRISTINE
That's why I don't think Walter is
dead. I can still feel him, in
this room.
REV. BRIEGLEB
Mrs. Collins --
CHRISTINE
I know what the police said. But
the remains...what they found on
that ranch is so...most of it can't
even be properly identified. What
if that boy made a mistake when he
picked Walter's picture?
REV. BRIEGLEB
I understand that you don't want to
accept this. What mother does?
But you have to let go...and start
over. For yourself. He'd want you
to move on.
CHRISTINE
Maybe. And maybe he'd want me to
keep looking. Maybe he's waiting
for me, somewhere.

She nods absently, finishes adjusting the sheets.
He checks
his watch.
REV. BRIEGLEB
We should go.
She nods again, and stands. He heads out of the room, and
she lingers for a moment, taking one last look around before
turning off the night-light, and sees the drawing he made of
the two of them walking together beneath an orange sun. HOLD
on that image as we HEAR a gavel hammering and:

JUDGE
Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the
judgment of this court that you
will be conveyed to San Quentin
Prison, where you will be held in
solitary confinement for a period
of two years, until October 2nd,

hanged by the neck until dead. May
god have mercy on your soul.
And he brings down the gavel.
Christine, alone, rides the street car to work. The car stops
in front of a school. Walter's school. She looks out the
window, to where children are playing. Then looks away again
as the street-car starts moving again.
Christine is back at work again, as she had been, though some
of the light has gone out of her eyes. She moves from station
to station, nodding her approval or checking off forms. She
glances to the clock, it's a little after two, then goes to
Mr. Harris, who has just come out onto the floor.
CHRISTINE
Ten minute break?
MR. HARRIS
Of course.
She starts away, turning at:
MR. HARRIS
You know...one of these days you
might consider actually taking one
of these ten minute breaks. Might
be good for you.
CHRISTINE
We'll see.
Thanks, Ben.
She heads off toward a back room. He watches her go with a
combination of awe, respect and deep sadness.
Christine is on the telephone, crossing off contact numbers
on a pad of paper.
CHRISTINE
Yes, hello, this is Christine
Collins, we spoke yesterday about
my son...fine, thank you. I was
wondering if you'd had a chance to

He's heard part of the conversation, and there's a sadness in

He said he knows you're still looking

testified that he didn't kill Walter.

You don't have a lot of time.
Four bare walls and a long table. Two chairs. One window,
behind bars and chicken wire. Christine waits, alone. Then:
we HEAR footsteps approaching down the hall. A moment later,
a PRISON GUARD escorts Northcott into the room. Northcott
nods to Christine, then glances to the guard, who looks to
Christine.

I can stay in the room if you want,

CHRISTINE
No, I'm...sure I'll be fine.
PRISON GUARD

Twenty minutes.
The guard exits, leaving the two alone.
GORDON
Don't suppose you've got a cigarette?
CHRISTINE
No, I don't smoke.
He nods, walks to the window to a nearby structure.
GORDON
That's where they do it, you know.
That building right over there.

CHRISTINE
That's where they do what?

there's thirteen steps going up to

unlucky. Helps make sure you're
gonna go to hell when you die. But
I got 'em beat. I outsmarted 'em.
He looks to Christine, smiles nervously, glances back out the
window.
GORDON
They're gonna let me have whatever
I want for dinner. Got a steak
coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes
and green beans. I always wondered
why they did that whole last meal
thing. One of the other guys on
Death Row said when you take the
drop, you foul yourself, and
everything you ate...comes out the
other end. So maybe that's why
they make sure you got something in
you when it happens. They like
knowing you fouled yourself on the
way to --
He stops himself.
Turns from the window.
GORDON
Sure you don't got a cigarette?
She shakes her head.
He nods absently for a moment.
GORDON

all the death sentences he's carried
out in this place. Says it's called
"Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women."
Beats my record all to hell.
CHRISTINE
Mr. Northcott...you asked me to
come to see you. You said if I
did, you would tell me the truth
about my son. Well, I'm here.
GORDON
Yeah...yeah, you are. But see, the

come, and now --

He's pacing, growing more agitated and scared.

I don't want to see you.

What?
GORDON
I can't do this...I can't talk to

forgive me for my sins...and I've
been good, ever since...if I commit
a sin now, if I lie now...I'm out

She goes around to him, faces him.

She pushes past him to Northcott, grabs the front of his shirt.

He screams in anguish, and the guard hauls him out, closing
the door after him. Christine tries to open the door, but it
won't open.

She slowly slides to the floor, crying as we HEAR the SOUND
of CHAINS clanking, and we....

The door to the prison yard opens and closes as Northcott is
led into the area with the scaffolding. The Warden is there,
waiting at the foot of the gallows, along with a chaplain.
Several other parents, including Mr. and Mrs. Clay, are in
the witness gallery at the back, separated from the gallows
area by a large plate glass window. Christine is among the
parents. The Clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for
strength. Christine nods, accepting it, and moves to one
side.
Northcott, legs and arms bound in chains, makes his way to
the warden at the base of the gallows. A clock reads 9:50.

WARDEN
Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have
been found guilty of murder, the
penalty for which is death by
hanging. There have been no stays
or reprieves, therefore the execution
will go forward as stipulated under
the laws of the State of California.
Do you have any last words?
GORDON
No...nothing.

I kept clean after I confessed,
reverend...just like I said I would.
The chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards,
who begin to escort Northcott up the steps to the gallows.
GORDON
Will it...will it hurt?
(no reply)
Please...not so fast...don't make
me walk so fast!
They struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the
last of the thirteen steps to the top. They tie his legs
together, and cinch his arms tightly in place.
GORDON
Thirteen steps...thirteen steps...
but I didn't touch all of 'em, you
bastards...I didn't touch all of
'em!
They start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure
the rope. He looks desperately to the witnesses.
GORDON
A prayer! Please, somebody, say a
prayer for me!
The mask goes on and is tightened into place. The executioner
approaches the handle that will open the trap door. The warden
looks to the clock...9:59. From beneath the hood we HEAR, in
a terrified, shaking voice:
GORDON
Silent night...holy night...all is
calm...all is bright...round yon
virgin mother and child...holy infant
so tender and mild --
Just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the
lever and the trap door JERKS OPEN.

Northcott FALLS through the door six feet then there's a

rope...as we HEAR the sound of his heart
slowing...slowing...until it finally stops.
Christine covers her eyes. There is no cheering in the witness
room. Only the sound of weeping.
The brass plate on the partially open door announces C.

there's a KNOCK and a group of other employees and operators

They're sure, but more important,
I'm sure.
(beat)
It's my boy, all right...it's David.
He's alive, Christine. They found
him up in Hysperia.
CHRISTINE
But how --
Mr. Clay motions for them to shush. They turn their attention
to the other room, where Ybarra looks up from making notes.

YBARRA
All right, so after you got into
the car, what happened next?
DAVID
They drove me around for a long
time, then we ended up at this ranch --
PANNING the boys huddled against one wall, scared.
DAVID (V.O.)
Yeah...two of them were brothers, I
think their last name was Winslow,
something like that. The oldest
was Jeffrey, I think he was around
eleven....
(beat)
...and Walter.
We STOP PAN on the last kid...on Walter Collins, at last.
As Christine REACTS to this, her hand flying to her mouth.
Not daring to breathe.

YBARRA
Walter.
DAVID
Yeah.
YBARRA
Do you remember his last name?
DAVID
Collins.
Christine covers her face.
Can barely stand up.
YBARRA
So if you only remember some of the
names of the rest, how come you
remember his full name?
DAVID
Because of what happened.
Two of the kids, Walter and Jeffrey, are sitting in a corner,
talking quietly, urgently.
DAVID (V.O.)
Walter and Jeffrey were talking
when everybody else was screaming.
They were scared, same as the rest
of us, but they weren't scared
stupid. They kept checking around
until they found a part of the coop
where the chicken wire was all messed
up.
They pull at the wiring.
Part of the roof weakens and dust
sifts down.
DAVID (V.O.)
They figured we might be able to
yank the chicken wire and bring
down the corner, maybe make enough
room to get out of there and run...
but it would make an awful lot of
noise and if it wasn't wide enough,
we'd be stuck. It might even bring
the whole place down.
WALTER
We gotta try it!
FIRST WINSLOW BOY
No!
What he hears --
CHANGELING A True Story
135.
JEFFREY
We have to get out of here!
FIRST WINSLOW BOY
I'm afraid!
And in an echo of what he told his mother the last time he
saw her:
WALTER
I'm not. I'm not afraid of
anything.
(beat)
Don't you want to go home? Don't
you want to see your mom again?
The Winslow kids nod, and start crying.
Jeffrey and Walter
look to the rest.
JEFFREY
Anybody else?
David holds up his hand.
JEFFREY
Okay. Anybody who doesn't want to
come, get over at that end in case
this comes down.
The Winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end,
too terrified to try and escape. Jeffrey, David and Walter
go to the weakened corner of the coop.
JEFFREY
When we get out, we split up, go in
different directions, they can't
catch all of us. Ready?
They nod, and get into position, each taking a part of the
wire framework.
JEFFREY
Pull!
They do so, pulling for all they're worth...struggling...the
ceiling SHIFTS above them, dirt falling all over the place...
they pull harder, the wire cutting into fingers, but still
pulling...then suddenly --
-- the corner FALLS AWAY, part of the roof starting to come
down with it. The NOISE is substantial.
JEFFREY
Go!
CHANGELING A True Story
136.
They race out the opening, Jeffrey first, then Walter, then
David...but just as the first two get clear --
DAVID
Help!
Walter turns to see David stuck in the wiring. LIGHTS go on
around the ranch. He hesitates...then RUNS back to David,
helps to untangle him. They HEAR a SHOTGUN blast, and FEET
running their way.
DAVID
Hurry!
Walter gets him untangled, and the two RACE away from the
coop, running for all they're worth as a FLASHLIGHT hits first
one, then the other. They RUN --
-- and David catches one last glimpse of Walter running,
heading for the line of trees....
YBARRA (V.O.)
And that's the last you saw of him?
As the interview continues.
David nods.
DAVID
That's the last I saw of any of
'em.
YBARRA
So you don't know if either of the
other two were captured?
DAVID
No. All I know is, if he hadn't
come back for me...I don't think I
ever would've gotten out of there.
YBARRA
What happened after that?
DAVID
I hid in the woods for two days,
too scared to move, because I was
sure they'd find me. I finally
started walking, but every time a
car came up I was afraid it was
them. So I kept off the main roads
until I saw a train stopped at a
crossing, and I jumped in.
CHANGELING A True Story
137.
YBARRA
Why didn't you tell anyone what had
happened?
DAVID
I was afraid! I thought they'd
come after me, or my folks...so I
didn't tell anybody. I was on my
own until I got a free meal from
this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told
her I was an orphan, on my own.
She said I could stay on, and...I
did.
(beat)
Every night, I'd wake up, thinking
they were right outside my window.
Then I heard the police talking on
the radio about what happened at
the ranch, and I thought, for sure
I can't go back now.
YBARRA
Why not?
DAVID
Since I didn't tell anybody what
happened, I was afraid they'd blame
me for those kids being dead. So I
just...stayed away.
YBARRA
So what made you come forward now,
after all this time?
David looks away, his eyes tearing up.
Finally:
DAVID
I miss my mom...I miss my dad...I
just...I just want to go home.
And it's all Mrs. Clay can take. Sobbing, she runs out of
the viewing room and into the interview room, where she goes
to her son and embraces him, holds him, the two crying into
one another's arms.
