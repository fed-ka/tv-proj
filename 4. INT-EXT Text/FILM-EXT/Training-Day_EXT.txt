Jake and Alonzo crossing.
Alonzo sizes Jake up, smirks
at his dorky running shoes.
ALONZO
You look, walk and talk like a
cop.
Grow your hair out.
Alonzo stops at:
G-RIDE
A narc-machine supreme.
A tired, candy blue 1978 Monte
Carlo with mismatched rims, curb feelers, window tint.
ALONZO
Gimme that menu.
Jake pulls a Chinese menu from under the wiper.
Hands it
to Alonzo, who folds and pockets it.
ALONZO
Get in.
S'un1ocked.
Jake's turn to smirk as he climbs in.
A well-tended craftsman on a steep hill of fixer-uppers
in Echo Park.
The G-Ride parks out front.
ALONZO
Get your shit together.
Alonzo and Jake cross to the door.
The steepness of the
hill is disorientating to Jake.
Alonzo knocks.
ALONZO
This is my Road Dog's pad.
Wanna
see what he thinks of you.
JAKE
What do I say?
ALONZO
You'll think of something stupid.
Someone peeps through the peephole.
A tall, heavy man in
a bathrobe with long, grey hair answers.
This is ROGER,
old before his time, a little sick.
Happy to see Alonzo.
ROGER
Hey, brother, get your ass in
here.
CUT TO:
Alonzo crosses to the G-ride with a sixer of beer --
-- He dodges an oncoming car.
ALONZO
Get the fuck back here!
Jake into the alley.
ON G-RIDE
Alonzo pulling to the curb.
ALONZO
Dumb-ass kid.
ON JAKE
Running like a deer.
He enters the alley.
Sees a book
bag on the ground -- A dumpster ahead.
Jake rounds it.
Fast.
HIS POV
A devastatingly beautiful Latina SCHOOLGIRL, pinned
against the wall by a tall CRACKHEAD.
Her nose dots
blood on her uniform blouse.
BACK TO SCENE
The Crackhead hauls back to smack her.
Jake Charging.
JAKE
Police officer!
You're under
arrest!
The Crackhead punches Jake's throat.
Stops him cold.
Jake realizes how huge this guy is.
Gulp.
CRACKHEAD
Gonna fuck you too, cop.
ANOTHER CRACKHEAD dives from the shadows and tackles
Jake.
Both go down hard.
Crackhead #1 stomps Jake's head.
Jake gets his arm
around Crackhead #2's neck, squeezes -- the forbidden
choke hold.
Alonzo enters the alley.
And just stands there,
watching.
Jake rides out Crackhead #I's vicious kicks as Crackhead
#2 convulses from hypoxia.
And finally goes limp.
Jake lets go, sweeps Crackhead #I's legs out from under
him and hops to his feet.
Crackhead #1 stands too.
The Schoolgirl looks on, stunned.
CRACKHEAD #1
You're ass is doomed.
Jake growls, snatches him up like a rag doll, spins him,
slams him hard.
In a flash, Jake twists him into a
pretzel, drops a knee on his neck, grinds his head into
the asphalt.
Clicks on the cuffs.
CRACKHEAD #1
We didn't do shit.
Bitch is crazy
and shit.
Crackhead #2 coming to, starting to stand.
Jake crosses
to him, pins his head with his knee.
Slips a pair of
flexicuffs from his sock, zips them on the man's wrists.
CRACKHEAD #2
Man, you fuckin' up, slick.
Homegirl tradin' her ass for
cookies.
JAKE
Shut the fuck up, sir!
ANGLE ON ALONZO
Smiling, impressed by his raw skill.
JAKE
Thanks for the help.
ALONZO
Should'a shot 'em.
Jake crosses to the Schoolgirl.
JAKE
We're police officers.
You okay?
You hurt?
SCHOOLGIRL
(to the Crackheads,
shaken but tough)
You fucked up!
My cousins are
from White Fence.
They're gonna
blast you fools!
Pinchi mayates!
ALONZO
Miss!
Relax!
Are you okay?
SCHOOLGIRL
What?
No.
No, I'm not okay.
Lookit my nose... My mom's gonna
trip out.
Alonzo gingerly examines her nose.
ALONZO
Honey, it's just a nosebleed.
Put
ice on it.
Don't be walkin'
around here alone.
Tell your
cousins to get your back.
You
know what those pieces'a shit were
gonna do.
Probably got AIDS.
Why
aren't you in school?
SCHOOLGIRL
I was going to a ditch party.
ALONZO
You almost became a ditch party.
Go home.
Go home.
Now.
She grabs her book bag and gets out of there.
JAKE
I gotta get her statement.
ALONZO
Unhook em'.
We're not racking up
arrests.
JAKE
(shocked)
Kick 'em loose?
ALONZO
No.
Get some shots in first.
JAKE
I have a punching bag at home.
I
want them off the street.
Alonzo squats by Crackhead #1.
Searches him.
ALONZO
Hear that, bro?
My dog, here,
wants to lock you up.
Been to the
bootyhouse?
Grabbin' ankles for
the big boys?
CRACKHEAD #1
Suck my dick, bitch.
I know
people.
ALONZO
Kick back, who's-who.
Alonzo finds rocks in one sock.
Some twenties in the
other.
He pockets the cash and crack.
Searches
Crackhead #2.
ALONZO
Where's your horn?
CRACKHEAD #2
Ain't got no horn.
Alonzo finds a glass pipe.
ALONZO
So what's this, chief?
Gonna make
you eat it.
Instead, he grinds it underfoot.
ALONZO
Ya'll lucky I got pressing
business today -- You, stand up.
Alonzo hauls Crackhead #1 to his feet.
Unlocks the
cuffs, tosses them to Jake.
Crackhead #2 strains against
the flexicuffs.
ALONZO
(to Crackhead #2)
You get to keep those.
He steers Crackhead #1 to a wall -- cocks his fist.
ALONZO
Ain't the first honey ya'll pinned
to a wall, huh?
Close your eyes.
Crackhead does.
Alonzo knees his groin -- oof! -- He
falls to the ground, whimpers in the fetal position.
ALONZO
Next time I cut your dick off and
shove it up your ass.
(pats Jake's back, winks)
I'll leave you three alone.
Gonna
grab some beer.
Alonzo exits the alley.
Jake watches Crackhead #1
whimper, Crackhead #2 writhe in the gutter.
It's futi1e
to beat these men.
Jake takes pity, walks away.
CRACKHEAD #2
Pussy motherfucker.
Gonna see
your ass again.
Gonna fuck you
up, bitch.
Won't see shit coming.
Creep like a ninja and crack your
head open.
Blow your house up.
Punk-ass white boy.
Now you in my
world, motherfucker.
Jake stops and turns around.
He stoops to pick up a pink
Hello Kitty change purse.
INSIDE CHANGE PURSE
The Schoolgirl's MIA bus pass and her freshman ID from
Immaculate Heart High School.
BACK TO SCENE
Jake glares at the Crackheads.
JAKE
You assholes!
She's fifteen!
CRACKHEAD #2
(grins)
She all woman.
Tax that ass for
days.
Man!
Jake could kick his brains out.
Somehow, he turns
and walks away.
CUT TO:
The G-Ride rolls through the intersection.
If you don't
know the neighborhood, stay the hell out.
CUT TO:
walking.
He sees Jake, starts running.
Jake gaining, tackles him.
Gets the Dealer in a
compliance hold and cuffs him.
Alonzo pulls up, sees
Jake grinning.
ALONZO
Love doing that, huh?
(searches Dealer)
Who you work for, fuckstain?
DEALER
Can't work.
I'm on disability.
ALONZO
Bullshit.
You crackin'.
Jake finishes searching.
ALONZO
No rocks?
JAKE
No rocks.
DEALER
(laughing)
Aw, dang.

The man comin' up short
again.
Alonzo exits the car.
Glares.
ALONZO
I never come up short, fool.
(to Dealer)
Open your mouth.
The Dealer does.
Sensing to not play with Alonzo.
ALONZO
Lift your tongue.
He does.
DEALER
See.
I ain't be gottin' shit.
ALONZO
Gimme a pen.
Jakes does.
Alonzo grabs the Dealer's neck.
Forces the
pen in his mouth.
Down his throat.
He gags -- Urgh!
Vomits.
DEALER
Motherfucker!
Jake is stunned.
Alonzo inspects the spattered sidewalk.
Sees Saran-wrapped rocks.
ALONZO
Lookie those.
DEALER
That's corn.
ALONZO
That's Jimmy crack corn... One,
two, three, four, five... six.
How'd you swallow that shit
without water?
DEALER
Fuckin' bullshit!
Fuck you, civil
rights violatin' motherfuckers.
Alonzo slaps him.
ALONZO
Gonna act like a man or a bitch?!
Got you cold.
Gimme a name and
stay on the streets.
The Dealer mulls it over.
DEALER
He in County.
ALONZO
Who?
DEALER
Sandman.
He's shot callin'.
ALONZO
Unhook him, Hoyt.
Jake unlocks the cuffs.
Alonzo steps over the vomit.
ALONZO
And collect the evidence.
JAKE
Fuck you.
ALONZO
You're learning.
CUT TO:
Graffiti on a wall:
GHETTO BOYS HOOD -- SANDMAN
The G-Ride glides INTO FRAME and OUT.
ANGLE
The G-Ride parks in front of a house.
Alonzo and Jake
exit.
Alonzo pops the trunk.
Inside is a microwave box,
toaster, a boombox, a TV.
JAKE
Gonna open a Circuit City?
ALONZO
It's unclaimed shit from property.
I pass it out to informants,
victims, witnesses.
Help their
families out.
Alonzo fishes out an assault vest, tosses it to Jake and
dons an LAPD windbreaker, POLICE across the back.
ALONZO
Intel says his mom's in the
residence with two female
juveniles and a possible male
juvenile.
JAKE
If he's not here, why are we here?
Alonzo pulls a paper out of his pocket, unfolds it.
ALONZO
We gotta serve this search
warrant.
It's the Chinese take-out menu Jake handed him earlier.
JAKE
We can't do that.
ALONZO
Yes we can, supercop.
Ding-ding,
that's the schoolbell.
He slams the trunk.
Pulls his gun.
They cross to the
door.
JAKE
Get a real warrant.
ALONZO
I wanna get shit done.
They step onto the porch.
Take sides by the front door.
ALONZO
Don't get me killed, new guy.
He knocks on the security screen.
ALONZO
Police!
Search warrant!
Silence.
Alonzo knocks again.
Nods at Jake.
JAKE
L.A.P.D.!
Open the door.
Nothing.
Then:
WOMAN (O.S.)
Kevin ain't here.
He up at the
Honor Ranch.
ALONZO
L.A.P.D.!
Please open the door or
we kick it in!
Ma'am?!
CLICKING.
The door is unlocked, opened.
An attractive
black WOMAN stands on the other side of the security
screen.
Alonzo waves the menu.
ALONZO
Search Warrant.
Unlock the door
and back away.
She does, Alonzo snaps it open, rushes in, Jake follows.
At the end of the block, three big GANGSTERS buy
popsicles from a Mexican vendor.
ANOTHER ANGLE
The Woman bursts out of the house, screams at Jake and
Alonzo as they climb in the G-Ride.
WOMAN
Fuckin' jackers!
You ain't no
fuckin' police!
Get the fuck back
here with my money!
She sees the gangsters.
WOMAN
Why ya'll standin' there lookin'

Blast them fools!
The gangsters trade looks.
Start running towards --
G-RIDE
Alonzo sees the gangsters.
Tries STARTING the CAR.
The
engine won't catch.
ALONZO
C'mon, baby.
Don't do me like
that.
The gangsters getting closer.
ALONZO
Fuckin' bitch!
Start!
Nothing.
Alonzo piles out.
Raises the hood, taps the
carb with the butt of his gun.
ALONZO
Start it!
Jake twists the screwdriver.
No dice.
He sees a Glock
pulled from a waistband.
Alonzo tapping.
JAKE
Gun!
Gun!
Gun!
ALONZO
Start it!
VAROOM!
Alonzo slams the hood.
Climbs in.
SQUEALS from
the driveway.
The armed gangster drops to one knee.
The G-Ride tear-asses away in Glock's sights.
POP!-POP!-POP!-POP!-POP!
A ROUND SHATTERS a taillight.
ANOTHER pierces the trunk --
Jake stiffly marches up the steps.
Then stops.
And
turns.
Alonzo staring at him.
Waiting for him to change
his mind.
A beat.
Jake shakes his head:
no.
SCREECH!
Alonzo is gone.
CUT TO:
As Jake descends the steps, the G-Ride pulls up.
The
passenger door opens.
Jake climbs in.
Shuts the door.
CUT TO:
The G-Ride pulls onto a side street then winds its way
through a maze of shabby streets.
CUT TO:
A great place for lunch and cocktails.
Alonzo and Jake
cross to the entrance.
Alonzo, his raidjacket tucked
underarm, hands Jake some Visine.
ALONZO
Use it.
Jake does.
Alonzo opens the door.
JAKE
Who's here?
ALONZO
Don't speak unless spoken to.
CUT TO:
Alonzo and Jake exit.
It's obvious something big is
going down.
Alonzo is excited, happy, the raid jacket
underarm.
He crosses to the valet --
ALONZO
Gimme the keys for the grey one.
-- receives a key ring.
Alonzo crosses to one of three
plush unmarked Crown Victorias in the lot.
Jake watches
him open the trunk and empty his jacket inside.
Alonzo
returns the keys to the valet.
CUT TO:
In an old, hilly L.A. neighborhood near downtown.
The G-
Ride parks.
Alonzo and Jake exit.
Cross to a Pacific
Bell repair van that Alonzo knocks on.
VOICE
Go away.
ALONZO
Daddy's home.
Open up.
The door opens.
Alonzo and Jake climb in.
The sedan parks by th G-Ride.
Out steps MARK, a black
clothes horse in Italian silk.
And PAUL, a steely-eyed,
clean-cut chicano in a turtleneck.
The van doors open.
Jeff and Tim climb out.
JEFF
Nice suit, Mark.
TIM
Beautiful suit.
Now Alonzo and Jake get out.
Six cops huddled in an
alley.
Jake fits right in with the motley bunch.
Paul
hands Alonzo the warrant.
ALONZO
Thanks.
My picks and shovels?
MARK
In the trunk.
Gonna dig a ditch?
ALONZO
You are.
Great suit.
MARK
Fuck you.
ALONZO
(shakes with Paul)
Howdy, killer.
PAUL
Alonzo, what the fuck's going on?
ALONZO
Don't worry.
I talked to the
three wise men.
It's all good.
His men trade looks, they have total trust in him.
Jake
is a little nervous.
PAUL
If we can get away with it, let's
go for it.
Fuck Roger.
(re:
Jake)
Who's this?
JAKE
Jake Hoyt.
First day in the unit.
I'm coming from Van Nuys patrol.
He holds out his hand.
Paul scoffs.
PAUL
Why's he in on this shit?
ALONZO
Gotta pop his cherry sometime.
PAUL
(to Jake)
Stay outta my way, boot.
Alonzo notes Jake's unease, shows him the warrant.
ALONZO
It's the real deal.
Signed by the
judge.
Thank the Sandman.
PAUL
Roger's not gonna be too keen on
going back to the pokey.
ALONZO
I don't care what Roger thinks.
(addresses everyone)
Our safety comes first.
He gives
us shit, we give him lead.
Let's
do this right so everyone can go
home and do the wife and girl
friend thing tonight.
(checks his watch)
Suit up, ladies.
Time to punch in.
CUT TO:
Five cops crouch outside the door with shotguns, machine
pistols.
Assault vests and helmets worn over civvies.
Jake and Jeff to one side.
Paul, Mark and Tim to the
other.
Paul and Mark give the door several quick, powerful
kicks.
Wood splits, hinges tear.
It falls open.
The
five cops surge into:
- DAY
from a distant hilltop.
The ambulances and black and
whites out front shimmer in golden afternoon heat.

Dials his cell phone and gets in the car.
ANGLE ON JAKE
leaning against a phone pole.
Watching as Alonzo pulls a
clipboard from under his seat and puts on reading
glasses.
Alonzo begins writing a major incident report
as he talks on his cell.
A beat.
Alonzo STARTS the G-RIDE.
Motions for Jake to get in.
A large hospital near downtown looms in the distance.
TILT DOWN --
to reveal the tough old barrios below it.
Cholos drink
on the sidewalk.
Play grab-ass and listen to MUSIC.
CUT TO:
Jake gets out, takes some boxes.
And they cross to the
house.
With Jake following.
Past staring Cholos.
A
drunk PeeWee maddogs Jake.
Jake maddogs back.
PEEWEE
You know where you're at, fool?
A VETERANO shoves the PeeWee aside.
VETERANO
The fuck outta the way, punk.
It's business.
He shakes with Alonzo.
VETERANO
'Sup, dog.
Thought you were
missing in action.
ALONZO
'Sup, man.
You know I'm never
lost.
Jake and Alonzo cross to the house.
AD LIBS of "Those're
cops," spread through the Cholos.
At the house's door, Alonzo knocks.
A beat.
A little
girl cracks it.
ALONZO
Hi.
Got some stuff for your
family.
She closes it.
A beat.
The door opens to reveal SMILEY,
a huge, drunk Veterano sleeved with prison tattoos.
He
looks at the two cops.
Massive, impassive.
Smiley never
smiles.
SMILEY
Kitchen's this way.
Alonzo enters.
Jake hesitates.
Then follows.
CUT TO:
Smiley walks Jake past the Cholos, staring at the beaten,
wet cop.
Jake hugs the pillowcase.
Out in the street:
SMILEY
I know Alonzo paid off his debt,
but I'm gonna wait till tomorrow
to make the call.
His magic ran
out.
Jake and Smiley shake hands.
SMILEY
Sure you don't wanna ride?
JAKE
I'm sure.
As Jake walks away:
SMILEY
You went Sega today, rookie.
You're at that next level.
Just
play their games and do what you
gotta do and you'll be cool.
They'll make you Chief.
(beat)
Hey, cop!
Jake stops, turns.
Smiley smiles.
The first time.
SMILEY
Remember me.

(smiles)
I will.
CUT TO:
Jake boards an MTA bus.
Flashes his badge to the driver
and plunks into a seat.
Passengers gawk.
CUT TO:
The MTA bus FILLS FRAME.
A beat.
It rolls out to reveal
Jake and his pillowcase.
Just standing there on the
curb.
JAKE'S POV
The cul-de-sac.
No man's land.
And very dark, the
streetlights have been shot out.
Deceptively quiet,
except for the little kid riding away on his bike.
CUT TO:
Jake enters, wary.
He rounds the misparked van.
And
sees the street is quiet.
The glow of a cigarette on the
roof of an apartment building catches his eye.
He looks at a building across the street.
Sees movement,
a shadow, like someone taking cover.
ON HOUSE
A light turns off.
The curtain in the window moves.
Jake swallows hard and keeps walking toward Sara's
apartment.
The G-Ride parked out front.
ON DRIVEWAY
Thirteen men pour out like hornets from a hive.
They are
the gangsters he saw earlier.
The bench presser leads
the way, like a cat that has found a spider to play with.
Jake stares unwaveringly into the man's eyes.
Bench presser looks at the pillowcase curiously --
Smack!
-- Jake threw a roundhouse at his throat, solidly
connecting.
Bench presser drops on one knee. He struggles for a
breath.
Clutches his throat.
His homies stare in
disbelief.
ON JAKE
He takes a deep breath.
TILT DOWN --
Jake's police handcuffs orbit his fist like brass
knuckles.
The gangsters stare at him.
JAKE
I have business with Alonzo.
It's in his eyes, he will not back down.
A gangster with
intelligent eyes, obviously next in the chain of command,
sizes up Jake.
A beat.
He gestures for Jake to go ahead.
Jake steps around the
bench presser, only now getting air through his windpipe.
Jake walks into their midst.
Their faces follow him.
They are behind him, around him.
He is outnumbered by these hardened streetfighters.
Jake
prays he isn't bum-rushed.
Now past them, he continues walking toward Sara's
building.
CUT TO:
As Jake descends the stairs, the porch lights of a house
come on.
Then the lights of another house.
Steel doors open.
People tentatively step outside.
Women and children, mothers with babies on their hips.
Blue-collar fathers in shop uniforms.
More porch lights come on.
More doors open.
JAKE'S POV
The cul-de-sac has come to life.
The homes are lit,
their occupants filling the street, ready to bear
witness.
BACK TO SCENE
All eyes on Jake as he walks down the street.
Three
young boys follow him.
The old woman comes out of her house to watch Jake pass.
As do two pretty girls.
Jake nearing the gangsters.
They block the street.
The
bench presser stands there, arms crossed, Jake will have
to go through him again.
Curious eyes wonder what will happen.
The bench presser gives Jake a slight nod of respect.
The gangsters part for Jake and he leaves the cul-de-sac.
ON JAKE
As he walks, his innocence is gone, a heavy burden on his
shoulders, but there is much strength in his gait.
Jake walks past the aloof little kid, riding his bicycle
in tight circles.
He smiles at Jake.
Jake smiles back.
CUT TO:
An unmarked police sedan pulls up.
We recognize the
silhouettes of the Three Wise Men inside.
CUT TO:
Jake opens it and exits his house, ready for absolutely
anything.
WIDER
He crosses to the sedan.
The back door opens, and Jake
gets in.
FADE OUT.
