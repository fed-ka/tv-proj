      Moonshadows mix with mist.  A WHISPERING wind.  STARS 
      brighter in the sky than we ve EVER SEEN THEM.  And a baby.  
      Somewhere out there -- STILL CRYING.

      And this is really fucking SCARY.  Anything could be out 
      here.  Claire very aware of this, but moving through the 
      DENSE FOLIAGE anyway.  And suddenly --

    A BRANCH CRACKS!

      Claire spins -- SOMETHING flashes through the thick brush -- 
      SOMETHING FAST --

      Claire stumbles back -- steadies herself with one hand on the 
      TRUNK of a LARGE TREE.  And oddly enough, embedded in its 
      trunk are two PINK LINES, like RINGS around the tree.  They  *
      seem to GLOW in the moonlight.  And Claire is as perplexed by 
      them as we are but...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   2.
      (CONT'D):22


      The baby cries again.  And it s closer now.  More URGENT.  
      Distressed.  A WAIL.

      Claire lets go of the tree -- still scared, but DRIVEN now -- 
      PUSHING THROUGH the thick LEAVES until she emerges into --

    A CLEARING

      And Claire comes to a full STOP as she sees --

      LOCKE.  Sitting at a LARGE WOODEN DESK, eyes down, flipping 
      over what look like LARGE PLAYING CARDS by the light of a 
      PURPLE SHADED DESK LAMP.

      This makes as much sense to Claire as it does to us --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Wh -- what s happening?

                                  LOCKE
                    You know what s happening.

      Locke turns over another card.  Claire, FREAKED, takes a step 
      closer to the desk --

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t understand -- Why are 
                    you...?

      The CRY again.  Anguished.  In trouble.  Locke nods his head 
      towards the sound --

                                  LOCKE
                    He was your responsibility.
                          (turns a card)
                    But you gave him away, Claire.

      FINALLY, Locke looks up -- And both his eyes are OPAQUE.  ONE 
      is SOLID BLACK.  One is solid WHITE.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Everyone pays the price now.

      Oh.  SHIT.  Claire backs off, TERRIFIED as LOCKE SHOUTS AT 
      THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS...

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    EVERYONE PAYS THE PRICE NOW!!!!

      And Claire TAKES OFF, running --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"         (BLUE)         9/22/04   3.
      (CONT'D): (2)22


      Running towards the sound of the CRYING BABY.  Even MORE 
      DIRE.  The jungle even THICKER.  The noises around her even 
      SCARIER.  And we re so close on her -- SO IN HER HEAD as 
      she s literally being SUFFOCATED by the jungle until -- 
      Claire BURSTS into --

      ANOTHER CLEARING

      And here is A BASSINET.  White.  Crisp linens.  A MOBILE 
      hangs from a TREE BRANCH above it.

      And the CRIES are gone.  Eerily SILENT.

      Part of Claire doesn t want to look inside... but she has to.  
      Slowly moves towards the crib, as we get a better look at the 
      MOBILE --

      Half winged, busted TOY AIRPLANES hang from its strings -- 
      THE OCEANIC LOGO clear on them all.

      And as Claire looks down into the crib, all we can make out 
      is THICK BLANKETS.  And as Claire reaches for what s SWADDLED 
      INSIDE --

      The mobile TURNS ON.  And eerie, tinkery tune --  Catch a 
      Falling Star.   The fractured PLANES begin to SPIN --

      And Claire ignores this as her hands DIG into the blankets... 
      but something is wrong... something is seriously wrong -- *

      And the JUNGLE around us is ALIVE -- SHADOWS, WHISPERS and 
      THINGS MOVING FAST -- The SONG in high gear, CHIPMUNKS SPEED -
    - and those once white blankets are NOW COVERED IN THIS 
      VISCOUS DARK LIQUID until FINALLY --

      The MOBILE STOPS.  The jungle is STILL.

      And Claire pulls a PRISTINE BABY from the blankets.

      Wait.  No.  It s not a baby... It s a DOLL.  Plastic.  
      Diapers.  Eyes closed.  And Claire just holds it.  Scared.  
      Confused.  A beat.  Another beat.

      And the Doll s eyes FLIP OPEN as it CRIES.  An INHUMAN HOWL.

      Claire DROPS it -- PETRIFIED -- STEPPING BACK -- TRYING TO  *
      GET AWAY -- And that s when she realizes -- There is *
      something DARK all over her HANDS.  LIQUID.*

      CLAIRE SCREAMS!  And we --

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"         (PINK)         9/23/04   4.




      And here s KATE, just standing at the edge of the ocean.  
      Watching as the foam of tired waves washes over her feet.  He 
      stops a few feet from her --

                                  JACK
                    This is a first.

      Kate turns and sees Jack.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    You.  Standing still.  Middle of 
                    the day.  Doing nothing.  Amazing.

      As Jack takes off his shoes and Kate looks at the ocean --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      10.
      (CONT'D):66


                                  KATE
                    I m doing something.

                                  JACK
                    Yeah?  What s that?

                                  KATE
                    I m sinking.
                          (beat)
                    When the water goes out, it takes 
                    the sand with it and... you sink.
                          (a smile: then)
                    I used to do this with my Mom.  
                    When I was a kid.

      Jack is surprised by this quiet and gentler Kate -- he steps 
      up to the water line.  Next to her.

                                  JACK
                    Ah.  A new plan -- sink your way 
                    off the island.  Sayid would be 
                    proud.

      Kate reacts to the sound of Sayid s name.  Looks up at Jack --

                                  KATE
                    He s been gone almost a week.*

                                  JACK
                    Something tells me he ll be okay.

      Kate nods.  Turns back to the ocean --

                                  KATE
                    So what re you doing, Jack?

                                  JACK
                    Bringing down some water.  Bringing 
                    back some fish.

                                  KATE
                    Whatever would we do without you?

      Jack shakes his head, smiles.  A few beats pass.  Jack just 
      looking out at the ocean.  And then --

                                  JACK
                    Claire s going to have the baby 
                    soon.

      Kate turns to him.  And as we see the real WORRY on Jack s 
      face, the full implications of what that actually MEANS...



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      11.




      Claire writes in her JOURNAL.  The occupants of the valley  *
      BEDDING DOWN for the night -- starting to light their fires.

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                     Dear Diary -- Still on the bloody 
                    island.  Ate a bug today.  Love, 
                    Claire. 

      Claire looks up to see CHARLIE.  Smiles as he hands her a cup  *
      of STEAMING liquid --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    What separates us from these savage 
                    Yanks if we do not have tea?
                          (sits, then)
                    Feeling better?

                                  CLAIRE
                    It was just a dream.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I have this dream -- craziest 
                    thing.  I m driving a bus and all 
                    my teeth start falling out.  And my 
                    mum s in the back.  Eating 
                    biscuits.
                          (beat)
                     Course I don t wake up screaming.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m fine, Charlie.

      And it s clear from her tone that Claire clearly doesn t want 
      to talk about this.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Right.  Well.  Of course you are.

      And now a somewhat awkward moment.  Charlie obviously wanting 
      to SAY something here -- and he s a little bit NERVOUS, so it 
      comes out in sorta one sustained THOUGHT --










                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   12.
      (CONT'D):77


                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Anyway, I was just thinking how 
                    hard it must be for you... y know, 
                    being here in this... place -- 
                    without your family and your 
                    friends and I just wanted to tell 
                    you that we could be friend -- I 
                    mean I could be your friend.
                          (off her look)
                    Not like we should do each other s 
                    hair or anything -- I just mean...
                          (beat; sincere)
                    If you ever needed anyone to talk 
                    to.  About anything.  I m here.

      And while Claire might be touched by all this, there is also 
    a part of her that PULLS BACK as a result of it.  Simply put: 
      she is uncomfortable with Charlie s affection.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Charlie, trust me.  You don t...
                          (trying to find the words)
                    You ll change your mind.  I m...*

      Charlie s hurt, but does his best to cover with humor --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Lemme guess.  Damaged goods.*

                                  CLAIRE
                    Something like that.

      Charlie feels like he put himself out there and got shot down 
      for it.  He s embarrassed.  Forces a smile as he gets up -- *

                                    CHARLIE
                    All right then.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I didn t mean you--

                                    CHARLIE
                    Sweet dreams, Claire.

      HOLD ON Claire as Charlie walks off.  Disappointed.  Maybe, 
      with HERSELF.  As she takes a SIP of the tea, we CUT TO: *


      Claire, walks with her friend, RACHEL, towards the entrance  *
      of a MODEST HOUSE in suburban Sydney.  Rachel playfully rubs  *
      her hand over Claire s still FLAT belly --*

                          (smiling, nervous)
                    -- God, it just feels impossible.
                          (then, brightly)
                    Thomas cleaned out his whole 
                    apartment -- I m officially moving 
                    in on Tuesday--

                                  RACHEL
                    -- wow --

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- I know, he s the best.

      Rachel goes to knock on the door, but Claire stops her, is 
      having second thoughts.

                CLAIRE (CONT D)RACHEL
      Maybe we shouldn t --
                                                  -- Uh uh.  You re not backing 
                                                  out now --

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    It feels silly --

                                  RACHEL
                    He s just a psychic, Claire.  I 
                    thought you were into this... all 
                    your astrology stuff...

                                  CLAIRE

                    someone telling me what s gonna 
                    happen or how to live my --

                                  RACHEL
                    It s not about what you need 
                    Claire.  It s about what s fun.
                          (then)
                    You ll go in, find out if it s a

                    So unless you have another 
                    excuse...

      Claire doesn t have one she can articulate, so Rachel knocks 
      on the door and we go to:

      DOLLY OFF A FIRE, revealing, in the distance, CHARLIE, 
      MICHAEL and some of the others tending to Claire.  But we 
      find Jack and Hurley over by one of the TORCHES -- a 
      conspiratorial conversation between FRIENDS.

                                  HURLEY
                    We hoofed it around the entire 
                      perimeter, man.

                                  JACK
                    Nobody saw or heard anything?

                                  HURLEY
                    Uh-uh.  Everyone was asleep.  Nada.

      Jack shakes his head.  Fuck.  What the hell is going on here?

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    So I had an idea.  I m out there 
                    looking for a psycho with Scott and 
                    Steve right... and I m realizing... 
                    who the hell are Scott and Steve?

                                  JACK

                    I m not telling you -- but what I m 
                    saying is, we need to start finding 
                    out who everyone is here.

                                  JACK
                    You want to start a census?

                                  HURLEY
                    Yeah, like a registry.  Names.  
                    What people look like.  Who s 
                    related to who.  We lay down the 
                    law, maybe everyone won t go around 
                    attacking each other.  I mean -- 
                    c mon -- It feels like someone s 
                    getting punched or stabbed or 
                    something every other day, man.
                          (beat; serious)
                    We gotta find who did this to her.

      And Jack NODS... but there s more to it -- because that DOUBT 
      is still etched on his face...


    A new day.


      ON HURLEY in census-taking mode, jotting stuff down as he  *
      converses with SCOTT and STEVE, on the move.*

                                    HURLEY*
                    Okay, so it s Scott Jenkins...*

                    Jackson.*

                                  STEVE*
                    I m Jenkins.  Steve.*

                                    HURLEY*
                    Right.  Steve... Jenkins.*
                          (then)*
                    And you dudes were on vacation in *

                                    HURLEY*
                    So... Safe to assume... I mean, I *
                    guess you re, uh... I mean, you two *

                          (gay)*
                      ...Married... Or something?*

      Scott and Steve share a look.*

                                  SCOTT*
                    Nah.  We re both single.*
                          (re: Steve)*
                    And my buddy s got serious  *
                      commitment issues.*

                                  STEVE*
                    No, I don t.*
                          (back to Hurley)*
                    Just haven t found the right person *
                    yet.*

      ON HURLEY, somewhat uncomfortable as Steve looks at him.  The  *
      ambiguity of these two guys  relationship still ambiguous.   *
      Gratefully, Hurley then notices*

      HIS POV - LOCKE, laying out boar pelts to dry in the hot sun. *

                                    HURLEY*
                    Excuse me, guys.*

      Hurley crosses to Locke, as Steve and Scott move off. *

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)*
                    Yo.*

      Locke peers up at him, but says nothing, continuing his work. *

                    to, y know, find out who everybody *

                    And who s checking to see who you *
                    are?*

      Hurley s slightly taken aback at that.*

                                  HURLEY*
                    M-me?*

                    It was a joke.*

                          (forcing a chuckle)*
                    Oh... Yeah... Good one.*

                                  LOCKE*
                    Well, you already know my name.  *
                    Lived in Tustin, California for *
                    most of my life.*

                                  HURLEY*
                          (writing)*
                    Uh huh.  And your reason for *
                    travel?*

      Locke suddenly pauses and looks at him.*

                                  LOCKE*
                    Sorry?*

                    Y know...  The reason you were in *
                      Australia.*

      After a beat, Locke looks off, pondering. *

                                  LOCKE*
                    I was looking for something. *

      Hurley eyes him for a moment.*

                                  HURLEY*
                    Looking for...*
                          (then)*
                    O-okay.  So, uh... Did you find it?*

                                  LOCKE*
                    No.*
                          (looks back at Hurley)*
                    It found me.*

      Hurley stares at Locke, finding himself strangely unnerved by  *
      these cryptic answers, but without the nerve to pursue it. *

                                  LOCKE (cont d) (CONT D)*
                    Anything else?*

                    No.  No, that s great.*

      Locke offers up a smile, and moves off, leaving Hurley to eye  *
      him as he goes.*

                    out here?  With no instruments, no 
                    monitors, no anaesthetic?  That 
                    would not be good.

      And maybe because there is a ring of truth to the possibility 
      that none of this is happening --

                                    CHARLIE
                    It s not all in her head.

                    So what do we do?


      Hurley approaches Ethan.  Our first real look at him.  He s 
      pleasant.  Unassuming.  But there s something INTERESTING 
      about him too.  Something we can t quite put our finger on...

                    Dude.  That s right.  Lance is the 
                    little skinny guy.  With the 
                    glasses and the red hair.

      Ethan looks nothing like the person Hurley just described.

                    Sorry, too many names and faces.  
                    Pretty pathetic -- I mean, you d *
                    think after a couple of weeks on an *
                    island with the same people we d *
                    all know each other...*

                                  ETHAN
                    Yes.  You would think that.*
                          (smiles; then)*
                    Well... it is what it is.*

      Hurley looks at this guy.  O-KAY...*

                                    HURLEY*
                    So, uh, we re doing a list, you 
                    know, of survivors.  Name, home 
                    address.  Like that.

                                  ETHAN
                    Well you already have my name.

                      HURLEYETHAN
      Not Lance.
                                                  -- Definitely not.

                                  HURLEY
                    Last name?










                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (GREEN)       9/27/04      27.

                                  ETHAN
                    Rom.

                                  HURLEY
                    Rom?  R-O-M?

                                  ETHAN
                    That s right.

                                  HURLEY
                    Great.  Where you from Ethan Rom?

                                  ETHAN
                    Ontario.  Canada.

                                  HURLEY
                    Right on.  Love Canada.  Great... 
                    uh... weather.
                          (then)
                    Well, that covers it.  Thanks for 
                    your time, dude.

      And just before Hurley walks off --

                                  ETHAN
                    Hey, Hurley -- What s this for?*

                                  HURLEY
                    Nothing, man.  Just...
                          (finding it)
                    Thought it d be a good idea.

      And OFF HURLEY, not the greatest liar in the world --




      [ESTABLISHING ACTION MISSING]




                                  MALKIN
                    ... yes?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      30.

      Now we see the REVERSE.  It s Claire.  Four months pregnant.   *
      It s sort of a rainy day.  She s wearing a hooded raincoat.  
      She pulls back the hood.  Looking sweet and vulnerable.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Mr. Malkin, I met you before.

      He stares at her for a long beat.  Finally:

                                  MALKIN
                    ... yes, I remember.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... you wouldn t give me a reading.
                          (then)
                    I was hoping maybe you would now.

      And on Malkin, staring at her, debating, nervous...


      TIGHT ON Claire -- unsettled by this MEMORY -- still revved 
      up -- anxious, upset, scared -- ALL OF IT -- as she strides 
      down the JUNGLE PATH (this should be the same location we saw 
        Locke/Charlie/Kate/Jack come through on their way to the 
      caves) carrying her bag.

      Then -- a NOISE.  She freezes.  Frightened.

      SOMETHING COMING from behind her -- FAST -- Moving through 
      the DENSE FOLIAGE -- and just as she s about to SCREAM --

      Charlie emerges from the JUNGLE.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hi.

      Claire just looks at him sadly.  A beat.  Then, she turns 
      around.  And continues walking.  Charlie scampers after her --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Where you going?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Back to the beach.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What happened?  Did Jack --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Jack tried to dope me up is what 
                    happened.  He thinks I m -- I m 
                    making all this up.  That it s not 
                    really happening.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"         (BLUE)         9/22/04   36.
      (CONT'D):2525


                                  CHARLIE
                    Ah.  So as proof of your sanity, 
                    you go tromping through the jungle 
                    alone.  Well done.

        Good-natured as that was intended, Claire stops.  Squares off 
      with Charlie.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m not crazy.

      And she s off again.  ON CHARLIE.  Clearly, she wants nothing 
      to do with him.  Nothing to do with anyone.  But after a beat 
      -- he follows her anyway.


      BACK ON THE BEACH, we find SHANNON and BOONE in the midst of 
      PACKING.  Hurley here with them, writing in his notebook --

                                    SHANNON
                    You want my  information?   Name.  
                    Shannon Rutherford.  Age.  Twenty.  *
                    Address.  Crap Hole Island.

                                  HURLEY
                    So where were you guys last night? *

                                  SHANNON*
                          (that was the stupidest *
                            question ever)*
                    Uh... the beach?*

      Boone looks at Hurley, suspicious --*

                                  BOONE
                    What s up with the interrogation?*

                                  HURLEY
                    Y know, you re like the twentieth 
                    person to ask me that today.  Why s 
                    everyone so uptight about answering 
                    a few questions?

                                  BOONE
                    Maybe we re not cool with you 
                    starting up your own little Patriot 
                    Act, man.

                                    SHANNON
                          (to Hurley; simply)
                    He s a liberal.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"         (BLUE)         9/22/04   36A.
      (CONT'D):2626


      Boone lets that go and refocuses on Hurley --

                                  BOONE
                    So why the list?*

      (CONT'D): (2)2626


                                  HURLEY
                    It s nothing, really -- we had an 
                    incident in the valley last night.

                                  SHANNON
                       Incident? 

                                  HURLEY
                    Claire -- the pregnant girl?  Ya 
                    know her?  Yeah, she kinda got, 
                    uh... attacked a little

                      SHANNONBOONE
      -- what?Is she okay?

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Yeah.  She s shook up, but...

                                    SHANNON
                    I am not moving to the rape caves.

      Shannon abruptly stops packing.  Boone s lost in thought for 
    a second, something DAWNING on him -- to Hurley --

                                  BOONE
                    Hey -- y know your life would be 
                    much easier if you just had the 
                    manifest.  We crossed off the names 
                    of the dead after we burned the 
                      fuselage... so it should be a full 
                    roster of the rest of us.

                                  HURLEY
                          (psyched)
                    What?  You serious?  Who has it?

                                  BOONE
                    ... who do you think?


      Hurley PLOPS down in the sand next to SAWYER.  Sunning in his 
       deck chair.   Shirt OFF.  Arm still bandaged from his 
      torture adventure.

                                  HURLEY
                    I m gonna lay it out straight.

                                  SAWYER
                          (yawning)
                    You do that.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   38.
      (CONT'D):2727


                                  HURLEY
                    I hear you have the flight 
                    manifest.  I need it and I want you 
                    to give it to me.

                                  SAWYER
                    That so.

                                  HURLEY
                    Now you can do what you usually do 
                    when someone asks you for something 
                    and tell me to screw off...

                                  SAWYER
                    Screw off.

                                  HURLEY
                    Or you can just give it to me.  
                    Because dude?  You could use the 
                    points.

                                  SAWYER
                    Gosh.  You sure know how to butter 
                    a man up, Stay-Puff.

      Hurley doesn t rise to the bait of the insult.  Just offers 
      up his winningest smile --

                                  HURLEY
                    It s a gift I have.

      Sawyer takes a beat.  Then another beat.  Finally --

                                  SAWYER
                      Manifest s in the tent.  Take it.

      And OFF Hurley, surprised that this actually WORKED...


      Find Claire, still making her way down the path.  Charlie, 
      never one to quit -- and certainly even more determined given 
      his emotional attachment to this girl -- a few paces behind --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Please let me carry your bag...

                    I m fine.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Yes.  You are.  But I can still 
                    carry your --

      She stops.  Turns to him --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Why d you come after me?

                                  CHARLIE
                          (little uncomfortable)
                    Uh... well... it s probably because 
                    I like you.

      Claire shakes her head, starts walking again --

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  CLAIRE
                    You don t like me, Charlie.  You 
                    only think you like me.  Maybe 
                    because I m so damn... pathetic 
                    with my big disgusting belly...
                          (full-on tirade now)
                    And yes, aren t you sweet and 
                      affectionate -- But you ll change 
                    your mind.  Maybe it ll be a week 
                    or a month... but it ll wear off 
                    and you ll get on with it and I ll 
                    be a stark raving madwoman with a 
                    crying b--OW!

      And Claire suddenly stops walking -- DOUBLES OVER in PAIN --

                      CHARLIECLAIRE
      Claire -- ?OW -- Oh no... OW--

      He puts his arm around her, nuturing.  Scared.  Concerned--

                                    CHARLIE
                    What s the matter?

      Claire looks up, IN PAIN -- TERRIFIED and totally VULNERABLE--

                                  CLAIRE
                    I think it s coming --

      And as Charlie s eyes slowly drop to her BELLY...

      AND WE SMASH OUT OF COMMERCIAL TO FIND --


      CLAIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONTRACTION.

      She s in PAIN, but this is not the anxious Lamaze breathing 
      of LABOR.  And she s keeping it fairly well together...

      Charlie, on the other hand, is PANICKED.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Was that another one?

                    Yeah...

                      CHARLIECLAIRE
      We need to time these, right?  
      That s what you do -- time -- Charlie...
      the contractions --

                                    CHARLIE
                    You just need to stay calm, all 
                    right?  Big deep breaths...
                          (to himself)
                    Aw bloody hell --

                        CLAIRECHARLIE
          (scared)
      You need to get Jack.
                                                  -- What?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I ll be all right...

                                    CHARLIE
                    I am not leaving you alone.  I can 
                    deliver a baby!

                                  CLAIRE
                    Charlie, please just get --

                                    CHARLIE
                    I can do this-- it happens all the 
                    time, it must!

                                  CLAIRE
                    You don t know how to --

      And Charlie is ALL OVER THE PLACE --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   41.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Listen: trust me -- I m not going 
                    to let anything happen -- You re 
                    safe -- Yeah -- I may not know what 
                    I m doing, but I ll figure it out -- 
                    If I can kick heroin, I can deliver 
                    a baby.

      And it s out of his mouth before he realizes he even said it.  
      Claire s just staring at him.  Beat.  Then --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Okay: let me explain.  I m an 
                    addict.  Was an addict.  But look, 
                    I ve been clean for five days!

      Another beat.  Then, more than ever:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Get.  Jack.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Right.

      One more beat of indecision -- concern for her -- opens his 
      mouth to say something -- but instead, HE TAKES OFF RUNNING.

      And as we sit here with Claire, another SHOT OF PAIN crosses 
      her face.  And the WIDER we get, the more ALONE she is.  HER 
      BREATHING the only thing penetrating the SILENCE of the 
      jungle as we BLAST INTO --


    A very pregnant Claire pounds on the door.   Urgent.   *
      Finally, Malkin opens the door and --*

                                    CLAIRE*
                    Okay, what is it?  Your  offer. *

      OFF Malkin, we go to:*


      Charlie hauls ass through the jungle.  SMASHES through LOW 
      HANGING BRANCHES as he goes.  He BLASTS out of the brush and 
      almost runs into --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      44.




      ETHAN.  Alone.  Carrying firewood --*

                                    CHARLIE
                          (frantic)
                    Hey -- Oh, thank God -- What s your 
                    name?

                                  ETHAN
                    Ethan -- are you all right?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Ethan -- I need you to go to the 
                    caves.  Run back to the caves -- 
                    and get Jack... tell him that 
                    Claire s --

                                  ETHAN
                          (concerned)
                    Claire?  Is she okay?

                                    CHARLIE
                    She s having the baby --
                          (no time to explain)
                    Get him.  Fast.  I ll be with her --

      Charlie points back to where he came from --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Right through there.  On the path.
                          (then)
                    Go!

      Ethan stands there for a moment.  Seems to process all this.

                                  ETHAN
                    Of course.

      And OFF CHARLIE as Ethan turns tail and RUNS for the caves...


      Charlie RACES through the jungle -- frantic, eyes wide, 
      hoping he hasn t lost his way -- and finally he sees her: 
      Claire, up ahead, lying there in distress.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Claire!  Claire!!!  He s coming!

      He arrives at her side -- drops to his knees, out of breath, 
      but encouraging:



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      45.

              CHARLIE (CONT D)CLAIRE
      Jack s on his way, he ll be -- it hurts--
      here-- are you--?  What s--?

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Okay, okay-- he ll be here, just 
                    breathe, keep breathing...

      -- and he s holding her hand now, breathing overtly, trying 
      to help lead her --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Like this.  Inhale, exhale, all 
                    that-- do it with me --

      And he breathes -- so does she -- and it actually seems to be 
      helping.  Still, she s scared, in some pain, and frustrated 
      as hell.  Under her breath and mostly to herself, she says:

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... I m not supposed to be here.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I think we ve all been feeling a 
                    bit of that--

                                  CLAIRE
                    I know... there was just... someone 
                    who promised me I wouldn t be here.

                                    CHARLIE
                    He was wrong.  Keep breathing.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (breathing, with regret)
                    ... yeah... he was wrong...

      -- and on CLAIRE, TIGHT, breathing, we CUT TO...


      Charlie with Claire, still in the deep breathing exercises:




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   47.

                                  CHARLIE
                    A psychic.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I know.  I m so embarrassed.
                          (then)
                    And after everything... he was just 
                    full of it.

    A breathing beat.  A long one.  Then:

                                  CHARLIE
                    Or not.
                          (off her look)
                    All he wanted was that no one else 
                    raise your baby, right?
                          (with dread)
                    ... so maybe he knew.

      TIGHT AS HELL on Claire as she turns to Charlie... just now 
      starting to figure out what he means.  She stares at Charlie, 
      stares, horrified by the thought...

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    ... I mean... if he wanted it bad 
                    enough... if that guy really... 
                    does have the gift... and I think 
                    some people do...
                          (could this be...?)
                    ... he could ve known, Claire...

      SO TIGHT on Claire -- the very idea ghastly -- and Christ, if 
      she doesn t suddenly remember details of the moment:


      TIGHT ON CLAIRE, eyes wet, staring off as she remembers... in 
      pure horror...

                                  CLAIRE
                          (sotto)
                    ... there was no couple... in Los *
                      Angeles...
                          (then)
                    He knew...


      RUNNING LEGS as they JACKHAMMER through masses of PLANTS -- 
      scrabble over ROOTS --

      SOMEONE is trying to get through the dense jungle as fast as 
      they can, but a LIMP from an injured leg prevents them from 
      reaching top speed -- and now we see -- it s SAYID -- His  *
      clothes weathered from an ordeal (you ll read all about it in  *
      EPISODE 108.)  His face and arms TORN UP from his TWO DAY  *
      TREK.  He runs, smashes his way through the jungle.*

      And if this wasn t ENOUGH action to get us excited about 
      staying tuned for the denouement --


      ANOTHER PAIR OF LEGS pounds through the foliage, running in 
      the opposite direction -- NO LIMP -- A different RHYTHM to 
      the BREATHING that accompanies them -- very different,  *
      because we pull up and see, IT S HURLEY. *

      By the way this is CUT, we get the sense that Sayid and  *
      Hurley -- are RUNNING TO THE SAME PLACE.*

      And off this pure KINETIC INTENSITY we find --


      STILLNESS.

      Claire sits against a tree.  CHARLIE huddles at her side with 
      friendly concern.  The TRADE WINDS ease around them, 
      prompting the grass to sway with reassuring grace.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You feel another one coming?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t know...

                                    CHARLIE
                          (looking around)
                    Where in the bloody hell is Jack?

      Claire shifts, starts to get to her feet --

                                  CLAIRE
                    I think... I think I m all right.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   50.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Wait.  You shouldn t -- the 
                      contractions --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Maybe that was the last one.
                          (a half-prayer)
                    Please, let it have been the last 
                    one.

                                  CHARLIE
                          (hopeful)
                    Jack said the stress might cause 
                    some kind of false labor...
                          (beat)
                    Are you sure you re all right?

      She assesses for a beat, then --

                                  CLAIRE
                    No pain.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Well, there you are, then:  
                    Birthing emergency averted.     
                    Told you I d take care of you.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (a heartbreaking smile)
                    Thank you, Charlie.

                                  CHARLIE
                    ... you re quite welcome.

      And a moment of GENUINE WARMTH.  Claire finally giving in to 
      it, too.  After all they ve been through, we want these two 
      to be together.

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    Any chance of you making it back to 
                    the caves?
                          (beat; and he means this)
                    I won t let anything happen to you.

      And after a moment, she NODS.  But lest we get too 
        comfortable, we CRASH BACK INTO --








                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"         (BLUE)         9/22/04   51.




      SAYID -- RUNNING -- LIMPING -- His breathing more RAGGED -- 
      More DESPERATE --

                                                                  INTERCUTS WITH:


      HURLEY -- RUNNING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION -- A COLLISION 
      COURSE.

      And we cut back and forth between the two until --

      One of the DARKER sections of the jungle.  Definitely CREEPY 
      as we find --

      CLAIRE and CHARLIE as they make their way back along the path 
      toward the valley.  Charlie carries her BAG in one hand.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   53.
      (CONT'D):4646


      Claire suddenly STOPS -- puts her hand on her belly.  Charlie 
      instantly WORRIED --

                                  CHARLIE
                    You okay?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah -- he just kicked.

      Claire SMILES and reaches out, taking Charlie s hand in hers.  
      Charlie smiles, abashed, as --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello there.

      Charlie and Claire both JUMP.  Didn t hear anyone come up.  
      They both look up to see --

      ETHAN.

      Just kinda standing here.  Arms at his sides.  More than just 
    a little UNSETTLING.

                                  CHARLIE
                          (confused)
                    Ethan?  Where s Jack?

                                  ETHAN
                    Oh.  Jack?
                          (simply)
                    I didn t go and get him.

      Ethan exudes a creepy calm -- he s still the same guy we ve 
      come to know, but there is something slightly askew in his 
      delivery, something just... OFF.*

                                  CHARLIE
                    What do you mean you didn t go?

      Ethan ignores him.  Turns his attention to Claire, takes a 
      step forward --

                                  ETHAN*
                    I know you re scared.  It s okay.*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    What the hell are you talking *
                    about, you git?  One more step --*

      AND SUDDENLY, a NOISE in the DENSE JUNGLE behind them --  *

      Charlie and Claire both turn towards it -- NOTHING.  And the  *
      instant they turn back --*

      Ethan is standing right in front of them -- *

                                  ETHAN*
                    I m sorry it s come to this.*

      And as we CLOSE IN ON ETHAN S COLD EYES -- wondering who the  *
      hell he is -- what he wants -- and what the fuck he is GOING  *
