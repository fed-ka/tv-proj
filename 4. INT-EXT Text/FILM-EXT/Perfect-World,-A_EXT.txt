SUPERSCRIPT:
OCTOBER, 1963.
A small country town. Normally quiet at this hour, the
street is tonight alive with trick or treaters dressed as
witches, goblins and superheroes making their annual door to
door rounds.

GLADYS PERRY, 30 going on 45 due to single motherhood and
having worked two fulltime minimum wage jobs the past ten
years, looks out the window with disgust and pulls the
curtains closed.

MR. HUGHES, a 35-year-old family man is playing chaperone to
prepubescent versions of SUPERMAN, TINKERBELL, and a DANCING
SKELETON.
KIDS
(in unison)
Trick or treat!!!
Gladys simply stares at the children before looking to Mr.
Hughes.
GLADYS
I'm sorry but we don't take no part in
Halloween.

MR. HUGHES
Excuse me?
Phillip arrives at his mother's apron. He stares at the kids
with relish. In the near window, Ruth and Naomi steal a look
through the window.
GLADYS
We're Jehovah's Witness.
Superman locks eyes with Phillip.
SUPERMAN
Hey, Phillip Perry.
PHILLIP
Hey, Billy Reeves.
SUPERMAN
How'd ya' know it was me?
GLADYS
Go eat your supper, Phillip.
MR. HUGHES
Come on, kids. Let's go to the next
house. Sorry for the bother.
Gladys closes the door firmly and locks it.

A green Impala pulls up to the main entrance and stops. A
GUARD steps from his office to greet the driver, LARRY, a
pudgy 55-year-old prison employee wearing a loud plaid jacket.
GUARD
Evenin', Larry.
Forget somethin'?
LARRY
Goin' to Austin tomorrow.
Gonna' take
some work with me.
GUARD
Work, work, work. When you and me gonna'
go out and grab a cold one?
LARRY
Sooner the better.
The gate opens and the Impala passes.

Superman and Dancing Skeleton, no longer with adult super-
vision, fill water balloons at an outdoor water spigot.
SUPERMAN
Make 'em small so you can heave 'em.

Superman lofts a BALLOON and grabs another as the first hits
the door of the Perry house and SPLATTERS.
SUPERMAN
Bombs away!
Dancing Skeleton does his best Warren Spahn and tosses a wet
fastball at the door.
SKELETON
Here's your trick!
At the window, Phillip, his nose pressed to the pane, stares
expressionless at the onslaught. He barely flinches as a
BALLOON SPLATS only inches away. Gladys arrives and pulls
the curtains shut once more.

Butch kicks the top off a ventilator shaft and rolls onto the
roof. Jerry follows as Butch shimmies to the wall.
At the edge, Butch and Jerry survey the yard as a searchlight
routinely bathes the walls in a circle of light.

THEIR POV - GREEN IMPALA
11B
parked almost directly below them, next to the Administration
office of the prison.
JERRY
You'n'me must be livin' right, Butchie boy!
BUTCH
Let's get something straight. I don't
like you. As soon as we're on our way,
that's it.
JERRY
Who said I liked you?
Butch slides down and hangs from the ledge before dropping on
the roof of the building below.
12
13
Just as Larry reaches the Impala, Butch and Jerry leap down
and land on him. The spotlight showers them in a flash of
light as it passes by.
Butch cups his hand over Larry's mouth while Jerry reaches
into his jacket -- Bingo -- a shiny .38.
BUTCH
(to Larry)
Keep yer' mouth shut.
JERRY
(to Larry)
Gawd I'd love to blow yer' head off.
14

Larry, driving with his eyes straight ahead, stops at the gate
and waves a palm at the Guard, who opens without hesitation.
GUARD
'Night, Larry.

16C
Red pulls up in front of a small house in a residential
section of town. Police cars are everywhere and several
officers are behind their vehicles, guns pointed at the house.
Red steps out of the car and is greeted by a POLICE SERGEANT,
about the same age as Red.
SERGEANT
Long time, no see. What are you doin'
here, Chief?
RED
Couldn't sleep.
Whattaya got?
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
16C
They walk. Red arrives at a truck with a 10 gallon coffee
urn roped to the tailgate. He grabs a paper cup and pours.
SERGEANT
Guy holdin' his family hostage. She kicked
him out, served him divorce papers, he came
back drunk and pulled a .38. Fired two shots
but we don't think anybody's hit. Actually
you might know the guy from your sheriff
days. Hayden Webb. Been on suspension for
awhile. Ring any bells?
RED
Yeah.
Lemme talk to him.
SERGEANT
No can do.
Police jurisdiction.
Red tastes the coffee -- cold. He spits it out, pours the
contents of the cup on the ground and walks toward the front
yard. Sergeant follows.
RED
And how are you guys doin'?
SERGEANT
We got specific rules to follow in these
kinda situations, Red.
(gives in)
He won't talk. Jus' keeps yellin', crying
and waving his gun around.
Red moves forward into the yard.
SERGEANT
At least use the megaphone, you stubborn
jackass!
But Red ignores and arrives at the front door.
He knocks.
RED
Hayden, this is Red Garnett. We worked together
a few years back. Mind if I come in?
The YELLING inside STOPS and the door opens a crack.
HAYDEN,
35, distraught, peers out.
HAYDEN
'Evenin', Chief.
RED
Leave it to the P.D. They got a three-
ring circus out there and not one cup
of hot coffee. You mind?
Hayden mulls it over, then opens the door.

16E
Sergeant and other cops stand around and watch the house.
SERGEANT
Well, I'll be damned.
NEW ANGLE
The front door opens and Julie emerges with her two kids.
She takes a few cautious steps, then runs to the police.
16F
16G
Hayden's dead, covered body is carried out the door.
Julie
screams and sobs, still holding her crying children.
Red, looking pretty shook up, slowly exits the house. He
stops and looks at Julie and the kids. His eyes lock with
the little boy's.
COP
Got a call, Chief Garnett.
They're
lookin' for ya downtown.
Red slowly walks away.
The little boy's eyes follow him.

22
The Impala creeps through the previously seen neighborhood
without its lights.
23
25
FROM BEHIND a fence, THROUGH the opened, screened windows we
see Gladys at work.
Phillip enters, dressed in cotton briefs and a T-shirt, drags
a chair from the kitchen table by the window and assists his
mother by buttering the toast.
POV MOVES CLOSER.
GLADYS
Thank you, Phillip. Go wake up your
sisters.
Phillip dutifully steps down and returns to the living room.
Gladys works to adjust her slip, then grabs plates and
silverware and takes them to the table.
JERRY
I take mine fried.
26
27
A Ford sits in a driveway. In the far b.g. a back porch light
glares. Butch ENTERS FRAME, looks at the light, turns to the
Ford and starts to jimmie the lock. No luck. He rises and
looks to the light.
28
31
Butch, carrying Phillip, and Jerry emerge from the back of
the house and race back to the Impala.
GLADYS (O.S.)
Phillip!!!!...
Butch flips Jerry the gun, tosses Phillip into the passenger
seat, leaps over the hood and into the driver's seat. The
CAR STARTS and SQUEALS away.
Neighbors, aroused by the noise, exit their homes clad in
robes, nighties and curlers.

33
Cummings races from behind the house with the SHOTGUN,
levels it and FIRES a BLAST...
A nearby station wagon WINDOW SHATTERS. Rising from their
cover position, its owners look at Cummings with disgust.
OWNER
Nice shootin', Fred.
34
37
An aluminum water tank spews a violent leak.
38
38
BUTCH
We got a handful of caps and yer'
shootin' water tanks. He's a smart
guy, huh, Phillip?
Phillip doesn't move or change expression. Jerry smiles,
almost to himself, and FIRES TWICE more for the hell of it.
The ROOF of the Impala EXPLODES with two holes as the car
speeds off down the highway.

Red is finishing up with several reporters near the door to
the parking lot. Adler jumps in, holds up his hands.
ADLER
All right, that's it, boys.
Chief's got
work to do.
Red and Adler move through the parking lot to SAUNDERS, 50, an
aide to the Governor. Saunder's seconds are a PHOTOGRAPHER,
young and energetic, and SUTTLE, 35, dark-haired, with a
cowlick.
Saunders shakes Red's hand and they turn to gaze upon...
'60-STYLE AIRSTREAM MOBILE HOME
parked in the middle of the lot hitched to the back of a new
Chevy truck. The Airstream is painted in state colors and
sports banners, decals and logos.
40
40
Saunders follows Red as he walks around the showpiece,
occasionally kicking a tire or two.
SAUNDERS
So whattaya' think?
Saunders motions for the Photographer to come closer and take
pictures. He moves in next to Red and poses as the camera
clicks.
SAUNDERS
We are very proud of this baby. Governor
Connally special ordered it so state
officials and dignitaries can ride in the
parade in Dallas. You know President
Kennedy's comin'?
(CONTINUED)

RED
So I hear.
SAUNDERS
Latest technology, oversized engine,
complete kitchen and sleeping quarters,
gun racks, frig, stove, the works. Even
got a hot line phone straight to the
Governor's office.
Red stops circling and nods to Adler, who scurries away.
RED
Fine piece of machinery.
SAUNDERS
What's more, as soon as it gets back from
Dallas it will be at your requisitioned
disposal. Perfect for lots of situations
-- a headquarters on wheels.
Red smiles, walks up to one of the Lone Star decals and rips
it off.
RED
We'll take it.
SAUNDERS
Uh, Chief?....
Red rips off another decal. Adler and a few others start to
load equipment, guns and files into the motor home. In
addition they cart out unecessary items: mattresses, etc.
and stack them in a pile outside the motor home.
The Photographer continues to snap photos.
SAUNDERS
(to Red)
Whattaya' doin', Red?!
(to Photographer)
Stop takin' pictures!
Red does away with the parade banner.
Saunders follows behind
and tries to reinstate the decal.
SAUNDERS
It's jus' not possible, Red. The Governor's
gonna' ride it in a campaign parade tomorrow.
RED
Guvner' hisself told me this manhunt was
top priority.

Adler moves through the door to the RV carrying Red's favorite
desk chair. He's followed by BOBBY LEE, 20's, cocksure,
wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots.
ADLER
(to Saunders)
S'cuse me.
(to Red)
This here's Bobby Lee. He's a specialist
with the Feds. They want him to tag along.
Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods.
Bobby Lee steps
into the Airstream.
SAUNDERS
Please, Red, ya' gotta' believe me...
Red spots Suttle, 35, bright-eyed, with a cowlick, sitting at
the wheel of the Chevy truck.
RED
Who are you?
SUTTLE
Dick Suttle, the driver.
RED
Not anymore.
Bradley.
BRADLEY, 35, glasses, moves to the truck and gets in.
Suttle shrugs and steps out.
Saunders stops Suttle and turns to Red.
SAUNDERS
This man stays with the vehicle wherever
it goes, Red!
RED
(to Suttle)
You know how to operate the gadgets?
SUTTLE
Yessir.
RED
(to Suttle)
Grab a seat.
Suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck.
Sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an
armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for Red.
Saunders gently touches Red's shoulders; a final plea.
(CONTINUED)
28.

SAUNDERS
Please Red, I'm beggin'. I mean, what am
I suppose to tell the Governor?
Sally arrives but before she can spit out a word...
RED
Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked
me out on it.
Red whistles and the ENGINE REVS. Red closes the door as the
motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger
side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window.
SAUNDERS
Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle?
Not a scratch!
Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally.
She's
pissed and overloaded with files.
AIRSTREAM
about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop.
A second later
the door opens and the steps pop out.
Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door...
... LAUGHTER filters out of the Airstream.
The Airstream
moves another 20 feet then stops.
Sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out
of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously
forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. Again,
when she gets close...
...the Airstream moves. Sally, boiling mad as her coiffure
wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box
in anger.
The Airstream stops. LAUGHTER from inside and a
few AD LIBS,
i.e. -- "Okay, Okay." More LAUGHTER. Red steps
out the door,
turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and
comments stop
on a dime. Smiling slightly he turns to Sally,
moves straight
for the file box, picks it up and walks back to
the Airstream.
When he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to
Sally, who
stews and holds her ground.
RED
You comin' or not?
She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red,
grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him.

The IMPALA BLASTS along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows
as it heads into a one light township. It slows, however,
before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay
phone booth.
44
44
JERRY
Why the hell we stoppin'?
BUTCH
You said you had a cousin near here.
JERRY
So?
BUTCH
So give him a call. See if we can shack
there til' things cool down.
Jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe,
grabs the keys from the ignition. Then he laughs and crawls
out on his way to the phone booth.
(CONTINUED)
30.

CONTINUED:
44
In the b.g. we see Jerry strut to the phone booth and pore
through a thin directory. Phillip steals a glance at Butch,
who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth.
PHILLIP
Why'd he take the keys?
BUTCH
So I won't leave him.
PHILLIP
(a tad hopeful)
Would you leave him?
BUTCH
Oh yeah.
In the b.g. Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and
returns to the car, half pleased with himself. He tosses
the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off.
JERRY
Musta' moved. Prolly' couldn't have heard
'em anyway. Goddam ear's still bleedin'.
You ever try that shit again...
BUTCH
What?
JERRY
What?
BUTCH
You were in the middle of threatenin' me.
JERRY
(from the movies)
Ain't a threat. It's a fact.
Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the
steering wheel.
BUTCH
Here kid, take the wheel.
Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best
to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. Butch
turns back over the seat to confront Jerry.
BUTCH
In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose.
That's a threat...
(CONTINUED)
31.
44
CONTINUED:
(2)
44
Before Jerry has time to snicker Butch hits him full in the
face and grabs the gun. Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and
the injured man cups his hands over the wound.
Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip.
BUTCH
... And that's a fact.
Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the
seat wearing a look of pure hatred.
JERRY
I'm gonna' kill you for that.
BUTCH
And that's a threat. Beginnin' to
understand the difference?
Somethin' catches Butch's eye and he turns and slows down and
turns into...
45
45
The Impala brakes to a dusty stop near the front of the store,
which is bordered by a giant hay field.
46
53
Phillip, still sobbing, runs for his life in the hay, which
is a full foot taller than he.
JERRY
no longer stumbling, now grinning maniacally, gives chase,
whistling as if calling for a lost puppy.
JERRY
I'm gonna' find you boy.
You best come here.
PHILLIP
gun in hand, stumbles, falls, gets up, keeps running. He falls
again and crawls to a stop. He wipes his tears and balls up
on the ground trying to make himself invisible.
35.
54
54
Butch exits with a grocery sack. When he sees the car doors
open he dumps the groceries in the front seat and looks to
the field.
HIS POV
The hay rustles as Jerry moves through the field.
55
55
Jerry, crouching, moves through the field -- eyes peeled for
any sign of Phillip.
Phillip lies still. He hears the hay rustling near him and
he looks up, squares his body and points the revolver at...
Butch, who spots him, motions for him to stay put and holds
out his hand for the gun. Phillip hands it over and watches
while Butch reaches into the plaid jacket pocket, extracts a
few shells and loads the .38.
JERRY
a little frustrated now, but still moving forward.
JERRY
(a whisper)
Hey boy. Hey boy. You better hope I
don't find ya'.
He spots something -- a dash of color -- and begins to crawl
faster. He parts a thick batch of hay and looks up into the
gun barrel and eyes of ...
BUTCH
squatted down,
who levels the revolver and closes one eye.
Jerry laughs.
JERRY
Whatcha' gonna' do? Hit me with it?
Butch reaches into the coat pocket with his free hand and
shows a shell or two. Jerry's grin drops.
JERRY
(pleading)
Me'n you are friends!!!!
BUTCH
Thick as theives.
PHILLIP
hears a GUNSHOT and runs for his life back toward the store.
36.
56
56
Phillip runs to the car and hides behind the tire opposite the
store and field. In the b.g. we see Butch emerge from the
field and walk toward the car.
The Old Man, who also heard the shot, emerges from the store
with a baseball bat.
Butch arrives at the car, spots the Old
Man and levels the revolver at him. Phillip is relieved when
he hears Butch's voice instead of Jerry's.
BUTCH
(to Old Man)
You got a phone?
OLD MAN
Naw.
BUTCH
Then go inside and lie down til' we're gone.
The Old Man meekly does so. Butch goes to the car door, opens
it and motions to a frozen stiff Phillip.
BUTCH
Well... Get in.
57
57
The truck and Airstream barrel down the highway.
58
61
The RV slides to a stop in the gravel parking lot which is
full of state and local police. Red exits first, followed
by the others. A LOCAL SHERIFF walks up to greet.
RED
We got a positive I.D.?
LOCAL SHERIFF
Yessir, with only the boy as hostage. But
not five minutes ago we found something else.
62
62
PAN FROM a fingertip UP an arm and TO the face of Jerry Pugh.
A clean bullethole has left him with a third eye, a bloody
back and an entourage of late summer flies. We hear the
CLICK of a photographer's CAMERA.
BOOM UP TO Red, Local Sheriff and other bystanders.
RED
Least now we know who's in charge.
63
64
The Impala rests in the fork of a dirt road.
65
66
The Impala spins out, kicking dirt in all directions.
BUTCH (V.O.)
Yessir. Time travelin' through Texas! We
got to find us a Ford. My daddy always
drove Fords, you know that?
67
68
The Impala travels slowly along the road until it edges to a
stop by the entrance to a small farmhouse with a truck and
car parked in a long dirt driveway. A farmer on a combine
works a small field.
45.
69
70
Phillip, still in his skivvies, legs cut up and muddied from
his escape from Jerry, sneaks up to the car and quietly peers
into the open window.
The keys dangle when his small hand touches them.
Phillip closes the door, looks around and then runs pell-mell
to the passenger window of the Impala.
PHILLIP
It's got keys and a radio.
I checked.
BUTCH
Good man.
Phillip holds his crotch and stamps his feet.
PHILLIP
Can we stop at a fillin' station.
BUTCH
What for?
PHILLIP
Number one.
BUTCH
This here's nature, Phillip.
Pee in the
ditch.
Phillip scrambles to the ditch to relieve himself while Butch
steps out of the Impala, tosses the keys into the field and
walks toward the Ford.

The FARMER stops his tractor and notices Butch and Phillip.
Phillip, despite his prior urgency, is having trouble coaxing
relief.
Butch slides into the Ford, pumps the gas pedal and turns the
key. The ENGINE GRUMBLES and DIES.
The Farmer is walking now, slowly and then at a trot as he
realizes what's happening.
Phillip finally starts to pee.
Butch cranks again and again but the Ford is flooded.
BUTCH
Start, you sonofabitch!
The Farmer runs faster, comes closer...
FARMER
Hey, that's my car! Hey!!!
Butch floors the gas to clear the flood and the ENGINE finally
STARTS. He throws it into reverse and peels out backwards
into the road beside the ditch where Phillip continues to
relieve himself.
BUTCH
Get in the car, Phillip!
The Farmer, only 30 yards or so away, is racing toward them
madder than a wet hen.
Phillip tries to hurry but the RC continues to run through
him.
BUTCH
Phillip!
Get in the car!
Phillip pulls his underwear up and races to the car. He leaps
into the open passenger door at the same moment Butch steps on
the gas and the Farmer arrives and grabs onto the door as it
closes.
71
74
The Ford pulls off the dusty road and into the lone pump in
this dilapidated petrol mirage. A BUCK TOOTH BOY, 15, in
overalls steps to the window.
BOY
What can I do ya' for?
BUTCH
(to Phillip)
Tell him your name.
PHILLIP
Phillip.
BOY
Fill-er-up it is.
The attendant starts to pump the gas.
BUTCH
See there! All you gotta' do is say your
name and people are waiting on you hand
and foot. Like a goddam king or somethin'.
Phillip can't help but smile at the notion.
75

Bradley and Suttle lean against the parked RV, chatting.
BRADLEY
You responsible for engine maintenance
on this thing?
SUTTLE
Uh, yeah.
I'm the full time driver.

75
Bradley shakes his head.
"Too bad".
SUTTLE
What?
Why?
BRADLEY
You notice how it keeps
wanting to slip a
bit goin' into second.
Feels to me like
somebody's been a little
heavy-footed with
the clutch.
(beat)
I'd take care of that if
I was you.
PAN TO: an ambulance door opens and the Farmer, strapped in,
is rolled toward it as his wife, sobbing, attends to him.
Several local police scour the surrounding field, walking
four feet apart, looking for what they hope they won't find.
Red leans on the trunk of the Impala, chews and spits on the
ground. He sniffs the air. Unsavory. Adler strides up from
the field.
ADLER
No bodies this time, thank Gawd.
RED
You got the keys to this thing?
ADLER
Uh... naw...
RED
Get me a crowbar.
(to Sally)
You might wanna' wait in the boat.
SALLY
No thank you.

The Ford slides down the Main Street and into a side alley
next to a Department Store.

A local police car cruises slowly, spots the Ford parked in

Terrance pulls his black and white to one end of Main Street
and parks it across the street, blocking it.
TERRANCE
(into radio)
Okay, Pete, I'm all set down here.
You?
ANOTHER COP
PETE, 40, probably Terrance's uncle, slides his black and
white to the opposite end of the street and puts it in park.
PETE

Copasetic. Let's just keep him tied
up til' the state boys get here.

Butch exits the store, spots the blackandwhites, and slides
into the middle of a group of old-timers moving down the
sidewalk at a leisurely pace.

Butch slides away from the Old Timers and into the Ford.
90A
91
Butch throws the Ford into reverse and steps on the gas.
Pete not expecxting this kind of pace, at least not from the
get-go, leaps into his back seat.
The Ford rams into the black and white pushing it backward
into a lightpole and a truck. The TRUCK'S OWNER, carrying
mulch from the feed store, watches as his truck slides
toward him.

PETE (V.O.)

Get the hell outta' there. We can't
lose both vehicles!
TERRANCE'S POV - FORD
is GAINING ON him -- he can actually SEE Butch's grimaced face
-- when suddenly it goes into a dusty fishtail, does a 180,
and barrels in the OPPOSITE direction.
PHILLIP
antsy as hell, stuck, wondering how this whole thing is going
to play out. He's suddenly aware of the peering eyes behind
him. Lucy bangs on the glass.
LUCY
(yells)
Buzz! You little shit.
Shoplifting is
a crime!
BUTCH
checks his mirror, looks ahead, spots Phillip and blasts
straight for the front door of the store. He SKIDS to a halt
and stares right at Phillip.
BUTCH
Up to you, Buzz...
PHILLIP
He's frozen for a second, his knees knocking, teeth
chattering, the works. Lucy appears behind him and the
glass door...
LUCY

Two young, country boys stand by the side of the road. One,
FRANK, tosses an egg from hand to hand while he watches the
horizon. The other, BILLY, approaches, crawling through a
barb wire fence dragging something behind him.
FRANK
Hurry up.
Someone's comin'.
ON HORIZON
Sure enough, a hail of dust signals the approach of a vehicle
a mile or so away.
Billy crawls into the ditch next to Frank. We see what he's
dragged from the field -- a scarecrow with a floppy hat and
red bandana.
FRANK
Stick it in the road. Hurry up.
Billy does so, propping the scarecrow into a sitting position
with a forked stick. Then he races back to the ditch and
slides in next to Frank to divide the eggs.

FRANK
We got seven eggs. I get four to throw
and you get three... since it was my idea.
Billy nods.
FRANK
Here they come.
Aim for windows and get
ready to run.
The car crests the hill, followed by another, and another and
a final one, all Highway Patrol, all with their lights on and
SIRENS WAILING.
FRANK
Oh shit!
The cars don't even slow at the sight of the scarecrow, blast-
ing right through it, sending hay, hat, limbs and all, flying.
The scarecrow, or what's left of it, lands in a ditch next to
the boys. In unison they breathe a sigh of relief, look at
each other, drop the eggs and hightail it for home.

102
The four Highway Patrol VEHICLES from before BLAST past at
90+, sending stray dogs and roadrunners scurrying for cover.
CRANE
DOWN to reveal the Ford off the same roadside, but
behind
a burm in a field. As soon as the patrol cars pass,
Butch
STARTS up the ENGINE and humps it to the road and off

The Ford makes a sharp veer off the road into a flat scrub
brush field. The car spins out a bit when it hits the dirt
sending forth a dust devil, then it regains its traction and
blasts ahead through the dust.

The truck, in an attempt to enter the field, misses the flat
spot, hits a burm with its front right tire and flies into
the air.

The Airstream veers off the road and into the rocky field.
Trees, scrub brush and boulders are no deterrent for the
sleek silverfish which seems to be moving even faster than
before.

The TRUCK BLASTS into a mesquite tree, runs halfway up
the tree, then dies a horrible death.
111P
The Airstream, now losing a bit of steam, hits a burm, almost
topples and comes to a precarious stop in a dried-up watering
hole.
115A
The Airstream, the amazingly futuristic piece of law
enforcement equipment sits beat to hell and leaning to one
side in the dry pond bed. All the tires are flat and dents
and bruises abound. The door tries to open but is stuck.
Red applies a boot to it and the whole thing comes off its
hinges and flies to the ground. Red exits. He groans and
shakes his head when he spots...
Bradley and Suttle limping toward him across the field.
Red sighs and starts slowly walking in the direction Butch
and Phillip headed.

Standing in the middle of the field, staring at the horizon.
He sticks a chaw in his mouth without diverting or blinking

BUTCH
It's up to you, Phillip. We can backtrack
to the highway or we can try it on foot.
PHILLIP
Where we goin'?
Butch reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a folded
postcard. He hands it over to Phillip.
INSERT - CARD
It's at least 20 years old, crumpled. It unfolds to reveal a
beautiful green valley with a snow capped mountain behind it.

BUTCH
It's Alaska, Phillip. Last of the wild
frontier.
PHILLIP
It's pretty.
BUTCH
It's beautiful!
PHILLIP

anyhoo, back to our present dilemma. You

Typical midwest Texas; flat, dusty, barren.
A mile or so

Phillip returns with the bag and pores through it.
BUTCH
How's it look?
PHILLIP
A soda... some gum... half a Moon Pie.

Butch continues his hell-bent brisk pace in the field of dirt
clods. It's all Phillip can do to keep up.
PHILLIP
Where we goin'?
BUTCH
We're goin' trick r' treatin', Phillip.
Phillip stops dead in his tracks. Butch, sensing that the boy
is no longer following, stops, spins and faces Phillip.
BUTCH
What?
PHILLIP
We ain't allowed to trick r' treat.
BUTCH
Huh?
PHILLIP
My mama don't allow it.
BUTCH
Trick r' treatin'? Why not?
PHILLIP
Against our religion.

Butch and Phillip cross the dirt yard and make their way to

Ok, Phillip, all ya' gotta' do is knock

'trick or treat.' Got it?
They arrive at the door.
Butch nods at Phillip who RINGS the

A FARM WIFE, 65 or so, like something from a Grant Wood, only
smiling, opens the door and looks out on the pair through the
screen door.

Trick r' treat.

The Woman returns with an armload of anything she could find
in the kitchen. Phillip gratefully opens his sack and watches
as the Woman drops in a loaf of bread, a jar of mustard,
candies, jams, butter and anything else she could find.
Empty-handed she reaches inside the door, opens her purse and
dumps her money -- a couple of dollars and lots of change into
the bag.
Phillip smiles.

Phillip, sack in hand, waves goodbye to the frightened old
Woman, who shuts her door and locks it.

He jumps in the Driver's seat of the WAGON and frantically

gains control of the wheel and steers the rapidly reversing
Ford around the Wagon.
FORD
continues backwards to the bottom of the hill, but it has
enough steam built up to head backwards up the other incline
of the previous hill.
BUTCH

He drops the gun into the well, catches his breath and heads
for the road.
After a few yards he has a thought, runs back to the
station wagon, grabs the keys and throws them as far into
the adjacent field as he can. Then he resumes his race for
the road.
186
187
Butch emerges and stumbles out.
BUTCH
(to the horizon)
Phillip?!...
No answer. He drags himself to the station wagon and, with
much effort, slides himself into the seat. No keys. He
opens the door, crawls out, leaving a trail of blood, looks
out to the road and starts to walk.
PHILLIP
runs down the road, looking back every so often to see if
Butch is following

makes his way onto the private dirt and starts walking back
toward the main road.
BUTCH
(yelling)
Phillip?!! I won't hurt ya', I swear!
PHILLIP
is running out of steam on the road ahead.
He stops for a
blow and looks back.
HIS POV
A few hundred yards back, Butch struggles forward.
BACK TO SCENE
Phillip crawls through the ditch beside the road and
squeezes through a barb wire fence.
His costume hangs on a barb. He rips away from the fence
leaving a foot-long strand behind.
In the b.g. -- a pickup truck drives by.
188
190
Butch, holding his side, the pain is worse as he stumbles
along.
He stops when he spots something -- a piece of white
costume on the fence. He crosses the ditch, steps through
the fence and walks in the same direction Phillip did.
BUTCH
That was a helluva' thing to do, Phillip.
You're a hero. Prolly' be in all the
papers tomorrow, how you saved those
folks. Truth is, I don't think I woulda'
killed 'em. I only killed two people in
my whole life. One hurt my mama and one
hurt you.
191
192
Butch follows Phillip's path through the field.
BUTCH
What say we talk this over? Settle
things man to man. Then we can be on
our way. I'll even let you drive. Knock
that right off yer' list. How'd that be?
PHILLIP
finally arrives at the creek, looking over
his shoulder all
the way. He looks at the water -- deep and
running swift.
Where to go? He decides and heads for the
nearest tree --
a big oak, and shimmies up to a branch ten
feet or so above
the ground.

193

A country cop answering the report, drives slowly down the
road, his pistol drawn and held upright in one hand. He
pulls into Mack's driveway and parks. Arch walks out of
the house to greet him.
ARCH
That's his car. Took off on foot. He's
got a pistol. Mack says it looks like a
.38.
194

Butch stops to rest.
Something catches his eye.
HIS POV
A white figure moves slightly in the boughs of an oak tree.
Phillip tries to climb higher but can't reach the next limb.
BACK TO SCENE
Butch walks underneath the tree without even looking at
Phillip. He sits down to rest.
BUTCH
Alaska, Phillip.
Wild and wooley. Man
against nature.
Me personally, I like
them odds.
(beat)
Did I tell you my
daddy lives there?
He's the one that
sent the picture
postcard. Listen
here to what he says
about it...
Butch pulls the postcard from his back pocket and reads...
BUTCH
(reading)
'Dear Robert'... that's my real name,
Phillip. Robert. Jus' like old Bob the
family man. 'Dear Robert, I just wanted
to tell you that me leaving has nothing
to do with you.'
Phillip, still afraid, can't help but listen as Butch
suffers through his memories.
BUTCH
(reading)
'Alaska is a beautiful place.
Colder
than hell most all the time.

BUTCH (CONT'D)
Someday you can come and visit and we'll
maybe get to know each other better.'
Short and sweet. That's the old man's
style. 'Cold all the time' -- like that's
a big sellin' point.
He laughs to himself.
BUTCH
He useta' pat me on the head and tell
folks 'that it's some that can live life
without askin' about it and it's others
has to know why, and this boy here is
one of the latters.'
(beat)
That's why I wanted to go up there. To
visit the old man, I guess. Prolly'
punch him one first, but then maybe we'd
end up bein' friends, sit down, have a
beer, talk things over....
Butch groans. He pulls his hand from his side. Blood is
oozing all over the place. He returns the postcard to
his pocket.
BUTCH
We'll jus' rest awhile. Then you
can make up yer' mind. How's that?
Phillip, still clinging to the tree, can't help but feel
compassion for his friend.
195
195
A dozen Highway Patrol cars now sit in the driveway. The
Fed in charge, AGENT HENDRICKS, assigns different officers
to secure the area in an incredibly organized fashion.
Mack, Lottie, Cleve and Arch watch from the porch.
196
196
Butch's eyes are closed. A small puddle of blood drips
and becomes a rivulet running down into the creek.
Phillip, still in the tree, still watching, can't bear it
any longer. He slowly climbs down and drops next to Butch,
who opens his eyes to the boy and smiles.
BUTCH
One thing's for sure now -- I definitely
believe in ghosts.

Never been shot before.

PHILLIP
I'm sorry.
BUTCH
I know ya' are. Truth is, if it had to
happen, I'm glad it was you. As opposed
to someone I don't know, I mean. All
things considered, I feel pretty good,
though. Could use a beer, though.
PHILLIP
What's beer taste like?
BUTCH
Oh, it's about the best thing there is.
You'd better put that on the list.
Phillip's eye catches something.
He stands up fearfully...
HIS POV - TWO MORE PATROL CARS
lights spinning, rushing down the road, kicking up dust.

Sally watches Red. When the car comes to a stop, she
reaches out and touches his arm.
SALLY
I think our chances of this thing ending
peacefully are good.
He smiles a lonesome smile, opens the door and exits.
198

Phillip kneels back down to Butch.
PHILLIP
You better run.
BUTCH
Naw, Phillip, I need me a time machine
with a loud radio to take me where I'm
goin'. Walkin's for squares.

Red exits his patrol car, followed by Sally.
Agent
Hendricks walks up.

RED
Yeah.
You got the area quadroned off?
HENDRICKS
Water tight. Like a frog's pussy.
(notices Sally)
Sorry, ma'am.
SALLY
No doubt an observation based on personal
experience.
Red can't help but smile.
RED
You got him spotted?
HENDRICKS
By the creek, half-mile down the road.
I spaced officers in a circle around them
100 yards or so away.
RED
You got any problem with me handling this
one?
HENDRICKS
What say we both handle it?
Red sighs.
RED
Let's head on down there.
Bradley, gimme'
a megaphone.
HENDRICKS
One other thing, Chief. Haynes is wounded.
The boy gut-shot him.
RED
Yer' shittin' me.

Phillip scoops a handful of water and brings it to Butch,
who opens his mouth and drinks, A megaphoned voice
interrupts...
RED (V.O.)

Butch, this is Red Garnett of the
Texas State Police.
A thin, knowing smile crosses Butch's lips.

RED (V.O.)
I know yer' hurt. We've got damn near
100 armed men here. Take a look around
and you'll see I'm shootin' ya' straight.
BUTCH
(yelling back)
All this for me. I'm touched, but I'm
afraid ya'll gonna' have to back it up a
step or two. I'm headed to Mexico.
(to Phillip)
Lyin' to 'em, of course.
201
201
Red leans against a patrol car, accompanied closely by Adler,
Sally and Hendricks.
RED
(into megaphone)
Hate
to tell ya', Butch, but yer' headed
the
wrong direction. Tell ya' what.
You
let the boy go and we'll talk about
it.
Discuss it over a cold beer.
202
202
BUTCH
(to Phillip)
Beer. What'd I tell ya'.
(to Red)
Appreciate the offer, Cap'n, but ya'
know I can't do that. If you and yer'
pals back outta' here, I'll drop the boy
at the border.
(beat)
If you don't I'll shoot him in the
head. I mean it!
Phillip, betrayed beyond comprehension, stares at Butch.
BUTCH
(to Phillip)
Don't look at me like that. I don't
even have a gun. What did ya' do with
the pistola' anyway?
PHILLIP
Threw it in the well.
BUTCH
Good thinkin'.

203
203
ADLER
Ya' think he means it?
Red mulls it over, replaces his old chaw with a fresh one
and looks to Sally.
RED
What do you think?
SALLY
Based on what's happened the past two
days I don't think he would.
RED
One thing's for sure. If he gets outta'
here with the boy, we're right back to
where we started.
BRADLEY
If he kills the boy he'll get the chair.
ADLER
Shit, he'll get the chair anyway.
He's
killed two in two days.
SALLY
We don't know that he pulled the trigger
on either of the innocent victims.
ADLER
Well he wasn't at home in his Strat-O-
Lounger. 'Sides, who killed Pugh?
Casper?
RED
All right, both of you, that's enough!
From the trail of blood I got a feelin'
it ain't gonna' make any difference.
Let's jus' concentrate on gettin' the
boy out for now.
Bobby Lee approaches with a leather case, bypasses Red and
goes straight to Hendricks.
BOBBY LEE
Where ya' want me, sir?
RED
Can you shoot off a hood?
Bobby Lee nods.
In the b.g., a HELICOPTER circles, preparing to land.

Butch and Phillip watch the helicopter land.
BUTCH
See, Phillip, dreams do come true.
There's yer' rocketship.
PHILLIP
Think I'll get to ride it?
BUTCH
Today's the day.
RED (V.O.)
(megaphoned)
Butch, we got the boy's Mama here.
She wants to say something.
Phillip is visibly stunned by the news. He crawls up to
the crest of the creekside and squints, looking for his
mom.
BUTCH
What's wrong, Phillip?
PHILLIP
It's my mama.
Phillip still cranes his neck to see.
BUTCH
Now that ya' got yerself a ghost suit,
do ya' think she'll let ya' trick r'
treat?
PHILLIP
(better than none)
I got to do one house.
Butch smiles.
He has an idea.
BUTCH
Put yer' mask back on.

Bobby Lee carefully unsnaps the latches on his leather case
and opens it on the hood of the patrol car.

Inside is... a high-powered military rifle in three parts.
Hands unzip a velvetine bag and pull out a high-powered
scope.
Bobby Lee holds the lens of the scope to his mouth, blows a
breath on it and wipes it clean with a piece of clean
cloth. He feels eyes and turns to see...
Sally, watching him at work.
Bobby Lee smiles at her, cocksure.
His dark role in this
manhunt is now perfectly clear.
Sally turns her head, disgusted.
Gladys Perry, frazzled, somewhat in shock, is ushered
forward. She's handed the MEGAPHONE. She fumbles with it,
pushes the button. It SQUAWKS LOUDLY.
RED
Jus' push the button and talk normal.
It SQUAWKS again.
RED
Here, I'll hold the damn thing.
You jus' talk.
GLADYS
(into megaphone)
Hullo... Hullo. Please, sir, he's my
only son. I'll give you money, whatever
I can. Please, I want to take my boy
home! I want to...
The MEGAPHONE SQUALKS one final dying time and SHORTS OUT.
Red hands it to Bradley, who immediately sets it on the
trunk and starts taking it apart.
RED
(to Gladys)
Yer' doin' fine. We'll get another one.
BRADLEY
I think yer' tobacco spit shorted it
out, Red.

This one's shot.
RED
Well, find another one!
Red sighs and cups his hands around his mouth.
RED

What?!
BUTCH

Candy! Halloween candy! Popcorn balls,
caramel apples, gum, shit like that?!

You hungry?

You find me some candy and I'll

Red nods to Adler who starts to gather sticks of gum,
mints, anything from the surrounding officers.
BRADLEY

the hood of the car and places one eye behind the scope of
his rifle.

BUTCH

One more thing. His old lady has to

every year.
Phillip strains to look for his mom.
He's upset, ready to
leave.
BUTCH
Gimme' yer' list, Phillip.
PHILLIP
Butch?...
BUTCH
Gimme that list.
Phillip pulls it out. Butch snatches it and reads it to
himself, laughing. He's on a death roll of sorts, between
losing blood and being in an impossible situation he almost
seems to be enjoying the macabre scenario as it unfolds.
Phillip, on the other hand, is beginning to sob.
BUTCH
(yells)
And she's gotta promise to take him to
the fair for rollercoasters and cotton
candy whenever he wants... or at least
once a year...
PHILLIP
I wanna' go home!...

And when he gets older he gets to drink
beer...

Not on the list, but you'll thank me
later for that little addition.

Done that, got to drive, gonna' ride that
rocketship. That's about it.

She's gotta' promise or I won't let him

Red, exasperated, he can't believe how weird this has
gotten.
RED

It's a deal!
BUTCH

Make her say it!
Red looks to Gladys as if to say, "go ahead".
She seems
reluctant. Red's frustration is showing.

210
Phillip is near tears.
He rises and starts to move for the field, but Butch grabs
him with one arm, pulls him close and holds him like he's
his own child.
PHILLIP
I jus' wanna' go home.
BUTCH

Know jus' how ya' feel, Phillip.

Red gives her a look that says, "Say it or deal with me".
GLADYS

I promise!

BUTCH

Can we trust her?
PHILLIP
She's a real good mama.
Butch reaches into his pocket, extracts the remaining wad
of stolen bills, unzips the Casper outfit, stuffs them
into the costume and rezips.
BUTCH
(to Phillip)
When you get home, hide this. If
she's lyin' you can buy yer' own damn
beer.
Phillip quiets for a moment and stares at Butch.
PHILLIP
Yer' not bad, are you, Butch?
BUTCH
Yeah.

Butch nods and smiles.
BUTCH

Butch nudges Phillip and the boy starts toward the field.

Gladys, near shock, AD LIBS commands to Phillip. "Come on
honey," "Phillip, keep walking," that kind of thing.
(NOTE: Her commands become more and more shrieking and
frantic and continue throughout, giving rise to even more
confusion than is already present.)
216

Phillip turns back and sees ...
Butch -- He tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for
it, but his strength is gone. He collapses.
Phillip, standing still, with his mother's shrieks filling
the air behind him, watches Butch for a second then runs
back toward him.

Red sighs and lowers the binocs.

Phillip stands before a struggling Butch.

Personally I think we negotiated a pretty

Keep him locked down.
Don't squeeze til'

Red holds Bobby Lee's eyes until the young Fed nods.
Then
Red unstraps his holster and moves between the cars.
HENDRICKS
Where the hell you going?
But Red's not listening, just walking, long and tall, into
the field.
Butch and Phillip continue to walk, Butch holding Phillip's
hand. When Butch spots Red approaching he slows and then
stops.
Red shows his palms and keeps walking toward them.
When
he gets within 25 feet he stops.

Sally realizes it's not a gun that Butch is reaching for.
SALLY
Noooooo...!!!!
FINGER ON TRIGGER

Butch's chest explodes when the bullet hits him. He rocks
backwards, still on his knees... and looks at Phillip in

Phillip moans, sobs, as he watches Butch, the GUNSHOT still
ECHOING.
AT ROADSIDE
Gladys runs from behind the car, followed by a host of
officers.
HENDRICKS
Keep everybody back!
Bobby Lee stands, lowers his rifle disengages and smiles at
Hendricks.
BOBBY LEE
No need to worry.
He can't hurt nobody
now.
IN FIELD
Red stands frozen, staring, in another world. An OFFICER
trots up to Butch and does a careful ground frisk.
OFFICER

No weapon, Chief!
Red "comes to," turns and walks toward the...
ROADSIDE
Red walks
up to Bobby Lee, stops and stares at the grinning
marksman.
After a beat, Red turns then nearly jumps out of
shoes with
a sudden right cross that floors the younger man.
Red starts
to jump in for more but Hendricks, stunned, jumps
in, grabs
Red and, joined by four other Officers, holds the
older man
back. Shouting, i.e. "Hey, hey, Red, whoa, whoa!"
Red settles a bit. Hendricks turns to Bobby Lee who rises
to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip, and then to Red who
is still breathing hard.

He stares at his old friend and
boss as they walk along.
ADLER
I thought he had a gun, too, Red.
There

Red doesn't even look at Adler, just keeps walking.
Adler
stops, his eyes following Red.
Sally, nearby, watches Red walk away.
PHILLIP
is helped to his feet by his mother. She holds him dearly
to her chest. He hugs back just as hard, his blood-stained
Casper outfit staining her blouse. She unzips the costume
and dollar bills fly all around. She starts to lead
Phillip off but he won't leave until...
He pulls the postcard from Butch's hand.

Staring down at Butch.
CLOSEUP - BUTCH
His eyes flutter a bit with recognition.
AT PATROL CAR
Red leans against the car.
After a few seconds Sally walks

leans against the car. After a few more seconds.

You did everything you could.

Red reaches into his pocket, pulls out his tobacco and
stuffs a chunk into his mouth.
IN FIELD - CLOSEUP - BUTCH
He licks his lips as the MUFFLED VOICES CONTINUE around
him. He squints hard and sees:
HELICOPTER
as it lifts off and speeds away.
As it wipes the sun...
CLOSEUP - BUTCH
A slight smile crosses his dying face as he squints to
see Phillip's flight.
CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
Nose pressed against the glass bubble.
BUTCH
His eyes don't close, still squinted but frozen.
CLOSEUP - EYES
We realize now, are lifeless.
BUZZARD
continues its flight past the sun.
SUN
flares, SENDING the SCREEN TO:
MILKY WHITE IMAGE
that opened the film.
FADE TO BLACK.
