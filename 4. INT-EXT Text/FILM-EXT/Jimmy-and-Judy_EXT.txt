Camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy
runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea
that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight.
She's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely
miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids
pass her.
Suddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks
over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns
red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face.
We can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's
cruel, harsh, and very intense. Exhausted and humiliated,
Judy holds back tears as...
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
2.
I/E. JIMMY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD/KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DUSK
Late summer evening. Camera Operator wipes dirt from the
lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as
he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a
glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a
bit awkward, but not at all unappealing.
He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles
his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing
it at the back of his house.
Through the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother
(JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new
millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone,
preparing dinner.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing
the nasty last night. Thanks for
that one. By the way, who the fuck
is Nancy?
Camera whips over to JIMMY'S DAD in the LIVING ROOM, well
dressed, rich looking and fat in his late 40's, watching
baseball on TV, tired after a long day's work. He drinks
from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube,
munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling
her friends that you're hung like a
light switch.
Dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch.
Jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes
the reach and... yes! Both balls
at the same time! One heck of a
double play!
Eyes on the TV, Dad takes his hands out of his pants and
sniffs them.
JIMMY (O.C.)
And the sniff to finish it off.
Satisfied, Dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he
continues to watch TV. We zoom out to see both Mom and Dad,
each through different windows.
3.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Fucking freak show.
CAMERA ON:
DAY
Someone (Jimmy) has placed the camera on the ground and is
facing a car in a parking lot at school.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(in bedroom)
That's Mrs. Holzclaw's car. She's
your P.E. teacher, right? I hated
her too.
Jimmy enters frame and punches a Butterfly Knife into the
sidewall of Mrs. Holzclaw's car sending air HISSING as the
tire sinks.
12.
JIMMY (O.C.)
And Bill McAllister... I went to
school with his brother. They're
both dicks.
Tape cuts to...
On TV, hidden camera style (long lens from a distance) the
Dumb Looking Bully Type (Bill McAllister) is taken out of
school in cuffs into a waiting Squad Car.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(in bedroom)
I planted an ounce of weed in his
locker then sent an anonymous
letter to Principal Lipsky.
Same location, different day. On TV, again hidden camera
style, a girl is being rolled out of the school on a
stretcher. It's the Mean Girl, the one who smacked Judy in
the face with her school bag.
She's placed into an ambulance.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I took care of her too.
Jimmy clicks the television set off with his remote.
END JIMMY'S REVENGE TAPE
Judy films Jimmy as he FIRES a twelve gage pump action shot
gun off into the distance. After each shot he pumps then
FIRES again.
JIMMY
Are you getting this?
No response.
Jimmy FIRES another shot. His muscles are flexing as he
pumps the gage. He looks extremely violent and determined.
JIMMY
Come on.
Are you getting this?
A very turned off Judy replies.
JUDY (O.C.)
This is where you wanted to take
me?
JIMMY
Yeah, what's the matter?
We can hear Judy crying.
The camera shakes out of control.
32.
JUDY (O.C.)
I wanna go home.
Jimmy looks over towards the camera/Judy. He knows that he's
fucked up and he feels like complete shit.
Jimmy walks over to her, takes the camera and shuts it off.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy has the camera and is chasing a naked (just from
behind) Judy through the woods. The camera shakes and
rattles, but we can definitely tell this is all in good fun.
Judy screams as she is being chased through the woods.
She
couldn't feel more free.
She begins to tire and slows down. She can no longer run and
turns towards the camera. As she turns around, camera shows
her from the waist up. She has a beer can in her hand and
she is a little drunk.
For the first time, she's completely at ease with her own
body and looks perfectly natural being naked in the
wilderness. She walks towards the camera smoothly and
seductively. Her long hair blond hair blows gently in the
wind.
JUDY
I'm so glad you're out. Next time
your dad wants to take it in the
ass, DON'T FILM HIM!
41.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I know. Ironic that I was the one
sent to the nut house.
JUDY
I thought I was going to die
without you. What if you and I
could live here together? Forever.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Right here?
JUDY
I'm serious. Maybe not here, but
eventually we'll buy some land, and
we can live together on it, and be
naked whenever we want.
She takes a big swig of her beer.
Then burps.
JUDY
Excuse me.
What do you think?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I think you're drunk.
Judy walks towards the camera.
She puts her mouth inches
away from the lens.
JUDY
I think you're right mister.
Judy giggles, then dances around playfully in the woods.
She
has never felt so alive.
JUDY
I don't want this to ever end. I
want to be here forever. I want to
dance and be naked and be free, and
I want us to ball our brains out
everyday, and I want to feel the
air on my body and I want to get
drunk and not care about anything
in the world. I just want us to be
together in this moment.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I know a place like that.
JUDY
You do?
42.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yep. We can go there one day if
you want.
JUDY
We can?
Where is it?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Erlanger.
JUDY
(doesn't buy it)
Erlanger!
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yeah Erlanger. Everybody was
talking about it in the nut house.
That's ALL anybody fucking talked
about was this dude who lives up
there named Uncle Rodney. He
supposedly has a commune where we
can do this kind of thing every
day.
JUDY
Uncle Rodney's commune?
Judy smiles, almost laughing. It all sounds pretty
ridiculous to her, but plays along anyway.
JUDY
That's funny.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(playfully)
No, I'm serious.
Judy walks back towards the camera and grabs it away from
Jimmy, surprising him.
JIMMY
Hey!
JUDY (O.C.)
Okay, now it's your turn.
Shot from the waist up, we now see that Jimmy's naked as
well. He's at a loss as to what he should say.
JUDY (O.C.)
How does it feel to be a free man?
Jimmy thinks.
A drunk Judy is losing her patience.
43.
JUDY (O.C.)
Come on, come on, come on...
JIMMY
I'm thinking.
JUDY (O.C.)
Just let it go, be free.
JIMMY
(adoringly)
You're such a hippie all of sudden.
JUDY (O.C.)
Come on.
JIMMY
No.
Judy's not getting what she wants from him.
Camera shuts
down.
CAMERA ON:
Judy films Jimmy. The camera is close and intimate as they
lie on their sides staring into each other's eyes. Judy is
still naked, but is being shot in an extreme close up.
JUDY (O.C.)
Okay, go.
Jimmy's still not up for it.
Judy grabs the camera and turns
it on him.
JUDY (O.C.)
Come on!
Jimmy's turns the tables.
JIMMY
Okay, you really wanna hear
something?
JUDY (O.C.)
Yeah.
Jimmy takes a deep breath, a touch of intensity flashes in
his eye, then...
44.
JIMMY
I want to go one day without
masturbating. I want to liberate
my penis. I want to clone you so
we could have a three way and
neither of us would be cheating. I
want you to scrape my balls with a
cheese grater...
Judy starts laughing.
The camera's shaking.
JUDY (O.C.)
That's gross!
Jimmy suddenly gets serious.
JIMMY
And I love you. I love you so much
it hurts.
JUDY (O.C.)
It hurts?
JIMMY
Like God is stabbing me in heart
with a thousand knives at the same
time and you're the only one who
can make the pain go away. Do you
love me that much?
JUDY (O.C.)
I love you so much, I'd rather die
than be without you.
JIMMY
Here.
Jimmy grabs the camera and points it at Judy.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Make me a promise... the way a
husband and wife make a promise...
that we will be together always and
forever.
JUDY
You mean get married?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Something more powerful than
marriage. It's a bond. It's our
bond. It's transcendental.
45.
JUDY
What?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Transcendental.
(grabs the camera)
Here.
Jimmy hands Judy the camera as she starts to frame him up,
but they're really engaging each other's eyes over the top of
the eyepiece.
JIMMY
It's transcendental because it
transcends everything. Life, love,
law, people, things... A bond so
strong that our souls will become
one and it can never end, even in
death. If you swear on the bond,
it means you'd rather die than
break your promise.
Judy is moved.
JUDY (O.C.)
That's so beautiful.
JIMMY
You're so beautiful.
I want to
love you forever.
JUDY (O.C.)
Swear on the bond. Swear we'll be
together forever, that you'd rather
die than be apart.
JIMMY
I swear on the bond.
JUDY (O.C.)
And we'll never let anything come
between us, not even death.
JIMMY
Not even death. I swear. Nothing
will come between us, ever.
Jimmy stares at her, then slowly leans in for a kiss... a
long, wet, toe curling kiss. Jimmy finds a way to point the
camera at the kiss.
46.
They break apart. Judy sighs, staring into Jimmy's eyes,
then leans into him, his lips touching her forehead, their
eyes closing as they feel the energy of true love.
JUDY
We'll be together forever.
JIMMY
(whispers)
Together forever.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
Jimmy and Judy sit in a parked car outside of a huge grocery
store.
Jimmy and Judy sit outside a small grocery store. Jimmy
films himself. Judy's in the passenger seat. He does his
best news announcer impersonation.
JIMMY
This is action ten news reporter
Jimmy Van Muffmuncher reporting to
you live from the parking lot of
Dick's grocery store where we're
going to witness the beautiful, the
talented, the amazing Judy, commit
her first crime.
Jimmy flips the camera around onto Judy.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Is there anything you would like to
say to the public and your adoring
fans before you go through with
this?
Judy gleefully plays along.
JUDY
Well Mr. Van Muffmuncher. I just
want to say that I look forward to
losing, my, um...
Judy pauses to think.
JUDY
What did you call it before?
47.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Your conformist crimeless
virginity.
Judy snaps back into her role as interviewee.
JUDY
Yes, I am very much looking forward
to losing my conformist crimeless
virginity. I would also like to
share with my fans these.
Judy lifts up her shirt and exposes her bra to the camera.
JIMMY (V.O.)
(in his reporter voice)
Thank you and thank your tits for
this rare, behind the scenes look
at your first crime slash moment of
truth.
Judy leans in pops a quick kiss at the lens of the camera.
Jimmy shuts it down.
CAMERA ON:
Judy is looking at the lens of the camera.
She's shaking and
screaming.
JUDY
What is the matter with you Jimmy?
You almost got us caught. You're
so worried about that camera. What
is it? What is it!
Jimmy calmly and quietly explains.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Twenty years from now, when we're
together watching these tapes
you'll realize how special this
moment is. I owe it to you. And I
owe it to us to capture everything
and anything we do together.
Judy is calmed but still is pissed.
JUDY
Well you freak me out sometimes.
Why do you have to tape everything?
It's like you have a problem or
something.
Judy's case isn't sticking.
She treads lightly.
49.
JUDY
You know, most of the reason kids
think you're so weird is because of
it. Why do you think everybody
makes fun of you? And then I have
to hear it and I have to deal with
it.
JIMMY (O.C.)
So everybody makes fun of me, huh?
JUDY
Yeah. Can't you give the thing a
fucking rest?
Jimmy's fuming.
JIMMY (O.C.)
And you don't want to deal with it?
Well fuck them and fuck you too if
you think that. I couldn't give a
fuck what people say. This is my
life and I want to document it.
And right now me filming you
happens to be the only reason I
manage to get out of my fucking bed
every morning! You can't take this
away from me!
Jimmy starts crying.
Judy takes the camera. She tapes Jimmy who is sobbing. Now
she is the one who speaks gently. She's trying to give him a
taste of his own medicine.
JUDY (O.C.)
How does it feel Jimmy? How does
it feel to have someone taping you
while you're crying?
Jimmy doesn't answer.
He tries to compose himself enough to
speak.
Judy pushes harder.
JUDY (O.C.)
Tell me. Look at the camera and
tell me how it feels!
JIMMY
You're not getting it. It doesn't
matter how it feels right now.
(MORE)
50.
JIMMY (cont'd)
What matters is that you're seeing
what's inside of me and your taping
it. Can you understand that?
Judy doesn't know how to respond.
JIMMY
Can you?
JUDY (O.C.)
I don't know.
JIMMY
Well can you at least try?
Jimmy is still crying.
This weighs on her.
JUDY (O.C.)
Yes.
I can most definitely try.
JIMMY
And you can never, ever, ever ask
me to not film you or anything we
do. That's the only thing I'll
ever ask of you. Agreed?
JUDY (O.C.)
Okay.
I'm sorry.
JIMMY
Will you swear to it?
On camera,
will you swear to it?
Jimmy has talked himself into a good mood.
Before we hear
Judy's response, we...
JUMP CUT TO:
I/E. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
Moments later, Jimmy is now taping Judy. She has her right
hand up, like a witness about to be sworn into the stand.
She's all smiles as Jimmy gives her the oath to repeat back
to him.
JAMES (O.C.)
Please raise your right hand.
Judy raises her right hand.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Please repeat after me.
I Judy...
51.
JUDY
I Judy...
JIMMY (O.C.)
Do hereby solemnly swear...
JUDY
Do hereby solemnly swear...
JIMMY (O.C.)
That I will never ask, request, or
even insinuate to Jimmy to cease
filming, no matter the situation.
JUDY
That I will never ask, request, or
even insinuate to Jimmy to cease
filming, no matter the situation.
JIMMY (O.C.)
And furthermore, I do hereby
solemnly swear to commit myself to
giving Jimmy his daily blowjob and
will continue to perform various
sex acts with the skill and
enthusiasm that he has become
accustomed to.
Judy laughs, then screams with embarrassed excitement.
Her
laughter and happiness is infectious.
She pounds her fists on the dashboard and laughs again.
We can hear Jimmy laughing off camera as well.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Keep your right hand up.
Judy lifts her right hand back up.
She looks at the camera
with a huge smile.
JUDY
I do hereby solemnly swear to g...
THWACK! Someone has thrown a full soda can on the hood of
Jimmy's car. He pans and zooms the camera over and sees a
car full of Three Teenagers laughing at them.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Mother fuckers.
Suddenly the TEENAGE DRIVER of the car appears, as if out of
nowhere, running to the passenger side. Jimmy zooms out.
52.
The frame catches up to him just as he spits a huge LOOGIE
into the car, hitting Judy right in the face.
Judy screams. The car full of Three Teenagers laugh
hysterically at her expense.
Jimmy hands Judy the camera.
JIMMY
Here, you're definitely going to
want to tape this.
Jimmy calmly gets out of his car as Judy tapes him through
the window. We can hear her breathing heavily as she tries
not to cry softly off camera.
Jimmy has gone to the rear of the car. We hear the trunk
open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full
of laughing teens. Jimmy enters the frame carrying a
baseball bat.
We see him talking calmly to the driver of the car, the Kid
who spat in Judy's face. Then...
WHAM!
Jimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with
the bat. The Kid falls over into the front seat of the car.
Jimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins
bashing in the windshield.
JUDY (O.C.)
(to herself)
Oh my God.
Now rage has taken over Jimmy over entirely.
He's bashing in
the windshield with all of his might.
The teenagers all go running from the car.
A crowd starts to
form in the parking lot.
JUDY (O.C.)
(to herself)
Oh, God Jimmy...
Jimmy has now completely bashed in the windshield and moves
to the front of the car. He now begins smashing the other
windows.
Now a sizeable crowd is formed. Jimmy is seemingly oblivious
to them and continues bashing the car.
53.
JUDY (O.C.)
(to herself)
I love you Jimmy.
Now it's to the point of overkill. But Jimmy won't stop.
It's as if the rage he's been carrying inside of him his
entire life is now coming to the surface.
We hear sirens in the distance as Jimmy continues to bash the
car. The car is in near shambles as we hear police sirens in
the distance.
Judy begins screaming.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy stop, please stop. Jimmy...
oh god, Jimmy stop. God damn it,
fucking stop!
Jimmy doesn't. He pounds the car harder as a police cruiser
pulls up. Two policemen get out of the car. They are
temporarily paralyzed with indecision.
We see one of the officers trying to speak with Jimmy. He
just ignores them. The policemen are oblivious to the fact
they are being filmed.
One of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in
Jimmy's face.
Now Jimmy is completely freaking out. We hear him scream,
but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed. One
of the cops draws his gun as Jimmy swings aimlessly towards
them. He gets sprayed again with the mace and is now
completely blinded. A huge crowd has now amassed outside of
the grocery store.
JUDY (O.C.)
Oh, God Jimmy, oh God...
Now the entire parking lot is filled with cop cars. Lights
are flashing all around Jimmy. He is surrounded but sill
continues to swing the bat.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy...
Three cops tackle Jimmy from behind. Judy throws down the
camera and runs out the door. The camera is face down on the
seat.
54.
We hear Judy get out of the car, leaving the door open so we
can hear the entire scene with much more intensity. The
sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming.
We hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are
pulling up. More screaming and sounds on the radio is heard.
We hear police chatter:
POLICE CHATTER (O.C.)
(over the police radios)
We're going to need an ambulance
stat at the parking lot of the
grocery store on Route 18...
More screaming and chatter is heard until someone enters the
car. We don't know who it is. They turn off the camera.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. SANITARIUM PARKING LOT/JUDY'S CAR - DAY
Judy is filming. She sits behind the wheel pointing the
camera at the front door of a HIDDEN VALLEY Mental Hospital.
She zooms in on a sign.
Judy flips the camera around to herself.
JUDY
Hi baby. I miss you.
(blowing a kiss)
Mwaa! I'll be waiting for you when
you get out. Be good and don't
wait too long. Look what I did for
you!
Judy opens her mouth wide.
She's got a tongue stud on her
tongue.
JUDY
I can't wait to use it on you!
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT DRIVE THRU/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
Jimmy's pulled forward to the drive thru while Judy tapes
from passenger seat. A voice squawks at Jimmy, asking for
his order.
55.
JIMMY
Can I get a double cheese burger,
no pickles, large fries and a coke?
Jimmy looks at the camera.
JIMMY
That's what I fucking missed more
than anything. Fast food.
He turns back to order more.
JIMMY
And a number two.
The Drive Thru window voice rattles off a price and tells him
to pull up. Jimmy continues to camera.
JUDY (O.C.)
What did you do in there all day?
JIMMY
Masturbated mostly.
JUDY (O.C.)
(jokingly)
You cheated on me! I want to be
the only person responsible for
making you cum.
JIMMY
I hope you're willing to be on call
twenty four hours a day.
JUDY (O.C.)
Seriously, what did you do? What
was a day in the life of Jimmy in
the nut house?
JIMMY
Well, besides masturbating, I
talked and talked and talked and
fucking talked until they were
satisfied. But basically I told
them what they wanted to hear. I
said shit like...
Jimmy does an over the top mock sincerity speech.
56.
JIMMY
"Now that I'm finally able to talk
about my problems, I now realize
that my behavior was inappropriate
and harmful to others."
Judy laughs.
JIMMY
Then I figured it out. I had to
cry as much as possible. Whenever
someone would cry they'd call it a
"break through." So I'd be like.
Jimmy does an imitation of himself in therapy.
He looks
directly into the lens.
JIMMY
You start out slow, then you build
it up like this... "Now I know
that using violence is not the
answer."
Jimmy is getting progressively sappier and more over the top
with his self impersonation.
JIMMY
Then you go like this:
(snaps back into the
impersonation)
I was wrong, I know I was wrong and
I'll never do it again. I don't
want to hurt people or myself.
Jimmy does an obnoxious fake cry.
JIMMY
Boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo-hoo-hoo,
waaaaaaa.
(snaps out of it)
Then you always give them the
obligatory hug at the end. After a
couple of weeks, then they
officially diagnose you with
something, give you a prescription,
then you're done.
JUDY (O.C.)
God, you're a genius.
Jimmy pulls up to the drive through window and pays the
Cashier who hands him the a paper bag of food.
57.
Jimmy pulls away and parks. Judy continues to question him
as he goes through his bag of food.
JUDY (O.C.)
So what did they say you have?
Jimmy munches on some fries.
JIMMY
ODD. Oppositional Defiance
Disorder.
JUDY (O.C.)
You're so lucky. I wish I was
diagnosed with something. What
does it mean?
Jimmy pretends he is reading from a text book 50's industrial
spoof style.
JIMMY
ODD is a disorder characterized by
an overwhelming pattern of
negative, hostile, and defiant
behavior which causes severe
delusions where the patient can no
longer distinguish fantasy from
reality.
JUDY (O.C.)
Wow.
I love that!
Jimmy smiles as he gets his burger out of the paper bag. He
then opens the top bun of the burger to examine if they got
his order correct. They didn't.
Jimmy playfully begins to act crazy.
JIMMY
You see. They fucked up my order.
I specifically asked for no
pickles.
JUDY (O.C.)
(playing along)
Oh, no! How will ODD Boy handle
this? Will his ODD brain be able
to withstand a pickle screw up at
the drive thru?
Jimmy goes into a cartoonish like crazy person character.
58.
He begins by taking the pickles off of his burger. He puts
the burger down, quickly lifts his shirt, holding it up with
his chin while he places two pickles over top of his nipples.
Jimmy yells.
JIMMY
Ooow, jeez, they're hot! I burnt
my nipples with the pickles.
Judy cracks up laughing. Jimmy takes a pickle off of his
left nipple and dangles it directly in front of the lens.
He then feeds it to Judy. We hear Judy chomping on the
pickle and giggling off camera. The camera shakes then shuts
down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. GHETTO/JUDY'S CAR - NIGHT
Judy is driving through the ghetto as Jimmy shoots out of the
window. On the sidewalk, he catches glimpses Drug Dealers, a
Crack Whore, a Drunk stumbling along, and Other Pretty
Sketchy Characters.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I love the ghetto. I don't know
what it is about it. I fucking
love it. It's always the first
place I go to when I get out.
JUDY
I love it when you're out of the
looney bin. Do you think you might
be able to try to avoid the place
for a while?
JIMMY (O.C.)
(joking)
If they don't send me to the bin,
maybe they'll send me to jail.
This upsets Judy.
JUDY
I'm serious. You act like it's no
big deal when you go away!
JIMMY (O.C.)
(tired of it)
All right.
59.
JUDY
No it's not all right! When you're
in there I have to be out in the
real world alone, by myself Jimmy.
You go away and come back like it's
no big deal. Well it is a big
deal. I don't want to spend
another day without you. Do you
understand me? I'd rather die.
Judy's holding back tears.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I'm not going back.
She doesn't believe him. She's really starting to cry
despite herself. He pulls his eye from the lens to look at
her.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy.
Judy looks over at him.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I promise. I swear on my life and
I swear on our bond, I'll never go
back.
Her freak out subsides.
JUDY
If you swear on our bond, then I
believe you.
Judy lets out half cry and half yelp.
Her emotions are a bit
out of control.
JUDY
I love you so fucking much.
JIMMY
(O.C.)
I love you too.
Awkward silence.
Judy looks like she wants to ask Jimmy
something.
JIMMY (O.C.)
What's the matter?
60.
JUDY
I was thinking, the last time you
got out we did it like five times,
like as soon as we saw each other,
we got naked and started doing it.
And today, my parents weren't even
home and I tried to do some stuff
to you, but you were acting like
you weren't interested.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I didn't mean to.
JUDY
Was it because you jerked off so
much while you were locked up?
Jimmy hands her a small bottle of whiskey. She takes a
sizable gulp, makes a face, then hands it back to Jimmy.
JIMMY (O.C.)
No.
Judy is getting upset again.
JUDY
(voice cracking)
Then why don't you want to have sex
with me Jimmy? You don't think I'm
pretty anymore?
JIMMY (O.C.)
No, no, no! That has nothing to do
with it. After I saw my dad being
rammed in the ass by my mother, I
kind of blocked it out, but when I
was in there they kept talking to
me and talking to me about it. Now
I can't stop it from coming into my
head. Every time I get wood, the
instant replay machine in my brain
projects this image of my Mom
pounding into my Dad.
JUDY
God, that's awful.
I didn't know.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yeah well, you know you didn't give
too much of an effort to get in my
pants anyhow. You just sort of
made your sex face and grabbed my
crotch.
61.
Judy takes another drink off the bottle of whiskey and
smiles.
JUDY
How do you like this?
While she is driving she pulls down her tank top and quickly
exposes her breasts through the top of her shirt.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Now we're talking.
Judy tries to position her body so her breasts are in frame.
She begins pushing one up, then sticks out her tongue,
teasing.
JIMMY (O.C.)
That is so hot.
Judy smiles and looks over at the camera. One hand on the
steering wheel and one on her breast, when...
JIMMY (O.C.)
Watch out!
BOOM!
A loud THUMP hits the car, shaking the camera.
JIMMY (O.C.)
I think you hit someone.
Judy's in shock. Jimmy puts the camera on the floor of the
car by the passenger seat. He forgets to turn it off.
All we see is a close up of the floor and Jimmy's feet.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Stay here.
Jimmy gets out of the car.
We hear the car door open then
close.
Judy sounds like she is having a complete nervous breakdown.
She's crying, but in an extremely nervous and frantic way.
JUDY (O.C.)
(calls to him)
Oh my God, what are you doing?
We have no clue what Jimmy is doing outside of the car.
62.
JUDY (O.C.)
Oh fuck, oh fuck. Oh my god.
Jimmy?
We hear a car door open and some struggling sounds coming
from Jimmy.
JUDY (O.C.)
Don't put him in here!
JIMMY (O.C.)
We're taking him to the hospital.
JUDY (O.C.)
No, we'll get busted.
Long pause, we hear Jimmy struggling off camera.
JUDY (O.C.)
What... what are you doing?
JIMMY (O.C.)
He's not breathing. He's not
fucking breathing!
Silence.
You can feel them thinking.
JUDY (O.C.)
Is he dead?
JIMMY (O.C.)
(has decided)
Pop the trunk for me.
JUDY (O.C.)
No.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy.
JUDY (O.C.)
What are we gonna do?
JIMMY (O.C.)
I don't know right now, but we're
not driving around with a dead guy
in our back seat.
JUDY (O.C.)
I just want to go home. Jimmy,
let's leave him. He's dead. We
should just go.
63.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Pop the fucking trunk already
before someone sees us!
We hear Judy pop the trunk.
We hear Jimmy struggling.
The camera is still on the floor of the car.
More struggling as Jimmy is clearly outside putting the body
into the trunk.
JUDY (O.C.)
(to self)
I want to go home.
We hear Jimmy slam the trunk.
JIMMY (O.C.)
(screams; frustrated)
Fuck!
We hear Jimmy come around to the driver's seat and open the
door.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy, I...
JIMMY (O.C.)
I'm driving.
We hear Judy get out of the car and walk around to the
passenger side and open the door, but she doesn't get in.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Get in.
Judy doesn't respond.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Are you gonna fucking get in!
Judy is hysterical.
JUDY (O.C.)
We should just leave him here.
JIMMY (O.C.)
We can't leave him in the middle of
the fucking ghetto. Get in before
someone sees us!
64.
Judy's losing it.
JUDY (O.C.)
I don't want him in my fucking car!
I want him out!
Before Jimmy can respond, we see the reflection of police
lights. Red and blue lights flicker against the lens.
JUDY (O.C.)
Oh shit!
We hear Judy get in the car and close the door.
JUDY (O.C.)
It's the fucking cops.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Just shut up.
She's hysterical.
JUDY (O.C.)
It's the cops. It's the cops.
It's the...
JIMMY (O.C.)
Shhhhhh!
Jimmy kicks the camera. We still can't see any of this.
We
can only hear what's happening.
JIMMY (O.C.)
You gotta play it cool, okay?
Judy's crying gets louder.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Stop fucking crying. Please, I'm
begging you. Stop it.
We hear the cop open and shut his patrol car door.
JUDY (O.C.)
Oh God. He's getting out of the
car. We've got a dead homeless guy
in our trunk and he's...
JIMMY (O.C.)
SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
65.
JUDY (O.C.)
Oh, my god Jimmy, he's walking
towards us.
JIMMY (O.C.)
SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Just be cool.
The Cop is close, we can feel his footsteps coming towards
the car. Judy collects herself as best as she can.
The cop taps his flashlight against the window.
We hear Judy roll down her power window and we hear the voice
of the Cop.
COP (O.C.)
Good evening. License and
registration please.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Certainly, sir.
The light from the Cop's flashlight reflects off the floor of
the car and into the lens of the camera.
The reflections stop.
The wait is unbearable.
COP (O.C.)
Could you please step out of the
vehicle?
Jimmy gets out of the car as Judy trembles in the passengers
seat.
We only hear the sounds of Judy sniffling and repressing
herself from crying and idle chatter of the Cop's radio.
It seems like forever, then...
THUMP!
The car is shaking, we hear intense struggling going on
outside.
Judy unleashes a piercing, high pitched scream.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy!
More violent struggling is heard as Judy begins to
hyperventilate.
POP
66.
A gunshot is fired.
Judy screams.
JUDY (O.C.)
AAAAAHHHHHHH!
POP.
Another shot is fired.
The car door opens, Jimmy gets in. We hear the sounds of
tires squealing and the engine roaring.
JUDY (O.C.)
What happened?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Shut up!
Judy's now totally freaked.
JUDY (O.C.)
What happened!
JIMMY (O.C.)
Just shut the fuck up! I don't
fucking want to talk about it!
Jimmy can't bully her into silence.
She continues to freak
out. The camera is kicked.
JUDY (O.C.)
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT FUCKING
HAPPENED! I WANNA KNOW. I WANNA
KNOW. I JUST WANNA FUCKING...!
Camera is kicked off and shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
A weird, digital, black and white image plays on the camera.
There's no light and Jimmy's got the camera back in "Nite
Shot" mode. He's standing outside of the car filming the
Homeless Man who is lying dead inside of the trunk. Judy
stands next to him as he films.
The Homeless Man is twisted and contorted in order to fit in
the small confines of the trunk.
Jimmy pans back and forth and up and down his dead body.
67.
JUDY (O.C.)
What are you doing?
JIMMY (O.C.)
(it's obvious)
I'm filming.
JUDY (O.C.)
It's dark.
You can't see anything.
JIMMY (O.C.)
It's on infra-red. Do you wanna
see?
JUDY (O.C.)
No, I don't wanna see.
JIMMY (O.C.)
He's beautiful. He really is.
There's a certain serenity to death
I appreciate.
JUDY (O.C.)
He's dead. He's in my car, Jimmy,
and he stinks. I wanna go home.
Jimmy keeps filming.
JUDY (O.C.)
I don't think I can do this.
Jimmy ignores her.
JUDY (O.C.)
I'm not like you. I can't do this.
(holds back a sob)
I wanna fucking go home.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yeah, well you can't fucking go
home. And you will do this. You
did do this. You killed him. You
didn't get in the car until the
cops showed up. Now we don't have
a choice. You want me to go to
jail? You want that?
JUDY (O.C.)
(softer)
No.
Judy settles.
Jimmy is out of breath.
68.
The sun is beginning to rise. The light of a new day
cascades upon the dead body in the trunk.
JUDY (O.C.)
(half crying)
What are we going to do?
JIMMY (O.C.)
We just need to make intelligent
decisions. That's all. We'll find
a way to take care of it. Then
we'll go away. We'll fix it.
It'll be okay. I promise.
JUDY (O.C.)
You promise?
JIMMY (O.C.)
Yeah.
Come here.
Jimmy has dropped the camera away from the Homeless Man.
He's still rolling while he wraps his arms around her and
holds her.
We hear him kissing her softly.
JIMMY (O.C.)
It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take
care of everything. I promise.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
(From Sc. 37, p. 64) On screen we see something completely
new. It's a black and white security cam style video image.
Just as the announcer described, this is the kind of image
that comes from a video camera that's mounted on the inside
of a Cop Car. It's static and covered with date/time text,
etc.
On TV, we finally get a chance to see what transpired when
Jimmy and Judy were pulled over. Judy is standing outside
the cop car. The moment she sees it approach, we see her
freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and
suspiciously. The cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes
over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy. After a few
moments, he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits.
The Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk. He doesn't have his
gun drawn, but he is being cautious, one hand on his gun
holster, the other shining on Jimmy's face with a flashlight.
COP
(on TV)
Go ahead and open it.
Jimmy stands by the trunk of the car, but he's not really
obeying the Cop's commands. He's stalling. The Cop is
getting suspicious. We can barely hear what they're saying
to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by.
There's an unintelligible exchange, then... the cop steps
forward, raising his voice.
COP
(on TV)
Put your hands on the vehicle.
Jimmy's reluctant.
COP
(on TV)
On the vehicle, now!
85.
The Cop and Jimmy are sort of at a standoff.
Jimmy finally
leans over and puts his hands on the trunk.
The Cop comes in close to Jimmy, pulling his hand from his
gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt.
At that exact moment, Jimmy makes his move, LEAPING for the
Cop.
He takes the Cop to the ground and off screen.
All we see is a barely decipherable image of Judy freaking
out in the passenger seat because she can't see what's going
on and neither can we.
About 5 seconds go by.
BOOM!
A gunshot is fired.
It feels like an eternity, then...
Jimmy pops up off the ground. He's got the Cop's gun! He
hesitates, not knowing what to do. He pauses, hesitant, then
shoots down towards the ground, where the cop is lying out of
frame.
He runs around the front of the car and into the driver seat.
There's a moment of hesitation as Jimmy and Judy seem to be
screaming at each other in the car, then...
Jimmy slams on the gas and the car takes off into the
distance.
The image on the TV cuts away and back to the Anchorman.
Jimmy's Mom and Dad with a chiron at the bottom of frame.
They're at a podium with Judy's parents standing stoically in
the background. Jimmy's Mom starts reading a prepared
statement.
JIMMY'S MOM
(on TV)
We are very shocked about recent
events. Our son has always been a
dear sweet boy who is sometimes
confused, but we want him to know
that we love him very, very much
and just want this whole thing to
be over.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Bitch.
87.
JUDY (O.C.)
Shhhh...
Judy's Dad steps up to the microphone.
Despite the truth, he
sounds genuinely concerned.
JUDY'S DAD
Jimmy if you're out there, we know
you're scared, but you're only
making it worse. Please bring Judy
back to us. We really miss her
terribly.
Jim walks over to the TV and...
Buddy is standing outside of a Piece Of Shit Trailer. He's
the douche bag type that we saw from a distance give Jimmy a
hug in the previous scene.
He's surprisingly charismatic and gracious and does his best
to make Jimmy and Judy feel at home.
Jimmy films as Buddy gives them a walking tour of the group
of trailers by the river. Judy's with them as well.
BUDDY
We got like thirty five trailers
here. Long as we've got some
that's empty you can stay in one.
Sometimes people come in and we got
get you a tent or-- fuck,
everybody's friendly--- you can
always find a bed to crash in.
Jimmy's panning around the landscape. People are watching
them walk with Buddy. It's almost as if they've got some
kind of celebrity status because they're with him.
BUDDY
It don't look like much but we do
some pretty good partying around
here. Ya'll are welcome to stay as
long as ya like. Fuck it, you can
stay forever. There's only two
rules. Don't mess around with the
labs which are down back there...
Jimmy's panning again, but BUDDY grabs hold of the lens.
BUDDY
Woah... No filming that shit.
Seriously. That's part of rule
number one.
(MORE)
97.
BUDDY (cont'd)
Don't even go near there with the
camera, and two is no cops, but
fuck, seeing what kinda shit you
guys got into, I don't think we
gotta worry about you calling 'em
up for a visit.
BUDDY laughs at his own joke.
BUDDY
Other than that, ya'll can do
whatever the hell you want,
whenever the hell you want. You
wanna do some of the stash at the
parties, that's cool too. We'd
like it if you do it, normally we'd
say you gotta sell some too, but
Rodney says y'all's is a special
case 'cuz you ain't leaving 'til
the heat's off for sure, that could
be months or... shit, years for you
guys. But no one up here's in a
fucking hurry.
Jimmy pans around capturing the natural beauty and
picturesque scenery of the camp.
BUDDY
Look at you. Little bitch from the
nut house, and you got yourself one
sweet looking bride! I still can't
get over the tits on this girl.
(to Judy)
Come here sweetheart.
Jimmy pans back and catches an image of Buddy as he grabs
Judy and puts his arm around her.
BUDDY
We're gonna have a party for y'all
tonight. You know that? We have
parties damn near every night, but
this one's gonna be special just
for you guys.
(to Judy)
You like that sweety?
Buddy's squeezing Judy just a bit too tight.
JUDY
Sure Buddy.
98.
BUDDY
(to Jimmy)
Nice piece of ass you got here.
Best you keep an eye on it so it
don't wander off on ya.
They've arrived at a trailer.
BUDDY
We're here!
Jimmy pans back up at the trailer that's going to be theirs.
From the outside, it's a disaster, peeling paint and cracked
windows.
Buddy gets in front of the camera, reaching for it.
BUDDY
Shit! Y'all's on your honeymoon.
Ain't gonna film it yourselves.
Buddy pulls the camera from Jimmy's hand and points it at
Jimmy and Judy. Judy waves. Jimmy looks a bit uncomfortable
though he tries not to show it.
BUDDY (O.C.)
That's nice.
Shaky amateur camera style as Buddy zooms in on Judy's chest,
closing Jimmy out of frame.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Let's go inside.
Judy turns.
BUDDY (O.C.)
(shouting)
Hold on! Hold on!
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
DAY
Jimmy is filming SALLY, a very sexy and very stoned 18 year
old girl wearing sunglasses and cowboy hat.
She speaks with a heavy southern accent.
SALLY
Just give your love to Uncle Rodney
and you'll get it back ten times.
Don't be afraid to love him and
you'll learn to love yourself in
return. He'll teach you the cycle,
how we're all connected. If you
give yourself freely and completely
to him, you'll have nothing to
worry about. That's what I did.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
DAY
Jimmy is filming Random Teens at a barbecue. Jimmy is
interviewing SAM, a long greasy haired, nineteen year old
wearing a heavy metal T-shirt. We see people partying and
hanging out in the background.
SAM is drinking beer from a can, smoking a cigarette, and
looks like he hasn't showered for a couple of days. He's
happy to be Jimmy's video subject.
100.
SAM
Ya'll are going to love it here
man. See this?
Sam motions behind him at the people partying.
SAM
This shit goes on every day. I
been here for six months man and I
love it. Thank God my parents
kicked me out... All you got do is
listen to Uncle Rodney and you'll
have the best fucking time of your
life. Oh, yeah.
(big dopey grin)
And don't fuck with him, 'cuz he'll
kick your ass!
Sam laughs at his own dumb joke.
Jimmy shuts off the camera.
CAMERA ON:
Jimmy films a naked Judy swimming in the river the
reflections of the water obscuring her body. She's free,
cleansed, relaxed, enjoying the sun, and having the time of
her life. She suddenly notices the camera.
JUDY
Jimmy, come swimming.
The water's
warm.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Is it?
Judy smiles, then slips her head under the water, coming back
up with a smile. She looks up at him.
JUDY
Come on.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Later.
I just want to look at you
now.
JUDY
Why?
Jimmy thinks.
She smiles an oh so sweet smile.
101.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Because you look happy, happier
than you've looked in a long time.
Judy smiles even wider. She floats towards camera while
Jimmy zooms in on her smiling face.
As she comes closer...
SHE SPLASHES towards the camera, trying to get Jimmy wet.
Camera shakes as Jimmy hops up to avoid be splashed.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Hey!
Judy LAUGHS.
Camera goes off.
CAMERA ON:
Head to toe shot on Jimmy. Buddy, we'll find out in a
second, is behind the camera. Jimmy looks at a trailer off
screen. He's excited, a little off center and a little
nervous.
Buddy tries to film Jimmy as he's walking towards Rodney's
trailer.
BUDDY (O.C.)
You nervous?
JIMMY
(lying)
No.
BUDDY (O.C.)
I would be.
JIMMY
He's suppose to be cool.
BUDDY (O.C.)
He's more than cool man. God, you
really don't have a clue do you?
Jimmy stops for a second.
JIMMY
Um... Judy wants to meet him.
I
don't know if I can ask.
BUDDY (O.C.)
Shit man. Don't have to. She's
one of his girls, man. She'll meet
him.
Jimmy stops in his tracks and looks at Buddy.
JIMMY
What the fuck does that mean?
104.
BUDDY (O.C.)
Relax dude... Just like you're one
of his boys. Shit man, I'll give
you two weeks and you'll WANT her
to experience him. You may even
want to, too.
Jimmy looks at Buddy, not quite sure what to do with any of
it. Buddy senses the tension.
BUDDY (O.C.)
Just go see him. Here, take your
camera.
Buddy extends the camera, lens forward.
We can see Jimmy's
puzzled look.
BUDDY (O.C.)
He wants you to film him, man.
With the camera. He'll tell you
when to turn it on, then you video.
Jimmy's puzzled, but he reaches forward and takes the camera,
shutting it down.
CAMERA ON:
Someone (Buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a lot
of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones
Jimmy was interviewing before. It's certainly a weird bunch.
They all look alike, dress similar, and have the same type of
crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions.
Most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers
while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums.
They all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be
allowed.
Camera pans to Jimmy, so we realize that he's not filming.
Our best guess would be that it's Buddy who's filming. Jimmy
screams at the camera over the noise of the Bongo drums.
JIMMY
Where's Judy?
Buddy's hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit.
We now see Jimmy see Judy.
She dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of
other drunk, happily intoxicated teenagers. Say what you
might about the attendees to the event, this party is a
FUCKING RAGER and Judy is happy to be the center of
everyone's attention.
Everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat
faster and become more intense. It's an all out jam session.
Jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing
around Judy. Camera follows him with a zoom as he does.
JUMP CUT
110.
Who knows how much later. Minutes or hours, the party rages
forward. The camera spins around. The party has reached a
new level of drunken absurdity. Most of those who are
dancing are drunk, stoned or both.
In the background, while it's too dark and hectic see
anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a
variety of sexual activity. Some have threesomes. Some are
probably having oral sex. Still others dance around them in
the foreground.
Camera zooms in on Uncle Rodney.
Standing just behind him, we see of flash of someone
recognizable. It's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely
familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness
going on.
She turns her head to look over at Rodney.
Now we can clearly see that this person is...
HAZEL - with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of
rolling on crank.
AND she's saying something to Uncle Rodney that's definitely
pissing him off.
Bodies wipe the frame.
JUMP CUT
Moments later. Camera catches Judy who hasn't missed a step
along the way to being a high, drunken mess. The rhythm of
the drum beats is ever present.
Uncle Rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around
her shoulder, saying something to her, but we can't hear it
over the noise. Jimmy approaches and they start talking.
Jimmy doesn't notice, but there are about four or five of the
kids, especially a couple of Rodney's Bigger Guys standing
not too far behind Uncle Rodney watching the conversation
intensely.
It's really difficult to put your finger on it exactly, but
something doesn't seem right here.
Uncle Rodney lets go of Judy and puts his arm around Jimmy.
With the noise of the drums and the fact that we're zoomed in
from a distance, we can't hear anything they're saying.
111.
Now Uncle Rodney and Jimmy are having a conversation as they
move towards the camera. Though Jimmy can't see it, we can
see that Rodney's Bigger Guys, the ones that were standing
behind Uncle Rodney are now pushing Judy along behind Jimmy
and Rodney. Though Uncle Rodney seems to be having a very
light and friendly conversation with Jimmy, we continue to
get the feeling that something ominous is afoot.
Finally, they approach camera and we can hear them.
UNCLE RODNEY
I'm so glad you guys came down
here. We never would have guessed
you'd come and see us.
JIMMY
You've been awesome.
Judy loves it
here.
Uncle Rodney's got Jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed
side hug.
UNCLE RODNEY
I knew she would. By the way.
Rodney's face drops.
UNCLE RODNEY
I know what you did to Dinko.
This hits Jimmy like a lead weight. Before he can react at
all, and before he realizes that anything is happening, Jimmy
is suddenly thrown into a headlock by Uncle Rodney.
Off camera, something similar is happening to Judy.
JUDY (O.C.)
(screaming)
What the fuck are you doing?!
Jimmy, Jimmy!
Judy screams his name over and over.
JUDY
Jimmy!
Jimmy!
BUDDY (O.C.)
(laughing)
Shut it, bitch!
SMACK!
Judy's been hit by Buddy off screen.
112.
Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
We hear intense struggling and laughter. By the sounds we
hear, we gather that Jimmy and Judy are being dragged off
into the woods against their will by Buddy and Rodney's
Bigger Guys, but it's too dark to tell if that is what in
fact is happening.
Someone unidentified is running the show and operates the
camera. It's impossible to see, but it's definitely Buddy's
voice.
BUDDY (O.C.)
Here, here, here. Right here.
Judy is screaming and crying.
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy!
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy?
Two or three guys, it's too dark to tell, start laughing.
JUDY (O.C.)
(screams)
Please somebody help us!
Jimmy grunts, trying to break free.
JIMMY
Judy!
RODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.)
Shut up, asshole! You wanna
fucking talk!
MUNCH. Somewhere in the darkness Jimmy's been kicked in the
gut. The camera hits the ground. It lands right in front of
Jimmy. We can still barely see what's going on, but we're
close enough and there's enough flashes of light from
flashlights to see that Jimmy is face down and bloody.
JIMMY
(defiant)
Fuck you!
113.
Jimmy gets kicked again just once. Then suddenly, a barrage
of kicks come at Jimmy one after the other after the other.
Leaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at Jimmy's
face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly.
The process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds.
We can't tell how much damage has been sustained, but Jimmy's
not moving. He's either unconscious or dead.
With one last kick, the camera is knocked aside and we don't
see Jimmy's face anymore.
RODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.)
Is he fucking dead?
JUDY (O.C.)
Jimmy!
Jimmy say something!
They mock her in a high pitched wining voice.
BUDDY (O.C.)
(mocking)
Jimmy. Jimmy say something.
RODNEY'S BIG GUY #2 (O.C.)
Get her clothes off.
JUDY (O.C.)
(screaming)
Noooooo! Noooooo!
Judy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as
we hear them tearing at her clothes. Then they pick her up
and start pulling her away from camera.
Her screams get quieter and quieter... fainter and fainter.
JUDY (O.C.)
(extremely faint)
Jimmy!
Finally there's silence. The camera isn't moving.
It's on
the ground and in the dark. Camera shuts down.
CAMERA ON:
It's completely pitch black dark. We can see nothing.
We
can only hear the sound of Jimmy fumbling around and
breathing heavily and nervously.
114.
BEGIN NITE SHOT
Suddenly, we see everything, albeit in a weird black and
white grainy fashion. Jimmy's flipped the camera into Nite
Shot, using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see
in the complete darkness. He's strapped the camera to his
wrist.
The image is Jimmy's POV as he searches through his trunk for
something. Pulling aside a duffle bag, we see the 9mm pistol
that Jimmy stole from the Cop. He grabs it as camera shuts
down.
CAMERA ON:
I/E. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT/OUTSIDE RODNEY'S
TRAIER/INSIDE RODNEYS TRAILER/PARKING AREA/DINKO'S CAR -
NIGHT
By the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy
took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens
of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in
sleeping bags and in tents.
Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera.
He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag
with her
back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to
Judy's,
but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over
passed
out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken
anyone.
Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes
a loud clanking sound of glass on glass.
Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking
up. No one does.
Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY.
Kneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on
her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the
camera. The girl flips over.
It's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely
intoxicated that she doesn't wake up.
Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips
the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the
inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another
passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of
the tent.
115.
Jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy
among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground.
No luck.
Jimmy's not too far from Uncle Rodney's trailer.
He decides
to make his way up.
He walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of
bodies until he gets up to the entrance...
OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
There's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile
by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at
the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like
hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent
beating.
Moving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle
Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very
slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door.
INSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
It's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses
forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to
see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music.
Jimmy is scared shitless.
In the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle
Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a
spooning position. There's no doubt this time.
It's definitely JUDY!
They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying
together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step
is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them.
Once Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he
stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared
himself for this particular situation and doesn't know
exactly what to do.
He continues filming them until he finally musters the
courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the
face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps
the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder
and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing.
116.
THWACK! An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmy's poking
hand. Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney!
The camera shakes out of control.
Uncle Rodney screams at
the top of his lungs:
UNCLE RODNEY
Who the fuck...!
Intense and furious wrestling ensues as Uncle Rodney flies
out of frame then, in a split second:
BAM!
A gunshot goes off. We hear a Uncle Rodney collapse,
followed by more gun shots. The camera has fallen from
Jimmy's hand and dangles by the wrist strap. Camera comes to
rest on...
UNCLE RODNEY'S BLOODY FACE
Jimmy's shot and killed him.
Outside, footsteps hit the deck.
Buddy opens the door of the
trailer.
BUDDY
Hey!
BAM, BAM, BAM!
Three more rounds are fired, hitting Buddy square in the
chest, knocking him down. Jimmy points the camera at a dead
Buddy on his back then whip pans it back to Judy in the bed.
Finally we hear Jimmy speak.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Judy, Judy, wake up. Fucking wake
up!
Outside we hear voices of some of Rodney's Other Teens.
Jimmy acts fast. Judy has been drugged and is mostly
unconscious and groggy, but Jimmy picks her up and gets her
on her feet, shouldering her out the door. Shot continues
to...
OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
We hear faint voices...
117.
RODNEY'S BIG GUY #3
(faint)
Hey! Hey!
A DISTANT GUNSHOT FIRES, but we can't see what is going on.
It's too dark and the camera is too shaky as they go to...
PARKING AREA
Another DISTANT SHOT, then Jimmy gasps in pain. He's been
shot, but decides to run, trying to carry a groggy Judy
anyway. Their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and
bullets whizzing by them. One hits Dinko's car.
Jimmy opens the door, then places the passed out Judy and the
camera in the passenger seat, climbs over her, throwing the
camera into Judy's lap.
We see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we hear
a BULLET HIT the driver's door. The car starts, and Jimmy
throws it into gear, flooring the gas as he speeds away.
JIMMY
Judy?
Judy?
Nothing.
JIMMY
Judy wake up.
Jimmy's voice begins to crack as he talks to/tries to wake up
Judy.
JIMMY (O.C.)
Are you all right baby?
Please
wake up Judy. Judy?
We don't know if Judy is dead or alive.
Jimmy swerves to avoid something in the road sending the
camera to the floor as camera shuts down.
