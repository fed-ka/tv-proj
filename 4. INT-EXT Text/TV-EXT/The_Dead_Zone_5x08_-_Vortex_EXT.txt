                                        STILLSON (V.O.)
                        Madame Chairman, for the record I
                        would like to state my belief
                        that these hearings should be
                        open to the press.



            A charity fund-raiser in progress.  Volunteers, including
          Sarah, sell donated clothing from behind folding tables. 
          But right now they're just listening.  Panning across
          their rapt faces as we continue to hear --

                                        WOMAN (O.S.)
                        His face was lacerated and he
                        lost two fingers on his left hand,
                        but his body armor saved his life.

            REVEALING a 50ish WOMAN holding a mic as she speaks from
          a small portable stage.

                                        WOMAN
                        The Army wouldn't pay for that
                        armor, so our church did.  That's
                        why I'm so grateful to the Desert
                        Storm Veterans of Maine.  Maybe
                        we can save another mother's son. 
                        Thank you.

          APPLAUSE as she hands the mic off to Reverend Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        Thank you, Mrs. Londstrom.  A
                          reminder:  Faith Heritage will
                        match every dollar raised today,
                        so please, help our young men and
                        women, who are fighting the good
                        fight in a country that desperately
                        needs their help.

          During which, camera finds Johnny and Bruce sorting used
          clothing donations at a table in the back.  Bruce can't
          seem to get into the spirit of things.

                                        BRUCE
                        The "good fight."  It's more like
                          a lottery -- only the winners get
                        to go home in body bags.

          Johnny gives him a look, sensing there's more to this.  A
          beat, then Bruce sighs, admits what's been eating him.

                                        BRUCE
                        A good friend of mine from high
                        school, career soldier, just bought
                        it over there.  Suicide bomber.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.

          Bruce grabs a shirt, angrily folds it.

                                        BRUCE
                        He had no chance, man.  But I 
                        guess we're all in the same boat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We still talking about the war?

          Bruce gives him a look.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's not easy sharing your secrets,
                        John, if you know what I mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Armageddon.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, Armageddon.  I mean look at
                        these people.  One foot in the
                        grave, only they don't know it. 
                        And only you can save them.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (attempting lightness)
                        Hey, don't put it all on me.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        We're a team, remember?

          Bruce just shakes his head as Sarah approaches.

                                        SARAH
                        How we doing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're a sorting and folding
                          machine.

                                        SARAH
                        If you find any more of those
                        camouflage shirts or pants, shoot
                        'em over.  The kids are really
                          snapping them up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Camo's hot.  Got it.

          Another VOLUNTEER MOM waves to Sarah from the sales tables.

                                        SARAH
                        Back to the front line.

          Johnny sorts through a pile of clothes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Camo, camo, camo.  Nothing like a
                        teen in uniform.

          He sees a flash of camo but when he grabs it, WHOOSH!



          Johnny finds himself looking at a YOUNG BLOND GIRL, about
          thirty yards away, as she turns to look back at him.  A
          charged moment of connection as we hear the roar of O.S.
          flames.   Then the girl turns and starts to take a step --

                                        JOHNNY
                        NOO!!!  

          Suddenly the ground EXPLODES beneath the girl, clods of
          dirt and shrapnel flying toward Johnny, who shields his
          face just before they BLACK OUT the screen! 


  88RESUME ON JOHNNY

          Still holding the shirt.  He finds a name tag sewn over
          the breast pocket: "STYRON."


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  7.


    8CONTINUED:8

          His gaze goes to a group of Gulf War vets hanging near
          the stage.  Bruce catches this.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hold the fort.

          We hang on Bruce as he watches Johnny head toward the
          vets, still clutching the shirt.

          WITH THE VETS AS JOHNNY APPROACHES

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yo, anyone here named Styron?  I
                        found a twenty in the pocket.

                                        VET
                        Throw it in the kitty, Jimmy won't
                        mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                          "Jimmy"?  I feel like I should
                        ask him first.

                                        VET
                        If you can catch him.  Lazy bastard
                        just took off.



          Johnny runs up, scans the lot, and sees a guy in a fatigue
          jacket, JIMMY STYRON, 30s, about to get into a beat-up
          van.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yo, Jimmy!  Jimmy Styron!

          WITH STYRON as he turns, watches Johnny run up.  His eyes
          narrow suspiciously as Johnny arrives, out of breath.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: shirt)
                        Hey.  This is yours, right?

                                        STYRON
                        Yeah.  So?

          Johnny looks at him, feeling awkward.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/22/05 - WHT-2  8.


    9CONTINUED:9

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, it's just I... um... I
                        mean...

          Flustered, he gives up and just grabs Styron's arm.  He
          doesn't get a vision, but he does get a reaction.

                                        STYRON
                                (jerking away)
                        What are you?  Some kind of freak?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, I just --

          But now Styron grabs Johnny, SLAMMING him against the
          side of the VAN.  But as he does -- FREEZE and WHOOSH!

          THE VAN SPINS AROUND 180 DEGREES, STYRON DISAPPEARS, AND
          JOHNNY FINDS HIMSELF STANDING BESIDE THE VAN IN -- 



            A highway underpass, desolate loading dock, or whatever
          similar location fits our board.  Styron's van is parked
            alongside a TAN PASSENGER VAN (same as in Sc. 29), Styron
          standing by the open rear door, showing a semi-automatic
          rifle to an intense-looking man (JACOB FRANKEL, 30s) --

                                        STYRON
                        Then you got your AR-15, the gold
                          standard.  Only difference between
                        this and the M-16 is mode-of-fire. 
                          Full-auto and 3-shot burst modes
                        are disabled on the civilian model.

                                        FRANKEL
                        Say you want to "enable" them? 

          Styron grins, tosses Frankel a ZIPLOCK filled with small
          gun parts and a computer-printed manual. 

                                        STYRON
                        With the right parts and
                          instructions, a six-year-old could
                        do it.

          As Frankel fingers the bag, Styron sizes him up, then
          flips a blanket off a box with military markings.

                                        STYRON
                        While you're at it, you might
                        want to check out these.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  9.


    10CONTINUED:10

          Johnny peers into the box with Frankel.  It's packed with
          dull metal discs.  LAND MINES.

                                        STYRON
                        M-14 anti-personnel land mines. 
                        Guess you could say they fell off
                          a truck. 
                                (picks one up)
                        Step on one, you hear a click. 
                        Step off, you won't hear anything. 
                        The last word in home defense.

          A beat, then Frankel nods, his expression somber.

                                        FRANKEL
                        I'll take them.  All of them.

          And as Johnny reacts, he WHOOSHES out of the vision.


  1111RESUME ON JOHNNY, PINNED AGAINST THE VAN

          Only now he grabs Styron by the shoulders, spins and jams
          him up against the van, shouting --

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's in the van, Jimmy?  Machine
                        guns?  Land mines?

                                        STYRON
                                (freaked)
                        Get off me!

          Across the parking lot, Johnny sees --

          DEPUTY ROSCOE

          Getting out of a sheriff's cruiser with a box of clothes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Deputy!

          Off Roscoe, his face falling...

                                        ROSCOE (V.O.)
                        It was one of those days I wished
                        the Sheriff was around.



          Situated in a picture-perfect small Maine town, which at
          the moment is overrun with anglers in crisp new fishing
          vests and spotless waders.  They cluster around their
          SUVs, gabbing and comparing equipment.

          Johnny's Range Rover pulls up at a pump, across from a
          big BUS-CONVERSION RV with dark windows.

                                        BRUCE
                        Guess the bass are really running
                        this year.

          An ANGLER who's filling up the RV touches his billed cap. 
          Johnny nods back, then hands Bruce a credit card.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Fill her up.  I'll ask for
                          directions.

          Johnny starts toward the store, passing an angler carrying
          a bag of food items.  The two men exchange nods, but then
            something makes Johnny look back --

          HIS POV - THE ANGLER

          The butt of a 9 mm pistol sticks out the back of his pants,
          partly hidden by the bottom of his fly fishing vest.

          JOHNNY reacts to this, puzzled and slightly disturbed.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  12.


    15CONTINUED:15

          He looks at all the anglers again, including one who's
          cleaning the windshield of a nearby SUV.  Johnny starts
          back toward his own car, "casually" allowing a hand to
          brush the back of the SUV.  WHOOSH!

  1919RESUME

          Now Johnny's really spooked.  Bruce, putting the pump
          back, notes his distraction.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's going down here and
                        it's not the bass.

          His eyes are drawn to the big RV again, now parked at the
          edge of the lot.  Instinctively, he starts toward it.



          Johnny approaches the RV, Bruce trailing him.  As they
          pass a couple of anglers, we see one of them touch his
          ear.  PUSHING IN CLOSE, we see he's wearing a small
            BLUETOOTH HEADSET.  As he listens --

          Johnny and Bruce turn just enough to see that they've
          been hemmed in by the two Fisherman, both holding guns at
            belly-level, their bodies shielding them from view.

          Johnny and Bruce turn again as the door HISSES open, then 
          react as Walt comes down the steps, wearing his uniform
          and a stony, all-business expression.

          Johnny takes her hand.  WHOOSH!  Camera 180s around him --


  4040EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny finds himself standing in an empty intersection. 
            Something clicks.  He looks up, sees a STOP LIGHT has
          just turned red, then turns again at the sound of OPERA
          MUSIC.  It's wafting from the open windows of an expensive
          SUV which stops near Johnny.  He steps close, peers inside.

          Lucy is in the front passenger seat; a man, evidently her
          HUSBAND, at the wheel.  The blond girl sits in back,
          fussing with a doll.  The family's dressed up, returning
          from the opera.  Lucy closes her eyes, reliving a moment
          from the performance.

                                        LUCY
                        The aria was so beautiful.  I
                        felt like I was floating.

                                        HUSBAND
                        It's that new tenor.  A year from
                        now, he'll be bigger than
                        Pavarotti.

          Suddenly both front doors are jerked open by two GUN-
          wielding CARJACKERS --

          The little girl is frozen with fear, unnoticed by the

          He lunges toward Carjacker 1, trying to reach his daughter
          over the back of the seat.

          Johnny and the others turn to see Carter entering with
          Frankel and two other men.  The energy in the room
          immediately ratchets up.

                                        CARTER (Cont'd)

          A murmur runs through the group.  Any hope Johnny had of
          going unrecognized is out the window.  He nods.

          The others make sounds and gestures of assent.  Challenged

          And as we alternate push-ins on their eyes, we INTERCUT:



          FLASHES of mayhem, death and destruction.  Sect members
          and SWAT agents exchanging automatic weapons fire.  The
          compound burning.  Men, women and children DYING.

          Glancing behind him, Johnny approaches the closed door.          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT THREE - 8/22/05 - WHT-2  31.



          The RV is now stationed closer to, but not necessarily
          within sight of, the Seekers' compound.  An Army-style
          command tent is set up beside the vehicle.



          Everything seems utterly still.  Then we detect a slight
          movement in the tall grass in the f.g. and, moving closer,
          see it's a camouflaged SNIPER.

          State police officers wearing flak jackets and SWAT
          OFFICERS armed with assault rifles and shotguns emerge
          from cover and stealthily approach the compound.



          BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  A series of EXPLOSIONS erupt along a
            perimeter between the officers and the compound, separating
          them.  The concussive force sends several officers
            sprawling in SLOW MOTION.  Panicked, other officers
          immediately OPEN FIRE on the building.  The gunfire is
            returned, bullets from the sect members' automatic rifles
          kicking up dirt.  We see TWO OFFICERS WOUNDED as others
          scramble for cover.          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT THREE - 8/23/05 - BLUE-2  39.



            A wounded Officer is being loaded into an AMBULANCE.

            advancing cautiously on the buildings.

            Suddenly, Carter runs between the buildings, firing at
          them as he goes.  Officers duck for cover and fire back
          as Carter slips behind the building housing his office.



          Frankel pushes open one of the big DOUBLE DOORS, turns to
          wave the others after him, when suddenly the walls around
          him are peppered with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE.  He retreats.

          A STORM CELLAR DOOR opens in the middle of the FIELD Johnny
          saw in his earlier vision.  As the others bunch up
            anxiously behind him, he looks toward the field's edge,
          then scans the dangerous ground between.

                                        JOHNNY

          several tentative steps into the field.  Then something
          CLICKS and he freezes.  As he starts to turn back --

          AN EXPLOSION blows him off his feet.  He lands on his
          back, bloodied.  His eyes start to close.  Suddenly, we --

          Johnny's foot is poised just above the ground; he's about
          to take that fateful step.  But now he steps back, then
          turns to the others.

          As the others begin to file anxiously into the field...



          Walt is standing near Seybold, as an Officer rushes up to
          report.

                                        OFFICER
                          Surveillance reports people exiting

                          Redeploy the SWAT team.

            Suddenly, a NEWS TRUCK pulls up, a CAMERA CREW hops out.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        Damn it!  How'd they find out?

                        Time for you to step back, Major.

          As Seybold seethes...



          Carter's office building explodes into flames.  The
          officers who've been advancing on the building fall back,
          as we HEAR other explosions.          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT FOUR - 8/23/05 - BLUE-2  49A.



          Johnny has led the sect members halfway across the field
          when the main building (or its facade) erupts in flames
          behind them.  Johnny and the sect members crouch and sway,
          struggling not to be knocked off their feet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Keep following me!

          Briefly loses her grip on Nora's hand.  Nora looks back
          at the flames, clutches her doll tighter.  We can imagine
          how, to the little girl's eyes, this indeed seems like
          Armageddon.



          Walt is about to hop into a SUV, lights flashing, as he
          reacts to plumes of smoke rising from the buildings.

                                        WALT

          Johnny's made it the rest of the way across the mine field,
          and now turns and directs the sect members.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's it.  Exactly in my
                        footsteps.  Keep coming.

          One by one, he and Bruce help the others across.  But
            Suddenly, a line of armed officers appear from the border
          of woods ahead of them.  Johnny freezes, until he hears --

                                        WALT (MEGAPHONE)
                        John.  It's all right.  No one
                        will fire on you.

          WITH WALT AND THE OFFICERS

          Seybold hangs back, reluctantly letting Walt take charge
          of this rescue effort.  An AMBULANCE stands by.

          As JOHNNY sighs with relief, waving the others along. 
          Officers take custody of some members, MEDICS give others
          oxygen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        C'mon.  That's it.  Keep coming.

            Suddenly, a woman shouts, panicked --

          Johnny turns, sees Nora standing alone in field, clutching
          her doll.  He takes a few steps toward her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora!  Don't move!

          Frightened and confused, Nora calls out to her mother.

                                        NORA
                        You said when the Rapture came,
                        we'd be with Daddy.  If I die,
                        then I can go to heaven and be
                        with him.  We should both go.

                        No, honey!  Not this way!

          Johnny shushes Lucy with a gesture, then edges closer to
          Nora, each step again laced with danger.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora, I know what it's like to
                        lose a father.  But I'm telling
                        you, as a father myself: he
                          wouldn't want you to join him
                        like this.

                        They said we'd be together again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know they did, honey.

          He inches closer, as we see Walt, Bruce, the other sect
          members, and even Seybold, tensely watching.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But your Daddy wouldn't want that
                        to happen now.  He wants to watch
                        you grow up, play and make friends,
                        and maybe someday have kids of
                        your own.  That's how you'll make
                        him happy.

          Tears are rolling down Nora's cheeks.

                                        NORA
                        How do you know?

          He holds out a hand.  A tense beat, then Nora dashes across
          the few dangerous yards separating them and leaps into
          his arms.

          WALT, BRUCE, and even Seybold collectively exhale.

          Johnny and Bruce wait amidst a crowd of milling PRESS.

          Stillson enters followed by the other panel members.  The
            Reporters surges toward him, shouting for comments. 
          Stillson quiets them with a gesture.

                        What we heard today was
                          frightening, not just because of
                        what did happen but because of
                        what could have.  Ultimately,
                        there was only one confirmed
                          fatality: Mr. Carter himself.

                        An incident like this is proof
                        that it's time for change in this
                          country.  These people may have
                        been misguided, but they were not
                          a threat that had to be met with
                        deadly force.  We need leaders
                        capable of understanding that
                          dialogue is more valuable than
                          confrontation, and that
                          intimidating others through
                          violence, because we disagree
                        with their religious choices,
                          compromises who we are as a people
                        and a nation.  Thank you.

          But the Reporters trail him anyway as he moves off,
          shouting flattering follow-up questions like "Is it true
          you're already considering a Senate run?"  that suggest
            Stillson, and not Johnny, is the man of the hour.

                        At least then there's hope.

          And as Nora turns and catches Johnny's eyes, we feel that
          hope in her shy but radiant smile.  Off Johnny...

                        Who are we?  Are we this flesh,*
                        these bodies of skin and sinew*
                        and bone, or are we something*
                        more?  If we believe all we are*
                        is flesh, we're lost, because*
                        flesh is weak.*

                        and humiliates us.*

                        spirit, bounded by flesh but not*
                        defined by it, then our path is*
                        clear.  Our eyes and ears are*

                        From the Divine spark that animated*
                        us, to the Fire that will consume*

                        us to surrender our earthly shells,*
                        in a final battle that honors our*

                        we will do so gladly.
