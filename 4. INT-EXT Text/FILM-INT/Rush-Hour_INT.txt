LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY
Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers
and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit
A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the
crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of
Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.
They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:
REPORTER
(to TV CAMERA)
Eager to mend its tarnished image,
Los Angeles has really put out the
welcome mat for tomorrow's summit.
The city promises quite a party as
leaders from Japan, China, South
Korea, Australia, the U.S. and
others begin talks for the largest
free-trade treaty in history.
The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries
arriving.
Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.
REPORTER (VO)
(continuing)
The one sour note is North Korea,
the only Pacific Rim country not
participating. There are rumors of
secret meetings with North Korean
representatives, but U.S. officials
insist the North must first hold
democratic elections, and halt its
nuclear weapons program -- as they
claimed to have done back in 1995.
We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.
Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.
The SCENE returns to LAX.
REPORTER (VO)
(continuing)
Tensions remain high since last
year's skirmishes between North Korea
and the U.S. So any chance of the
communist North joining the Pacific
Partners seems highly unlikely.
DISSOLVE TO:
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.
MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.
The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.
A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.
NEW ANGLE
The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.
SAM
I can't stand it -- half an hour to
get to the stupid school every
morning... with no music...
(Korean; subtitled)
[Just our damn Nanny...]
JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.
MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.
JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...
CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS
Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...
WIDER
Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.
Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.
Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.
And then it gets really nasty...
A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.
It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...
Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.
They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.
MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.
DRIVER
(Korean)
[Stay in the car.]
JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY
Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.
ANGLE WITH JAVAL
as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.
The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.
MERCEDES - DAY
Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.
JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.
JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.
Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...
But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.
INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES
Javal's device is armed, and waiting...
FADE TO:
CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.
PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.
Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.
Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.
Carson groans... he's DREAMING...
CUT TO:
CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT
Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.
CARSON
Son of a bitch!
He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...
MIRANDA
Pete... please... we have to be up
early tomorrow. Call the police.
CARSON
Yeah, right.
He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."
He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.
CARSON
(continuing)
Shit!
MIRANDA
pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.
MIRANDA
Not again...
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY
Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.
JOY
There are six bathrooms in this
house, Sam.
SAM
(fanning the air)
But only one with a smoking section.
She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY
Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.
Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiqus.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.
Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.
Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.
AMBASSADOR HAN
(Korean)
[Go change.]
Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.
AMBASSADOR HAN
(continuing)
[You smell like a fireplace.]
A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.
MRS. HAN
It's the Governess...
(into phone)
Hello, Hilda...
CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS
as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.
GOVERNESS
(thru phone)
Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY
MRS. HAN
(into phone)
We will see you next week...
(hangs up; smiles to kids)
It appears I'll be taking you to
school.
JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.
JAVAL
Very good. You may go now...
He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.
Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.
He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.
CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY
Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.
ANGLE ON TV
A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.
BOBBI
(on TV)
...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
July, the Olympics and Woodstock all
rolled into one! All over town
there'll be parades, concerts,
rallies, festivals... So get out
there everyone, but plan your drive-
time accordingly! This is Bobbi
Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...
We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.
MORNING ANCHOR (VO)
(on TV)
The President is on his way...
PRESIDENT
(on TV)
...It's an honor hosting my fellow
leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
city of the Pacific Rim...
We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.
MORNING ANCHOR
(on TV)
We'll see the menu for Mayor
Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
after this...
We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.
BACK TO SCENE
As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.
MIRANDA
I was watching that.
CARSON
If I hear one more Beach Boys song,
I'll shoot myself.
Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.
CARSON
(continuing; while smiling)
I said, if we were having sex once in
a while, you wouldn't need to ride
that fucking bike every morning.
MIRANDA
(hasn't heard a thing)
Be right with you...
As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.
Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."
CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY
Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.
Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."
MIRANDA
(looks him over)
Have you gotten any sleep lately?
CARSON
(ignores the question)
Shop's gonna tow the car in --
goddamn ignition's trashed.
MIRANDA
Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.
Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.
CARSON
You ask me, those suckers are a lost
cause.
She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.
MIRANDA
It's not for you.
CARSON
You mean it's not for you.
MIRANDA
I don't chase car thieves in my
underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
boredom if we ever sold this house
and moved.
CARSON
I'd die of shock, from finding
anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
Even for what it's worth now.
MIRANDA
Lots of people bought at the top of
the market...
CARSON
That sure cheers me right up.
MIRANDA
I don't know why we even talk about
it. The city's not the problem. So
we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
that saying: "Wherever you go, there
you are."
Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.
MIRANDA
(continuing)
I hope you're current on your
tetanus booster. Was it worth it?
CARSON
One cut... two assholes in the
hospital... Yep.
Carson glances at his watch and gets up.
CARSON
(continuing)
Well, another day of baby-sitting my
favorite bunch of people...
He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.
MIRANDA
Ask for a transfer.
CARSON
They're not gonna transfer me. You
know damn well why I was bumped down
to guard duty...
(as he's leaving)
My outstanding people skills.
Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.
MERCEDES - DAY
It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.
LISA
Hey, Joy... Sam...
Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.
LISA
(continuing)
Excellent -- I can't hear him!
SAM
(raps on window)
The glass is an inch thick.
(points to doors, roof)
Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
proof.
LISA
Perfect car for L.A.
(looks back at her Dad)
Starts, too.
FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.
Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).
They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm
Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder
rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.
ROBBINS
Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually
escaped the office!
DAVE
I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em
a chance to hose out my cage.
He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.
DAVE
(continuing)
Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?
ROBBINS
Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.
Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.
SABATINI
"Chuckles," as we're inclined to
call him.
(yawns; flops in a chair)
Friggin' graveyard shift...
ROBBINS
Love to know what dope made it the
Bureau's job to give full-time
protection to foreign consulates.
(offers coffee to Dave)
Cup a mud?
DAVE
Not if you made it. Why don't you
get Sabatini to brew the java? She's
the alleged chick.
SABATINI
Blow me.
DAVE
Where's Carson?
SABATINI
On his way. Some creeps tried to rip
off his Mustang last night.
(beat; solemnly)
They cut the ragtop.
DAVE
Motherfuckers...
Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attach case.
DAVE
(continuing)
Latest and greatest. Wireless
network link-ups.
SABATINI
Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.
ROBBINS
Me, too.
DAVE
Ingrates.
JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.
MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY
The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:
There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.
The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.
Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.
JAVAL'S VAN - SAME
Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.
INSERT
Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.
MERCEDES - DAY
The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.
JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.
Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.
FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.
Dave follows.
DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.
ROBBINS
Cherry?
DAVE
Under the seat.
Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.
ROBBINS
Siren?
DAVE
I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'
hurry..!
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.
He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.
He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:
SABATINI
Someone snatched Han's family! White
phone van, westbound on Washington!
Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.
CARSON
Give me a secure radio!
Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.
FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY
Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.
A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.
CO-WORKER
Someone's been to Nordstroms, big
time.
WALTHER
Clothes make the man.
CO-WORKER
But does the man make enough for the
clothes?
WALTHER
(smiles)
The man makes payments on his Visa.
Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.
SECRETARY
Mr. Walther... priority line!
WALTHER
(into phone)
This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl
Walther... What's the nature of your
emer --
(grimaces)
Aw, Jesus... not today...
(beat)
I'll inform channels and get a copter
in the air. For God's sake, keep it
quiet. Do what you can, but don't
endanger civilians or the family!
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.
CARSON
(into radio)
You bet -- nice and easy.
Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when
SCREECHING around a corner.
FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY
Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.
WALTHER
(into phone)
Get the Secretary of State on the
horn.
(listens)
I know he left already. I'm familiar
with the concept of time zones. Find
his ass.
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Carson turns the frequency on his two-way.
CARSON
(into radio)
Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on
its way.
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a
couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.
CARSON
(into radio)
Check it out! Ahead, on the right!
SABATINI (VO)
(thru radio)
Think it's them?
CARSON
(into radio)
Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll
move up; he won't suspect a civilian
car. Stay back, then get on his ass
when I signal. We'll box him in.
He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.
CARSON
(continuing; into radio)
If the Mod Squad gets in your way,
don't be shy about getting 'em out.
SABATINI (VO)
(thru radio)
Copy that one.
COLONEL LEE'S CAR - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the FBI cars as they pass.
DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way
to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.
SABATINI
Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!
JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.
HIS POV
As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.
JAVAL
grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.
JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.
Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.
Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.
JAVAL
I need to concentrate!
JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.
Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.
Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.
ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.
Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.
Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:
DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY
Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.
A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;
Engage the transmission;
And supply fuel to the carburetor.
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
CARSON
(into radio)
He's gonna wrap it around something!
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.
In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.
The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.
JAVAL
Does anyone need to use the rest
room? This will be your last
opportunity for a few hours.
(no takers)
Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,
please sit here.
(indicates the Lazy Boys;
then turns to Lisa)
And you... what is your name?
LISA
(after a beat)
Lisa...
Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:
JAVAL
No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.
He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.
JAVAL
(continuing; sotto)
You afford me some additional
bargaining power. But not much.
She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.
He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.
We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.
JAVAL
(continuing)
There. No taping your mouths, no
restraints. Please remain still
while I explain. The meters on the
left indicate sound pressure --
Decibels. There are microphones on
your chair backs. If you raise your
voices above certain level, putting
your meter in the red zone for more
than one sustained second, the
circuit will be closed.
(beat)
The right meters indicate motion.
There are pressure sensors inside the
armrests and seats. The sensors don't
like to get wet, so I hope you were
honest about not needing to use the
loo. If you make any excess
movements, or try to leave your
chair, the circuit will be closed.
MRS. HAN
I don't understand...
She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.
MRS. HAN
(continuing; softly)
What happens if the circuit closes?
JAVAL
Kaboom...
He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.
JAVAL
(continuing)
Easy... deep breath...
(to the kids)
Do each of you understand?
They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.
JAVAL
(continuing)
Keep your wits, and all will be fine.
He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.
COMMENTATOR #1
(on TV)
...Not since the '84 Olympics has the
whole city had an such an opportunity --
Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.
GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on
the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the
TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.
Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,
Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.
CARSON
I'm not so sure what happened here.
Something smells. Asshole was acting
like he wanted us to spot him...
WALTHER
What the hell are you talking about?
AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
Mr. Walther?
Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with
repressed emotion.
WALTHER
Ambassador Han... my deepest --
AMBASSADOR HAN
-- I have no wish for condolences.
Just answers.
WALTHER
As soon as we have any to give...
Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the
cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.
Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp
breath and sits on the steps.
AMBASSADOR HAN
(into phone)
Yoon..?!
CARSON
(to FBI agents)
Start a trace!
Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther
pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.
WALTHER
(into phone)
Mr. Secretary... they're alive!
COLONEL LEE
(to Carson; incensed)
You are tapping our phones?!
CARSON
(while crossing to
Ambassador Han)
Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl
Streep.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.
MRS. HAN
(into phone)
We are not hurt. But this man is
very serious --
He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.
JAVAL
(into phone)
I want you to remember the feeling
you had when you thought your family
was dead, and use it to inform the
choices you're about to make.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
CARSON
Say you want to talk to the kids...
AMBASSADOR HAN
(into phone)
I need to know my children are all
right.
JAVAL (VO)
(thru phone)
Be in front of a television in two
minutes. Tune it to channel four.
You'll get the picture.
Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.
AMBASSADOR HAN
There is a television in my office.
As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to
the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:
ROBBINS (VO)
(thru radio)
We're screwed on the trace -- he's
on a cell phone.
FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.
DAVE
Play the tape back. I might be able
to pull the electronic serial number
out of the subcarrier.
CARSON (VO)
(thru radio)
Ask Dave if he knows how to find the
phone's serial number.
ROBBINS
(smiles; into radio)
Hey, great idea...
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.
ANGLE ON TV
It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a
DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL
CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.
CLOSER
There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell
phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an
IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax
machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from
the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.
CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE
It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs
in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are
clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.
CARSON (OS)
Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!
(beat)
Look at the TV -- this was just
taken.
BACK TO SCENE
A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,
the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the
extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han
picks up the phone on his desk.
JAVAL (VO)
(thru phone)
There must surely be several people
in the room; you may put me on the
speakerbox if you wish.
Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others
look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.
JAVAL (VO)
(continuing; thru
speakerbox)
I am not a terrorist. Your
countries' political posturing means
nothing to me. So do not waste time
trying to negotiate.
(beat)
The Federal Reserve Bank of Los
Angeles can furnish ten million
dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The
required denominations are in the
instructions, as is the method of
packaging. Be in your car at 3:00
PM, and drive north on Highland
Avenue. I will call with where to
leave the money, which you will do
at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will
call again at 4:00 with the family's
location and the method for removing
them from their... predicament.
Could you please refer to page one?
(they look at the photo)
Any deviation from these instructions
and my device will fulfill its
function at exactly 5:00 PM.
CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.
AMBASSADOR HAN
(to Walther)
P'yngyang must approve the ransom...
WALTHER
Of course. The FBI's top Hostage
Negotiator is on the way --
CARSON
-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last
thing we need! This asshole sound
like he was interested in bargaining?
Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:
WALTHER
We have people who are experts in
these situations. We really feel it
would be best if you let them
coordinate everything...
Numb, Ambassador Han nods.
WALTHER
(continuing; to Carson)
Let's get on it...
FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.
CARSON
...You're gonna just pay up, count
on his good nature to return the
family?!
WALTHER
It's the President's intention to
keep this quiet, move forward with
the Summit, and work with the North
Koreans. Jesus, you've already
embarrassed the shit out of us over
the phone surveillance --
CARSON
-- They know their phones are tapped!
They tap our fucking phones!
WALTHER
That's not the point! The point is
not acknowledging it!
(beat)
We got an international incident
brewing, with a country we were
practically at war with last year!
Our best Negotiator is gonna run
point. If you got a problem, you can
take the goddamn rest of the day off.
CARSON
This Consulate is my responsibility.
WALTHER
Not any more.
Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.
WALTHER
(continuing)
That's the Negotiator. You do the
briefing.
Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.
CUT TO:
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.
Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee
and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)
CARSON
...Our worst enemy'll be the city.
There are events gearing up all
around town, and a dozen world
leaders arriving. Add the Friday
rush hour and usual L.A. bad
behavior and it'll be a nightmare
out there by 3 PM. It all works to
the advantage of the kidnapper,
hinders our pursuit efforts...
(frowns)
You don't agree?
WIDER
The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.
It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over
the breast pocket of her jacket.
MIRANDA
I'm wondering whether to believe him
when he says he's strictly motivated
by money.
CARSON
(grabs faxes back)
You see one word of Peoples'-
Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary
whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-
this-week bullshit in this entire
letter?
MIRANDA
I still want to check the MO against
known politicals, terrorists --
CARSON
-- Already doing it. We're
coordinating with the Secret
Service, the NSA and the CIA.
MIRANDA
Have someone talk to the LAPD, give
them a cover story for the media
about the crash on La Cienega.
Walther comes in and looks at Carson.
WALTHER
Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll
is your wife?!
This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.
CARSON
(while looking at Miranda)
If she'd changed her name when we
got married, I wouldn't have to.
MIRANDA
(to Carson)
I'm so enjoying this opportunity to
finally work together...
WALTHER
Jesus, forget I asked.
(beat)
The cash will be here in an hour.
(to Miranda)
Any thoughts on the kidnapper's
thoughts?
MIRANDA
Everything indicates he's working
alone. And his concerns do seem to
be solely about the money... so I
agree that he's only using the
Summit and the tension with North
Korea to create extreme motivation
to pay the ransom.
COLONEL LEE
I will bring the money to him.
CARSON
My ass.
COLONEL LEE
The hostages are citizens of the
People's Republic of Korea --
CARSON
-- Hey, do I go to the torture
chambers in your prisons, tell you
how to do your job?
WALTHER
All right, you're outta here! Is
this the same insubordinate crap you
pulled at Beverly Thrift?
Carson glares coldly at Walther.
CARSON
I'll coordinate the drop.
AMBASSADOR HAN
Perhaps that is better. Inspector
Carson knows the terrain --
COLONEL LEE
-- Then he can come with me.
Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.
WALTHER
(firm; to Carson)
It's settled.
CARSON
It sucks.
MIRANDA
But it means we can get on with it.
The Americans leave the room.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.
MIRANDA
(sotto)
Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.
If the Bureau had listened to Pete,
Beverly Thrift never would've
happened.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.
Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.
JAVAL
That's more like it...
He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.
WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY
In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-
decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.
Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.
An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.
FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of
kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.
DAVE
I wanted to be home by now, take the
kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.
SABATINI
We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,
L.A. was supposed to be a brown
blotch in the rear-view mirror.
She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.
Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.
He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.
MIRANDA
He'll expect a homing device --
CARSON
-- I expect him to expect it. He'll
check the cash with an RF detector...
(re larger transmitter)
Meaning he'll find this one.
(re smaller transmitter)
This only has a quarter-mile range,
but on a frequency too low to detect.
(turns off receiver)
And I doubt the asshole will have an
X-ray machine or a metal detector.
MIRANDA
Why must you always refer generically
to criminals as "assholes?"
CARSON
Gosh, you're right. It could
undermine their self-esteem and spoil
their chances for rehabilitation.
MIRANDA
You been reading my magazines in the
bathroom again?
She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:
JAVAL (VO)
(thru recorder)
"And my device will fulfill its
function at exactly 5:00 PM..."
MIRANDA
He's really exhibiting pressured
speech... big effort here to sound
calm. Same with his vocabulary... if
he were in control, he wouldn't feel
such a need to sound that way.
CARSON
Just tell me if we can use it.
MIRANDA
If we needle him he could get sloppy
and give us an opening, but I'm not
going to risk it. This is the worst
kind of perpetrator: anything makes
him deviate from his carefully-
scripted plan, he could become
extremely volatile.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,
pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.
MIRANDA (VO)
(thru headphones)
Do we have back-up if the bleeper
fails?
CARSON (VO)
(thru headphones)
Nothing but physical surveillance.
FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
MIRANDA
It's real important we don't lose
him. He didn't go through all the
trouble of designing that bomb not
to use it.
Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him.
CARSON
Well, it ain't gonna happen.
(beat; sotto)
Not again...
WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF
DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit
nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup.
The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
What the hell is the big crisis?
SECRETARY OF STATE
We just received a missive from the
North Korean attach. They say the
kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke
and humiliate them during the Summit.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
Bullshit. They're just ticked because
we don't want the Chinese dragging
their asses into the treaty talks.
The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
We have a covert operative in place.
He reports the hard-liners and
moderates in the High Command are
arguing about how to respond, should
the Premier's niece and her children
should be killed.
PRESIDENT
(scowls; thru video link)
Respond?! Christ. What about the
damn Premier?
SECRETARY OF STATE
He's weak. He has to look tough to
save face, keep control of hard-
liners... otherwise he risks a coup.
CIA CHIEF
Which is a real possibility. Most of
those old-fart Generals don't want to
-more-
CIA CHIEF (Cont'd)
be part of the Summit any more than
we want them to. They're mad as hell
he even talked to the Chinese.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
I don't want to deal with this right
now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell
the North we'll pay the ransom for
'em... Placate 'em! And make damn
sure we get that family back in one
piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?
FBI CHIEF
The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack
team in place.
SECRETARY OF STATE
There's a Diplomatic Liaison from
State, too.
CIA CHIEF
(to FBI Chief)
What about your man stationed at the
Consulate...
(refers to notes)
Carson? He was demoted from the FBI
Hostage Program, couple years back.
And this did happen on his watch...
FBI CHIEF
(irritated)
There's no way he could've prevented
this abduction! Besides, I've got one
of my top Negotiators in charge --
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
-- Whatever. I want a total news
blackout and I want this over with,
quickly! Without giving those Commie
little bastards any excuse to shit
all over my Summit!
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag
Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the
two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.
MIRANDA
(into phone)
Yes, please go ahead...
JAVAL (VO)
(long beat; thru phone)
Ah... this must be one of those
professionals --
MIRANDA
(into phone)
-- I'm only here to see that
everyone gets what they want --
JAVAL (VO)
(thru phone)
-- I've got my shotgun in little
Lisa's mouth, and I will pull the
trigger in five seconds unless you
put the Ambassador on the phone.
Miranda hands the phone to Ambassador Han.
MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
From the two-way radio in Carson's pocket:
MIRANDA (VO)
(thru radio)
The drop is at the DeMille barn,
across from the Hollywood Bowl.
You're to leave the money in the
center of the parking lot.
CARSON
(into radio)
Shit... no way we can set up a stake-
out in...
-more-
CARSON (Cont'd)
(checks watch)
Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers
at the Bowl. Have them clear the
area of civilians.
MIRANDA (VO)
(thru radio)
Remember, Pete... we're dealing with
a customer with a lot of rage.
CARSON
(to himself)
Must've bought a house same time we
did.
JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked
across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a
Summit-related concert is being readied.
Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.
MERCEDES - DAY
Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money
from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the
pavement. Carson looks around.
CARSON
(into radio)
There's about a hundred ways he can
scurry off like a cockroach from
here... So spread out.
Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs
a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.
DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel,
smacks his arm and points ahead:
JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector
wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them
makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.
DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY
The van pulls away.
Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving.
He looks up...
Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.
DAVE
Son of a bitch!
(into radio)
He found the bleepers -- both of
them!
MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
CARSON
(into radio)
Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like
he'll be hard to see in that truck.
Which way's he heading?
DAVE (VO)
(thru radio)
Toward the freeway.
Carson hangs a U-turn.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while
anxiously clutching her two-way radio.
MIRANDA
(into radio)
What happened?
CARSON (VO)
(thru radio)
We're made! Gotta grab him!
MIRANDA
(beat; into radio)
All right... Carefully...
MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun.
CARSON
Watch it! We need him alive!
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.
MIRANDA
(into radio)
Love to be in the loop on this...
PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.
PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.
The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...
JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.
CARSON
(to Walther)
...Scrounge us some bodies: National
Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local
PD's, meter maids --
WALTHER
-- They're gonna search the whole
city in a goddamn hour..?!
CARSON
Look, I don't need you to tell me
how fucked we are!
WALTHER
Fuck you!! Every time you're on a
case something explodes!
Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:
MIRANDA
Stop! The clock's running! Arguing
is a luxury we can't afford!
-more-
MIRANDA (Cont'd)
(looks at Carson)
What's done is done. There'll be
plenty of time to point fingers
later.
Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.
SABATINI
I need some fuckin' ink!!
Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.
In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.
AMBASSADOR HAN
This is impossible! How can you even
begin to find them?
Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.
MIRANDA
Well, the normal procedure is to
negotiate with the perpetrator...
Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.
CARSON
Let's take stock. We've got a picture
of where he hid the family, and
recordings of his calls --
MIRANDA
-- That's right! We can send them to
our experts for analysis...
CARSON
(to Ambassador Han)
Same with his fingerprints. But that
means we need high-quality image and
data transmission. We can piss away
ten minutes coptering this shit to
our offices in Westwood, or we can
use your surveillance equipment.
COLONEL LEE
There is no surveillance equipment.
This is a diplomatic facility --
CARSON
-- You want to play games, fine.
He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.
AMBASSADOR HAN
Take them upstairs.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.
Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.
CARSON
South Korean Consulate's just down
the street -- want to take a listen?
Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.
Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.
CARSON
(continuing; re hand)
Shitcan that thing, will you?!
She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.
CARSON
(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
Got a digital scanner?
COLONEL LEE
Analog.
CARSON
(looks equipment over)
You might want to drop a few bucks at
Radio Shack and get with the decade.
(into radio)
Dave -- get in here. Bring your
computer, a city map, and the tapes
of the ransom calls.
DAVE (VO)
(thru radio)
On my way...
He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.
MIRANDA
(to Colonel Lee)
Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe
him to the Ambassador, see if it's
anyone he knows.
Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.
CARSON
(into phone)
This is Carson in L.A. There's a set
of prints coming over. Narrow the
search criteria: Male, thirties,
Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,
maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and
bombers first. We need an answer in
fifteen minutes.
HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY
A TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high-
resolution computer monitor.
FINGERPRINT TECH
(into phone)
That yellow air out there finally
rot your brain?! It's impossible!
CARSON (VO)
(thru phone)
Dazzle me.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:
CARSON
(to Walther)
We got one of the best sound guys
right here in town...
(into phone)
Newman in Audio Analysis...
DAVE (OS)
Newman's gone.
WIDER
Dave comes into the room.
DAVE
He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a
bed and breakfast in Wyoming.
Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.
DAVE
(continuing; looks around)
Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like
to see the fight tonight.
CARSON
Get those tapes transferred to a
sound guy. We need ambient and
background analysis, the whole
enchilada.
DAVE
Enchilada -- you saying that because
I'm Mexican?
CARSON
No... 'cause you're fat.
MIRANDA
(picks up Javal's fax)
Photo enhancement... Isn't there
some amazing tech with the LAPD --
DAVE
-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle
PD a month ago.
CARSON
Jesus H. Christ...
SABATINI
I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA
earn their keep.
CARSON
Do it.
Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to
Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the
dust on her fingertip.
MIRANDA
Given his behavior, this orange
residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.
Amphetamines.
CARSON
Any significance?
MIRANDA
It's consistent with the lone wolf
scenario: A handful of these is pure
bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the
psychosis and paranoia kick in.
(beat)
We could check pharmacy records, on
the remote chance he got them
legally... if we had a couple of
weeks, that is.
CARSON
(to Sabatini)
Get the Bureau on it.
MIRANDA
Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.
CARSON
Look, goddammit, you start skipping
no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all
quit and go to the beach right now.
Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and
nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.
CARSON
(continuing)
He grabbed the family at 8:30. The
last certain visual we had was just
before his van went into the alley
on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the
Consulate at 9:30.
MIRANDA
That gives him about fifty minutes
to get to his location, move and
secure the hostages, and activate
his time bomb.
CARSON
He probably waited a while to pad
the time -- he wanted us know the
family was still alive...
(sotto; re Koreans)
...So these crazy bastards wouldn't
throw a premature shit hemorrhage,
but he didn't want to call too soon,
either. I say they're within 15 to
20 minutes, via surface streets, of
where we last saw them.
He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,
Hollywood to Inglewood.
MIRANDA
The most densely-populated part of
the L.A. basin. This narrows it down
to about 200,000 dwellings.
A beat while this sinks in.
MIRANDA
(continuing)
He was traveling west --
CARSON
-- Bet he doubled back.
MIRANDA
C'mon, that's total conjecture --
SABATINI
(re Carson)
-- I'd trust his instincts when
dealing with maniacs. He is deeply
disturbed.
MIRANDA
You're telling me?
WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since
we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,
is pacing on Air Force One.
SECRETARY OF STATE
...North Koreans have gone ballistic,
accusing us of botching the ransom
drop on purpose.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
They're still harping on that
"American plot" nonsense.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
Meaning?
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
They say the death of the Premier's
niece and her family would justify
immediate retaliation.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!
What kind of retaliation?
Everyone in the room looks at one another.
CIA CHIEF
They're threatening to pull a Saddam
Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed
at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?
(beat)
They're talking about firing a
missile into Los Angeles --
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
-- A goddamn WHAT??
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range
cruise -- their version of our
Tomahawk, launched from offshore.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will
find the city, but it's not too
accurate beyond that.
VICE PRESIDENT
Still, for their purposes it's
perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take
out a city block or two...
SECRETARY OF STATE
To the eyes of the world it's a
measured response -- like what Reagan
did to Qaddafi. But actually striking
at an American city would be a huge
psychological victory for them.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
I don't believe I'm hearing this!
(beat)
So if we know it's coming, we can
knock it out of the fuckin' sky!
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
These weapons fly subsonically, below
radar... we don't have the defenses
in place... If we'd had the time to
deploy a string of Patriot anti-
missile batteries across the coast --
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
-- You're saying we got all this
lousy hardware and can't stop one
goddamn missile??
Everyone's silence answers his question.
PRESIDENT
(continuing; thru video
link)
I want an immediate search for all
ships within range.
FBI CHIEF
We better inform the other leaders,
stall on the Summit --
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
There's no reason to panic yet --
they can't launch until after the
family's confirmed dead!
CIA CHIEF
Afraid that's not the case...
The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with
FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
The North Korean Premier holds what
we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's
able to destroy a missile in flight,
right up to the moment before it
achieves its target.
CIA CHIEF
Our Op says they've timed their
retaliation to hit right after 5:00.
FBI CHIEF
And if the family turns up okay,
they'll just make it self-destruct.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
Shit! I really don't need this today!
VICE PRESIDENT
We're forgetting one thing here: the
family. Intelligence is sure the
North will abort their attack if Mrs.
Han and her kids are safely returned?
CIA CHIEF
Absolutely. Their whole game depends
on claiming a legitimate provocation.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Still, we should let them know there'd
be a response... if it comes to it.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
I'd like to turn 'em into a
radioactive parking lot.
SECRETARY OF STATE
That's the problem: we can't. We're
the last superpower. Our hands are
tied by politics, alliances, goddamn
stacks of treaties... most we could
do is give 'em a "measured response"
back again, or everyone starts
crying that we're the bullies.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians
wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a
stunt like this.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
Believe me, the North drops one in
my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in
theirs. Get some bombers in the air.
And don't tell me any more bad news!
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
CARSON
(into radio)
Cute.
(to Miranda)
He signed the name of the Allied
Commander during the Korean War.
Maybe he was a political.
MIRANDA
No. The phony ice cream truck, the
booby-trapped chairs... he could've
-more-
MIRANDA (Cont'd)
done it without half that stuff. But
this was going to be the score of a
lifetime... he was showing off.
CARSON
(to Dave)
Who's got those kinds of skills:
Electronics, vehicle customizing,
computers, explosives?
DAVE
Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your
average high-school student if
they're so inclined. My guess is our
perp used off-the-shelf equipment
for everything except the C-4, and
that's only slightly harder to get
than crack or heroin, if you know
who to ask.
PARKER CENTER - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
Everyone who can be spared, even moth-eaten SUPPORT PERSONNEL,
hustle through the maze of hallways and get into waiting cars.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Bobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity.
BOBBI
This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye
in the Sky... back to you, Brent...
The red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot.
BOBBI
(continuing; furious)
Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that
entire segment!
(as if to a child)
Keep... the sun... to my left!!
The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other.
BOBBI
(continuing)
What's new on the kidnapping rumor?
CAMERAMAN
Nada. Total news blackout.
BOBBI
Go back over the hill.
NEWS PILOT
We got the valley traffic report in
fifteen --
BOBBI
-- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed!
Sig alert..!" I'll improvise!
She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her
purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She
takes a huge swig and grimaces.
BOBBI
(continuing; to Cameraman)
What are you lookin' at? I was the
morning anchor in Houston! And I'm
one break away from getting out of
this stupid fuckin' whirlybird!
BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY
The Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy
carefully turns to her mother.
JOY
Why us?
MRS. HAN
You heard him -- for money.
JOY
What if something goes wrong?
MRS. HAN
(firmly)
It won't.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Carson grabs his FBI blazer off the back of a chair.
CARSON
I'm going to the kidnapping site.
MIRANDA
I want to talk to the witnesses.
Colonel Lee also heads for the door. Carson looks at him.
CARSON
Great, we'll hire a bus.
They leave. Dave, meanwhile, paces, phone in hand.
DAVE
(into phone)
...I know it's privileged
information, goddammit! Lemme talk
to a supervisor... You are a
supervisor... Lemme talk to your
goddamn supervisor... I told you,
I'm with the FBI...
(to Sabatini)
Cellular company says he was using a
phone with a cloned number.
SABATINI
Big surprise. Have 'em send a list of
the numbers called on the account.
DAVE
That's what I'm trying to get.
They're saying I need a subpoena.
(into phone)
Don't put me on hold... Don't...
(pulls phone from his ear)
I'm listening to Michael fuckin'
Bolton!
SABATINI
Walther! Get on the horn to Justice
and deal with this!
FISHING TRAWLER - DAY
Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean
SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure
a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.
Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of
high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged
CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...
FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY
The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his
headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.
Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.
The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.
Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.
Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Ambassador Han, Walther and Sabatini are looking at a series
of high-definition faxes spread out on a table.
Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee hurry back in. Disgusted,
Carson throws his jacket on a chair.
CARSON
Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was
working alone, and he was a vicious
son of a bitch. Old news.
COLONEL LEE
(to Ambassador Han)
And our car was stolen.
AMBASSADOR HAN
I felt safer when I was the
Ambassador to Libya.
SABATINI
Image enhancements came back.
POV OF PICTURES
The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of
the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.
BACK TO SCENE
Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to
look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.
CARSON
We going steady?
SABATINI
The sun position tells us the
windows are facing northeast.
(beat)
Here's the best -- look at the glass
on the prints hanging in the
background. There's a reflection of
a reflection, out on the street: the
corner of a billboard.
CARSON
Looks like the wheel of a car.
MIRANDA
We talked about these billboards,
when we were car shopping! Four-
door... they make a wagon, too.
(beat)
Something Japanese... God, what was
it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You
thought it had no character.
CARSON
I thought that about all of them.
C'mon, think, dammit!!
MIRANDA
You think!! You were there, too!
They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:
CARSON
Call the outdoor advertising
companies. Get the location of all
the billboards for Japanese cars
within our search parameters.
Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:
DAVE
(into phone)
...Peerless Auto Security. We need
to know whether you've sold a large
quantity of these components to any
one customer, or whether you'd had
any stolen recently...
WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - GENERAL KAI'S OFFICE - DAY
General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major
Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the
others leave the room before General Kai picks it up.
WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY
Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call
with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him.
CUT TO:
BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY
Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is
trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry.
MRS. HAN
He asked you if you had to go...
The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at
first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level
meters all begin to creep upward...
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...
JOY
Oh, my God...
The meters are hovering just below the red...
SAM
pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger
than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.
He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...
He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.
And his meter drops to zero.
WIDER
Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...
He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.
Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...
Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.
Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...
All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light
stops flashing.
Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts
laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.
WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK
The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,
still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the
tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
Uh, it's a code name... for weapons
using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...
He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President
about this.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
(continuing)
Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347
they attacked a Genoese fort, and
catapulted infected corpses over the
walls. The Genoese who survived
carried the disease back to Europe...
and it killed half the population.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
Get to the goddamn point, Major.
The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.
CIA CHIEF
Seems the missile is armed with a
warhead carrying the Pneumonic
Plague.
The President goes nuts.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
The Black Plague?! Every time I talk
to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!
What happened to this "limited
retaliation" shit?
SECRETARY OF STATE
The North Koreans insist the missile
carries a conventional payload. They
say we're trying to trick them into
aborting the attack.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Especially since the uplink from our
Op in P'yngyang was unencrypted.
CIA CHIEF
We think one of the Hard-liners
switched the warhead without the
Premier's knowledge. But he's not
about to take our word for it, and
he's too weak to risk the
humiliation of backing down.
PRESIDENT
(incredulous; thru video
link)
They use a biological weapon on
American soil, they have to know
we'll respond!
SECRETARY OF STATE
Maybe they don't think we got the
guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause
they think they can whip us, like
what happened in 'Nam. Look who
we're dealing with: a teetering,
outlaw regime, and inside it, some
wild-ass renegades working their
screwy agenda!
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
What the hell are we doing in L.A.?
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
We've deployed Marines from Pendleton
and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft.
Irwin, put 'em in protective suits,
but it's 40 minutes before they're on
the ground.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
All right. Assuming the worst...
What'll happen?
The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his
COMPUTER GRAPHICS.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
The warhead vents the plague
bacteria above the target area,
infecting about 50,000 people. First
symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes
become swollen; temperature rises to
105. Victims turn deep purple from
lung hemorrhaging, usually die the
same day.
(beat)
There are treatments -- streptomycin
and tetracyclines -- but we'd be
overwhelmed by the numbers and its
extreme contagiousness.
CIA CHIEF
We could have 500,000 infected in a
week, who knows how many after that.
Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have
the Summit leaders been warned?
FBI CHIEF
Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.
'til we give the all-clear.
PRESIDENT
(thru video link)
And you're sure it's safe if we can
get 'em to destroy the missile in
flight?
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
The bacteria can't survive the heat
of an explosion.
CIA CHIEF
I suggest none of this go any
further -- not even to the agents
working to find the family. Word
leaks out to a city of 12 million
people there's rocket full of the
Plague coming at 'em, you'll create
a panic of biblical proportions.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Everyone is painfully on edge. Ambassador Han paces. The FBI
agents are on a phone or a radio, working leads.
Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean.
CARSON
Say what?
COLONEL LEE
Perhaps someone will decide it is
foolish to incur the wrath of North
Korea.
CARSON
(crosses to Colonel Lee)
Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole
thing. And we're knocking our heads,
trying to find your people, just for
show.
WALTHER
Carson...
CARSON
Let's grab a few beers, kick back
'til five o'clock rolls by. Then
maybe we can have a war over it. I
think that's a great idea, seeing as
how you fuckers have needed your
clocks cleaned for fifty years now!
COLONEL LEE
(gets up)
Why wait until five?
Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from
going at each other.
MIRANDA
Pete!
(sotto)
Christ, you're self-indulgent!
There's nothing but anger and
cynicism left inside you, so they're
all you can express any more. No
wonder everyone in the Bureau thinks
you're such a nutcase!
CARSON
Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep
around the office... "Dr. Knoll-It-
All."
MIRANDA
(hurt)
You've been dying to tell me that...
She walks away. Carson immediately regrets saying it.
CARSON
Miranda...
(to himself)
Shit.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Robbins is still working the phone.
ROBBINS
(into phone)
...Yeah, Peerless Auto Security...
fine... get your manager...
He puts the receiver down, hits the speakerbox button and the
mute button. He crosses to Dave's desk to grab some papers.
We can hear the CONVERSATION at the alarm shop:
INSTALLER #1 (VO)
(thru speakerbox; muffled)
Tell Jerry, pick up line one!
AUTO SECURITY SHOP - DAY
A group of young INSTALLERS horse around as they outfit luxury
cars with security systems, high-end audio components, etc.
INSTALLER #2
Jerry's outta here!
INSTALLER #1
Some cop's asking if we sold a bunch
of Peerless parts.
INSTALLER #2
Talk to Javal!
INSTALLER #1
Javal's off today.
INSTALLER #3
Dude's off a lot.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
INSTALLER #4 (VO)
(thru speakerbox)
He's used to it -- fuckin' Frenchies
get the whole summer off.
INSTALLER #2 (VO)
(thru speakerbox)
Man's Canadian, dickweeds!
INSTALLER #1 (VO)
(thru speakerbox)
You're gonna have to call back on
Monday...
Carson rushes over to the phone. To the others in the room:
CARSON
Everyone shut up!
(into phone)
Guy on vacation, the Canadian --
INSTALLER #1 (VO)
(thru speakerbox)
-- Yeah, Javal...
CARSON
(into phone)
Six foot, sandy hair, spooky eyes?
INSTALLER #1 (VO)
(thru speakerbox; laughs)
Zombie Eyes! You know the man?
Carson and Miranda look at each other. Bingo!
CARSON
(into phone)
I need a full name, address,
anything you got!
INSTALLER #1 (VO)
(thru speakerbox)
Paul Javal... hang on, we'll look it
up... This an immigration thing?
Shit, he's our best installer.
NEW ANGLE
One of the Korean Espionage Agents answers a RINGING phone on
Colonel Lee's desk, listens, then hits the hold button.
ESPIONAGE AGENT
Inspector Carson, extension 666...
CARSON
That's appropriate...
(to Dave)
In 30 seconds you're gonna give me
Paul Javal's shoe size.
Carson hurries over, grabs the phone. We SEE him punch the
button for x666.
CARSON
(continuing; into phone)
Carson...
FBI SOUND LAB - DAY
EDWARDS, headphones around his neck, sits in front of a wall
of audio analysis equipment.
CARSON (VO)
(thru phone)
Whatta you got?
EDWARDS
(into phone)
Ambient background sound is normal
city stuff, but there's a distinct
echo pattern. Your people are in or
near a high-rise that's at least
eight floors tall. And there are
other high-rises nearby.
CARSON (VO)
(thru phone)
How high up are they?
EDWARDS
(into phone)
No way to extrapolate that from the
sample you gave us.
(refers to notes)
One more thing: There's an emergency
siren approaching at 17 seconds into
the second call, passing the location
at 33.5 seconds.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Carson hangs up the phone.
CARSON
Okay -- high-rises in our search
area. Eight stories or higher.
MIRANDA
Downtown, Century City, Westwood
corridor, Museum Row, Mid-
Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip
there's a few...
CARSON
Sabatini! What about that billboard?
SABATINI
Nothing yet! Everyone's left their
goddamn offices already!
CARSON
(to Robbins)
LAPD will have a record of all
emergency vehicles running Code 3 at
9:32 AM. Get their starting point
and their destination.
MIRANDA
And have them narrow their foot-
searches to areas around high-rises.
CARSON
(to Dave)
Where's that fuckin' address?!
DAVE
I'm still holdin'!
Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM
connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the
keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair
longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable.
DAVE
(continuing)
He's on our hit parade. Interpol
passed us his records when he
entered the country.
(reads)
French by birth... looks like a total
scumbag.
SABATINI
Isn't that redundant?
DAVE
(reads from computer)
Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe;
served some short stretches, petty
shit... arrested for kidnapping, no
conviction. Did four years in France
for blowing bank vaults. Moved to
U.S. last year. Clean since then.
CARSON
Get his Driver's License number;
Social; bank accounts; charge cards;
club memberships... find out what
movies he rented.
Get whoever's
closest to the Auto Shop to get in
there, interview everybody.
MIRANDA
This sure was a ballsy move for a
car-alarm installer.
CARSON
Hey, he watched the news... Everyone
knows the U.S. will do anything to
avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.
They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard.
MIRANDA
Ambassador --
CARSON
-- Quit apologizing for me!
MIRANDA
Quit giving me reasons to!
AMBASSADOR HAN
(to Carson)
On occasion, my wife has been known
to kick my ankle under the table.
Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look.
CARSON
Sounds like her aim's a little low.
Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a
piece of paper.
DAVE
Address, according to the Auto Shop.
CARSON
(looks at paper)
Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise!
Sabatini -- you're with us.
(off Robbins' disappointed
look)
She's got the field experience.
Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops.
MIRANDA
There still could be accomplices.
If there are, they'll hear us in
the helicopter.
Carson looks again at the address...
CARSON
There's a TV station a couple blocks
away. We'll land on their pad.
(to Robbins)
K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a
SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to
hang back unless we need 'em.
OSAKA APARTMENT - DAY
In the tiny bedroom of a wheelchair-bound JAPANESE TEENAGER,
computers and HAM RADIO equipment are stacked everywhere.
He turns on a tape recorder. We hear a faint, crackling VOICE:
OPERATIVE'S VOICE (VO)
(on recorder)
...Missile heading to L.A. has a
Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
Kipchak equipped!
The Teenager rolls to a computer running CompuServe. He clicks
the CHAT icon, types: "Anyone up on their spy terminology?"
BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY
With the gardeners gone, and their sound sensors disabled,
Mrs. Han, Joy and Sam are SHOUTING for help.
They listen for a response; it is completely quiet.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel
Lee rush into the lobby.
Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...
And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.
Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.
CARSON
(pulls out his i.d.)
Whoa... FBI..!
They lower their weapons.
CARSON
(continuing)
How the hell you get here so fast?
SWAT TEAM #1
They're shootin' a cop movie down
the street. We're workin' as extras.
CARSON
Terrific. Who else is here?
SWAT TEAM #1
Three officers on the roof, next
building over, and two in the tenth-
floor hallway.
CARSON
Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.
(to Concierge)
Give me your master key.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY
Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.
Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.
He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.
As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.
The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.
WOMAN
What the fuck..!
Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.
MIRANDA
Sorry...
Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.
CARSON
(to Miranda)
Wait here.
She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.
Carson cautiously goes into the living room --
It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macram ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.
CARSON
(into radio)
I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight
while I look around.
Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles
uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.
MIRANDA
I like what you've done with the
place...
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K; MP-5 in hand.
SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with
Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.
COLONEL LEE
Wait!
Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.
SABATINI
Where's Carson?
COLONEL LEE
Inside.
Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.
He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...
He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.
Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.
He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.
Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.
Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.
We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.
CARSON
NO! --
Too late... The front door opens....
Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...
As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.
Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.
Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.
Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...
And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.
CARSON
I said keep everyone back!!
He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.
MIRANDA
Stop it!
Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.
CARSON
(to Colonel Lee)
Get out of my sight.
He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
It's in between reports. The Cameraman listens to the Grateful
Dead on a BOOM BOX. Bobbi answers her ringing CELL PHONE.
BOBBI
(into phone)
Marchfelder.
STATION MANAGER (VO)
(thru phone)
You dated the Mayor, right?
BOBBI
(sighs; into phone)
You need a traffic ticket fixed?
STATION MANAGER (VO)
(excited; thru phone)
Try to confirm something for us.
There's an incredible buzz on the
Internet -- someone picked up a
classified message on a U.S.
Intelligence frequency. We think
it's authentic!
GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee
sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.
Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let
Sabatini's death slow him down.
CARSON
(into radio)
What's the status?
ROBBINS (VO)
(thru radio)
Wilshire and West PD Divisions had
seven vehicles running with sirens at
9:32. They're getting the routes from
the officers now.
CARSON
(into radio)
Hurry it the hell up.
He glances over at Miranda. After a beat:
CARSON
(continuing)
I should've known she'd come up.
MIRANDA
Pete --
CARSON
-- "Should've." Shit, there's a
familiar word.
(long beat)
That day... I was there soon enough.
We should've rushed 'em, before they
could finish setting up...
MIRANDA
The Bureau never would've let you.
They want it by the book: talk them
out.
Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...
DISSOLVE TO:
BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY
Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:
A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.
The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.
Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...
The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.
Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...
DISSOLVE TO:
GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
CARSON
Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.
MIRANDA
You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your
decision. You can't keep living as
such a raw nerve, never sleeping --
CARSON
-- Those kids were ten years old!
(sotto)
Same age as the Han boy...
He turns away. She takes his hand.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we
CUT TO:
HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY
Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,
construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc.
A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads:
This Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated
For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,
then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.
CARSON
C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank
records? What about cross-referencing
possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!
Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the
surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.
Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:
MIRANDA
Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!
(reaches for phone)
Where are the numbers for the
outdoor ad companies?
ROBBINS
Parker Center's making those calls.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:
BOBBI
Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!
CAMERAMAN
Maybe it's true... probably is true.
That's why they got a news blackout!
BOBBI
I'll rip your miserable eyeballs
out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!
He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY
The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...
BOBBI
(on TV)
...A warning was radioed to U.S.
Intelligence that a biological weapon,
allegedly containing the deadly
Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los
Angeles. While unconfirmed, the
President and other leaders are all
late in arriving...
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.
Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a
long column of telephone numbers.
DAVE
Finally got the call list from
Javal's phone. Most aren't his;
they're from the legit user who
didn't know his number was cloned.
CARSON
Go to the bottom of the list, work
back through the last 12 hours.
Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.
DAVE
Here's the call to the Consulate --
965-5000.
(while scrolling)
The rest are dupes... all from the
other guy...
CARSON
Wait... go back... the one at seven
this morning...
Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666.
WIDER
Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk.
(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE
from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button.
(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP
on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."
BACK TO SCENE
Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.
Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.
Time stands still.
Realization.
Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.
Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.
CARSON
Get down!
Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.
The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North
Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.
Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.
Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.
Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.
Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.
CARSON
(continuing)
MIRANDA!
Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.
Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.
Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.
Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.
She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.
Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.
OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car
ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...
MIRANDA
Go..!
CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY
As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and
Ambassador Han gets in.
CARSON
Get the fuck out of here!
Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson
sighs and tears out of the driveway.
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Carson looks around at the chaos around them.
CARSON
Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out
here!
Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:
FM NEWSCASTER (VO)
(thru car radio)
...These words, which have terrified
the city:
RECORDING OF BOBBI (VO)
(thru car radio)
...A biological weapon, allegedly
containing the deadly Pneumonic
Plague, is approaching Los Angeles...
Stunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his
face in his hands.
CARSON
(into radio)
Miranda..!
MIRANDA (VO)
(thru radio)
I heard. I'm in the copter.
CARSON
(into radio)
I want you to get out of here...
GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is
beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her.
MIRANDA
(into radio)
Shut up and keep your eyes on the
road. That's my goddamn car.
(beat; into radio)
Dave? You staying on top of the
research?
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while
hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He
grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking.
DAVE
(into radio)
I can't... My kids...
MIRANDA (VO)
(thru radio; calmly)
Listen: the best way to help them is
to stay at your computer. If any
information comes in, holler. Okay?
He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat:
DAVE
(into radio)
Okay...
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY
Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps
off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:
BOBBI
Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull
back... show the other copters around
us... this is fuckin' great...
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.
CARSON
...The Colonel hired Javal, made it
look like he was working alone. Then
he made sure Javal got killed, so
we'd never find your family -- and
they'd have an excuse to drop their
bomb. But what's in it for 'em?
AMBASSADOR HAN
There are men in my government whose
power depends on North Korea staying
as it is: Socialist, repressive,
isolated from the world. They'll
resort to anything, even war, to
keep it that way. They have the
Hitler Syndrome: if their country
cannot exist the way they want it,
they would rather see it destroyed.
APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Marine MAJOR VREELAND and his PILOT sit in the lead
helicopter, an Apache Gunship.
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Carson leans on the HORN and tries to push through traffic.
VREELAND (VO)

FBI, this is Major Vreeland.
Discontinue your pursuit, we're

VREELAND (VO)
(thru radio)
We've got the situation in hand.
COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY
Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into
the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate.
APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper
body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable
S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher.
Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel
Lee, but there's no time...
VREELAND
(to Pilot)
Shit! Pull back!
CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY
Carson and Ambassador Han watch with horror.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
A hundred yards away, they're BUFFETED by the explosion.
BOBBI
(to TV camera)
Jesus fuckin' God!!!
(beat; smiles)
Uh, I think we're gonna set down
now. Back to you, Brent.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY
The Han family watches the TV, amazed, as Colonel Lee ducks
back down into the Mercedes and closes the sunroof.
JOY
I always hated that guy...
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson
looks at Ambassador Han:
CARSON
One of yours?
(Han nods)
What the hell do you need heat-
seeking rockets for in L.A.?
AMBASSADOR HAN
There could be another riot...
CARSON
(shakes his head)
And they call me Mr. Overkill.
(into radio)
Dave, what do you know about...
He looks at Han.
AMBASSADOR HAN
Strela-2...
CARSON
(into radio)
Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Dave, calmer but still sweating, taps at his computer. A
schematic of Colonel Lee's rocket launcher appears on it.
DAVE
(into radio)
I'm with ya... Strela-2. Perenosniy
zenitniy raketniy kompleks. Russian
factory index 9K-32-M2 --
CARSON (VO)

POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Miranda has hitched a ride in a black-and-white.
MIRANDA
(into radio)
Stay back. LAPD's putting up a
roadblock.
NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY
Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand...
WIDER
The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station.
Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a
KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter...
Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY
stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the
copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:
BOBBI
Save it for someone who gives a
shit!
COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers,
angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.
CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes.
Carson catches up to it.
DAVE (VO)
(thru radio)
...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to
arm, so stay tight on his ass.
Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han
braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him.
CARSON
That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses
you'd like to tell me about?
AMBASSADOR HAN
I don't think so -- they said it was
solid as a rock.
CARSON
(looks at his crumpled car)
No shit...
As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.
Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.
Carson looks up just in time to see...
A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.
Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo
CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.
The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han
from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:
AMBASSADOR HAN
(dazed)
I can't believe I'm still alive...
CARSON
This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.
Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him
on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.
AMBULANCE - DAY
Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking
for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag.
NEWS COPTER - DAY
Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the
minimart, listening to this exchange on a POLICE SCANNER. Her
Cameraman is eating a microwave burrito. Bobbi jumps in, grabs
the ENG camera, and yells at her Pilot:
BOBBI
Get this fuckin' thing in the air!
(to Cameraman)
Out! Not enough room for four.
CAMERAMAN
(as they TAKE OFF)
What am I supposed to do when the
plague comes, hold my breath?
POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
They rapidly cut through the traffic.
MIRANDA
(into radio)
Switch to a secure channel.
(flips a switch)
What on earth are you thinking?
CARSON (VO)
(thru radio)
I'll make him open the sunroof.
Someone can shoot tear gas or a
percussion grenade inside.
MIRANDA
(into radio)
Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or
anything on me, have you?
CARSON (VO)
(thru radio)
No way. I couldn't stand making so
many people happy.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Carson closes the door, then sees Bobbi.
CARSON
You?! I wanted a police copter!
PILOT
Just tell me what to do. I flew two
tours in 'Nam.
BOBBI
And he doesn't go unless I go!
CARSON
Wrong-o...
CUT TO:
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
They follow the 110 north. Ahead, Carson sees the Mercedes
cutting across lanes.
CARSON
(into radio)
Got 'im -- looks like he's headed
for the 101.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.
It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.
Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.
He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.
CARSON
(to Pilot)
Pull hard to the left, on my
signal...
He braces himself on door jamb...
Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.
CARSON
Now!
The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and
the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.
A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.
POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Miranda sees what Carson is doing.
MIRANDA
You fucking lunatic!!
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
The News Pilot looks over at Carson.
PILOT
Hope you got more flares than he's
got rockets.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks
the top off... and it doesn't ignite.
Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.
The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.
Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.
AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he
peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.
MIRANDA
You're completely deranged! Playing
chicken with rockets!
CARSON
Well, what the hell were you doing
out there?
AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
What are both of you doing?
Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his
arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.
CARSON
Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!
Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.
Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that
are parting like the Red Sea for him.
MIRANDA
Even if we can pry him out with...
(looks at her watch)
Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll
be very cooperative.
CARSON
I'll just use my outstanding people
skills.
Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:
Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...
CARSON
(continuing; to Ambassador
Han)
That car's like a rock, right?
COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the
park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.
COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY
WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...
Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Dave sits in front of his computer, phone receiver resting on
his shoulder, riveted by the ACTION on the TV.
DAVE
Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned
into Dirty Harriet!
He turns as his MODEM squawks and another download comes in.
DAVE
(continuing; into phone)
You're sure there were no accounts in
the other names I gave you?
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
The family stares at the TV. Mrs. Han purses her lips...
fighting it... a tear rolls down her face. The time: 4:51.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Dave is looking at the TV, paying no attention to his
computer.
INCLUDE COMPUTER
as some bank records are being downloaded: faxed IMAGES of
processed checks SCROLL down the screen.
CARSON (VO)
(thru radio)
Anything else come through?
DAVE
(numb; into radio)
Take a hint. We're screwed.
CARSON (VO)
(thru radio)
Not yet...
Shaking his head, Dave glances at his computer...
CLOSER
Just in time to glimpse the words "First & Last + Deposit" on
one of the checks as it scrolls off the screen.
DAVE
fumbles to scroll back to the check.
DAVE
(into radio)
Wait! One of Javal's alias accounts:
check for an apartment rental!
CARSON (VO)
(thru radio)
You're shittin'... Where?!
CUT TO:
APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Miranda looks at Carson, then checks her watch. 4:52.
CARSON
(into radio)
...Have the Manager evacuate the
complex. Find out which unit the
family's in, but don't let anyone go
in 'til we get there.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
Dave, re-energized, is juggling the phone and the radio.
DAVE
(into radio)
Private security's going around with
PA's, and they set off the fire alarm.
(into phone)
Well, try callin' him again!
(into radio)
Manager's gone, and the Assistant
can't find the key to get to the
rental manifest.
(into phone)
Then kick the fuckin' door down!
PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY
The dense Assistant Manager, MILTON, stands in the outer
office, staring at the inner office's closed door.
MILTON
(into phone)
I'll try him in his car again...
During this, outside:
WESTEC GUARDS (OS)
(thru car-mounted PA)
Tenants -- leave your apartments at
once... Take the stairs...
APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Carson sticks the radio in his pocket and looks at Miranda.
CARSON
"Fuck-you" pumps??
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
The hostages can hear the WHOOPING fire alarms and the (OS)
ANNOUNCEMENT. Joy looks at Mrs. Han, hopeful.
JOY
They must know we're here...
ALL
Help!
No answer.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).
Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to
coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.
JOY
Mother... Sam...
They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:
MRS. HAN
Do it.
Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.
With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.
PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY
Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the
Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door
to the inner office and rush in.
MILTON
It's a brown binder... Says "Rental
Manifest." You can't miss it...
They literally tear the office apart.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins
to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.
APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments.
CARSON
(into radio)
Apartment number would be real
helpful, gang...
Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.
MIRANDA
There!
They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.
BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.
Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.
The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.
In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.
Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.
CARSON
Okay... work with me here!
He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.
LISA
Hurry, please hurry...
Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.
Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.
Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:
CARSON
DON'T!
He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.
CARSON
(continuing)
We have to go out the window.
MRS. HAN
Can't you disarm the bomb?
CARSON
Too risky. Let's concentrate on
getting you out of here.
He looks at the meters on the electronic units.
CARSON
(continuing)
Sound detectors?
MRS. HAN
Sam covered them with chewing gum.
SAM
High-tech problem, low-tech solution.
Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.
CARSON
Pressure sensors. Use 'em in
convertibles: Bad guy sits on your
seat, he sets the alarm off. These
are rigged backwards -- get up, you
set 'em off.
SAM
You a bomb expert?
CARSON
Nope. But I've had some car alarms
in my day.
(to himself)
For all the goddamn good they do...
Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.
CARSON
(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
Slide your arm forward... Watch the
meter... Keep the pressure on the
armrest with your elbow...
He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.
CARSON
(continuing)
It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
the weight of your arm... Okay...
pick it up.
They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.
The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.
CARSON
(continuing; to Sam)
Low-tech solution...
(to Mrs. Han)
Lean back... Carefully.
Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.
He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.
MIRANDA (VO)
(thru radio in his pocket)
How's it going in there?
CARSON
(to himself)
Nag, nag, nag...
He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!
BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER -
DAY
Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making
an incredible racket.
Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!
Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.
Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.
WIDER
The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.
CARSON
You'll be over in five seconds...
She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.
ANGLE ON BOMB
One minute... fifty-nine seconds...
CARSON
sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.
Han into it...
CARSON
Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook
and ride down on the line.
He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.
ANGLE ON BOMB
Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...
THE HARNESS
slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...
But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.
Fifteen seconds to go...
Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.
CARSON
(shouts)
Release the cable from your side!
Get out of here!
MIRANDA
(shouts back)
Come over the railing! Grab onto the
harness!
APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Miranda turns to the Pilot.
MIRANDA
Tear the hook loose!
PILOT
It'll pop the winch buckle!
MIRANDA
Try it anyway!
BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER -
DAY
Five seconds to go...
The Apache helicopter backs away from the high-rise...
The cable pulls taut...
Carson wraps the webbing of the harness around his wrist...
The Apache STRAINS against the resistance of the cable...
The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson
HANGING on the harness next to it...
The helicopter turns and flies away...
APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot
fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.
BELOW
Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.
Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.
Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear
as the helicopter lands.
Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...
WIDER
Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air;
helicopters crisscross the scene.
Everyone turns their eyes skyward, looking for the missile...

DAY
The Premier and the High Command are watching the action at
Park LaBrea on CNN Live...
...As Ambassador Han embraces his family.

CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
The pastoral scene is a COMMERCIAL on the TV.
Carson, wrapped in a towel, holds the phone and paces.
CARSON
(into phone)
...I'll call you next week.
Carson hangs up, and CLICKS off the TV as he leaves the room.
The sound of RUNNING WATER continues (OS)...
CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:
MIRANDA
Working with you today was
certainly... interesting, Inspector.
CARSON
It's my outstanding people skills.
He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...
Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.
MIRANDA
I hate this fucking town...
Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.
All of the books and magazines about other places to live
spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...
FADE OUT.
