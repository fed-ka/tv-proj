  The Manhattan skyline.  A violent STORM rains Hell down upon the 
  city.  CAMERA GLIDES over Central Park towards the West Side to 
  FIND the glowing lights of LINCOLN CENTER.  We can just hear the 
  warm strings of CLASSICAL MUSIC over the steady downpour...


  An imposing stone building on the Upper East Side, christened 
   The Drake  in the year of its construction in 1923.  A yellow 
  taxi SCREECHES to a stop out front.  Malcolm jumps out and 
  rushes inside, past the DOORMAN on duty --


  OOMPF!!  He lands hard on the wet concrete of the sidewalk.  
  Holy shit, he got out.  Malcolm stands up, takes a breath. 

                                    MALCOLM
                    ...oh dear God thank you...

  A NOISE behind him.  An eerie SQUEAK of metal.  He turns back to 
  the building.  Sees that the  JUDAS HOLE  (which is a small 5x7 
  inch door, set into the larger lobby door, like a peephole) has 
    mysteriously opened.  

  Malcolm freezes -- why the fuck did that little door just open?

  SUDDENLY -- Malcolm is LIFTED off the ground and PULLED right 
  through the tiny Judas hole in the door!!  

  And with that, we PULL BACK to see carved into the building 
  itself,  The Drake , and below that,  999 Park Avenue ... Then 
  the numbers slowly TWIST around to reveal that evil has an 
    address... TITLE UP:

                                   666 PARK AVENUE 


  The Drake rises over Park Avenue, historic, solid, imposing in 
  its magnificence.  It holds no hint of menace in the daylight.

  A JUNKER CAR, with patches of rust and Indiana license plates, 
  pulls up and parallel parks between a Mercedes and a Cadillac.  

  JANE VAN VEEN, 28, and HENRY MARTIN, 29, professionally attired, 
  climb out of the car.  She looks up at the building.

                                  JANE
                    Nice digs.  What do you think?  

                                  HENRY
                    I think we couldn t afford to rent a 
                    closet in this place.                                                                                      5.


  They share a wry smile.  Henry s good looks and easy smile 
  convey a confidence that belies his humble upbringing.  Jane s a 
  natural beauty, with the pluck of someone who s earned 
    everything she s gotten in life.  They make an adorable couple.

  As they head inside, we PUSH IN through the open Judas hole --


  Gavin and Olivia have coffee on their terrace aerie, overlooking 
    a picture-perfect view of Central Park.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    The girl seems nice.  Tragically 
                      provincial, but I like her spirit.  And 
                    she s beautiful.                                                                                    13.


                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I like her just fine.  
                          (beat)
                    She s how we get Henry.  


  Jane meets with Gavin over an elegant breakfast.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    My attorney s drawing up employment 
                    contracts for you two.  I ll let you 
                    know when I have them...
                          (then)
                    This should keep you busy for awhile.

  Gavin hands Jane a typewritten TO DO LIST.  She scans it.

                                  JANE
                          (off list)
                    What s wrong with the elevators?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    They can be tempermental.  The Drake s 
                    an old building.  Our water s still 
                    heated by a gas boiler.  Half the 
                      plumbing s still galvanized pipe.

                                  JANE
                    It shouldn t be too hard to replace all 
                    that with copper.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I ll be gutting the basement and 
                      renovating some of the upper floors to 
                    modernize things, later this year.

                                  JANE
                    Let me know if you need any help --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I have someone already, but...I ll let 
                    you know.

  It s a soft rejection.  Jane covers her disappointment.

                                  JANE
                    Sure, anything you need.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Take your time and settle in.  Meet the 
                      residents.  I think you ll find it s a 
                    friendly building.

                                  JANE
                      I actually met someone last night.  A 
                    man named John Barlow...?                                                                                    18.


                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Yes, Barlow, in 8B.  An accountant.  
                    His lovely wife Mary died recently.

                                  JANE
                    Oh, that s sad.

  Jane s about to press further, when Olivia glides into the room 
  in a red silk kimono, delighted to see Jane.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Jane, you re here!  I was so happy when 
                    Gavin said you and Henry were joining 
                    us.

  Olivia regards the SILK SCARF Jane has tied fashionably around 
  her neck.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    That is a gorgeous scarf.

                                  JANE
                    Thank you.  It was my grandmother s, 
                    actually.

  Jane self-consciously adjusts the scarf.  Olivia turns to Gavin.  

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Gavin, the Crawfords canceled on us.  
                    What do you want to do?

  Gavin nods to Jane --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    We could invite them. 

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    That s a great idea.  
                          (to Jane)
                    Tomorrow night.  It s a cocktail party 
                    for patrons of the Philharmonic.  And 
                    there s a performance afterwards.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    It s formal.  Does Henry own a tux?

                                  JANE
                    He could rent one I guess.

                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    He s what...a 44 regular?

                                  JANE
                    That sounds right.                                                                                    19.


                                  OLIVIA DORAN
                    Then borrow one of Gavin s.  He has an 
                    Armani that d look perfect.

                                  JANE
                    That d be great.  We d love to go. 

  Off Jane, pleasantly surprised --


  Hannah and Tommy walk up the street.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Dr. Scott likes you, Mom.  I can tell.

                                  HANNAH
                    What do you know?  You re eight.

  But we sense that Hannah hopes he s right.  She playfully ushers 
  Tommy along.


  THWACK!!  Henry hits a perfect drive straight down the fairway.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    That s a serious swing.  

                                  HENRY
                    I put myself through law school working 
                    as a caddy, found some time to work on 
                    my game.  But I played mostly municipal 
                    courses.  Nothing this nice.

  Gavin steps up to the tee and sets his ball down.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Ever play for money?

                                  HENRY
                    I ve never been much of a gambler.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    But you moved to New York, got a job in 
                    the Mayor s office.  That s ambitious.  
                    With ambition, there s risk.  

                                  HENRY
                    So I m gambling with my life?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                          (with a smile)
                    Always.

  Gavin lines up, then confidently SWINGS the iron -- THWACK!  

                                  HENRY
                    Nice hit.

  Gavin s confident look -- of course it was.  Off this --


  Gavin and Henry walk up to the putting green of the 11th hole.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I bought the place in 1977, and it s 
                    doubled in value what, a dozen times?  
                    It was my first property.  I was still 
                    Resident Manager then.  

                                  HENRY
                      Impressive.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Not bad for a college dropout, eh?  

  As Gavin takes a knee behind the ball, surveying the green --

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    The entire city was going to Hell back 
                    then.  Lotta crime.  Riots.  But real 
                    estate was relatively cheap.  The place 
                    was falling apart from neglect, but I 
                    could see it was a remarkable building. 
                    It just needed some attention.  

  Gavin lines up his putt.  He smoothly hits the ball, an arcing 
  shot that rolls toward the hole.  And drops in.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    The Drake s come a long way since then.  
                    But then, so have I.

                                  HENRY
                    Three for birdie.  Well done.

  Henry crouches behind his ball, eyeballing the shot.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI (O.S.)
                    Five hundred bucks says he misses.

  They turn to see DANIEL CAVANI, 40s, walking over from the 
  adjacent hole.  Cavani s a bulldog in pink golf shirt and 
  pressed khakis.  He shakes hands with Gavin, but we get the 
  sense these two men are NOT friends.                                                                                    34.


                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    You slice your shot over this far?  You 
                    know the club offers lessons --

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    I want to talk to you about my 
                      waterfront project.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Daniel Cavani meet Henry Martin, a 
                    friend of mine.  

  CAMERA POV -- a long lens finds focus as Henry and Cavani shake 
  hands.  CLICK CLICK.  Henry s unaware, but as Gavin looks 
  straight at the camera, it s clear he arranged the photo op.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    Nice to meet you, Henry.  

  REVERSE ANGLE -- we FIND Gavin s assistant YURI standing in the 
  treeline with a long telephoto lens, snapping PHOTOS of Henry s 
   meeting  with Cavani.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    I hear you tried to offer 30 mill in a 
                    short sale with the bank.  The real 
                    estate alone s worth twice that.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    It s not my fault you can t refi your 
                    loan, Danny boy.  You re in a pinch, I 
                    was just trying to help.

  Cavani pulls Gavin out of earshot of Henry.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    I don t need your help, Gavin.  I need 
                    you to back off and let me work it out.  

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    Work what out?  I hear the city s not 
                    budging on the environmental regs and 
                    now you re three months behind.  Looks 
                    to me like you re over-leveraged and 
                    hanging on by your fingertips.  Now, 
                    you want a lifeline?  I ll go 40 mill 
                    and you get to keep your shirt.

                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    I d rather go bankrupt than sell to 
                    you.

  Cavani turns to leave.  As he walks past Henry --                                                                                    35.


                                  DANIEL CAVANI
                    You seem like a nice kid, Henry.  You 
                    should keep better company.

  Cavani moves off.  Worried, Henry turns to Gavin --

                                  HENRY
                    I m sorry.  Was he just talking about 
                    the Greenpoint Towers complex?

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    In Brooklyn.  You know it?

                                  HENRY
                    Gavin, I work for City Planning.  We re 
                    in a legal dispute over that property 
                    right now.  It s highly improper, 
                    possibly even illegal, for me to have 
                    any contact with Mr. Cavani.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    I didn t realize that, I m sorry.  I 
                    don t want to get you in trouble...  

                                  HENRY
                    It s alright, don t worry about it.  
                    You didn t know.

                                  GAVIN DORAN
                    It s your putt.

  As Gavin covers his smile --  


  The Doran s limousine is parked out front.  A driver leans on 
  the hood reading the paper.


  Jane stands on a busy corner looking at a pocket map of the 
  city.  She s surprised to see Hannah Fletcher approaching.  

                                  JANE
                      Hannah...?

                                  HANNAH
                    I work around the corner.  What are you 
                    doing here?                                                                                    39.


                                  JANE
                    Trying to find the public library.
                          (off her map)
                    Does the Six Express stop near there?

                                  HANNAH
                    Only if the library moved to the Bronx.  
                    You can take the B train and get off at 
                    42nd street.  It s only couple blocks 
                    from there.

                                  JANE
                    I m glad I ran into you.

                                  HANNAH
                    I don t know if you re busy, but you 
                    wanna grab lunch?


  Stone lions kneel before the high columns of the majestic 
  building.  Jane makes her way up the wide steps and enters.


  John and Mary Barlow walk down the street holding hands.  Mary 
  suddenly stops, looking ahead --

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    That cafe.  I ve been there before.

  Mary stares at a small cafe on the corner. 

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    It s where we had our second date.  Do 
                    you remember?

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    I think so... You kissed me over 
                      dessert... You were nervous...                                                                                    44.


                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    I was a wreck.

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    You said you loved me... And I could 
                    see it in your eyes... No one had ever 
                    looked at me that way before...

  Barlow nods.  But then a dark cloud descends over her.  She 
  looks scared.  He pulls her close. 

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    What s wrong?

  Then -- a trickle of BLOOD falls from her nose.  Barlow notices 
  it.  Mary touches her nose.  Sees the blood on her fingers.  

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    I feel cold, John --

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Let me take you home --

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    What s happening to me?

                                  JOHN BARLOW
                    Mr. Doran will know what to do...

  As they walk away, RACK FOCUS to the REFLECTION in the store-
  front window -- Mary is nowhere to be seen.  Barlow is ALONE.  

  Over this startling reveal, we PRE-LAP:

                                  GAVIN DORAN (OVER PHONE)
                     The mind is its own place, and in 
                    itself can make a Heaven of Hell, or a 
                    Hell of Heaven.   


  CONTINUE MUSIC.  Barlow stands alone in the shadows, trenchcoat 
  pulled tightly around him, hands thrust in his pockets, head 
  down in troubled thought.  Then, someone approaches --

  BARLOW S POV -- DANIEL CAVANI walks a small dog into the park. 

  And now we see -- Barlow holds a long KNIFE at his side, intent 
  on claiming the remedy to Mary s failing health... 

  Cavani gets closer, Barlow steels himself.  Then -- 

  Barlow BLITZES Cavani as he passes, knocking him to the ground.  
  Stunning him.  The dog begins frantically BARKING.  Barlow 
  raises the knife, about to stab -- and he FREEZES.  A sickened 
  look on his face.  He can t bring himself to do it... 

  Cavani scrambles away, SHOUTING for help, as Barlow breaks down 
  in tears.


  Jane steps out onto the rooftop.  It s the middle of the night.  
  A chilly wind blows.  How the hell did she get here?  She turns 
  around to go back -- but the door is now GONE.  

  Then Jane sees something else that startles her --

  MARY BARLOW walks across the rooftop.  She wears her long white 
    nightgown.  Bare feet.  Moving like a lost soul.  Jane studies 
  her, a slow moment of stunned recognition from the news photo -- 
  could it really be her?  How s that possible?  

                                  JANE
                    ...Mrs. Barlow...?  

  JANE S POV -- Mary moves to the edge of the roof and climbs up 
  on the ledge.  She stands there, a ghostly figure in white, 
  reminiscent of her leap from the roof of Bellevue.  

                                  JANE
                    Mary?!  Don t... Please...

  Mary slowly turns to Jane, a lost look in her eyes...  

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    You shouldn t have come here...

  Jane takes cautious steps forward, trying to get closer... 

                                  MARY BARLOW
                    They re never going to let you go...

  Mary stretches out her arms, leans back, and lets herself FALL -- 

  Jane rushes forward to grab her, hand outstretched, but MISSES -- 
  watching in horror as Mary drops to the street below -- 

  We FOLLOW MARY as she FALLS... time SLOWING DOWN to an 
    impossible crawl as Mary FLOATS dream-like towards the ground... 
  A WISP on the wind... Her nightgown wrapping around her like a 
  death SHROUD... 

  As Mary SLOWLY passes each window, we catch fleeting glimpses of 
  the residents inside their apartments, in FROZEN MOMENTS:                                                                                     60.


  -- BRIAN works at his desk in front of the window as Louise 
  brings him a cup of coffee, then kisses him.  RACK FOCUS to see 
  REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW, Alexis now watches them from her 
    apartment...

  -- Hannah stands in the doorway of Tommy s bedroom, pensive, 
  watching her son sleep...

  -- DR. SCOTT places a large stack of CASH and a GUN in a 
    lockbox...

  -- NONA sits on her bed, holding Jane s SCARF... Arranged around 
  her: a zippo lighter, bifocals, a charm bracelet, a wristwatch.  
  Items posted on the bulletin board as  missing ...

  -- HENRY sleeps, unaware that GAVIN DORAN sits in the shadowy 
  corner of the bedroom, watching him, eyes like onyx...

  And as the ground rises up to meet Mary, we SMASH TO:
