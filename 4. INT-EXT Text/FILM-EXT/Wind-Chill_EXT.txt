Campus is a ghost town, most students having already left for
the holidays: the DORMS abandoned, the LIBRARY STACKS empty,
the LABS silent, the DINING HALLS eerie.
Our GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted
with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm. She
passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS,
on her way to...

She arrives at a large, partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with
dozens of student-made notices, printed in a rainbow of eye-
catching computer fonts and colors. A sign at the top reads:
RIDE BOARD.
She scans the posted notices. One catches her eye: torn
hastily from a spiral notebook, on which is scrawled a
handwritten message:
NE1 Need a Ride 2 Delaware 12/23?
Call 607-154-9835
A gust of wind riffles the notice.

Our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely-empty parking
lot. It's late afternoon, and already dark enough for the
sodium vapor streetlights to have come on. A few snowflakes
swirl in their sickbed glow.
We follow her to...
A beat-to-shit 1988 OLDSMOBILE idling in the middle of the
lot. An unbroken dusting of snow indicates it's been the
only vehicle here for some time.

An underclassman GUY, 19, is asleep behind the wheel of the
Oldsmobile. He's skinny, dressed in thrift-shop clothes, has
the complexion of someone who doesn't get out in the sun
much. His car is filled with all of his earthly possessions:
books, CD's in plastic milk crates, dirty laundry, etc.
She knocks on the driver's side window, startling him awake.
He stirs, blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot.
GIRL
Do you think you could have parked
any further from the entrance?
The sight of her quickly snaps him awake.
He scrambles out.
GUY
(still a little groggy)
There were still cars when I got
here. I thought we were going to
get an early start to stay ahead of
the snow?

She walks back to the trunk, which is stuffed to capacity
with more of his things: CLOTHES, a bag of GROCERIES, etc.
GIRL (cont'd)
(calling to him)
Jesus, I'm just going home for
Christmas. What are you doing?
Pulling up stakes and movin' your

She starts rearranging the trunk, making room for her bag.
GUY
I'm kinda getting kicked out of my
apartment. I didn't have time to
find someplace new before exams.
She takes out some of his things.
Puts them on the ground.
GUY (cont'd)
Here, let me help you with that-
GIRL
Why don't you just get the engine
started and put the heat on? I can

He watches her rearrange his things, a little flummoxed.

Well? What are you waiting for? I
thought you wanted to stay ahead of

He hurries back to the driver's seat.
Starts the engine.

access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow.
Attached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more

The Oldsmobile cruises by, the only car on the two-lane

Yeah, but you can still see our

Curiosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the
middle of the road to have a look for herself.
No tracks.
Just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints.

This doesn't make any sense...
At that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight. He
spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings.
The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep
even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it. A precipice.
He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs.

He's pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow
nearby catches his eye. He takes out the flashlight, shines
it at the roadside.
Little wooden crosses.
Just two this time. Another sad shrine, to a different set
of anonymous victims of Route 606.

Her teeth chatter as she does her business, one wary eye
peeled to catch the guy peeking.
Suddenly, out of the gloom appears -
A DARK FIGURE, moving by very near her.
She GASPS. Tumbles back onto her ass.
As she's struggling
to pull up her pants -
MORE DARK FIGURES appear, moving in the same direction.
As the figures enter the woods their leader turns so she
glimpses his face: elderly and unremarkable at first glance,
then for an instant CHANGING into a twisted ashen deathmask.
Her SCREAM brings our guy BOLTING out of the car.
GUY
What?! What happened?!
But it all happened so fast she doesn't believe her eyes.
She gestures at the procession of DARK FIGURES disappearing
ahead.
GIRL
(still in shock)
- Did you see? - They were right
here! -

Why didn't you stop them?! Maybe
they have a phone!

He eases the door shut, carefully so it doesn't latch and

is, she decides to follow rather than remain at the car by
herself.

The two kids arrive at the place on the road -- top of a
ravine disappearing thirty feet below -- where the dark
figures seemed to be headed.
Only to find NO ONE THERE.
GIRL
Where'd they go?!
GUY
There!
She looks where he's pointing with the flashlight-
HER POV:
On the wooded slope on the opposite slope of the ravine are
SEVERAL TALL OLD MEN IN DARK COATS, dispersing through the
woods. As if whatever somber occasion that brought them to
the ravine has ended.

Hey! Wait! We need help here!

kids are forced to backtrack to a place several yards away

Okay.
She trudges on ahead, her footsteps growing FAINTER, finally
fading entirely.
He's alone now.
He leans against a tree to catch his breath, wincing in pain.
For an instant it seems like he's going to be sick. But then
he just hocks up phlegm and spits into the pure white snow.
Blood.
Though still winded, he pushes on.

A few minutes later he trudges into view.
Looks around.
No
sign of our girl.
GUY
Hello? Hello?
He arrives at the top of the hill.
Silhouetted against the
night sky. Treeless.
His flashlight finds the few vertical objects still standing.
A RUINED BUILDING
Windowless and long-abandoned, its ceiling and walls caved in
around a large stone chimney.
He crunches inside and examines the black maw of the large
stone fireplace, now stuffed with trash and dead leaves. His
flashlight beam finds a SMALL IRON DOOR built into the side
of the chimney.

He kneels in the snow and tugs the little iron door open.
Gingerly slips his arm inside the firebox.
Retrieves a bunch of OLD NEWSPAPERS. He stuffs them inside
the front of his jacket. Continues rummaging around in the
firebox.
As he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side.
He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides.
He turns in a slow circle. His flashlight sweeps over the
interior of the abandoned ruins, the beam picking out what
look like branches -
HUMAN HANDS
frozen into claws, reaching from...
A FROZEN BODY.
It's lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe: teeth
clenched in a terrible rictus, icicles dripping from nose,
clawlike fingers, eyes.
He's so startled he nearly drops the flashlight.
The wayward light finding ANOTHER FROZEN CORPSE in a nearby
bed mere feet away: another rictus grimace, clawlike fingers
seeming to reach for him. And then another. And another...
All OLD MEN.
Frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from Pompeii.
ONE OF THE BEDS is EMPTY.
Our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the
bed's occupant: frozen sitting upright in an old wooden
wheelchair.
Eye to eye with him.
He reels in horror, trips, LOSES THE FLASHLIGHT as he goes
sprawling. Then recovers, snatching the flashlight up again
and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies -
And sees NOTHING:
No beds.
No old men...

It's the black STRANGER from earlier, shuffling and mumbling.
This time he's close enough for her to make out some of the
words he's muttering:
STRANGER
...please, officer, please don't...
GIRL
Wait!
Determined not to let him vanish again, she takes off in
pursuit, coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles
down the middle of the road.
STRANGER
...don't put me in the river...
Suddenly she glances down, sees why he's shuffling so oddly.
His ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with BALING
WIRE, as are his wrists.
GIRL
(shocked)
Oh my god! Who did this to you?!
STRANGER
...please, officer, just take the
booze and let me go...
She reaches toward him.
The instant her hand nears him the wind HOWLS DEAFENINGLY.
She experiences a sudden powerful JOLT, almost as if she's
grabbed a live wire... only instead of electric heat she
feels a terrible otherwordly cold...
Frostbite.
The jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze, and for the
first time he becomes aware of her. He raises his frightened
eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face.
A scream builds in her throat at sight of him.
The stranger's face is bloodless, bloated, swollen with rot.
A sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth
moves, as if he's trying to speak.
But instead of words emerging, his throat suddenly bulges.
Something's in there, fighting its way up his esophagus.

In the silence he hears her SCREAM coming from ahead.
He stands, and though still winded, starts running again.

Our guy emerges from the woods still carrying the newspapers
he found in time to find our girl white with shock and

So what do you say? How `bout a

You know, this is one bad stretch

Niggers hauling booze across the

Her bravado begins to flag. This isn't the kind of police

back in the direction of the Olds.

She holds out the money, but he ignores it.

She continues backing away until she's backed up against the

The cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches
sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes
him stop.
She glances over her shoulder to see what he's looking at:
A LIGHT on the hilltop, where the burned-out ruins stand.
And weirder still, there's a FIGURE in silhouette standing
nearby.
Someone watching.
The cop darkens, enraged by this unwanted audience. His face
contorts, fury building in him until he trembles with it. He
rests his hand on the butt of his service revolver, says to
her in a low urgent voice:
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Get in the damn patrol car...
She starts walking toward the parked patrol car ahead of him.
The highway patrolman's boots CRUNCHING behind her.

two-step as he drags her along the gravel road shoulder
-- HANDHELD footage as she's dragged toward his idling patrol
car
-- POV of a FULL MOON in the tree-tops, dispassionate
spectator to the assault going on on this lonely stretch of
road
-- CLOSE UP of the COP'S MOUTH, twisted with lust as he
whispers something obscene we cannot hear.
-- CLOSE ON his HAND working it's way up to her throat,
forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her
suck.
-- POV underneath his patrol car, as his boots kick her feet
apart, and take up position between them
-- The brim of his hat lifting to reveal him looking up with
a scowl of surprise
-- And the cop's scowl curdles into a look of outrage at
sight of --
-- SILHOUETTES of old men watching on the hilltop, roused by
the commotion down on the road below --

The rungs are icy, forcing her to climb slower than she would

She clutches the pole tightly, wind whistling in her ears.
She waits until her heart slows and she's recovered from her
near fall.
Then looks up to gauge the distance left to the JUNCTION BOX.
Keeps climbing.
She reaches the last rung at the TOP OF THE TELEPHONE POLE.
It's noisy up here, thanks to the WIND and the icy telephone
wires, source of the mysterious HUMMING she's been hearing.
She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX.
Locked.

It's a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her
eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to
just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth.

Her eyes open, and she commences climbing back down to earth.
She reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops

fall and she goes sprawling, lays there for a dazed moment.
She starts crawling on all fours back toward the stranded
Olds. Suddenly she stops as she comes upon-

A thick spatter of mud lands on the bare foot.
Our girl raises her eyes to see -

It's the blonde we saw raped and murdered in the summer of

dirt like someone recently exhumed from a shallow grave.

We see them a split-

He's coming.
When she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner

Then her eyes widen in terror, she lets out a small whimper,

She scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the
Oldsmobile -
Only to find when she tugs on the handle that it's STUCK.
She yanks on it harder, getting frantic now, as -

The residents of St. Christopher's Home for Retired Clergy.
Suddenly there's a WHOOSH as the engine fire spreads across
the car's undercarriage, moving toward the FUEL TANK.
The priests exchange a look, reaching some silent decision.
The LEADER of the elderly priests comes forward.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
Hurry it up, I smell gas...
The snowplow driver stands there, confused by what he's
witnessing.
The old priest crouches down, reaches through the open window
past the trapped highway patrolman.
Rips out the chattering TWO-WAY RADIO by its cord.
The cop's face registers disbelief, then fury, as he realizes
the priests aren't going to help him. Are in fact condemning
him for years of crimes committed on this stretch of road.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
(struggling)
Oh no you don't! You bastards have
no right to sit in judgement of me.
I know what you're thinking but I
had nothing to do with that drunk
girl's disappearance. I saw her
home safely. Just ask the County
investigators. And anything else
you think you saw? All of it was
lawfully done!
He sputters as gasoline drips on his face from above.
Another WHOOSH, blue flames spreading out from the fuel line.
The cop smells smoke, a pleading note entering his voice now.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
Please, father... For the love of
Christ have mercy on a poor sinner!
There's a SMALL EXPLOSION, and the inside of the car starts
filling with FLAMES and black smoke.
The trapped highway patrolman begins burning alive, cursing.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
Goddamn you filthy bastards! You
think you'll be rid of me!? You'll
never be rid of me!! I'll be your
worst nightmare!! I'll be -
The rest is lost in a second larger EXPLOSION.
Flames flicker on the elderly faces of the priests gathered
here to bear mute witness. They watch the burning patrol car
for a moment longer, then one by one climb the embankment.

Christmas, 1958. The crash scene we saw depicted in the news
clipping. The wrecked `55 CROWN VIC. PRIESTS administering
last rights two the two TEENS in letter jackets: one already
dead, the other breathing his last breaths.

Our girl and the rattled snowplow driver stand there in the
silence and the flickering firelight from the burning car.
GIRL
Come on. We can go now. It's over.
The snowplow driver, stunned, speechless, can only stand
there and nod.
Suddenly -
The COP launches himself out of the window of the overturned
car at them.
Skin peeled and blackened, he starts crawling over the rocks,
dragging his paralyzed lower body after them.
The snowplow driver's eyes go wide and he stands rooted in
place, unable to move.
She grabs him by the arm, pulls him away.
GIRL (cont'd)
MOVE!!

He comes to his senses, staggers up the embankment after her.
He loses his footing on the icy rocks and goes sprawling.
As the cop seizes him around the legs, and starts crawling up
the length of his body.
We hear the sizzle of instant FROSTBITE, the frost spreading
with time-lapse speed up the snowplow driver's limbs as he
shrieks in agony.
Until even his shriek is FROZEN IN HIS LUNGS.
ANGLE ON OUR GIRL
As she begins scrambling up the snowy slope away from the
horror below.
Suddenly she loses her grip and starts to slide back down on
her belly toward the cop a dozen feet below.
She whimpers, fingers clutching at anything.
Finally she succeeds, manages to haul herself up the steep
embankment, climbing with everything she's got left in her
until she reaches the road.

She hauls herself up from the gloomy abyss, wrenches the
driver side door open and scrambles inside -

The sky is showing the first signs of approaching dawn.
She watches OUR GUY'S GHOST moving into the woods, back
toward the direction from which they came.

She stands there, exhausted, spent.
Suddenly -
A familiar SONG begins to chime on her cellphone RINGTONE:
CELLPHONE
("Rockin Around the X-mas
Tree...")
Ding-da-da DING, da-DING da-DING...
Her eyes widen in terror. She fumbles out the cellphone.
Stabs the "off" button with her thumb.
She instinctively starts back to the stranded Oldsmobile -
Stops -
Looks at the ghost.
And in that moment decides, for better or worse, to follow
him.
She takes off down the road.
We follow as she hurries to catch up with our guy's ghost.
GIRL
(crying; breathless)
Wait!
She's close enough now to hear that he's MUMBLING something.
GUY'S GHOST
...I would've told you everything
eventually...
Exhausted, she's having trouble keeping up with him.
GIRL
I know.
GUY'S GHOST
...then it wouldn't be stalkerish.
GIRL
(out of breath)
I know!
GUY'S GHOST
... It would just be this sweet
funny story we'd have...

But it's no use. She stops trying to keep up and pauses
briefly, devastated, catching her breath. Then she pushes on
in the direction he went.
TIME DISSOLVE:
It's almost light out now, and SHE'S ALONE, staggering along
the road as quickly as her exhausted state allows. It's like
running in a dream, never fast enough to outdistance an
unseen pursuer.
But then she hears it -
THE HIGHWAY.
She can't believe she's made it back to civilization.
FADE TO BLACK.

The gas pumps are crowded with EMERGENCY VEHICLES and
PERSONNEL. The morning calm is broken by the BEEP BEEP BEEP
of trucks backing up, the BLEET of arriving ambulances, the
constant CHATTER of two-way radios.
OUR GIRL is seated in the back of an open ambulance with a
blanket draped around her shoulders, allowing EMTs to treat
her frostbite.
She watches ATTENDANTS from the county morgue zip the bodies
of our guy and the snowplow driver into BODYBAGS.
Suddenly she remembers her cellphone, and takes it out.
INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY --
It's the DIGITAL PICTURE OF OUR GUY when she first met him,
asleep behind the wheel of the `88 Olds in student parking.
BACK TO SCENE
She closes her cellphone.
The EMT helps her into the passenger seat of the ambulance.
As the ambulance drives off we CRANE UP to see...
