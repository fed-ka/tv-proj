The undifferentiated blue resolves itself, as a ripplin

form emerges from it's depths; a completely bandaged head
breaks the surface of the fluid.
107 WIDER 107
A patient is lifted from a hydro tank, the complex water
vessel in which burn patients are treated. He lies
perfectly still, hands and face swathed in gauze; A 20th-
century mummy. Tubes and wires.poke from his body.
We hear the steady beeping of a cardiogram.
108 MASKED BURN NURSES 108

some still submerged in their hydro-tanks.

With a sharp practiced motion, he plucks out the pin.
115
PATIENT'S BANDAGED FACE
115
His eyes still closed. No response.
RESIDENT
Of course, there are serious emotional
side effects to this operation. When
the body ceases to feel, when so much
sensory input is lost, the patient
becomes alienated. The mind, cut off
from its regular diet of input, has a
never-satisfied thirst; alienation
gives rise to loneliness, anger;
uncontrolled rage is not uncommon.
And the rage problem is exacerbated by
the chemical effect of severing the
nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow
unchecked through body and brain--
giving him the strength of dozen men.
Hence the leather restraints.
The resident turns and heads for the door. The interns
follow behind like ducklings.
