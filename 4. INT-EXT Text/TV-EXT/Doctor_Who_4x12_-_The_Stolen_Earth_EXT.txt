      CU on THE DOCTOR, racing out of the TARDIS door -  

      WIDE SHOT, as he stops dead.  It's the most ordinary street
      in the world; a good distance away, a MILKMAN and his float. 
      DONNA steps out, but stays by the Tardis. 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...but it's fine.  Everything's
                    fine.  Nothing's wrong.  All fine!
                          (yells across)
                    'Scuse me!  What day is it?

                                      MILKMAN
                    Saturday.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Saturday.  Good.  I like Saturdays.

                                      DONNA
                    ...so I just met Rose Tyler?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yep.

            DW4 - Ep 12 - Pink
                                      DONNA
                    But she's locked away in a parallel
                    world, yeah?

        www.thewriterstale.com
                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Exactly.  If she could cross from
                    her parallel world, to your parallel
                    world, then that means the walls
                    of the universe are breaking down. 
                    Which puts everything in danger,
                      everything!  But how...?! 

      He runs back to the Tardis, Donna follows, door slams shut.

      The Milkman's strolling back to his float.  But he hears a
      noise.  A rattling.  Ting-ting-ting.  Glass.  He looks...

      The empty milk bottles in their crates are shivering, just
      a little, ting-ting-ting...

      He walks closer, puzzled...

      They rattle, harder.  Shaking.

      The milkman looks round.  Tiny, fractional CAMERA SHAKE.

      He sees a couple of slates slide off a roof...

      HIGH SHOT on the Milkman, as he looks up.  In horror...

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 12 - Shooting Script - 12/02/08       page 2.

      A DRUNK MAN's standing in the middle of the road, happy.

      Jack reaching them - Donna also running up -

      SARAH JANE's car screeches round a corner -  Brakes!

      She's driven right up to TWO DALEKS.  Both now swivelling
      round on the spot to face her.

                                      DALEK 1
                    All Human transport is forbidden!
