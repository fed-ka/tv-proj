      CLOSE on the right eye of ELLEN. She stares straight ahead.  

    A MELANCHOLY SONG PLAYS as we PULL BACK to REVEAL her face. 

                                      SONG 
                        It's good to hear your voice 
                        It's good to hear your breathing& 

      She is a dark-featured, attractive woman in her late 20s. 
      As the camera pulls back, it becomes apparent that she is 
      at the wheel of a car, gazing at the road coming at her. A 
      serious, enigmatic expression paints her face. 

                                      SONG (CONT'D) 
                        I'm running out of hours& 

 

      POV on Ellen's profile as she drives. Her expression is 
      distant, perhaps conflicted. 

 

      CLOSE ON Ellen, still in her trance. 

                                      SONG (CONT'D) 
                        So maybe I won't bother& 

 

      CLOSE ON Ellen, still in her trance. 

                                      SONG (CONT'D) 
                        Everybody wonders what 
                        We did wrong& 

      She reaches over to fiddle with the radio. The signal is 
      WEAK and GARBLED. Her eyes momentarily leave the road as 
      she checks the dial. 

      After a beat, she looks up. Her eyes go WIDE and she 
      SCREAMS. 

      POV through the windshield on a BUICK parked in the middle 
      of the road. She is headed straight for it. 

      She jerks the wheel and SLAMS on the brake. 

 

      VARIOUS ANGLES as the car goes SKIDDING across the pass, 
      bounces back off the railing and just barley avoids a 
      nosedive off the end of the cliff. 

 

      As the car HURTLES to a halt, Ellen bounces against the 
      steering wheel and is pounded into unconsciousness. 

      The car comes to a stop on the other side of the Buick. 

      We hold on her face, eyes closed, only for a second before 
      we-- 

      CUT TO BLACK 

    A MAN'S VOICE begins. 

                                      BRUCE (V/O) 
                      I believe anything can happen to 
                            anyone...anywhere...at any time. 






      Ellen and Bruce charge through the door, their lips locked, 
      tearing at each other's clothes. QUICK CUTS as LIGHTENING 
      FLASHES. They tumble onto the couch and make love with 
      unbridled, animalistic passion. 

      She turns her face as he kisses her neck to REVEAL her 
      expression of rapture. CLOSE ON ONE DARK EYE as she opens 
      it. 

      SHOCK CUT TO-- 




      Ellen's head rests on the steering wheel. Her eyes are 
      open. There is a rumble of THUNDER and a FLASH OF 
      LIGHTENING. Ellen blinks. She takes a deep breath and lifts 
      her head. Cagey, she glances around. All is silent. 

      She looks through the windshield at the empty road. She 
      thinks for a beat, then winces as she places a hand to her 
      head. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh, my God. 

      She pulls down the rearview mirror to examine a SMALL 
      LACERATION at her hairline. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Oh, shit. 

      She twists the keys in the ignition and the engine 
      SPUTTERS. She grabs her purse and fishes out her cellphone. 
      She taps out a number, but gets nothing. 

      She pops open the glove compartment and pulls out a SMALL 
      FLASHLIGHT. She checks it and finds that it works. 

      She gathers her purse and opens the door. 

 

    A FIRE ROARS in the fireplace. Bruce WHOOSHES a LARGE 
      HUNTING KNIFE with quick flicks of the wrist. He catches it 
      by the handle and POUNDS it into the floor. He then goes to 
      work assembling an AK-47 RIFLE. Ellen looks on, not happy. 

                                      ELLEN 
                      I guess I'm going to make some dinner. 
                        You want anything special? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        No, I'm not hungry. I'm just gonna 
                        walk the perimeter and call it an 
                        early night. I've got a big day 
                        tomorrow. 

      Ellen watches him for a beat. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Getting together with those survival 
                        freaks again? 

      He looks up at her. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        You don't know what you're talking 
                        about, Ellen, so I'm just going to 
                        ignore that you said that, okay? 




 16                                       ELLEN 
                                (deadpan) 
                        Okay. 
                                (whispers) 
                        You ignore everything else I say, so& 

      He stares at her. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                      I mean, Bruce, you are really freaking 
                        me out right now. We don t even go out 
                        anymore. You spend all your day with 
                        those nut jobs. We don't even have a 
                        house in the city anymore. 

      Bruce stands. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        The cities aren't safe anymore, Ellen. 
                        You will thank me when the shit 
                        happens. When the Big One drops, we 
                        can just wait it out here while those 
                        mud people rise up and fucking kill 
                        each other. 

      She stands. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        What is this shit you're even talking 
                        about, huh? I don't understand 
                        anything you say to me anymore, and 
                        I'm your wife! 

      Bruce moves to the door. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        I'll be a few hours. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Fine. 

      Alone, Ellen glances around. She crosses to the fireplace 
      and looks at a FRAMED PHOTO of herself and Bruce on their 
      wedding day, dressed for the occasion and smiling for the 
      camera. 

      PAN TO a larger FRAMED PICTURE of Bruce in full military 
      gear, posing with a rifle, along with a assortment of GUN-
      TOTING BUDDIES. Ellen considers it for a beat, then turns. 
      She pulls the knife from the floor and tries Bruce's wrist 
      flicks, She spins the knife, but it CLATTERS to the floor. 





      CLOSE ON Ellen's bruised and bloodied face as she lies 
      unconscious in a dark room, the nail file still jutting 
      from her shoulder. The sounds of DRIPPING WATER can be 
      heard. 

      Ellen rouses. She GASPS as she sits up to find herself 
      handcuffed to a pole. She glances this way and that. The 
      room is dark and grimy, dimly lit with GAS LAMPS. She 
      catches sight of something O/S and SCREAMS. 

      REVEAL TWO DEAD BODIES, their EYES ROTTED OUT, leaning 
      against a grimy wall. Ellen SCREAMS as she struggles to her 
      feet. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh, no! 

      She looks this way and that, and finds more ROTTING 
      CORPSES. She CRIES OUT and struggles with her handcuffs, 
      but it is no use. 

                                      ELLEN 
                              (cries) 
                        Oh, no. 

      Behind her lies the Young Woman, motionless, her face and 
      body covered in bloody lacerations. Ellen SCREAMS and 
      crouches back down to the floor. 

      Suddenly, in a jolting shock, one of the "corpses", a lanky 
      old man, BUDDY, sits up in his wheelchair and GASPS for 
      air. He COUGHS and SPUTTERS. Ellen's jaw drops. 







 24                                       BUDDY 
                        Oh good lord, it smells bad in here! 
                        When is he going to clean it out, by 
                        golly? If there's one thing I can't 
                        stand, it's a messy house! And no 
                        matter how much I sleep, whenever I 
                        wake up it's still the same messy 
                        house! 

      He wheels closer to her and we get a better view of his 
      grizzled face and SOILED CLOTHING. His eyes widen as he 
      spots Ellen. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Hi. 
                                (beat) 
                        I'm Buddy. Not too many come up that 
                        road. Maybe one a night. Didn't make 
                        the turn in the road either, huh? 

      Ellen trembles and GASPS, her eyes wide as she continues to 
      take in her horrific surroundings. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Well, one in ten usually don't. He's 
                        had a real backlog lately. 
                                (beat) 
                        Did you bring any candy? I like it 
                        when they bring candy. Sweets pass the 
                        time so much faster, don't you agree? 

      Ellen lurches forward and VOMITS. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        I'll take that as a "maybe." 

      Ellen clamps her hand to her mouth and cries. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D O/S) 
                        Your friend is pretty. 

      CLOSE ON the Young Woman's body. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        He must think you're both very 
                        special. He didn't kill you like the 
                        last two. 

      Buddy jerks his chin at the first two corpses. 






 25                                       BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        They was bad girls. Kind of nasty, you 
                        know. I guess they sort of deserved 
                        it. 
                                (beat) 
                        Do you know what they did? 

      Ellen shakes her head. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        They wanted to do&sexy things with 
                        him. Said they'd do anything he wanted 
                        if he didn't hurt them. But he doesn't 
                        want sexy things. Those things are 
                        bad. You see so many bad things in 
                        your life. It all comes in through 
                        your eyes. And sometimes your eyes lie 
                        to you. And show you things you don't 
                        want to see. So he makes them go away. 

      At last, Ellen manages to speak. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Where&are we? 

                                      BUDDY 
                        You've come home. 
                                (beat) 
                        I've been here waiting for you. Well, 
                      I was waiting for someone, I guess. It 
                        might as well be you. Might as well be 
                        anyone, really. 

                                      ELLEN 
                                What&what the fuck is he? 

                                      BUDDY 
                        His face is like the moon. So 
                        beautiful. I used to call him 
                        Moonface, but he didn't like that for 
                        long. Thought I was making fun of him. 

      Ellen's breathing is short and rapid. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        That sick bastard. He cuts out their 
                        eyes? 








 26                                       BUDDY 
                                (dismissive) 
                        Oh, he does that with everyone, girl. 
                      I thought we was clear on that 
                        already. You have to be on certain 
                        terms to relate to him and the eyes, 
                        well&they're usually the first things 
                        that have to go. I guess we're lucky, 
                        you and me. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Why hasn't he killed us? 

                                      BUDDY 
                        Reasons. There must be a million 
                        reasons. He might be busy. After all, 
                        he has to move those cars miles away 
                        to dump them so that no one can ever 
                        find us. 

      Ellen considers this. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Oh, he's so smart. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Listen to me, okay? I left my 
                        cellphone up on the road. I can get 
                        you out of here. Okay? If you can get 
                        me out of these 
                                (shows him her cuffs) 
                      I can leave and go get us help. Okay? 

                                      BUDDY 
                        Sorry. 

      Buddy holds up his own arms, which are also cuffed. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                      I would if I could, but I can't so I 
                        won't. 

      Suddenly, there is a THUMP from upstairs. DUST rains down 
      on Ellen. She looks up to the ceiling. Ellen struggles 
      frantically with her cuffs. Buddy launches into another 
      rant as the THUMPING draws nearer. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        So, about the candy. Did you bring 
                        any? What's your name anyway? I'm 
                        Buddy. Did I tell you that already? We 
                        can be good friends for a while. I 
                        think he really likes you  



 27                                       ELLEN 
                                (interrupts) 
                        Shut up! 

                                      BUDDY 
                        We could sing some songs! Do you know 
                        any songs? 

      Through the slatted roof, Ellen sees a FIGURE STOMPING 
      overhead. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                      I know lots of songs! 

      The basement doors are thrown open. Light from above shafts 
      down on Ellen's terrified expression. Buddy instantly 
      wheels back into the darkness and hangs his head. 

      Moonface STOMPS down the stairs. He stares at the 
      trembling, tearful Ellen for a long beat. He then crosses 
      to the Young Woman and SNAPS a SWITCH on a mysterious-
      looking gadget. He pulls a ripcord and suddenly ROAD CREW 
      WORK LIGHTS flood the cellar with blinding light. SIRENS 
      BLARE and the room is REVEALED more thoroughly in the 
      light. We see the full effect of Moonface's work each 
      corpse has had its eyes drilled out. 

      Ellen squints and recoils, blinded and terrified by the 
      display. As her eyes adjust, she can make out the focal 
      point of the basement-- 

    A large DRILL PRESS in the center of the room, powered by a 
      WHIRRING GENERATOR and complete with a table and straps to 
      hold a body down. The main drill bit is attached to a large 
      mechanical arm and there is a crank to one side. 

      Moonface scoops up the Young Woman on the floor and carries 
      her to the table. He positions her so that her head is 
      directly beneath the drill and straps her down. Coming to, 
      the Woman MOANS. Ellen looks on in horror. 

      Moonface gives the leg strap a final yank, eliciting a 
      horrific SCREAM from the Woman. Realizing what's happening 
      to her, she CRIES. Moonface clamps his hand over her mouth, 
      but he can barely muffle her WAILS. 

      Ellen struggles with her handcuffs. 

      CLOSE ON Moonface's hand as he pushes a button. The drill 
      bit WHIZZES to life. The Woman SCREAMS. Ellen CRIES and 
      shakes her head furiously. 



 28                                       ELLEN 
                        No! No! No! No! 

      Moonface turns the crank and the drill begins its descent. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        No! 

      The Woman SCREAMS. Moonface holds her face down and GROWLS. 
      CLOSE ON the Woman's eye as the drill bit comes down. 

      ANGLE ON ELLEN. She jerks against her restraints as the 
      SOUND OF THE DRILL BIT TEARING INTO FLESH is heard. Buddy 
      winces. 

      The Woman SCREAMS and her limbs clench. Ellen cries. Buddy 
      looks on in horror. There is another horrifying SQUELCH, 
      and then the Woman's feet go limp. 

      ANGLE ON the drill bit as it pulls back, a slimy spiral of 
      gore and brain matter. Moonface presses the button. Ellen 
      CRIES. Moonface kicks off the switch and the generator 
      POWERS DOWN. 

 

      Ellen stares, wide-eyed, through the dark. REVEAL Moonface 
      as he drags a crucifix, to which the Woman's body is 
      affixed. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        You&sick&fuck. 

      Moonface stops in his tracks. He looks to Ellen. She glares 
      up at him. 

      He draws a finger to his lips. 

                                      MOONFACE 
                        Shh. 

      He turns and carries his trophy up the stairs. Ellen 
      trembles and cries. The cellar door SLAMS closed. Ellen 
      CRIES. Buddy GASPS to life. Ellen WHIRLS around at the 
      sound. 

 29                                       BUDDY 
                        Ain't love grand? We could sing a song 
                        about love. 

      He wheels up to her. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Did I ask you about that? Do you know 
                        any songs? I like to sing. Singing is 
                        good for the soul. 
                              (sings) 
                        His face was sharp as a butcher's 
                        cleaver 
                        But that did not seem to grieve her 
                        Look away look away look away 
                        Dixieland& 

      Ellen turns to him. 

                                      ELLEN 
                              (yells) 
                        Oh, shut up, you crazy old fuck! Shut 
                        up! 

      Buddy is clearly stung. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        Well, there's no need to 
                        shout. 

      Ellen continues to struggle with her cuffs. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Oh, please, little girl. You'll only 
                        hurt yourself. 

      She stands and rubs her cuffs against the pole. 

                                      ELLEN 
                      I have to get out of here. I have to 
                        get out of here. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        You know, if Dixie is not your cup of 
                        tea, fine, but there's really no need 
                        to be impolite. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Shut up! Just shut up! 

                                      BUDDY 
                        Well, what songs do you know? 

      Ellen cries. 


 30                                       ELLEN 
                        Don't you get it? He's going to kill 
                        us. He's going to kill us. 

      Buddy cocks his head at this. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        Don't know any songs, huh? 
                                (beat) 
                        Well, that's okay. There's other ways 
                        to pass the time of day, I guess. 

                                      ELLEN 
                      I need to find a way to get out of 
                        here. I need to find a way to get out 
                        of here. There's got to be some way to 
                        get out of here. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        Maybe there is. Maybe it's right over 
                        your shoulder? 

      Perplexed, Ellen glance over her shoulder, but sees 
      nothing. Turning back, she catches sight of the nail file. 
      She looks at Buddy. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Go for it. 

      Ellen stares at the nail file. Steeling herself, she clamps 
      it in her teeth and gnaws. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        You can make it. I know 
                        you can. Yes. Go deep. 

      Ellen whimpers. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Deeper. 

      Tears streaming down her face, Ellen looks up and catches 
      her breath. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Don t give up. 

      She SOBS. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Don't give up. You're strong. 
                                (whispers) 
                        Not like those dirty girls. Not like 
                        the others. 


 31       Ellen summons her courage. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Don't be afraid. You're strong. 

      She clamps down one more time and works at the file. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Yes, you can make it. I know you can. 

      Ellen yanks with her teeth. With a mighty SPUK, the file 
      pops out.  

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Yes! 

      Ellen grabs the file and sets to work unlocking the cuffs. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Ah! Ah! Oh, my dear. 

      The right cuff opens. She stands and goes to work on the 
      left. Buddy is impressed. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        My dear, dear, girl. 

      There is a CLICK as the left cuff opens. Buddy's eyes pop 
      open and he lets out a victory WHOOP. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Ah! Oh! 

      Ellen starts for the stairs. Buddy holds up his hands and 
      slips free of his own cuffs, revealing that he has been 
      free all along. He stands and starts a victory dance. 

      Ellen turns to him and holds a finger to her lips. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Shh! 

      He jabs a finger in Ellen's direction and LAUGHS 
      maniacally. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        She's loose! 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Shh! 

                                      BUDDY 
                        She's loose! She's loose! 


 32                                       ELLEN 
                        Shh! Be quiet! 

      He points at her and continues his rant. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        She's loose! She's loose! 

                                      ELLEN 
                        He's going to hear you. Shh! 

      Suddenly, the cellar doors are thrown open and a SHAFT OF 
      LIGHT pours down, illuminating Buddy's face. We see now 
      that there is a gory wound above his left eye. 

      ANGLE ON the stairs. Moonface starts down. Ellen looks up 
      in horror. Buddy trots off. 

                                      BUDDY 
                              (sings) 
                        Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton 
                        Old time things I've not forgotten 
                        Look away& 

      Moonface ROARS as he descends. Buddy does a jig in his 
      corner of the room. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Look away look away 
                        Dixieland& 

      Ellen turns this way and that. She grabs a nearby TWO-BY-
      FOUR and THWACKS him with it. Buddy leaps up and down. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        Oh, goody! Goody! Oh, goody! Goody! 
                        Goody! Goody! 

      Ellen turns on Buddy. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Would you shut the hell 
                        up? 

      She WHACKS Buddy square in the face. He crashes to the 
      floor. 

      Moonface charges Ellen. She holds the two-by-four between 
      them, but he muscles her up against the wall and pins her 
      there, the two-by-four under her neck. Using it for 
      leverage, he lifts her up of the ground. CLOSE ON her 
      dangling feet. 



 33       Moonface presses the wood tight against her neck, choking 
      her. She fumbles under her skirt and produces the nail 
      file. 

      With all her remaining strength, she THRUSTS it deep into 
      his gut. He GROWLS and lurches forward, setting her free. 
      She scrambles up the stairs. 

 

      Ellen emerges from the basement and SLAMS the doors down 
      hard. She starts for the door, then stops in her tracks at 
      the sight of--  

    A BABY CRIB in one corner of the room, containing nothing 
      but a BABY-SIZED SKELETON. She GASPS, then whirls around 
      and breaks for the heavy wood front door. She yanks at the 
      deadbolt, but no luck. 

                                      ELLEN 
                              (through tears) 
                        Oh, come on! Come on! 

      She kicks and yanks, but finally realizes she can't escape 
      this way. She turns her attention to the far window, which 
      is broken. 

      She runs for it, but suddenly there is a mighty GROWL. 
      Moonface pops out of the cellar door and grabs her by the 
      ankle. She crashes to the floor, but manages to kick out at 
      him, knocking his knife from his hand. 

      She wriggles free and staggers to the window, ready to 
      throw herself through, but then STOPS IN HER TRACKS. 

      POV through the window on the 50-foot drop from the cliff, 
      straight down into the rocky river below. 

      Moonface rises to his feet with a GROWL. 

      Ellen whirls around. Moon face grabs a nearby axe and 
      SNARLS. Ellen races across the room, then stops. Moonface 
      looks at her and nods. 

      Ellen thinks for a beat. CLOSE ON the knife on the floor, 
      its blade GLEAMING in the moonlight. CLOSE ON the baby 
      crib, the skeleton in full view. 

      Ellen sizes up her options. Moonface GROWLS. She lurches 
      this way and that, setting him off course. Making her 
      choice, she lunges out of reach and grabs the skeleton, 
      DUST raining off the CLATTERING BONES. 


 34       In one deft motion, she brings it up and SMASHES it into 
      Moonface's face. He reels backwards and clasps his hands to 
      his head. 

      Ellen crouches down and grabs the knife. She WHOOSHES it 
      around in her hand. Her eyes flash wide with grim 
      determination as she sizes up her victim. 

      Quickly she flips the knife around in her fingers, just as 
      we saw Bruce do. An instant later she expertly flips it 
      around into a stabbing hold. She leaps up and lunges at 
      Moonface, sinking the blade deep between his shoulder 
      blades. 

      She yanks it out. He MOANS. She KICKS him in the butt. He 
      spins around and kicks her across the room. 

      Ellen recovers, and, like a seasoned knife fighter, swiftly 
      slices him across the back. Moonface howls and rises up in 
      pain, and as he does, he exposes his chest. Seizing the 
      moment, Ellen slips the blade cleanly between his sternum 
      and his ribs, burying it up to the hilt. 

      He staggers back and his momentum sends him CRASHING out 
      the window. As he flies through the glass, he grabs 
      desperately for the bed sheets as he falls, sending the bed 
      FLYING against the wall. 

      POV through the window, on Moonface, who dangles over the 
      river, clinging to the bed sheet for dear life. Ellen 
      stares out the window at him. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Hell of a night& 

      He claws at the sheet, GRUNTING as he pulls himself up bit 
      by bit. CLOSE ON the sheets as they TEAR beneath his 
      weight. Ellen gives a matter-of-fact nod. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Huh, Moonface? 

      He GROWLS. The sheets continue to TEAR. Ellen turns away, 
      not even watching as the sheets finally give way and 
      Moonface FALLS. 

      We PULL IN on Ellen's vacant face. REVEAL a gun on a shelf 
      nearby. She grabs it. 

      MONTAGE-- 

      CLOSE ON the barrel of the gun as Ellen loads it with 
      shells. She gives it a SPIN and snaps it closed. 


 35       Ellen straps a leather belt around her waist and shoves the 
      gun into it. 

      She finds a pair of boots and puts them on. 

      She finds a crowbar in a far corner of the room. 

      She THWACKS the front door with the crowbar. With a few 
      more THWACKS, the deadbolt gives. 

 

      CLOSE ON the KEYS, which dangle from the ignition. Ellen 
      turns them, and the engine SPUTTERS to life. 

      Behind the wheel of the car, Ellen heaves with relief. 

      She gets out and goes around to the front of the car, where 
      the hood is propped open. She closes it.  

      She finds that the Buick is still there, door still open. 
      She whips around to look behind her. All is still and 
      quiet. 

      She moves around to the back of her car and pops the trunk. 
      Her face is partially illuminated as she gazes down into 
      it, an inscrutable expression upon her face. ANGLE ON the 
      trunk to REVEAL  

      The DEAD FACE of Bruce stares straight up at her, a look of 
      confused horror in his wide eyes. His body has been jammed 
      into the trunk. He is eerily lit by the moon. 

      An icy Ellen stares down at him. 

      SHOCK CUT TO-- 

 

    A BRIEF FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Bruce's face, just 
      long enough for us to see that his eyes are wild. 




 36       In another FLASH OF LIGHTNING, we see Ellen being thrown 
      backwards into a large mirror, SMASHING it and sending 
      glass raining down. 

      Bruce glares at her for a moment, then bears down. 

                                      BRUCE 
                        You fucking bitch! You goddamned 
                        whore! 

      He CRUNCHES up to her through the glass and yanks her to 
      her feet. She SCREAMS and CRIES. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        What are you doing? What are you 
                        doing? What are you doing? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        You make me sick! 

      He PUNCHES her across the face. She SCREAMS as she CRASHES 
      to the floor. Bruce undoes his leather belt and glares down 
      at her. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                      I bet you wish you could fight me now! 

                                      ELLEN 
                              (through tears) 
                        Oh, my God. 

                                      BRUCE 
                      I bet you wish you fucking listened to 
                        me now, don't you? 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh, stop it, Bruce! Please stop! 

      He crouches down and sets about tying her wrists with his 
      belt. She CRIES. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Please! Please! What are you doing? 
                        What are you doing? What are you 
                        doing? 

                                      BRUCE 
                        I'm not going to stop. I'll stop when 
                        I'm fucking done. 

      He hauls her to her feet and throws her face-down onto the 
      floor. She SCREAMS. 




 37                                       BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        You're acting like a fucking whore, 
                        I'm gonna fuck you like a whore. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Please! No! 

      He mounts her and rips her skirt. She SCREAMS and CRIES as 
      he thrusts violently, over and over again, the violence 
      illuminated by intermittent LIGHTNING. 

      After a few quick thrusts, he climaxes. He lifts himself 
      off her and catches his breath. Limp on the floor, she 
      CRIES. He stands. 

                                      BRUCE (CONT'D) 
                        You know what, Ellen? One last lesson 
                        for you. Ellen. The meek will inherit 
                        shit. 

      Satisfied, he smiles and sighs. 

      Suddenly, from nowhere, Ellen leaps into frame, throwing 
      her bound arms around Bruce's neck, using the length of his 
      belt to catch him in a chokehold. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Oh, I hate you! I hate you! I hate 
                        you! I fucking hate you! 

      She bears down hard. He thrashes against her, but nothing 
      can match the strength of her rage. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        You motherfucker! 

      He crashes to his knees and she rides him all the way down. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        You fucking asshole! I fucking hate 
                        you! I'm going to kill you! 

      Bruce paws at the shards of broken glass, but it is no use. 
      She tightens her hold and his eyes go wide. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        I'm going to fucking kill you. I'm 
                        going to fucking kill you! I'm going 
                        to fucking kill you! 

      She THWACKS his head against the floor and SCREAMS. He 
      GROANS as she tightens the belt. With one last yank, his 
      eyes bug out of his head and he goes limp. 


 38                                       ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                      I hate you. 

      He collapses to the floor. Ellen CRIES. 

                                      ELLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 

      She cowers in a corner. LIGHTENING FLASHES. 

 

      CLOSE on Ellen's hand as she flips the generator switch. 
      She pulls the rip cord and the machine ROARS to life. 
      REVEAL Buddy in the corner, bound to his chair with heavy 
      rope. 

      CLOSE ON Bruce's corpse, splayed on the drill press table. 

      The GENERATOR WHIRS and SIRENS BLARE. Ellen moves up to the 
      crank and presses the button. The drill bit spins. She 
      holds his head in position. 

      Buddy looks on in horror as Ellen calmly turns the crank. 

                                      BUDDY 
                              (whispers) 
                        The eyes see all evil. All the evil in 
                        the world. 

      CLOSE ON the drill bit as it spins up, now dripping with 
      BLOOD and GORE. 

      Ellen switches the drill off. Buddy nods, almost reverent. 

 

      CLOSE ON the now-crucified Bruce, light shining through the 
      eyeholes. Ellen stands behind, admiring her own handiwork. 

      Buddy looks on. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        Beautiful. He almost looks sad, 
                        doesn't he? Like a crying clown. 

      Ellen smirks. 

 39                                       ELLEN 
                        He's the newest member of the family. 
                        You can call him Uncle Brucey. That's 
                        his name. 
                                (beat) 
                      I have him to thank. It was all his 
                        hard work and determination that got 
                        me out of here alive. 
                                (beat) 
                        The fucking bastard. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        I'm so sorry for you. 

      Ellen turns to Buddy. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        So, so sorry. 

      Ellen moves up to Buddy, her eyes steely. 

                                      ELLEN 
                          Everybody's sorry for something. 

      She pulls out the gun and points it at him. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        No. 

      CLOSE ON an icy Ellen. 

                                      BUDDY (CONT'D) 
                        No. 
                                (beat) 
                        No. 

      She stares at him for a beat. Slowly, she draws a finger to 
      her lips. 

                                      ELLEN 
                        Shh. 

                                      BUDDY 
                        No! 

      Ellen FIRES. 

 

      Ellen is at the wheel, grimy, covered in mud, eyes staring 
      straight ahead. She has the same strange expression of 
      conflict and uncertainty we have seen before.
