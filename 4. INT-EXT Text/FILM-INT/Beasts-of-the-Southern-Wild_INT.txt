A tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed
on the floor. We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a
baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an
unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of
unmistakable wisdom.
Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen
on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice.
Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by
DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention.
CUT TO:
Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands,
getting right in there like it was a candy apple. It looks
really yummy.
Pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around
her.
A hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of
the Shacko. Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws
corn to the chickens.
WINK
Share with the dogs.
Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a
filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body.
This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a
handsome young pup.
MUSIC CUTS abruptly as a basket of crawfish is slammed in
front of camera. The crawfish squirming and struggling for
life engulfs the screen.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Meat.
A fearsome, uncompromising leader, sexy like a lady
bullfighter, peeks at Hushpuppy over a mass of squirming
crawfish. This is MISS BATHSHEBA (36).
She points to three students, pushing their heads with her
finger, each time announcing:
MISS BATHSHEBA
MEAT. MEAT. MEAT.
The twelve students follow her through a maze of creatures
caged in mason jars, basins, and boxes with breathing holes-
her educational tools.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
Every animal is made out of meat.
I am meat, ya'll asses meat.
Everything is part of the buffet of
the universe.
Miss Bathsheba rolls up the leg of her skirt.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
This here, is an Aurochs.
Riding her thigh, is tattooed a scene much like a cave
painting in Lascaux. In thick black ink, it depicts a battle
between early men wielding spears, and giant bull-like
animals bearing down over them.
9
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
A fierce, mean creature that roamed
the earth back when we all lived in
caves. They would gobble the cave-
babies down right in front of their
cave-parents. And the cavemen
couldn't do nothing about it,
because they were too poor, too
stupid, too small. Who here thinks
the Cavemen were sitting around
crying like a buncha pussies?
Children stare blankly, no one raises their hand.
Hushpuppy watches a heroic crawfish crest the basket, fall to
the floor, and make a run for it.
Miss Bathsheba snatches up the rogue crawdad and flings it
back into the vat.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
Y'all better think about that.
Cause any day now, the fabric of
the universe is coming unraveled.
The ice caps gonna melt, the
water's gonna rise, and everything
south of the levee's going under.
She points to a map showing a ragged coastline. On the wrong
side of a giant line marked "levee" is an island labeled "The
Bathtub."
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
Ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a
whole bunch of water. Y'all better
learn to survive.
A mysterious COLD WIND fills the air. Hushpuppy stares into
a wall poster of an ice cliff reading: THE SOUTH POLE.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
Way back in the day, the Aurochs
was king of the world.
Hushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing, up to
Wink's shanty in the trees. Windell, her dirty Chihuahua,
follows behind.
HUSHPUPPY
Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up?
Hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko.
HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
Daddy?
Nothing.
She goes inside.
The house is empty.
She checks the Shacko for food. Nothing.
Hushpuppy draws a picture of Wink on a foldout mattress...
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy
and nobody. They got to live in
the woods, and eat grass, and steal
underpants.
Hushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of Wink.
Playing don't-touch-the-floor, Hushpuppy navigates her house.
The room has with holes in the walls blocked with old clothes
and paper towels. Homemade toys fill every surface. This is
the domain of a child at loose ends.
Hushpuppy leaps over her bed- a nook piled with clothes- and
plugs in the Christmas lights.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O)
Everything we still got from Mamma,
we keep in my house.
We push in on a shrine to her mother:
A red basketball jersey. An apron. A sawed-off shotgun. A
child's drawing of a beautiful lady.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Daddy says, the first time she
looked at me, it made her heart
beat so big, that she thought it
would blow up. That's why she swam
away.
Hushpuppy takes the jersey down. She puts it over a chair in
the dining area.
Hushpuppy gets a can of cat food. A pot. Water in a bowl.
Her actions have a sad sense of routine to them- she's been
left alone before, and has her own self-invented system for
feeding herself.
She opens a can of cat food, takes it out with her hand and
throws it in a pot. She licks the remnants off her finger.
13
MARIETTA'S VOICE
Hi my sweet baby.
HUSHPUPPY
Hi momma.
MARIETTA, Hushpuppy's imaginary, invisible mamma, is speaking
from the basketball jersey chair. Marietta functions like an
imaginary friend- Hushpuppy is the only one who can see her.
Hushpuppy takes the pot, puts it on the stove.
MARIETTA'S VOICE
Hushpuppy what you doing there?
You being good like I taught you?
HUSHPUPPY
Yes, mamma.
Hushpuppy turns on the gas.
Hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions: oven mitts, a
helmet, she flips the table and hides behind it.
She aims the stove lighter: a flame thrower made from a
cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant. A spray of
flames ignites the stove in a FIREBALL.
CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER. Hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove. She ties
on an apron and sways to the music. She is dressing like her
mom.
Marietta's Voice sings to her.
MARIETTA'S VOICE
You're good, you make me happy /
you're good, you make me happy.
HUSHPUPPY
That's pretty Mamma.
MARIETTA'S VOICE
You're pretty Hushpuppy.
Hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying
in fat, which in her POV is a surreal churning vision, like
the bubbling lava at the center of the earth.
She's SHOCKED out of her vision by a YOWLING CAT being flung
across the yard.
14
WINK (O.S)
Get out of my way you fat animal!
Hushpuppy jumps down from the stove, grabs a bowl of water,
and runs to greet Wink,
Hushpuppy stomps inside. Her cat food is burning, with steam
jetting up to the ceiling. She thinks about it for a moment,
and turns the burner up. Smoke billows.
Hushpuppy grabs her basketball jersey off the chair and jumps
over the breakfront counter. Behind her A MASSIVE GREASE
EXPLOSION.
Hushpuppy ducks down, panicking. She check over the median.
The stove is on engulfed in flames.
Hushpuppy scrambles under a cardboard box.
The walls of the box are decorated with years of her
drawings. In here she feels a strange safety. The FLAMES
and BREAKING WINDOWS feel distant and muffled.
She draws a hieroglyphic of herself sad and crying on an
island with a sun and a palm tree.
She peeks out as Wink runs into the house, which is filled
with black smoke, flickering flames.
WINK (O.S.)
(panicking from inside)
Hushpuppy!? Boss lady!? Hushpuppy
where you at!?
Hushpuppy drops the box closed. Smoke billows into the box,
filling it up.
16
HUSHPUPPY (V.O)
If Daddy kill me, I ain't gonna be
forgotten, I'm recording my story
for the scientists of the future.
Hushpuppy draws a bigger figure giving her a hug as Wink's
panicked fury intensifies outside.
WINK (O.S)
HUSHPUPPY!? Where are you Boss!?
HUSHPUPPY (V.O)
In a million years, when kids go to
school, they gonna know that once
there was Hushpuppy and she lived
with her Daddy in the Bathtub.
Wink pulls Hushpuppy's drawings off the walls, he flings them
out the door to safety.
Hushpuppy coughs.
Wink has heard. He looks toward the box.
WINK
BOSS LADY?
Hushpuppy and makes a runs for it, flying out the door.
WINK (CONT'D)
Don't you run away from me. I
swear to GOD Hushpuppy!
Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba frantically pull herbs and
roots from her containers of medicinal oddities and pack it
into a large medicine jar.
MISS BATHSHEBA
It's gonna be OK baby.
Bathsheba hands Hushpuppy the medicine jar.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
Ok, Hushpuppy, here's what I need
you to do. You take this medicine
and run as fast as you can. Go!
Through the bus window, Hushpuppy watches Wink prepare for
the storm as branches and debris fly by him. He RANTS to
himself and drinks. He ties the Turck onto the house.
Hushpuppy looks to where her animals lurch and freeze, run
around in circles, pant heavily. They feel it coming.
Rain drops start to spatter the window and Wink trips and
falls trying to catch a fleeing chicken.
Now, the full force of the storm HOWLS and CLATTERS the
shutters. Rain screams against the corrugated metal roof.
Wink tapes padding over all sharp corners and plastic wraps
the furniture. He's Hushpuppy-proofing everything.
He runs a piece of duct tape across the floor.
WINK
This side is still Wink's house.
No toys, and no girl stuff over
here.
Wink pushes charred toys from Hushpuppy's house across the
line.
WINK (CONT'D)
So if I want to come over that side
and smack you in the face, that's
against the rules. So there's a
plus for you.
23
Hushpuppy is not able to see the bright side here.
WINK (CONT'D)
Now come on down here and get in
the boat, man.
He points to a trunk on the floor. Hushpuppy hops down and
gets in. Wink sits on his air mattress.
WINK (CONT'D)
If the water get real high, we
gonna float to the top and we gonna
bust through the roof and we gonna
ride away, okay?
Wink puts a pair of mismatching water wings on her.
WINK (CONT'D)
You never NEVER take these off.
I'm your Daddy, and you do what I
tell you to do, because it's my job
to keep you from dying, ok? So sit
back and just listen to me...
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
CLOSE YOUR EYES!
Hushpuppy watches Wink pretending to sleep. The THUNDER
scares the bejesus out of him again.
She looks to the ceiling where water is starting to pour in
steadily.
Looks back at Wink who is sneaking a sip from his liquor
bottle. He resumes his phony sleep.
A strong gust of wind JOLTS the entire room and he springs
out of bed.
WINK (CONT'D)
Why you starin' at me like that? I
can't sleep with you starin' at me
like that.
Wink paces the floor.
WINK (CONT'D)
Listen. You need to understand,
you're a kid and I'm a man.
She doesn't understand.
24
WINK (CONT'D)
What, you scared?
Hushpuppy nods. THUNDER BOOMS and Wink is the one who
flinches.
WINK (CONT'D)
Don't be scared, no storm can't
beat no Doucet. I'm gonna show
you. You watch.
But he can see she's still scared.
WINK (CONT'D)
I'm'll show you! We Doucets we're
not scared of no damn storm.
Wink grabs a bottle of moonshine and climbs down the hatch in
the floor into the storm.
Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out.
OUTSIDE. The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full
sprint through the 100 MPH winds. He tears his clothes off
and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him.
WINK (CONT'D)
Look at me! Look at me Hushpuppy!
Watch me kick butt.
Wink fires his shotgun at the heavens.
WINK (CONT'D)
Hell yea! I'm right here! I'm
right here I ain't going nowhere.
AHHHHHH!!!
A THUNDER CLAP shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam
CRASHES down.
Hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe.
Windell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, BARKS,
panicking herself.
HUSHPUPPY
Mamma!? MAMMA!?
CUT TO:
25
Hushpuppy has enclosed herself under a table with a
tablecloth on it. She's drawing on the floor with charcoal.
Something alive hits the roof and scurries across. We hear
the entire house MOAN, or was it a distant ROAR?
HUSHPUPPY
Daddy?
Wink's hacking cough, which has gotten worse since last we
heard it, fills the room. Hushpuppy tries to shake him
awake.
Hushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt.
On Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web
of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins
covering his entire heart.
Hushpuppy's eyes go wide with horror.
They enter the bar, empty bottles, half eaten crabs, and
general party debris are littered everywhere.
30
Little Jo is sprawled on the floor under a table. Is she
dead or just wasted?
WINK
Little Jo!
She awakes with a start and bangs her head on the table.
LITTLE JO
Wink!?
Wink and Walrus run to help her up.
LITTLE JO (CONT'D)
(TO WALRUS)
You don't touch me you filthy
bastard!
(TO WINK)
Wink, you get me.
They both lift her.
LITTLE JO (CONT'D)
Goin' on all night `bout how
tonight's the last night on earth
we gotta make it count. Talkin'
dirty right in front of Peter T.
WALRUS
Sorry Peter T.
Peter T enters from the Bathroom.
WINK
Peter T, my man! I knew you wasn't
gonna leave me man!
Peter T speaks in his polite, level-headed, soft sweet voice.
PETER T
Oh no, oh no.
WALRUS
(re: Peter T)
That is one classic dude right
there.
WINK
Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you
stayed man! RHHAAAA!
31
Wink jiggles Peter T's ample belly. Peter T giggles with
glee.
Wink puts one arm around Walrus and the other around Peter T.
He smiles to Hushpuppy.
She laughs too, the first smile in quite some days.
The Bathtub crew are lolling in the later party stages.
There is a rooster on the table looking like the most sober
creature in the room by far.
WALRUS
If I had wings, I know I could have
flown in that bad boy. But I would
have probably bounced off a tree,
or...
Hushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells.
WINK
Hushpuppy! Did I ever tell you the
story of your conception?
The bar crowd chuckles.
WINK (CONT'D)
When me and Hushpuppy's Mamma first
met we was so shy, we used to sit
around, and drink beer, and smile
at each other. One day we was so
shy we just napped...
Wink's voice FADES DOWN as Hushpuppy's fantasy takes over.
She closes her eyes.
We follow behind Marietta's supple curves as she walks into
the kitchen. Her white slip is almost see through...almost.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
Back when Daddy used to talk about
Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty
she never even had to turn on the
stove.
She runs her fingers along the counter and the burners IGNITE
one by one as she passes.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
She just walk into a room and water
start to boil.
Water starts to bubbles like a spontaneous volcanic eruption.
Marietta reaches into the frigidaire, and pulls out two ice-
cold beers.
Ice melts down the bottles.
She opens them on the counter, flawlessly.
She walks over to Wink. Stands there. A hot mess.
Wink's voice FADES UP.
33
WINK (V.O.)
Your Momma battered that gator up,
and set it to fry.
CUT TO:
Wink tips his drink.
WINK
...and Hushpuppy popped into the
universe maybe four minutes later.
He empties the glass, sufficiently drunk now.
WINK (CONT'D)
I got it under control.
Wink looks away, lost in his own fantasy.
Over Marietta's shoulder, beads of sweat form along the strap
of her slip. Good Lord.
Wink looks, and meets her eyes. The gaze of a proud and
smitten man.
Grits fall through the chimney vent, into the boiling water.
Dancing like all the invisible particles of the universe.
Hushpuppy stares hard, her face locked in pride and
determination. Filling with all the strength and heroism of
her long-lost mother. She's ready to snap into action.
Hushpuppy opens the door.
We hear RUSTLING and WHISPERING inside school.
It's three little girls left behind in the storm. JOY
STRONG, a tall, wild-haired leader; LIZARD, a tiny thing in a
giant man's tee shirt, and T-LOU, the muscle of this girl
gang, looking very meek in her desperate condition.
The girls are huddled against each other, terrified, hungry,
and alone.
Wink pours a mountain of crab and shrimp at a great communal
table, assembled from many different tables.
WINK
Come on lets go! Time to eat!
Come on children, feed up time!
He sends a feast sliding across the floor under the table,
where Joy, T-Lou, and Lizard dig in.
Wink has decorated the bar with all the waterlogged relics of
the Bathtub.
35
The room is a shrine of people's chairs, umbrellas, clothing.
We're late in the game, and the party has descended into
utter debauchery.
Jean raises a glass.
JEAN BATTISTE
To the last of the food!
WALRUS
To the last of the water!
LITTLE JO
You ain't drinkin' no water.
Miss Bathsheba pour shots and toasts.
MISS BATHSHEBA
Yea, tastes like more, alright!
Hushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps, sitting on top of
the table.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
For the ones we'd never find, we
make a funeral the Bathtub way,
with no crying allowed.
Drunken Wink is giving drunken Walrus a bath as he eats.
WALRUS
When the water goes down, I'm gonna
French kiss the dirt!
MISS BATHSHEBA
Water's not goin' down man.
WINK
Nah, that's my beautiful place
under there.
MISS BATHSHEBA
Man you know they got plenty of
salt coming into that water,
everything beautiful is gone.
Trees are gonna dies first, then
the animals, then the fish.
WINK
I got it under control.
36
Hushpuppy picks up a crab. She tries to pound it open, tries
yanking on a leg. She can't shell it.
JEAN BATTISTE
Come on Hushpuppy, come over here
lemme show you how.
Hushpuppy sits down next to Jean, a good pupil.
JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D)
Here baby. You hold like this,
then you turn it over like that.
Hushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration, but a
bit tentative.
We see Wink look away from Walrus and Jo's bawdy humor
extravaganza and focus in on Hushpuppy. His disdain is
palpable for this froufrou shelling technique.
JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D)
Don't be scared of it now. Now,
you take this knife, and you pop
this off.
Jean holds Hushpuppy's hand and guides a knife to open the
belly of the crab.
JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D)
Atta girl.
WINK
NO! Hushpuppy--
Wink POUNDS the table. And the party falls suddenly silent.
Wink pushes the utensil away. He grabs a crab, opens it in
three virtuosic hand motions.
Grease and spice explode everywhere and Wink sucks the face
of the crab clean. It is beautiful to watch.
He slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy.
WINK (CONT'D)
Beast it!
Hushpuppy looks to Miss Bathsheba for guidance.
MISS BATHSHEBA
You heard your Daddy. Beast it.
37
Hushpuppy pulls on the crab shell with all her might. She
doesn't have the power.
EVERYONE
(CLAPPING ALONG)
BEAST IT! BEAST IT! BEAST IT!
The kids jump out from under the table and chant.
Hushpuppy is turning blue, her eyes bulge with effort...
CRACK!
Hushpuppy opens the crab claw and sucks down the meat.
Everyone goes wild with applause! The kids too!
Hushpuppy stands up, ascending to the top of the table. She
lets loose a WARRIOR CRY and flexes her muscles, deadly
triumphant.
Little Jo gets so excited she starts dancing on the table.
She CACKLES and jitterbugs wildly.
Walrus gets up to join her. Jean gets up and dances too.
All the kids get up.
Wink glows with pride. Miss Bathsheba smiles.
WINK
Yea! You see what kinda family we
got?! We got feeling!
Miss Bathsheba puts Lizard's head in her lap, Lizard is
playing as if she's unconscious after hyperventilating.
MISS BATHSHEBA
(teaching a lesson)
Come here, like this.
She takes Hushpuppy's hand and places it on Lizard's chest.
She moves her hand in a circular motion.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
Like this. Tee-Lou get some water.
Tee-Lou runs to get a handful of water.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
Quick little circles. Good for the
heart. Joy Strong?
Joy turns her back. Miss Bathsheba shakes her head.
Tee-Lou returns and pours water on Lizard's head, cooling
her.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
This is most important thing I can
ever teach y'all. You got to take
care of people that's smaller and
sweeter than you are.
Hushpuppy registers this advice, takes it to heart. She rubs
Lizard's chest with delicacy and affection.
39
Lizard's breathing returns to normal, and she sits up
peacefully. Hushpuppy is awestruck. Bathsheba gets to her
feet.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
That's better.
Hushpuppy watches Wink sleeping. His breathing has gotten
worse.
She tiptoes up with her red basketball jersey and lays it
down on Wink, tucking him in just right.
A DISTANT RUMBLING is heard. Cutting off suddenly as we...
CUT TO:
The kids sleep on Miss Bathsheba in a big pile on the floor.
41
Hushpuppy wakes hearing SHIFTING and a SNAP behind her.
Peter T is uncapping a shotgun shell and pouring black powder
into a small jar.
She looks out the window where Jean Battiste is unhooking a
propane container from Miss Bathsheba's burner. He opens her
chest freezer and hefts out a 12-foot garfish, dropping the
container in the water.
JEAN BATTISTE
Shit!
Wink sneaks up and whispers to Hushpuppy.
WINK
Boss, Daddy's gotta take care of
something.
Hushpuppy is instantly concerned, she's heard this line
before, and it always leads to trouble.
WINK (CONT'D)
I'm gonna fix everything back how
it was.
HUSHPUPPY
Everything gonna go right back?
WINK
Hell yeah, we gonna win.
Wink pounds his chest in solidarity. Hushpuppy matches his
pound, but without confidence.
WINK (CONT'D)
Boss, anything go wrong, Walrus is
Daddy.
Wink and Hushpuppy look Walrus-- the face of doddering
drunken bewilderment. A goat licks him.
Hushpuppy is not comforted.
WINK (CONT'D)
You're gonna be the king of the
Bathtub, I promise that.
Wink can see he's getting nowhere.
42
WINK (CONT'D)
Just sit here I'll be right back.
The DOOR CLOSING wakes Miss Bathsheba up. She scans the
room, noticing the three missing people.
WALRUS
(an unconvincing lie)
I think they be gone. I-I really
can't say where.
MISS BATHSHEBA
Walrus, don't make me slap your
ass! They go to the levee!?
Walrus is intimidated into silence.
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D)
You so much as piss on that wall,
you know what them people gonna do?
They gonna smoke us out and stick
us in a damn shelter.
Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba go for her boat keys.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
Daddy says, brave men don't run
from their home.
Hushpuppy scurries out the side window, escaping outside
before Miss Bathsheba sees her.
WINK
Peter T hand me the-
He looks, Peter T has both hands on the Turck.
WINK (CONT'D)
Peter you didn't drop the trip-
line?
PETER T
No I did not.
Peter T thinks a moment.
PETER T (CONT'D)
Oh, yes I did.
JEAN BATTISTE
Oh, Peter T.
PETER T
I'm sorry.
Wink dunks under water.
Hushpuppy climbs the stairs of the original house to get to
the top of the Shacko.
She looks down through the hole in the floor.
In her POV Wink climbs into bed, he painfully takes his shirt
off. The bruise on his chest has extended all the way across
his stomach.
Hushpuppy looks out on the water for some sign that
Marietta's still with her. The light shining on the water is
off. She sees nothing but dead trees and a defunct oil rig.
HUSHPUPPY
Mamma!?
Nothing.
HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
Mamma where you at!?
As if in response, we hear a HELICOPTER LOUDSPEAKER.
PILOT
This is a mandatory evacuation
area, you can no longer live here.
Everyone in this area, has to
leave. I repeat....
She pours the crushed up roots into Wink's mouth, careful not
to disturb him. Wink dooesn't move.
Hushpuppy gently folds in the orange fungus. Quiet, quiet--
WINK
GUUAAAHH!
Wink spews up an explosive cloud of medicine.
WINK (CONT'D)
God damn!
Wink grabs her medicine jar and threatens her with it.
WINK (CONT'D)
What you doing!?
He smashes it against the wall.
WINK (CONT'D)
What the hell's wrong with you!
Hushpuppy is so upset she doesn't know what to do. She
screams in anger.
HUSHPUPPY
Raaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!
Raging, Hushpuppy breaks everything she can get her hands on,
ruining everything Wink's reassembled, tipping shelves, pans,
walls. She grabs a fishing pole and starts bashing Wink's
grill over and over.
WINK
You wanna throw things? Come on!
I can do that too. You want to
play that game? Let's throw stuff!
Wink joins in, breaking stuff too, channeling all his anger
into the destruction.
Wink throws himself into the wall. It breaks off and dumps a
series of shelves all over the floor.
49
Hushpuppy can't believe it.
Suddenly it's cathartic, they start throwing objects at each
other and laughing.
WINK (CONT'D)
Come on! Come on!
Wink pegs her in the face with a stuffed animal and she
grins.
Hushpuppy throws a pillow!
WINK (CONT'D)
AAAAH!!! COME ON! COME ON!
Hushpuppy throws a shoe.
WINK (CONT'D)
AAAAAHHHHH!!!!! YEAH!! COME ON!
Hushpuppy and Wink destroy everything in the house.
Something goes off in Wink chest. He grabs his heart and
collapses on the floor.
Hushpuppy realizes something's not right. She throws a life-
jacket at her father.
Wink continues to force a smile at her. Hushpuppy won't
return the smile.
HUSHPUPPY
Man. You think I don't know.
Hushpuppy's bottom lip starts quivering.
Wink's smiles disappears.
WINK
Hey. No crying. Don't you cry
man. Don't you cry!
He threatens her with a shoe. Hushpuppy hides behind an
overturned chest.
WINK (CONT'D)
HEY! Don't cry damn it!
Wink hangs his head and catches his breath against the wall.
50
WINK (CONT'D)
Shit.
He pull himself to his feet and grabs a bottle of moonshine.
He sets up two cups on the table.
WINK (CONT'D)
Come on get a drink.
Wink pours Hushpuppy a shot.
Hushpuppy sips. Winces. Looks suspiciously at her father.
Sips again.
Wink takes one straight from the bottle.
WINK (CONT'D)
This counts as I'm sorry for a
whole buncha things. Lord.
HUSHPUPPY
You gonna be gone?
WINK
What? No!
HUSHPUPPY
You gonna leave me alone?
WINK
I ain't gon' leave nothing.
HUSHPUPPY
Cause if you be gone, I be gone
too.
WINK
Hushpuppy, that is not how it
works.
HUSHPUPPY
I will. Sometimes in the bed I
start shaking and can't stop. I
got what you got.
WINK
No man. That's just a side effect
of being a stupid little girl.
51
HUSHPUPPY
I ain't gonna be dead?
WINK
No. You? No! You gonna live a
hundred years more. You know what,
show me the guns.
Hushpuppy shoves Wink.
WINK (CONT'D)
Show me them guns man.
Wink clears everything off the table with one sweep.
WINK (CONT'D)
Show me the guns! Guns! guns! guns!
guns! guns!
Hushpuppy flexes her biceps. She begins to chant, fierce and
TRIUMPHANT--
HUSHPUPPY
Guns! Guns! Guns! Guns!.....
WINK
(OVERLAPPING)
Guns man, give to me! Guns! Guns!
Wink holds up his hand to arm-wrestle. They SCREAM in tandem
as Hushpuppy pins him hard.
WINK (CONT'D)
Ooooo, Hushpuppy you the man. Who
the man?
HUSHPUPPY
I'm the man.
WINK
Who the man!?
HUSHPUPPY
I'm the man!
WINK
TELL ME LOUDER WHO THE MAN!!!!
HUSHPUPPY
I'm THE MAN!!!!!!!
52
WINK
YOU THE MAN, RIGHT?!
Wink is overcome with love. It's too much for him to bear.
WINK (CONT'D)
Fuck this table!
In a violent euphoria, Wink grabs the table and hurls it
across the room.
This scares Hushpuppy. She stares silently at her wild
animal father, longing for something more than rage.
Wink takes a step toward like he's going to comfort her, then
stops, turning back.
WINK (CONT'D)
I gotta lay down hear? I gotta be
strong. Don't be scared.
Wink lays down in the corner.
Hushpuppy doesn't go to bed, she just stands there.
WINK (CONT'D)
What?
Hushpuppy waits, not backing down.
WINK (CONT'D)
(GIVING IN)
Come here.
Hushpuppy goes to Wink.
WINK (CONT'D)
Lay down.
Wink pats his heart for her to put her head down on it.
A long beat.
WINK (CONT'D)
Hey.
HUSHPUPPY
Yea?
WINK
You ain't the one who's sick.
53
She listens to his BIG HUGE HEART.
The SOUND becomes recognizable as a HELICOPTER PROPELLER.
Hushpuppy opens her eyes, still tucked in Wink's arm.
Through the wall she sees FOUR WELL-DRESSED men. They are
out of place like aliens exiting their space ship.
She rouses Wink, he hears the FOREIGN SOUNDING VOICES and
yanks Hushpuppy up. He instinctively pulls him and Hushpuppy
behind the over-turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to
defend them with.
EVACUATOR (O.S.)
(from outside the door)
This is a mandatory evacuation
area. Everyone in this region has
to leave.
Wink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to
enter.
54
WINK
We ain't going nowhere!
Hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well. It's a standoff.
Three evacuation workers ram the door of Little Jo's house.
Little Jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife
and civil war era pistol.
LITTLE JO
You gonna have to shoot me cause
I'm not going.
EVACUATOR 2
Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you.
LITTLE JO
I ain't never left here and I won't
never will.
She spits. They get closer.
LITTLE JO (CONT'D)
Son, don't make me cancel your
birth certificate.
The Muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle, slam
her to the ground. It's horrible.
EVACUATOR 2
Relax, relax ma'am.
LITTLE JO
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
They drag Little Jo out of the house.
MATCH CUT to Wink and Hushpuppy pinned and being dragged out.
WINK
Get your hands off of her! I'm
gonna kill you! Let her go!
55
The interior of the refugee camp is violently, fluorescent-
lit and painted white in an attempt to maintain a facade of
sterility.
Hushpuppy stares at the strange and modern ceiling like
they've descended from another planet.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
It didn't look like a prison, it
looked like a fish tank with no
water.
The Bathtub residents walk through the gymnasium which has
been converted into a holding tank/hospital for refugees.
Student doctors are examining, treating, feeding people. The
abandoned souls, the sick, and the old are lined up waiting
for assistance.
A processed egg patty jiggles weirdly as it hits Hushpuppy's
tray.
WINK
Don't eat that.
DR. MALONEY, a clean-cut, over-extended handsome young doctor
hustles toward the lunch line.
DR. MALONEY
Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with
you, we found something in your
test. It's-
WINK
Whoa whoa whoa, not in front of my
kid. Stay, Hushpuppy.
56
Wink pulls Maloney out of earshot.
DR. MALONEY
Mr. Doucet, there's no easy way to
say this...
Hushpuppy struggles to hear more, only a couple words come
through the din of refugees.
DR. MALONEY (CONT'D)
...require surgery
immediately...you need to think
about what you want for your
daughter...you could die.
In Hushpuppy's POV: Maloney puts a sympathetic hand on Wink's
shoulder and Wink pushes it off violently. Maloney puts up
his hands in peace and Wink shoves him through one of the
curtains and is assaulted by a flood of orderlies.
WINK
I don't need nothing from you! You
keep your hands off her! I don't
need nothing from y'all! Let me
go!
Hushpuppy is snatched as she fights to come to his rescue.
HUSHPUPPY
Daddy!
They tackle Wink to the ground. He goes limp as he falls.
We TRACK with Wink as he comes to consciousness rolling
through the cots. He is sedated and being pushed in a
wheelchair.
He looks through an open door.
In Wink's POV- Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and the rest of
Bathsheba's original school class play in a room with a
BABYSITTER.
She tickles Hushpuppy, who has been given new clothes and
looks like a normal little girl for the first time. Her
boots and boys underpants have been traded for a delicate
blue dress. The image is jarring.
57
BABYSITTER
Hushpuppy needs a hug.
HUSHPUPPY
I don't want your hug!
The Babysitter squeezes Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tries to squirm
away.
BABYSITTER
Hushpuppy, that's not how nice
girls act. Say "I'm sorry ma'am."
Hey! Say it. Say it or you're
going to corner time.
Hushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his
horrifying appearance.
Wink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls
by. His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on. He tries to
scream and nothing but a SEDATED MOAN comes out of his mouth.
He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm.
ORDERLY
(gently moving Wink's hand
AWAY)
There there, sir.
Hushpuppy stares in shock as Wink is wheeled away.
Hushpuppy watches in hiding as a hand covered in a rubber
glove changes the bandage on a surgical scar; it looks
infected and mishandled.
The same hand puts pills in Wink's mouth.
Hushpuppy stands over an old man on an artificial respirator.
She's creeps closer, examining him. She puts her head on his
chest. His heart is beating.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
When an animal gets sick here, they
plug it into the wall.
She whispers in his ear.
58
HUSHPUPPY
They're coming for you.
She repeats the process with another vegetable.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
Daddy says, if he ever got so old
he couldn't drink beer, or catch
catfish, that I had to put him in a
boat, and set him on fire, so no
one could come plug him into the
wall.
Hushpuppy peeks through the curtains at another terminal bed.
She sees two orderlies force pills into Wink's mouth. He's
regaining his strength and is able to hold them off
momentarily before submitting, and going limp.
Hushpuppy bolts, unable to take it.
We stay in the room as the orderlies walk away.
Wink peeks to make sure they're gone, then spits his pills on
the floor.
Wink stares at the ceiling for a long beat. Then, with a
burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples
himself onto the floor. He pulls his wires out.
Hushpuppy lies asleep in a pile with Tee-Lou, Lizard, and
Joy. Wink enters and jostles her awake.
WINK
Boss. Let's go.
HUSHPUPPY
Where we goin'?
59
Wink and the girls hustle to the entrance of the Refugee
center.
Walrus comes running down the hall, pushing Peter T on a
gurney.
Wink looks bewildered, the rest of the team seems to have
their own plan afoot.
Jean Battiste and Little Jo charge through the cots riling
refugees into revolt as the orderlies chase them trying to
maintain decorum.
JEAN BATTISTE
Go home! Everybody get up! Don't
you want to go home? Lets go!
These people don't care about you!
Little Jo fights off an orderly with a syringe.
LITTLE JO
You live in this hell hole!
Wink runs the kids toward the bus, they pass two busses
labeled for Salt Lake City, Des Moines.
Wink helps Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard get on. Then Hushpuppy.
Suddenly Wink's hand slips out of Hushpuppy's. He steps away
from the evacuating bus. Hushpuppy turns and the bus door
slams between them.
WINK
(from outside the door)
Make sure you put her somewhere
good ok?
Wink sags. He's giving her away. He turns to leave..
HUSHPUPPY
(banging on the door)
NO! I ain't running! No!
60
Wink walks away from the bus, his chest heaving, his face
clutched in the horror of what he's done.
Behind him, the bus pulls forward, then veers violently.
Hushpuppy charges the driver clawing at her face, punching
and kicking.
HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
Let me go!
The driver pulls the break and Hushpuppy bangs the doors
open.
She charges Wink from behind, gives him a diving shove.
He topples over.
HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D)
You trying to get rid of me! You
trying to get rid of me!
WINK
No!
HUSHPUPPY
Why you trying to get rid of me?
WINK
I ain't trying to get rid of you.
HUSHPUPPY
You is.
WINK
No. Hushpuppy... I can't take care
of you no more.
HUSHPUPPY
Yes you can.
Hushpuppy stares him down, accusing.
WINK
Daddy's dying!
Hushpuppy's chest heaves up and down.
WINK (CONT'D)
My blood is eating itself. You
know what that means?
61
HUSHPUPPY
Don't be sayin' about dying.
WINK
Everybody's Daddy dies.
HUSHPUPPY
Not my Daddy.
WINK
Yes, your Daddy!
Her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in.
It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her.
WINK (CONT'D)
I didn't want you to watch that,
ok? You understand?
Wink doubles over hacking. He COUGHS horribly.
Hushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass,
dripping from his mouth.
The Bathtub gangs charges out the door!
Across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming
to a halt around Wink.
Hushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking
lot.
HUSHPUPPY
Come on! Come on!
Little Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him.
WINK
Walrus, get me home.
They drag Wink through the Shacko entrance.
Everyone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door
as they lay him down in convulsions. She stays and tries to
watch.
Wink tries to say something to Walrus and can't. Blood
bubbles out of his mouth. Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then
looks away as fast as he can.
Reeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door.
Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge
with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a
hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away
JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to
each other in wonder.
Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland.
Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke
facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at
a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans
Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their
ladies of the night.
There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along
with "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Fats Waller.
The hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this
establishment, comes a'hoppin'.
MISS FRANKIE
Holy crap you have toddlers!
SERGEANT MAJOR
Good afternoon, Miss Frankie.
MISS FRANKIE
Well butter my butt and call me a
biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major?
You need some grits?
SERGEANT MAJOR
Yes ma'am.
66
MISS FRANKIE
Holy Sugar, they are so precious!
Y'all just as cute as a tub of
puppies!
Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do
with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists.
Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry
of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They
are not who she is looking for.
She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up
all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it,
none of them right.
Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes,
ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious
dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed.
She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen.
Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven.
SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the
swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles.
It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where
a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the
swinging doors. They open.
Hushpuppy holds her breath.
A gorgeous COOK (35) wearing a baseball cap and an apron
comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her
brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold
beer.
The Cook looks down. Sees Hushpuppy.
COOK
You need something baby?
Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath. She still can't speak.
COOK (CONT'D)
Well whatchu want? You alone?
Hushpuppy shrugs.
She's too stunned, too shy to speak.
67
The Cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of
her. Like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy,
she submits to Hushpuppy's longing gaze.
COOK (CONT'D)
Get in here, I'm'll show you a
magic trick.
Hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen, knocking her
head against the swinging doors on her way in.
With the smooth fanfare of a circus performer, The Cook lifts
an egg, opens a beer bottle with her teeth, SPITS the cap at
the egg and it cracks over the grits.
Hushpuppy's face is joy beyond all measure. She watches the
Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single
motion, it's like a dance. She slaps a fresh alligator tail
on the table and begins sawing through the scales.
COOK
Lemme tell you somethin', when
you're a child people tell you that
everything's gonna be all hunky-
dory and all that bullshit, but I'm
here to tell you that it's not. So
get that out your head right now.
She removes the knife from the gator and aims it at Hushpuppy
like its a pointer.
COOK (CONT'D)
Life's some big old feast, yeah,
but you? You ain't nothin' but a
stupid little waitress.
She scales a gator, strips the bones, dredges, fries.
COOK (CONT'D)
Everything you got on your platter
gonna fall on the floor and ain't
nobody gonna be there to pick it up
for you. Someday it's all gonna be
on you.
68
She stirs the grits. Grits on plate. Gator on plate. Plate
in front of Hushpuppy. Lemon is squeezed all over
everything.
COOK (CONT'D)
So smile, girl.
Hushpuppy tries to crack a grin. She barely remembers how to
smile and it comes out all wrong. The Cook shakes her head,
opens another beer on her teeth, and heads for the pantry.
COOK (CONT'D)
Nobody likes a pity-party-having-
ass-woman.
Hushpuppy stays behind staring into the floating particles of
dust in the incandescent light-- stars of the universe. The
golden bubbling fry pot-- lava of the molten core.
Four perfect gator nuggets are placed next to a sumptuous
dollop of grits.
COOK
The gator's magic.
Hushpuppy looks up from her food-hypnosis.
COOK (CONT'D)
(encouraging a smile)
Awwwwwwwww.
A real smile emerges across Hushpuppy's face.
COOK (CONT'D)
Mmm-hmm.
Magic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance
floor. Strippers cradle their dates. It's all very sweet
and tender. This seems to be the M.O of this strip club,
slow-dance not pole-dance.
The kids are each dancing with a stripper, glowing with love.
They are orphans in a heaven of mothers.
69
We float back to Hushpuppy, the camera dances with her and
the Cook.
The Cook squeezes Hushpuppy and spins her. Each time we
catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter.
HUSHPUPPY
You can take care of me. Me and
Daddy.
After a long beat.
The Cook shakes her head `no.'
COOK
I don't know nothing bout your
Daddy, I can't take care of nobody
but myself.
This sinks into Hushpuppy.
COOK (CONT'D)
You can stay if you want.
Hushpuppy considers this for a moment, squeezes the Cook.
HUSHPUPPY
This is my favorite thing.
COOK
I know.
A far-away look has come over her. Her mind is somewhere
else.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
I can count all the time I've been
lifted.
We look up at a face that's slowly coming into focus- it's
Wink, younger and healthier.
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.)
I can count all the times I've been
lifted on two fingers.
70
He is the first sight of the slimy newborn baby girl tucked
in his arm. Baby Hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries
her.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S)
Wink! Bring my baby here! They
need to wash her off.
WINK
Naw, that waits.
Baby Hushpuppy's huge-eyed, warped facial expression ogles
Wink. She coos.
WINK (CONT'D)
(TO HUSHPUPPY)
Alright fatso, breathe some air.
They pass through a doorway and sun washes over Baby
Hushpuppy. She smiles and smiles at the world.
Back in reality Hushpuppy gathers herself. She's suddenly
not hugging back, just being held.
HUSHPUPPY
I need to go home.
COOK
(WHISPERED)
No.
Hushpuppy cups her hand to the Cook's ear and whispers
something inaudible.
The Cook squeezes her tight, seeming on the verge of adopting
her. But she can't. She spins Hushpuppy around and around,
then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze.
Hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying
couples.
All goes quiet, and we sit behind Hushpuppy's head, a sea of
light like a crown around her.
MUSIC SWELLS. Decisively, with the force of a charging
general, Hushpuppy turns and runs toward camera.
71
The Bathtub crew sits by Wink's bed. His eyes are open, but
everyone is silently waiting for the inevitable.
Wink is curled up on Hushpuppy's bed-- very, very thin. His
eyes are closed. His chest heaves up and down in short
violent breaths. Hushpuppy stands and stares.
Wink looks at Hushpuppy in reverence. He knows it's the last
time.
Wink motions for her to come closer.
Hushpuppy inches toward him. It takes all of her might. She
sits on his bed.
Hushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out
of a paper bag and pops it. She unwraps a gator nugget, dips
it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite.
Hushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly. She eats one
herself.
Wink and Hushpuppy draw it out. They don't want it to end.
It takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite, and
she paces herself to finish when he does.
WINK
(BARELY AUDIBLE)
Real good.
74
Wink's chest heaves up and down, harder and harder. A tear
rolls down his face.
WINK (CONT'D)
(CHOKING UP)
No crying, you hear?
She holds them back, being tough for her Daddy.
HUSHPUPPY
No crying.
Hushpuppy's face hardens, and even as the tears fall, we see
a strength and composure that only Wink could have put there.
She falls into his arms and he embraces her.
Hushpuppy squeezes Wink. She does not let go. She stays
strong.
Wink's hand trembles on her back.
She holds him as his deep, warm, heartbeat slows, slows, and
stops. His weight slumps over her. She keeps on holding
him, but she knows.
