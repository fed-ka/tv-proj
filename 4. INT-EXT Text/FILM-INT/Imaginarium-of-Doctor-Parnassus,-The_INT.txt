PARNASSUS' DEN
NIGHT
25
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
...at what price....
DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and
drops the paper-weight.
VALENTINA
Father!...
At that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear
frantic banging on the roof.
DR PARNASSUS is glad of the excuse not to go on.
DR. PARNASSUS
We've stopped.
VALENTINA
What do you mean `at what price'?

DR. PARNASSUS
(turning back to his Tarot
cards)
It'll wait, it'll wait. Another
time. Something's happened. You'd
better go and see.
VALENTINA
Typical! You insist I listen to a
story and then you don't finish it!
More banging from above.
DR. PARNASSUS
Go and see!
VALENTINA turns and goes.
PARNASSUS looks miserable but, almost relieved.
He turns
over the next card.
It's The Hanged Man. It depicts a body hanging from a gibbet
surrounded by several arcane objects.
PARNASSUS studies the card, trying to wring some meaning from
it - then lays The Hanged Man in the space between the
others. He takes a swig from the bottle.

EXT
WAGON ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE
NIGHT
26
The wagon has stopped in the middle of Blackfriar's bridge.
It's pouring with rain.
VALENTINA, wearing some sort of covering against the rain,
climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon.
Here she finds ANTON pointing excitedly down into the Thames.
ANTON
Incredible! I saw somebody d-
dancing in the air.. under the b-
bridge..
VALENTINA looks doubtfully at PERCY who peers morosely out
from under his sou-wester and shakes his head.
ANTON (CONT'D)
It's true! There was a sh-shadow on
the water, when the lightning
flashed...
(CONTINUED)
35.
26
CONTINUED:
26
Lightning flashes again.
We see what ANTON and VALENTINA see. A shadow, on the water,
of someone `dancing', hung by his neck with a rope attached
to the underside of the bridge.
ANTON (CONT'D)
(triumphant)
You see! The d-dancer!
VALENTINA
(horrified)
There's someone hanging there!
ANTON
(smugly to Percy)
I t-told you!
VALENTINA
A rope! Get a rope!
27
EXT
SIDE OF BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE
MOMENTS LATER
27
ANTON is `absailing' over the side of the bridge. One end of
a rope is tied around his waist, the other is attached to the
bridge parapet. A lantern dangles from his waist.
VALENTINA and PERCY watch ANTON'S perilous descent.
Moments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge,
the mysterious HANGING MAN'S and ANTON'S.
The MAN is hanging by a noose around his neck, still jerking
in his dance of death. His hands are tied behind his back.
ANTON can't reach the MAN.
ANTON
(shouting up)
I c-can't reach him.
VALENTINA
Try again!
PERCY
Swing in!
VALENTINA
Hurry up.
(CONTINUED)
36.
27
CONTINUED:
27
ANTON shoots PERCY and VALENTINA a jaundiced look and with
VALENTINA'S help on her end of the rope begins to swing back
and forth.
Eventually, with a big enough swing, he manages to hook his
foot around the HANGING MAN who has gone limp. Dead.
With extreme difficulty and great discomfort, ANTON pulls the
MAN close to him, takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the
MAN'S rope.
ANTON and the MAN are now swinging back and forth together on
ANTON'S rope which is threatening to cut ANTON in half.
ANTON
Arghhh!!!!
VALENTINA
You've done it! Brilliant!
ANTON
Argggg!!!
PERCY
Come on, don't hang about! We're
getting soaked up here!
28
EXT
PAVEMENT ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE A LITTLE LATER
28
VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY manhandle the MAN over the parapet
and onto the pavement.
DR. PARNASSUS has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon.
Soaked. He's drunk and is swaying.
DR. PARNASSUS
Why are you fishing dead people out
of the river? He's dead. Leave him.
Let's go. Before the police turn
up.
He goes, unsteadily, back inside.
VALENTINA and ANTON drag the MAN under the wagon, out of the
rain.
The MAN is dressed in an expensive Saville Row suit. His
jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols
have been scrawled on his forehead. He's about 30 years old
and very handsome.
(CONTINUED)
37.
28
CONTINUED:
28
The MAN appears to be dead but VALENTINA decides to try the
kiss of life.
ANTON is made uncomfortable seeing VALENTINA administer the
kiss of life and he pulls her away.
ANTON
No! That won't work. And anyway,
you d-don't know where he's b-been.
Let me...
He brings both fists down hard on the centre of the MAN'S
chest.
Boing! The `dead' MAN coughs, sits bolt upright, spits out a
little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of
the wagon, knocking himself out.
The little metal tube clatters over the asphalt.
ANTON (CONT'D)
He's alive!
VALENTINA
Thank God.
PERCY
Well, he was.
ANTON picks up the little metal tube and examines it.
ANTON
What on earth is this?
29
EXT
BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE
REAR OF WAGON MOMENTS LATER
29
VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY drag the MAN from under the wagon
and carry him to the rear.
VALENTINA
Put him in the big trunk.
ANTON
B-but...
VALENTINA
Don't argue.
PERCY
The boss said leave him.
(CONTINUED)
38.
29
CONTINUED:
29
VALENTINA
He thought he was dead.
They start to bundle the MAN in one of the travelling trunks
attached to the back of the wagon. With the body hanging
half in half out, ANTON suddenly stops.
ANTON
I d-don't like it. It's none of our
b-business.
VALENTINA
So, what do you suggest, we leave
him on the side of the road?
ANTON doesn't want to answer that one.
PERCY
(walking away)
Definitely.
VALENTINA, single-handedly, hefts the MAN into the trunk and
carefully places a cushion under his head. An action not
missed by ANTON.
30
EXT
DERELICT BUILDINGS
DAWN
30
The wagon stands, hidden, among deserted derelict buildings.
All is quiet.
The lid of the big travelling trunk slowly opens.
The MAN struggles out. His neck is sore, his wrists ache and
his head is bruised. He hasn't a clue where he is. He tries
to make sense of the wagon, the grazing horses, the derelict
buildings.
Some distance away a bizarre, horned and tailed CREATURE is
involved in a strange contorted dance.
Hoping to avoid the CREATURE, the MAN starts to move away but
is stopped by a squeaky voice behind him.
PERCY (V.O.)
Hey, you!
The MAN turns around to find PERCY looking at him.
PERCY (CONT'D)
I suppose somebody saves your life
everyday of the week.
(CONTINUED)
39.

MAN
(croaking)
What?
He can hardly speak. It hurts him to do so.
PERCY
Too much like routine to bother
with a thank you.
MAN
(with difficulty)
Who are you?
PERCY
Percival St. Antoine della Touraine
et Sansepolcro da Piemonte the
Third. If that proves too
difficult, you may call me Percy.
MAN
Where are we?
PERCY
Geographically, in the Northern
Hemisphere. Socially, on the
margins. Narratively, with some way
to go. And your name is...
MAN
(appalled)
I... I can't remember.
PERCY
That's handy.
PERCY whistles to the dancing CREATURE, who turns and
approaches. The MAN is getting very nervous.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Any credit cards?
MAN
What?..Oh..OK... you can have
whatever you want.. just don't..
PERCY
...with your name on them.
MAN
Ah...right.. good idea.

MAN (CONT'D)
My wallet... it's gone. Nothing.
I've been robbed.
PERCY
Don't look at us.
CREATURE
What's your name?
PERCY
(sceptical)
He can't remember.
Suddenly a mobile phone starts ringing. They all look at
each other. It's in the MAN'S pocket. But, he doesn't move.
The CREATURE takes his head off ..it's ANTON.
ANTON
Might be for you.
PERCY
They'll know who you are.
The MAN still doesn't move. ANTON reaches over and tries to
find the phone in the MAN'S pockets. The MAN tries to push
him off and find the phone himself. The phone is retrieved
but, in the struggle to answer it, it's dropped.
A WOMAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN can be heard from the phone. As
ANTON and the MAN dive for it, the MAN `accidently' steps on
it. The phone is crushed.
PERCY (CONT'D)
Pity.. I speak Russian.
ANTON and PERCY glare with deep suspicion at the MAN.
DR. PARNASSUS (O.S.)
Dammit! I told you to leave him. He
was dead.
DR. PARNASSUS, holding a cold, damp towel to his throbbing
head, appears, coughing and miserable from the wagon.
PERCY
Well, we didn't and he isn't.
ANTON
He was hanging under the b-bridge.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Hanging?

PERCY

noose)
By his neck. Until dead. If we'd
had any sense.
ANTON produces the bricks with strange markings that were in
the MAN'S pockets.
ANTON
We found these in his p-pockets.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS examines the bricks with great interest.
He pulls out The Hanged Man card and compares it's arcane
details - a noose, strangely marked shapes like bricks, a
metal tube - to the objects found on the MAN.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
The hanged man!
VALENTINA(O.S.)
Is he okay?
She appears from inside the wagon.
VALENTINA (CONT'D)
(to man)
Are you alright?
MAN
Yes... thank you.
VALENTINA
(to PARNASSUS who is in
deep thought)
He tried to kill himself.
ANTON
With his hands t-tied behind his b-
back?
They all look at one another. Good point.
PERCY
Actually, I saw that trick
performed many years ago at....
ANTON
S-somebody was trying to k-kill
him.

ANTON
We c-can't let him stay with us.
VALENTINA
Why not?
ANTON
We d-don't know what this is about,
who he is, what he m-might have
done...
MAN
(croaking)
I haven't done anything. I'm sure.
I hope. Please... Give me the
benefit of the doubt.
PERCY and Anton exchange knowing looks.
VALENTINA
(appealing to PARNASSUS)
Father?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS, looking up from his study of the bricks and
noose, takes the MAN aside, looks closely, trying to read the
strange markings on his forehead.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
These marks... I recognize them.
MAN
(puzzled)
Marks?
The MAN wipes his hand across his forehead. Looks at his inky
hand.. confused.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(sotto voce)
You've been sent by Mr Nick.
MAN
(puzzled)
Mr Nick?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(impassioned)
Don't toy with me. Tell me you're

TONY doesn't know what DR PARNASSUS in talking about but he
grasps the fact that if he wants to be allowed to stay here
he needs to play along.
MAN
Yes.
DR. PARNASSUS
Thank God! Thank God! Thank God for
that!
DOCTOR PARNASSUS takes PERCY aside, shows him the Hanged Man
Tarot Card and indicates the MAN with a nod.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
He's from Mr Nick.
PERCY
No he's not.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
He's come with a proposal.
PERCY
No he hasn't.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
All is not lost.
PERCY
What proposal?
VALENTINA
Father?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(looking at the card, then
to the MAN)
You're welcome.
MAN

Thank you.
PERCY groans and tears his hair.
VALENTINA is pleased. ANTON is not.
VALENTINA kisses PARNASSUS on the cheek.

MAN
Thank you.
He does so. DOCTOR PARNASSUS sits opposite him.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(expectantly)
So...

it)
I like your study.

From Mr Nick. What does he want?
MAN
Ah... Well... That's the problem...
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Problem? What problem?

Unfortunately... I've lost my

VALENTINA, dressed as `Beauty', is rummaging in a theatre
skip, helping the MAN find something to wear for the show.
There is a slight whiff of sexual attraction in the air.
VALENTINA
He says you must work... to focus
your mind. You can help out front..
sell tickets. Ah, here we are...

bottomed wig)
Try this. You can be `Justice'.

thickens. I'm going to have to give
you a name...
She presses a metal breast-plate to his chest.
VALENTINA (CONT'D)

I dub thee Saint George. You can
save me from the dragon. George.
GEORGE
Hold on!.. what dragon?
VALENTINA
You've met Parnassus.
Mischievously, she ties a chiffon tutu around his waist.
GEORGE
Now you are making fun of me.
VALENTINA giggles.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry but, nobody laughs at me

He begins tickling her. She laughs uncontrollably, falling
backwards into the costume skip..

DOCTOR PARNASSUS is attempting to get ready for the show but
he's so drunk he can hardly stand. He's already put some
article of clothing on back-to-front or inside out. PERCY is
trying to help.
VALENTINA
Oh no!
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Can he remember!

Can you remember?
GEORGE
Not yet.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Bloody useless! Mr Nick sends an
emissary and he can't bloody
remember! It's a bloody disaster!
VALENTINA
You can't go on. You're drunk.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
I am not drunk! I'm under
considerable stress.

horizons. It's not too late.

face down onto his stomach, catches the stem with his
clenched buttocks. VALENTINA bursts out laughing.

The effort seems to have tired PARNASSUS. He needs to sit
down.
GEORGE
What... ?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Alas, this technique has its
limitations.
GEORGE
But... Did you discover anything?

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(dramatically)
Your name.
GEORGE
My name?... What is it?
PAUSE.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
Anthony Shepherd.
TONY
(stunned)
My God! That's it! You're right!
Anthony Shepherd! They call me
Tony. Tony Shepherd! That's who I
am!
VALENTINA and ANTON begin to pay attention and gather around.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
And... you used to do good works.
Something to do with charity I
think.
TONY
Yes...That's right! That's right!
But how?...
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
(dismissively)
It's an ancient technique of mental
divination, but I'm very rusty and
it doesn't always work
satisfactorily.
TONY
But that's amazing! Brilliant!
(oddly concerned)
Was there anything else?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS shakes his head, no.
TONY (CONT'D)
(relieved)
That's absolutely fantastic! Thank
you. Perhaps I'll remember other
things.
PARNASSUS smiles and bows slightly ironically.

VALENTINA
Charity work? I knew you were a
good person.
PERCY
So what was he doing dangling under
a bridge from his neck?
VALENTINA
Percy!
PERCY
(sarcastic)
Oh dear, was that a rude question?
Have I put my foot in it?
TONY
That's so strange. And horrible..
it's a complete blank. But I do
remember I was involved in some
sort of charity.. trying to do
good, to make the world a better
place, you know...inspire people,
give them hope....
(self deprecatingly)
What an arrogant idiot.
VALENTINA looks at him thinking `what a sympathetic person.'
The sound of a flutey whistle distracts him. ANTON is blowing
a tune on the metal tube he found on the bridge.
TONY (CONT'D)
What's that?
ANTON
(with a superior air)
Mozart's flute concerto in G.
TONY
I mean, the pipe. Where did you get
it?
ANTON looks at the metal pipe.
ANTON
I found it.
TONY
It's mine.

ANTON
Oh. You're a musician n-now.
TONY
It's not a musical instrument. May
I have it?... Please.
ANTON
(teasing)
Are you s-sure it's yours?
TONY
Positive.
ANTON
Alright.
ANTON appears to offer the pipe to TONY but palms it so that
when TONY reaches out to take it, it's gone.
ANTON (CONT'D)
It's g-gone.
TONY
(getting shirty)
Don't fool around.
ANTON
Ah, there it is.
TONY once more tries to take it. Once more ANTON makes it
disappear.
TONY
(angry)
Give it to me!
ANTON
(derisively)
Oooooh!
VALENTINA
Anton, that's enough.
She steps forward, takes the pipe from ANTON and gives it to
TONY.
TONY
Thank you.
DR. PARNASSUS, who's been watching this exchange, looks
thoughtful.

EXT
THE WAGON
NIGHT
43
PARNASSUS and CO are preparing to move out and do a show.
ANTON is working near PARNASSUS and PERCY who are unaware of
his presence.
DR. PARNASSUS
What's eating Anton?
ANTON pricks up his ears.
PERCY
He's in love with Valentina?
DR. PARNASSUS
(dumbfounded)
In love....?
PERCY
It happens.
DR. PARNASSUS
The little snake! I'll skin him
alive!
CUT TO ANTON who winces.
PERCY
While you're at it, don't forget
the other one.
DR. PARNASSUS looks at PERCY questioningly.
PERCY (CONT'D)
The viper, the scorpion, the
amnesiac boa constrictor. Tony.
DR. PARNASSUS
Quite another kettle of fish.
PERCY
Really?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS
He's ambitious, energetic... a man
of destiny.
(CONTINUED)

PERCY
(ironic)
And he's going to help us win five
souls.
DR. PARNASSUS
I think he might. Valentina sees
good in him.
PERCY
She'd be better off with Anton.
CUT TO ANTON who's pleased.
DR. PARNASSUS
Perhaps I should offer her hand to
whoever helps most in winning the
next five souls.
CUT TO ANTON who looks puzzled.
PERCY
That's even worse than the other
ideas you've had today.
DR. PARNASSUS
(sighs)
You're not wrong... Ah, Percy, what
would I do without you?
PERCY
Get a midget.
CUT TO ANTON as he moves, thoughtfully, away.
44
EXT
OUTSIDE PUB
NIGHT
44
The theatre, parked outside a pub, is up and running.
ANTON, as Mercury, is doing his pitch.
ANTON
Sleep no more. Procrastinate no
longer. Embrace this once in a life-
time opportunity. Let the mind of
Doctor Parnassus be the portal to
the infinite world of your
imagination.
Behind the curtain, PERCY is signalling VALENTINA to see if
DOCTOR PARNASSUS has been drinking. She sniffs him.
(CONTINUED)

DOCTOR PARNASSUS
What are you doing? Please
concentrate. We've got a tremendous
amount of work to do tonight. A
great deal depends on it.
A roll on the drums from PERCY. The curtain rises. DOCTOR
PARNASSUS `floats' above the stage on his glass plinth.
ANTON
As old as the universe itself, the
great Doctor, versed in every
mystic practice known to man, and
many more besides, will guide you
to your destiny.
However, the AUDIENCE - a few PASSERS-BY and DRINKERS who
have drifted out of the pub for a smoke - aren't much
interested in ANTON. Instead they pay more attention to the
masked TONY who, decked out in a stylish costume, is working
the sparse crowd with his smooth charm.
ANTON, irritated, glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is
worried about the lack of customers.
TONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN. They laugh at one
of his jokes. One pretty young woman, SALLY, in particular
seems to be smitten by the handsome `actor'. TONY smiles
seductively at her.
The sight provokes ANTON. He leaps off the stage, grabs SALLY
by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage.
PERCY keeps playing.
SALLY
(laughing)
What?... Hey, what you doing?
ANTON
T-taking you to the heart of your
imagination!
ANTON is trying to compete with TONY but just can't manage
the charm.
SALLY
(good humoured)
Oh my god! No way!
ANTON
You won't regret it!

FEMALE FRIEND
Go for it Sal!
SALLY
(indicating friend)
Only if she comes with me.
FEMALE FRIEND
(enthusiastic)
Now you're talking!
A few ONLOOKERS cheer.
ANTON
N-not at the same time!
ANTON is still pulling SALLY onto the stage.
SALLY
I'm not going on my own.
ANTON
Your imagination is a very special
place. Doctor Parnassus will make
it flower.
SALLY
I bet he will.
More laughs.
FEMALE FRIEND
We'll do it together.
More laughs.
ANTON
(shakes his head)
No. T-two c-competing imaginations
in the Imaginarium at the same
time... it's n-not advisable.
FEMALE FRIEND
Eh?
ANTON
The stronger imagination will
overcome the weaker and then
there's n-no knowing what might
happen.
(CONTINUED)

FEMALE FRIEND
That's really stupid.
SALLY
Let go!
ANTON
D-don't be afraid, d-dear lady.
You'll be safe with me.
Anton sweeps her off her feet and carries her onto the stage.
SALLY
Put me down!
ANTON
Have no fear.
FEMALE FRIEND
She doesn't want to do it on her
own!
ANTON
Only b-because she d-doesn't
realize...
FEMALE FRIEND
Let go of her you silly pillock!
VALENTINA, worried, steps forward to try and restrain ANTON.
VALENTINA
Anton...
ANTON
It's alright! It's alright!
Staggering under the weight of the struggling SALLY, ANTON
barges into DOCTOR PARNASSUS' on his glass plinth.
The plinth rocks and teeters. VALENTINA tries to stop it
falling.
ANTON, unaware of what he's done, disappears through the
mirror as DOCTOR PARNASSUS crashes head first onto the stage.
Crack!
From behind the mirror comes the sound of a woman's
terrifying, terrified screams.

FEMALE FRIEND
SALLY! They've got her in there!
That's her screaming! SAL! They
doing something to her! SALLY!
Help, somebody! Help! Save her!
Upstage VALENTINA tends the stunned DOCTOR. He clutches his
head in pain.
VALENTINA
Father! Father!

INT/EXT
THE MIND OF DR. PARNASSUS
THAT MOMENT

Terrified, ANTON and the screaming SALLY are spun through a
black void clinging desperately to an asteroid as planets and
stars spin madly around them.
Blood-red lightning bolts crackle and crash. Chaos.
46
EXT
OUTSIDE PUB
THAT MOMENT
46
Out front, the CROWD, larger now, is reacting badly to the
dreadful screams. Sally's friends try to storm the stage.
TONY and PERCY try to hold them back.
TONY
Please. Everything's alright. It's
okay. Really. I promise you.
A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN hits him with her handbag.
TONY and PERCY are in danger of being overwhelmed. We can
still hear Sally screaming from somewhere within the stage.
TONY (CONT'D)
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and
gentlemen....please...
A DRUNK takes a swing at PERCY, misses, and connects with
TONY.
TONY (CONT'D)
Ugh!
He falls off the stage and disappears into the angry CROWD
who begin pummelling and kicking him.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

PERCY, desperate, produces a pistol and fires a couple of
shots into the air.
EVERYONE dives for cover.
PERCY, taking advantage of the temporary lull, begins to race
around, untying, unhooking, and pulling on ropes.
The theatre begins to close up as the horses bolt and the
wagon clatters off down the street, bits falling off as it
goes.
VOICE IN CROWD
Somebody call the police!
A battered TONY, chased by the enraged crowd,just manages to
clamber on board, with the help of VALENTINA.
The wagon narrowly succeeds in out-pacing the fastest of the
CROWD. As it disappears down the street, a figure is dumped
unceremoniously out through the back door of the wagon.
It's the terrified SALLY, sent sprawling in the middle of the
road.
A figure steps out from the shadows to help her to her feet.
It's MR. NICK in his bowler and red waistcoat.
