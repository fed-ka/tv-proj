A sunny Southern California day. Commuters speed by.
Stephanie's FORD FOCUS pulls into the PARKING STRUCTURE,
across the street from the BANK OF CALIFORNIA. She steps from
the car, smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward
the intersection. The traffic signal changes to "Don't Walk".
A BUSINESS MAN next to her, sprints across the street.
Stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign. She
looks down to see a little KITTEN. It rubs against her ankles
and PURRS.
STEPHANIE
Well, you're a little cutie.
2.
A car's HORN blares, spooking the kitten. It darts into the
intersection and freezes at the sight of an oncoming VAN.
Stephanie races into the intersection, snatches up the kitten
and places it safely down on the other side of the street.
STEPHANIE
Hey! Slow down!
The Van roars past. She pets the Kitten. It PURRS and licks
Stephanie's face. She sets it down.
STEPHANIE
Go on home. Shoo now!
She heads for the Bank. The kitten follows. She turns back,
frowning.
STEPHANIE
Shoo!
Stephanie enters the Ivy-covered red bricked Department of
Psychology Building.
Stephanie waves as the last of her co-workers drive off. It's
then that she notices the battered Chevy Caviler. It's parked
in the structure.
Stephanie looks closer. There's no one behind the wheel.
She nervously glances about. No sign of Mrs. Ganush.
Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car.
Her FOOTSTEPS echo in the deserted structure, more loudly
than she would like.
She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the
doors behind her. She places the box of contracts on the seat
next to her. As she starts the engine, she notices a strange
sight: something moving, skimming along the surface of the
lot.
It's Mrs. Ganush's linen handkerchief.
It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer.
Stephanie watches transfixed, as it flies right toward her
car. It dips beneath her hood and is gone. It suddenly sweeps
up into view, flittering up, over her windshield, and is
carried off by the wind.
Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled
hands come up around her face! Mrs Ganush sits up in the
back seat of her car! SHRIEKING with rage at Stephanie!

19.
MRS. GANUSH
(In Hungarian)
You bitch! I pluck out your fucking
eyes!
Mrs. Ganush's razor sharp fingernails lash out towards
Stephanie's eyes. But Stephanie grabs the old woman's wrists,
halting her.
The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's
throat. Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically
searches for a weapon. Her hand finds the box on the seat
next to her. She grabs a handful of colored push pins and
jams them into the old woman's arm. Mrs. Ganush releases her
grip. Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before
Mrs. Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie's hair!. The old
woman yanks upon it. Stephanie's head is pulled back, over
the edge of the seat. Ganush braces her feet against the back
of the front seat to pull even harder... Stephanie's neck is
now bent so far back it's about to snap!
Stephanie's hand finds the stapler, trips the release. It
springs open. She swings it back over her shoulder!
Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk!
With each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs. Ganush's
forehead.
Ka-Thunk! A lucky shot-- the old lady's white eye is stapled
shut.
The old woman HOWLS, but her grip on Stephanie's hair only
tightens.
Stephanie, about to black out, throws the car into gear and
hits the gas. As the car' accelerates, Stephanie fastens her
shoulder harness with the last of her strength.
The old woman's stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for her
to see... an oncoming concrete column.
Stephanie's car slams into it. Stephanie is held fast by her
shoulder harness.
But Mrs. Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat,
impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force.
Close shot of the old woman's head slamming into the dash. In
a spray of broken teeth, her dentures eject from her mouth.
20.
Both women are dazed from the impact. Stephanie regains her
wits first. She reaches across Mrs. Ganush and opens the
passenger door.
Mrs. Ganush stirs, but before she can come to, Stephanie's
foot shoves her out. The old woman hits the ground hard but
she sits up suddenly with a SNARL and starts to climb back
in. Stephanie shifts the car into reverse. The opened
passenger door knocks Mrs. Ganush back down to the pavement.
The car's rear bumper slams into a concrete column. Stephanie
is dazed.
Mrs. Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the
car.
Stephanie tries to focus. A blurred image in the rear view
mirror: Mrs. Ganush running closer,'SHRIEKING with old world
rage!
The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but
Stephanie closes it and locks it just in time! Mrs. Ganush
furiously pulls on the door handle to no,avail.
STEPHANIE
I beat you, you old bitch! Next
time take your Geretol!
The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie's view. Stephanie
looks about. Where'd she go?
The old woman pops up into view, raising a chunk of concrete
and... CRASHI Stephanie SCREAMS as the window shatters.
The old woman's head juts into the cart She clamps her
toothless maw down upon Stephanie.'s chin. Suckling it,
gumming. The old woman's good eye rolls about in ecstacy.
Stephanie SHRIEKS as she pushes the slobbering head away.
Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old woman's mouth
to Ste
phanie's jaw.
The old woman's wrinkled hands grope about the front seat.
She finds her dentures, now damaged from the fight. She
GRUNTS as she jams them back into her mouth. She comes at
Stephanie, mouth wide open and SHRIEKING!
Stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and
shoves it down the old lady's throat. Mrs. Ganush gags,
trying to retch up the ruler.
21.
Then Stephanie is suddenly screaming herself, as the old
1 Woman has grabbed her legs and is dragging her from the car.
Stephanie hits the pavement. She shields her face with her
hands, waiting, but the blow never comes. The old woman
standing above her, WHEEZING.
MRS. GANUSH
You shamed me.
The Old Woman reaches down. Stephanie flinches. Mrs.'Ganush's
gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of
Stephanie's coat. She waves the button through the air, and
breathes out a single word:
MRS. GANUSH
Lamia...
Clouds move past the setting Sun. A shadow falls over
Stephanie. A cold wind makes her shiver.
STEPHANIE
What--? What are you doing?
Stephanie sits up, reaching for her button. But the old woman
1 moves it out of reach.
MRS. GANUSH
You want it?
Stephanie snatches the button back. Mrs. Ganush smiles
cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the button into her coat
pocket.
MRS. GANUSH
Soon it will be you, who comes
begging to me. It begins tonight
when you hear the cry.
STEPHANIE
What cry?
MRS. GANUSH
The Lamia. It's coming for you.
A large black, BUZZING fly lands on Stephanie's face. She
swats it away. Her vision blurs and she grows dizzy. She
leans against the car for support. When she finally looks up,
Mrs. Ganush is gone.
22.
Stephanie and Ray eat ice cream cones as they walk past the
shops.
RAY
I just thank God you're okay. You
are okay, right?
STEPHANIE
I'm fine.
Ray waits, sensing that there's more to it.
RAY
Your fine, but...
STEPHANIE
I-- It's just that I could have
gotten her another extension. But I
didn't.
RAY
Loo]. You said the bank had already
granted her two extensions.

23.
RAY (cont'd)
When you don't pay your mortgage
you lose your house, what did she
t expect?
STEPHANIE
I guess.
A breeze. She shivers. He wraps his arms around her
protectively and after a moment, they walk on. Stephanie
watches wistfully as a YOUNG COUPLE coo over their BABY.
Behind the couple, Stephanie notices a neon sign in a
storefront window. It reads: PSYCHIC.
STEPHANIE
Let's get our fortune's read!
RAY
You're kidding right?
She cajoles a protesting Ray through the front door of the
establishment.
Ray and Stephanie cruise along the dark, winding hills. Ray
looks over at Stephanie.
STEPHANIE
How did he know all that?
RAY
Know what? That you lost,a button?1
He makes some good guesses, stirs
you up, leaving you with a lot of
questions. And conveniently, his
business card. C'mon, he's a scam
artist.
STEPHANIE
He didn't want the money. He tried
to give the money back.
RAY
In the end, he took it, didn't he?
STEPHANIE
I guess so.
Ray and Stephanie step from the car. They open a rusting iron
gate, and walk up the hilly path to Stephanie's slightly
funky Silver Lake rental house.
Ellen's car pulls away. The wind kicks up, whisking leaves
about, as though something where moving up the path and
toward the front gate of the house.
Ray's car stops in front of the Bank.
An old, wood bungalow that has seen better days. A MOVING
TRUCK in the driveway.
Stephanie's car pulls up. she steps out, carrying Mrs.
Ganush's loan documents.
She passes the MOVING MEN who load the last of Mrs. Ganush's
things.
She arrives at the opened front door, gathers her courage and
KNOCKS. No answer. She calls out:
STEPHANIE
Mrs. Ganush?
No answer. She steps inside.
5 5
The Old Woman's CACKLING can still be heard as Stephanie
hurries to her car and drives off.
Stephanie site in her parked car.
TO
42.
Stephanie halts at a red light. out of the corner of her eye
she sees something odd.
STEPHANIE'S POV - ON THE STREET
Stu Rubin walking with two well dressed executives.
STEPHANIE
Stu?
The men warmly escort into the First National Bank.
STEPHANIE
What's he doing at First National?
The car behind her HONKS! She drives on.
Stephanie's car is parked in the street.
The distant SCREAM of the kitten is heard. We hear it again
and again until it is finally silenced. 4
Stephanie's car pulling up in front of Ray's hillside house.
The convertible top is down and Stephanie looks radiant in
the golden sunlight.
RAY'S VOICE
Let's get a look at that dress.
She steps from the car and models the dress. S
STEPHANIE
You like
RAY
I like.
Stephanie and Ray approach the front door. Stephanie carries
her home made cake. They ring the bell. Stephanie suddenly
seems apprehensive.
50.
RAY
Something wrong?
STEPHANIE
It's just that I'm not, some ivy
leaguer with an impressive resume.
I have a feeling that's what your
folks really want.
RAY
Maybe. But in the end, it's about
what you and I want.
STEPHANIE
Is that so?
Ray gives her a reassuring nod.
The front door opens revealing Ray's parents, GEORGE AND
TRUDY DALTON. Behind them we glimpse an exquisitely furnished
foyer.
TRUDY
RAYMONDL
She kisses her son.
RAY
Stephanie, this is my mother,
Trudy, and my Father, George.
Trudy glances at Stephanie's revealing cocktail dress with
thinly veiled disapproval. Stephanie self-consciously tugs it
lower.
TRUDY
How do you do?
GEORGE
Nice tp meet you, Stephanie.
STEPHANIE
It's very nice to meet you, too.
GEORGE
Please, come in.
STEPHANIE
Thank you.
A
'51.
She steps inside.

Ray rushes outside stopping Stephanie as she is about to get
into her car.
RAY
What did you see in there?
58.
STEPHANIE
4
You don't want to know.
Ray pulls her close.
RAY
Tell me!
STEPHANIE
The thing that's coming for me.
What the old woman sent.
RAY
Listen to me. What you're going
through right now-- It's like the
doctor said, it's a stress reaction
and --
STEPHANIE
No. I wanted to believe that-- but
it's real, Ray. You just don't want
to open your eyes to it because it
threatens you. Because if I'm right
and there is something out there,
then you'd have to throw out
everything you teach. And where'd
that leave you? Like a plow without
a mule.
Ray just stares at her. A long moment passes as he wonders if
maybe she isn't right.
STEPHANIE
Unless you're willing to take a
chance and believe in me, I can't
be with you any more.
She steps into the car and drives off. Ray watches her tail
lights, as they vanish into the night.
An older home with bars on the front windows. Stephanie
knocks at the front door.
She turns toward a distant sound: A chilling, high-pitched
SQUEAL. Was it just a bus's air brakes... or something more?
When Stephanie turns back, the door has been opened a crack.
An EYE peers out at her.
59.
VOICE OF THE EYE
What is it?
STEPHANIE
Hi. Yes. I came to see Sylvia
Ganush. Is she here?
The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old
Gypsy girl. ILENKA GANUSH. Bottle of beer in her hand, long
black hair, earrings and a snake tatoo on'her neck. She
wears a low cut shirt and tight shorts.
EASTERN EUROPEAN HIP HOP and LAUGHTER are heard from within
the house.
ILENKA
I'm Ilenka, Sylvia's granddaughter.
Who are you?
STEPHANIE
Stephanie Brown. I'm... sort of...
a friend of hers. Actually, I've
been trying to help her with a loan
THAT-
ILENKA
Wait. I know who you are. Grandma
told me you'd come. You're the
woman from the bank. The one who
took her house.
STEPHANIE
It was really the bank that took
the house. I just work there. In
fact, I tried to help your grandma
get-the house back, but my boss
wouldn't let me.
Ilenka knows she's lying. Stephanie knows that she knows.
ILENKA
That's not what happened, is it?
Are you going to stand here on my
porch and lie to my face?
STEPHANIE
. no.
ILENKA
You used to be a real fat girl,
to didn't you?
60.
STEPHANIE
Yes.
ILENKA
I can tell. You know, you caused my
grandma a lot of pain. That house
was her pride. When you took that
from her, she had nothing left.
You're not welcome here.
She starts to close the door. Stephanie halts her. Desperate
now, no where else to turn.
STEPHANIE
Okay! I did it. It was me who
denied her the loan. I was trying,
to get ahead at work and I
shouldn't have done it. It was
wrong.
ILENKA
Damn straight it was wrong.
STEPHANIE
And I'm ashamed about it. And I'm
going to get down on my hands and
knees and beg her to forgive me.
She said-that I hadn't suffered
enough. But now I think she'll see
that I have and then maybe she'll
let me...
ILENKA
.make everything all right for
her, is that it?
STEPHANIE
Yes.
Ilenka gives a bitter, cryptic smile. She motions for
Stephanie to follow. They enter a room filled with young
Gypsies drinking, smoking and talking loudly in a Slavic
tongue.
A WOMAN WITH A CANE shouts as she throws a pair of dice. A
Hungarian man with a long, braided ponytail, curses his bad
luck as he pays cash to the woman.
' STEPHANIE
Where is she?
61.
Ilenka gestures to an area beyond the party goers. Stephanie
t pushes her way through the crowd. She stumbles and falls atop
the Corpse of Mrs. Ganush!
As per the custom of the Gypsy wake, there is no coffin, just
her dead body that rests atop a coffee table.
Stephanie has landed atop the corpse! The leg of the coffee
table breaks under the weight of the two women. Stephanie
tumbles to the ground, the corpse landing atop her. The crowd
of mourners GASP.
The dead woman's opened mouth bobs up and down upon
Stephanie's chin, as through it were once again suckling it.
Stephanie shoves the corpse off of her and backs away in
revulsion.
ILENKA
Still going to make everything all
right?
The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table.
Ilenka addresses the crowd in Hungarian. She tells them that
it was this white trash farm girl that threw her grandmother
t from her home and that she now bears the curse of Lamia.
A mother shields her daughter's eyes from the sight of
Stephanie, the cursed one, then hurriedly kisses her
.crucifix. A man spits at her feet then walks off.
STEPHANIE
No, please-- I needed her to take
this thing off me.
ILENKA
It will never come off.
STEPHANIE
You know about it? Then, please
help me. I'm begging you.
ILENKA
She said you'd come begging. I only
wish she could have lived to see
it.
The blood drains from Stephanie's face.
62.
ILENKA
.maybe she can...
Stephanie glances down to the corpse. It's head is now
facing her. It's dead eyes, OPEN!
An old Pasadena home site alone atop a hill. Ray's car drives
up, parks.
STEPHANIE
Are you coming in?
69.
RAY
T
I wanted to but Rham Jas said non
believers weren't welcome. I still
don't like this.
STEPHANIE
I know how crazy this must seem.
But it will all be over after this
I swear to you.
He nods. She kisses him.
STEPHANIE
I'll call you when it's done.
RAY
I'll be waiting.
STEPHANIE
We'll laugh about it on the train,
tomorrow.
RAY
t Yeah.
Stephanie steps from the car. Ray drives off. She turns to
face the old house.
Stephanie and Rham Jas watch as PARAMEDICS load the covered
body of Shaun San Dena into the ambulance. They close the
doors and drive away.
STEPHANIE
It's sad:
RHAM JAS
Yes.
STEPHANIE
Strange how things work out. She
waited years for another chance to
overcome the lamia ..and finally
she did.
RHAM JAS
No. I'm afraid you misunderstand.
Rham Jas looks at her with pity.
STEPHANIE
What?
RHAM JAS
The,Lamia can not'be banished by a
medium. This was our lesson
tonight. I'm sorry.
79.
STEPHANIE
0
But I saw her get rid of the
thing...
RHAM JAS
No. You saw her drive the Lamia
from the seance. That is all. It
will be back.
STEPHANIE
But then, what am I supposed to do?
Rham Jas shrugs. He fishes in his pocket for his car keys.
RHAM JAS
Perhaps on this final evening, you
should finish up the business of
this world. For before the night is
through, the Lamia will come for
the owner of the accursed object.
STEPHANIE'S HAND
Slowly emerges from her coat pocket. She studies the thin
brass button in her palm. 0
RHAM JAS
Unless, of course... you were no
longer the owner.
STEPHANIE
No longer the owner? I don't
understand.
Rham Jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank
envelope. He places the button within and seals it.
RHAM JAS
The Lamia comes for the owner of
the accursed object. Just make a
gift of it...
To demonstrate, he hands the envelope to Stephanie.
RHAM JAS
.and you've given away the curse.
80.
STEPHANIE
Why didn't you tell me this
before?!
RHAM JAS
Because we are speaking of murder.
Stephanie looks from the envelope containing the button to
Rham Jas. She places the envelope carefully into the side
'pocket of her purse. Rham Jas tries to conceal the sadness
and fear he feels for her.
RHAM JAS
Whatever you decide, you have until
sunrise.'
She nods goodbye as Ray's car pulls up. Ray opens the door.
for her and she gets in.
RAY'S BMW pulls up and Stephanie gets out.
RAY
Are you'still okay about the Santa
Barbara trip?
STEPHANIE
Yes, everything's fine.
RAY
Okay. Our train leaves tomorrow
morning. Seven A.M. When do you
want me to pick you up?
STEPHANIE
It's better if we meet at the
D station. There's something I've got
to do on the way.
Stephanie suddenly' clutches at her purse. The envelope is
gone!
STEPHANIE
Wait! Where's my envelope?
RAY
What envelope?
She opens the car door and frantically rummages around the
floor, through Ray's papers.
STEPHANIE
It's got to be here!
Then, Stephanie comes upon something under the seat. She
smiles and stands. A white envelope held tightly in her
hand.
STEPHANIE
Got , it .

82.
RAY
Tomorrow's gonna be a new start for,
us. Don't be late.
They kiss and Ray drives off.
A light drizzle falls as Stephanie'searches the graveyard for
the burial place of Mrs. Ganush. She carries the shovel
defensively, ready to swat at anything that might leap out at
her.
She stops before a freshly dug grave. A temporary marker
reads the name. "Sylvia Ganush".
She's scared now, not sure if she can really go through with
it. A church bell TOLLS five times. There's no time to think
about it. Stephanie looks around to make sure no one is
watching, then starts to dig.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER - It's raining harder. The hole Stephanie digs is now
several feet deep.
CLUNK: The shovel has hit the buried coffin. The rain
intensifies.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER - Mud is pouring down the sides of the grave. In the
bottom of the pit Stephanie has unearthed the simple pine
casket. She jams the shovel blade between two boards and
pries off the coffin's top and shoves it aside.
A lightning flash illuminates the corpse. Mrs. Ganush's white
eye is open and staring at Stephanie.
Stephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from
her coat.
16 40
86.
STEPHANIE
I'm giving it back to you.
She grabs Mrs. Ganush's hand and tries to get her clenched
fist to open, but rigor morris has locked it shut. Stephanie
pulls with all her might, causing...
MRS. GANUSH'S CORPSE
to lurch up and out of the coffin. Her dead arms, thrown
forward from the momentum, wrap around Stephanie. Stephanie
SCREAMS! The withered face leers! Stephanie pushes the corpse
away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud.
STEPHANIE
You'll take it, all right...
She picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old
woman's mouth, wedging it between her teeth. She pries the
jaw open. Mud and rivulets of water begin pouring down into
the grave from all sides. The body of Mrs. Ganush is quickly
being re-buried.
STEPHANIE
I, Stephanie Brown, do hereby make
a formal gift of this button to
you, Sylvia Ganush.
She jams the white envelope down the old woman's throat.
STEPHANIE
Choke on it, bitch.
She kicks the old woman's jaw.. It SNAPS shut, trapping the
envelope between her broken teeth.
Muddy water cascades down into the grave, flowing over Mrs..
Ganush's face. It covers everything, except the jutting
envelope and a single, staring white eye.
Stephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick.
She grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it
tears away, unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up
to her armpits.
THE HEAD OF MRS. GANUSH
Bobs up, through the mud. The Old Woman is grinning, with the
envelope still jammed between her teeth.
87.
LONG SHOT - THE GRAVE
Rivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction. It
has become the drain hole of the cemetery.
THE INFLUX OF MUD
pushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie. Her grinning
face led mashed against Stephanie's cheek. Stephanie's SCREAM
is cut short as she and Mrs. Ganush disappear beneath the
mud.
The only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain. CAMERA STARTS TO
PULL AWAY when...
STEPHANIE'S HAND
rips up through the mud, grasping the tree root.
STEPHANIE'S HEAD
Breaks the surface of the mud, sucking in air. She claws her
way out, then staggers away, through the pouring rain.
DISSOLVE TO:
A cleaned up Stephanie, her hair still wet from the shower,
drives the empty morning streets. A smile slowly comes to her
face as we hear the rest of Mr. Jack's message:
88.
MR. JACKS' VOICE
Apparently he stole your file on 4
the Mcpherson loan and then tried
to broker his own deal at First
Federal. I guess he thought we
wouldn't find out. When I
confronted him he broke down crying
and well, we won't be seeing him
around anymore.
The Eastern sky is growing brighter. Stephanie's car pulls
into the lot. She removes a week end bag from her trunk and
walks briskly toward the station.
MR JACKS
(V.O.)
It looks like the loan's coming
back to us. And I just wanted you
to know that come Monday morning,
that assistant manager's position
will be waiting for you.
Moments before sunrise, the sky is streaked red.
Ray waits on the train platform, clutching two tickets and a
small garment bag. Behind him, other Passengers arrive. From
his pocket, he removes a velvet case. He opens it and peeks
t inside A diamond ring. He stows it back in his pocket.
He looks for Stephanie.
Then, his face brightens as Stephanie emerges from the crowd,
radiant in her, new coat.
STEPHANIE
Ray!
Ray embraces her and grabs her luggage. A TRAIN WHISTLE
sounds as the train approaches.
RAY
Is everything okay?
STEPHANIE
Great.
RAY
I'm so glad you're here. There's so
much I've been meaning to tell you.
0 She takes his hand. 0
90.
STEPHANIE
But let me say this first while I
have it straight in my head. You
never stopped believing in me. I'll
try and live up to that.
They share an intimate moment. A romantic kiss. He breaks off
and smiles.
RAY
Did I tell you, you look great?
STEPHANIE
Thanks.
Stephanie models her new coat.
STEPHANIE
You like it? It's brand new.
RAY
What'd you do with your old coat?
Just the mention of it, makes her face darken.
STEPHANIE
I got rid of it. I never want to
see it again.
RAY
Too bad,'cause I just found this.
Ray produces the envelope. And from it, withdraws... THE
CURSED BUTTON!
CAMERA RACES INTO A HUGE CLOSE UP OF THE BUTTON with a
terrible CLASHING of symbols!.
Stephanie can't breathe.
RAY
Yeah, it was in my car. Hey, have
you seen my Indian Head nickel? I
put it in an envelope just like
this one.
Stephanie stares at the button, shaking her head in
disbelief. The RUMBLING of the approaching train builds on
the sound track.
4
91.
RAY
What? What is it?
She backs away in horror, but Ray follows her with the button
still in his hand.
The RUMBLING grows louder. She's backing up toward the edge
of the platform.
RAY
Stephanie. Stop!
Ray steps forward, still holding out the button. Stephanie
SHRIEKS as she falls backwards, off the platform and onto the
tracks.
In her last moment of life, she turns her head to see...
THE ONCOMING TRAIN
Racing at her!
Through the swirling smoke, the engine's mechanical face,
resembles the goat like face of the demon Lamia.
It VOMITS STEAM as it angrily bares down upon her.
THE TRAIN WHISTLE SHRIEKS!
Stephanie recognizes the sound. It's a cry she's heard
before. In every door creak... in every cold night wind... a
haunting, soulless sound... the cry of Lamia.
Ray races to the edge of the platform. The two lover's eyes
find each other one last time.
Stephanie SCREAMS as the Lamia swallows her and pulls her
down into hell.
THE PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM
Believe they have witnessed a train accident but Ray knows
the truth. He looks to...
THE BUTTON
still in his hand.
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER ON RAY
92.
A look of dread. Finally, he believes.
