A frightened MICHELLE WHITEHILL (30s) sits watching the news 
from the sofa, nervously fidgeting with a GOLD CROSS around 
her neck.  Her husband RAY WHITEHILL (30s) stands vigilant at 
the window, peering outside.

EMERY (O.S.)
Wait for who to come for us?

Ray and Michelle turn to find EMERY (6) peeking around the 
corner.  Precocious.  A light in her eyes.  Ray quickly mutes 
the television.  Michelle puts on a fake smile.

MICHELLE
Nothing, baby.  Everything s fine.  
Time for bed.

Emery nods.  She may be six, but she s still smart enough to 
know when something is being hidden from her...


Emery enters the kitchen, where she takes a few PILLS from a 
pill box labeled Tuesday, washing them down with water.  A 
familiar routine.  On the news in the next room, an 
EYEWITNESS is interviewed --

Emery looks outside the kitchen window at a SHED in the 
backyard.  Sees the door ajar, FLAPPING in the wind.


She slowly opens the door.  Scans the dark shed with her 
flashlight... Did something just move?  She scans again... 

EMERY
Hello?

She walks further inside... There, huddled in the corner of 
the shed, she finds ROMAN.  Shivering.  Scared.  His clothes 
dirty.  He looks up at her.  Startling how human he seems.  
Emery, spotting the tell-tale dots under his eyes...

notice as Emery sneaks past him, grabbing a blanket...

He offers her a grateful smile...

Roman watches as she leaves...  As WE TIME CUT TO:


Roman lying asleep under the warm blanket.  Emery tiptoes 
inside, leaving a bowl of LEFTOVER SPAGHETTI beside him.  
While inside the house, dire TV NEWS reportage continues:

TV NEWS (O.S.)

watchful and vigilant...

After Emery tiptoes out, he opens his eyes.  Sees the 
spaghetti.  He takes a tentative bite of one strand.  His 
eyes open wide -- intrigued... The texture and taste so 
foreign to him.  Later that night --


Emery and Roman sit cross-legged on the floor of the shed 
underneath a MAKESHIFT FORT made out of DROP CLOTHS.  Roman 
watches as Emery expertly demonstrates making a STRING FIGURE 
out of yarn with her hands.

Emery lifts Roman s hands, transferring the string figure to 
him.  Their warm touch connecting them... The moment 
interrupted by the sound of --  

DOGS BARKING.  Emery stands, looks out the window.  Sees TWO 
POLICE OFFICERS WITH DOGS on a sweep of the neighborhood, 
heading towards the shed.

The officer brandishes his weapon -- A TREMOR GUN.  Points it 
directly at Roman.  But a frightened Roman does not budge...

 PEWWW -- A GOLF BALL-SIZED LASER SHOOTS from the officer s
gun, hitting Roman directly in the abdomen.  He falls 
forward.  CONVULSING violently.  Emery watches in horror --

Ray and Michelle burst in.  Ray grabs Emery and carries her 
back into the house as she desperately tries to fight free.  
She watches from over her dad s shoulder as the officers lift 
Roman s seemingly lifeless body, carrying him to their van.   

EMERY

surprisingly vibrant for a girl who has made this place her

her bedside table.  She is watching the news report on TV 
when Emery enters, still catching her breath --

One of them was claiming the Orions

EMERY
Can it cure conspiracy theorists?

JULIA

chummy with one of the Orions.  Get

You look tired.  Did you sleep?

RAY and MICHELLE (now 40s) watching the NEWS -- Images of 
MARSHALL HIGH SCHOOL, road blocks, protests and 
helicopters... They trade a look of concern.  As upstairs --  


Emery opens her closet, clad in a towel, and surveys the 
options:  An important decision.  She pulls out a purple top 
and snatches a pair of boots, next to which sit an OXYGEN 
TANK decorated with stickers.  A remnant from another life.  
Soon after...


Emery rushes down the stairs.  Michelle is a nervous wreck.  

MICHELLE

want a sweater, too?  I packed you a

WE CUT INSIDE THE BUS TO FIND --


NINE TEENAGERS sitting in rows -- These are the ORION NINE.  
They look like normal kids, except for a dot under both eyes 
and marks on their face and neck.  One of the Nine, DRAKE 
(16), a macho Orion, eyes a GUARD with an MP5 standing at the 
front of the bus, keeping watch.  Drake leans forward to 
whisper to another MALE ORION sitting in front of him.   oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        12.

We now see this Male Orion is making a STRING FIGURE with his 
hands.  And we understand this is ROMAN (16), the boy from 
the shed.  But no longer a boy.  Handsome.  Gentle.  But a 
little brooding.  AS WE CUT TO:  


TAYLOR (16) and ROCHELLE (16).  Taylor is Alt-Girl Cool -- 
the tastemaker of the sophomore class.  Rochelle is preppy, 
more structured -- a bad girl wannabe.  Taylor ingests the 
strip -- the hottest drug of the 2020s.  She closes her eyes, 
savoring this meditative moment.  Seconds later, she opens 
her eyes.  Grinning.

ROCHELLE
My turn.  

TAYLOR
Sorry, that was my last one.

TAYLOR
Well, she picked a hell of a day to 
rejoin society...

While outside --


The Orions stand in line at a SECURITY CHECKPOINT just inside 
 entrance.  ARMED SECURITY GUARDS wand each of the school s
them down and scan their BAR-CODED WRISTBANDS.

Lukas and Emery stand nearby at a row of lockers.  Emery eyes 
Roman standing in line.  Though she does not recognize him, 
she finds herself inexplicably drawn to him... 

TAYLOR (O.S.)
Rumor is they have three penises.  

Emery snaps out of it.  Finds a grinning Taylor before her.  

TAYLOR (CONT D)
Small, medium and extra large. 

Taylor and Rochelle LAUGH, continuing past Emery.

LUKAS
That s Taylor and Rochelle.  They re 
in charge.

EMERY
In charge of what?

LUKAS
All of it.

Emery watches as Taylor and Rochelle are immediately swarmed 
by a gaggle of STUDENTS.  She then turns back to the Orions.

EMERY
Have you ever heard about an herb 
the Orions supposedly grow inside 
the Sector?  Something called cyper? 

LUKAS
No.  But I did hear they eat skunks.

EMERY
Why would they do that?

LUKAS
Cheaper than raccoon.

Emery looks at him.  Lukas smiles.  Emery watches as the 
Orions are shuffled off down the hall and disappear into a 
room...   oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        17.

GIRL 2
Yep.  And now her parents are 
letting her sit the school year out.  
They think the Orions will try to 
eat the baby or something.

nods.  Drake uses a VIRTUAL SCALPEL to make the incision.   oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        25.


MR. TURK (CONT D)
Very good.  That clicking sound is 
normal.  Just premature bone tissue.  
Now fold back the flaps of skin... 

A disgusted Rochelle pipes up --  

ROCHELLE
This is inhumane. 

From across the room, Teri SNICKERS.  

ROCHELLE (CONT D)

Emery eyes a panicked Rochelle, who s about to purge.  Emery 
 WRIST and pressing gently in thinks fast, taking Rochelle s
between her tendons.  Rochelle looks at her quizzically...

EMERY

slowly...  

Rochelle is at first a little freaked out, confused, but 
slowly, very slowly, she starts to breathe normally again... 

EMERY (CONT D)
Feel better? 

Rochelle nods... A small smile beginning to curl up... 


The cafeteria, boisterous at lunch time.  STUDENTS file up 
and down rows of tables, surrounded by HIGH-TECH VENDING 
MACHINES.  The Orions sit together, but apart from the 
humans.  

Drake stands at one of the vending machines.  A SCREEN offers 
him three choices: Low-Fat?  Vegetarian?  Orion?  He presses 
  An AUTOMATED VOICE speaks --the button for  Orion. 

AUTOMATED VOICE
You have chosen:  Puffed rice cake.  
Would you like chicken-flavored?  
Beef?  Or carrot?

Drake scowls -- all of the choices unappetizing...

While ACROSS THE CAFETERIA -- Emery stands at another vending 
machine, considering her options, when Taylor approaches.  oxygen                                                                   1/16/13        26.


TAYLOR
Today might be a good day to skip 
the ham steak.

EMERY
Good call.

TAYLOR
That was cool what you did for 
Rochelle.  Always thought that stuff 
was kinda old school hocus-pocus.

EMERY
Maybe.  Whatever it is, it s worked 
for me before... 

When their attention is drawn ACROSS THE ROOM, where Eric has 
DUMPED THE BOOKS of one of the Orion Nine (CALEB, 16).  But 
before it gets heated, a TEACHER intervenes.

EMERY (CONT D)
Why does Eric hate them so much?

They watch as the teacher scolds Eric, who merely laughs and 
walks away, leaving Caleb to collect his books and papers...

TAYLOR
His father used to have this totally 
sweet restaurant, a neighborhood 
place.  But it was over in 
Bunkhead... 

EMERY
Where they put the Sector...

TAYLOR
Yep.  And people started moving 
away, on-the-quick.  After that, 
 father did a lot of staying Eric s
at home and drinking his breakfast, 
if you know what I mean. 

Emery nods... She looks genuinely moved.  Taylor studies her 
for a beat... Then:

TAYLOR (CONT D)
Let me see your phone... 

Curious, Emery produces her cell phone.  Taylor takes her own 
 the phone against phone, presses a button, and  bumps 
s screen LIGHTS UP: The image of A SCARECROW   Emery Emery s.

Emery washes her hands at the sink.  When Teri exits a stall

Julia shakes her head... Emery fights back her emotions.  
Then, her wheels begin to turn...   

EMERY (CONT D)
Will they let you out for an hour?

JULIA
Probably.  Why?  Where are we going?    


THE NEXT DAY.  Eric and a few of his CRONIES chat with Sophia 
at the end of a hallway.  She seems to enjoy the attention. 

ERIC

ACT FIVE


A badly bruised Roman sits in an office alone.  His leg 
shaking nervously.  Fearing his punishment.  While outside...

To find ROUGHNECK ADULT ORIONS scattered around a few tables, 
playing an Orion game involving LIQUID TRANSLUCENT MARBLES.  
 (but In another corner of the room we find more  human 
clearly less popular) games -- Pool tables.  Poker.  Etc...

A brave Roman passes by the Orions, ignoring their piercing 
stares, and walks directly to the --

BACKROOM - Where he finds WEEBLE, the crusty owner, sitting 
at a table, reading a magazine.  He looks up at Roman. 

WEEBLE

Roman holds out a $20 bill.  Weeble eyes Roman.

Wireless speakers POUND.  GRAFFITI lines the walls.  The

ACROSS THE ROOM -- Lukas bobs his head to the beat, clearly 
out of his element, but trying to fake it.  He waves to Emery 
from across the room, relieved to see a familiar face.  

She waves back, looking a bit nervous, as Grayson hands her a 
drink.  She notices he wears a SILVER RING on his thumb.

EMERY

Weeble eyes the box.  Then eyes Braden.  Knows he s fucked.

Roman picking off a SHARP PIECE of the herb...  He makes a

as the ROARING GUITARS send the MUSIC skyward -- 

Roman SHOVES THE SHARP HERB DIRECTLY INTO HIS VEIN... As he

A desperate Weeble trains a HOMEMADE PVC PIPE GUN at the 
GUARDS.  The guards instinctively DRAW THEIR WEAPONS.  It s a
