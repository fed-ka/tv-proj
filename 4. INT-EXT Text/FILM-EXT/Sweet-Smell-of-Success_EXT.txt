A row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the
long loading bay, waiting for the edition.
In the foreground
a large clock establishes the time as 8:10 PM. A rumbling
noise warns the men to take their positions; a few seconds
later the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes
onto the moving belts from which they are manhandled onto
the trucks.
Much noise and shouting.
The front truck moves out to the city street.
As it does
CAMERA EMPHASIZES the big poster on its side.
The design
features a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims - a
trademark of Hunsecker's. (It will later be seen as the
masthead of the gossip column.)
"GO WITH THE GLOBE"

J.J. HUNSECKER
"They eyes of Broadway"
The truck starts on its journey along Broadway.
Some shots
are of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic (taken
from a camera car).
Others are from the inside of the
truck; as it slows down, the delivery man tosses the heavy
bundle of papers onto the sidewalk.
CAMERA following the
truck, holds it in foreground against the blazing electric
signs of Broadway and Times Square.
The southeast corner of the intersection of Broadway and
46th Street, CAMERA, fairly high, shoots north towards the
impressive vista of electric signs, silhouetted against the
darkening sky.
Very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks.
CAMERA descends towards the Orange Juice stand on the
corner, passing the booth which sells souvenir hats.
It
moves through the congestion of chattering passersby,
steadily approaching a smartly dressed young man, who stands
at the counter of the Orange Juice stand.
Oblivious of the
hub-bub around him, SIDNEY FALCO is concerned only with his
private problems.
He turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb
behind him; this is what he has been waiting for...
CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT
The news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the
sidewalk besides a newsstand.
DETAIL
The bundle of newspapers.
It hits the sidewalk with a smack.
CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney Falco crosses the sidewalk.
The
owner of the newsstand, IGGY, comes to pick up the bundle;
he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor;
Sidney snaps his fingers with impatience.
Iggy wears
spectacles and is clearly more or less blind, he has to
grope for the cord that binds the papers.
IGGY
Aw Lady, if I looked like you, I'd--
SIDNEY
C'mon...C'mon...
IGGY
(recognizing Sidney's voice)
Keep ya sweatshirt on, Sidney.
Majestically taking his time, Iggy lifts the bundle to his
stand and cuts the cord.
IGGY
Hey, Fresh, the Globe just came
in -- Hey, Sidney, want an item for
Hunsecker's column?
Two rolls get
fresh with a baker!
Hey, hot, hot,
hot -- etc.
Annoyed, Sidney throws him a dime, seizes a paper and
returns briskly to the orange juice stand.
ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT
Sidney's place at the crowded counter has been taken by
newcomers.
Rudely, he recovers his half-consumed glass of
orange juice and sandwich.
He takes them further down the
counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the
paper.
CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM, picks up further snatches of
overheard dialogue. (See dialogue attached at the end of the
scene) We move close enough to see Sidney's hands open the
paper expertly at HUNSECKER'S column - identifiable by the
picture of the spectacled eyes.
Over scene there is a
babble of offstage dialogue.
CLOSE UP OF SIDNEY
His face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column.
He is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment.
CAMERA SHOOTS WEST on 46th Street, as Sidney comes down the
side street from the newsstand in background.
Irritably, he
jerks open the door of a shabby entrance.
As the glass door
closes, Sidney is seen striding up the stairs.
FIRST FLOOR - OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Beside the top of the stairs is the door to Sidney's office.
On it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads:
SIDNEY FALCO
Publicity
From inside comes the sound of desultory typing.
Sidney
comes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door.
From D'Angelo's point of view.
CAMERA LOOKS UP at Steve.
The Quintet is now reaching the end of the number, a driving
rhythm of considerable excitement.
A waiter passes in f.g.
and the CAMERA CRANES BACK through the curtained doorway to
the backstage part of the club.
This movement is continued
as we see some other employees, including Jerry Wiggins, the
intermission pianist, who is waiting in the corridor near
the fire-exit.
As he steps out of the door to discard a
cigarette, CAMERA AGAIN CONTINUES ITS MOVEMENT, CRANING BACK
AND DOWNWARD into the little courtyard.
Here, it discovers
the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow
near the steps of the fire-escape, listening to the music.
CLOSER ANGLE
This is SUSAN HUNSECKER.
She wears an expensive mink coat.
It is oddly in contrast with her personality; the face is
sensitive and intelligent, but childlike and tragic.
A girl
in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her
capacity.
Over scene, the music continues.
Susan shifts
her position, knowing that the session will soon be at an
end and that the musicians will be coming backstage.
Chico, Paul and Carson come through to the corridor backstage.
As they do so, Chico, glancing out of the open door sees
Susan in the courtyard.
He goes out onto the fire-escape;
Paul following behind.
CHICO
Hi!
Susie...
SUSAN
Hello, Chico.
Paul.
CHICO
(to Paul)
Throw a rope round this chick while
I go get Steve.
Chico goes swiftly back into the club.
Paul remains with
Susan.
There is a momentary silence; Paul is embarrassed
because Susan is.
Susan makes an effort at conversation,
she nods towards the club.
SUSAN
Full house...?
PAUL
Packin' 'em in.
Susan, getting out of the taxi, moves past CAMERA.
Sidney,
following her, instructs the driver.
SIDNEY
(to cabbie)
Wait for me.
I'll be right back.
LONGER SHOT
Sidney moves after the girl, calling: "Susie!"
SUSAN
Hearing him, Susan turns back.
Sidney walks into shot to
join her.
SIDNEY
(lightly)
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll
talk to you like an uncle...
SUSAN
(smiling)
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
They move through the doors.
REVERSE ANGLE
Sidney quickly corrects himself, saying earnestly:
SIDNEY
No, I mean because I admire you -
in fact, more than admire you -
although that's neither here nor
there.
(quickly skipping to
the important point)
Susie, don't sell your brother
short.
Talk this over with him, I
mean - you'll find him a real friend.
SUSAN
Susan looks thoughtful, making no comment.
RESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN
Carefully (again probing) he prompts her:
SIDNEY
Any message, in case I see J.J.
later?
Susan turns away and walks out past CAMERA.
Sidney watches
her.
SUSAN
She looks back at Sidney, quietly firm.
SUSAN
Yes.
Tell him for me that Steve
Dallas is the first real man I've
ever been in love with...
She turns away and walks through the inner door, going down
the corridor towards the elevators in background.
RESUME SIDNEY
The sincerity of the girl's manner strikes home to Sidney.
Now that her back is turned we see the sharp twinge of pain
with which he hears the statement of her feelings for
another man.
Angered, he wheels, striding out of the door
onto Broadway.
Sidney returns to the cab, instructing the driver:
SIDNEY
The Twenty One Club.
He climbs in and the taxi drives off down Broadway.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
CAMERA HIGH, SHOOTING WEST down 52nd Street, as Sidney's cab
pulls up, double parking in front of the 21 Club.
Sidney
maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the
entrance and the CAMERA DESCENDS to SHOOT ALONG the courtyard
towards the entrance.
We see the figure of Jimmy Weldon and
his girl friend coming out of the Club.
CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT
Jimmy Weldon is coming out of the Club accompanied by a
girl; he is slightly tight.
As he steps through the outer
doors, Weldon again spies Sidney on the sidewalk; he steps
to one side of the entrance way.
Sidney slips through the congestion, but just as he tries to
enter the Club, Weldon's hand shoots out, neatly ambushing
him, pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard.
Sidney is
instantly resentful of this manhandling, but has to adjust
himself, assuming a quick smile for the benefit of Weldon.
SIDNEY
Jimmy!
This is a coincidence.
I
am just going -
WELDON
(overlapping)
Yeah.
A coincidence you should run
into the very man you've been
ducking all week!
(to the girl)
This is my press agent, Joan.
Weldon, jibing at Sidney, plays his remarks off the girl,
who is amused; Sidney, of course, is not.
SIDNEY
(quickly)
I tried to reach you twice -
WELDON
(overlapping)
What do you do for that hundred a
week.
Fall out of bed?
SIDNEY
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right
now to talk to Hunsecker.
I can
promise you -
WELDON
(horsing)
Joan, call a cop!
We'll arrest
this kid for larceny!
Sidney flinches, his pride touched.
SIDNEY
Listen, when your band was playing
at Roseland -
WELDON
(cutting in)
That was two months ago.
Take your
hand out of my pocket, thief!
The girl tries to quiet Weldon, who has gone from horsing to
loud contempt.
THE GIRL
Take it easy, Jimmy dear...
WELDON
(indignantly)
Why?
It's a dirty job, but I pay
clean money for it, don't I?
Abruptly Sidney bursts out, giving as good as he has taken:
SIDNEY
No more you don't!
What is this -
You're showing off for her?
They're
supposed to hear you in Korea?
WELDON
(smirking to the girl)
He's intuitive - he knows he's
getting fired!
SIDNEY
If you're funny, James, I'm a
pretzel!
Drop dead!
Weldon, shepherded by the girl, is already on his way across
the sidewalk.
WELDON
It was nice knowing you, Sidney.
Not cheap - but nice.
Happy
unemployment insurance.
CAMERA shoots up at the penthouse on the roof of the Brill
Bldg.
The Budweiser sign is extinguished, a black silhouette
against the sky.
A light burns in the window of Hunsecker's
apartment.
Hunsecker turns from the window.
CAMERA is close on his
brooding face.
CAMERA tracks with him as he crosses towards
the parapet.
At this height there is a wind which blows his
hair and the movement of the camera emphasizes a remarkable
vista of the New York skyline.
The buildings are now dark,
only a few of the electric signs are left on all night.
CAMERA comes to rest looking over Hunsecker's shoulder; it
tilts downward to a view of Broadway below, Duffy Square in
the distance.
HUNSECKER - NIGHT
A close-up; Hunsecker is looking down on his "kingdom".
But
there is little love in the man's face, only authoritarian
power.
From Hunsecker's viewpoint.
The streets empty, except for
an occasional passing taxi.
The street flushing truck comes
up Broadway from Duffy Square...
LAP DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
The identical camera set-up.
Through the dissolve the light
changes from night to day; Broadway magically becomes a
roaring stream of traffic.
In foreground a NEWS VENDOR.
Sidney comes out of the exit
of a subway, reaching for his pocket as he approaches the
news vendor who offers him a paper.
NEWS VENDOR
The Globe?
SIDNEY
(shaking his head)
Gimme The Record.
Sidney buys and opens the paper.
CAMERA MOVES closer to
shoot over his shoulder.
We see the gossip column which
bears a photograph of Otis Elwell at the top.
Smirking with
satisfaction, Sidney turns away from the CAMERA and throws
the paper into a trash basket before he disappears into the
impressive entrance of a large office building.
The sign
above the doorway reads: THE NEW YORK GLOBE.
QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
Sidney comes down 47th Street from Broadway, making for the
stage door entrance of the Palace theatre.
He walks
confidently into the alleyway, paying no attention to the
old doorman gossiping with the shoeshine boy at the chairs
next to the entrance.
The doorman turns, protesting:
DOORMAN
(calling out)
Hey!
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
Sidney, without halting, looks back towards the Doorman,
addressing him with the patronizing manner of a superior.
SIDNEY
Herbit Temple here yet?
DOORMAN
Yeah, but you can't come in now!
SIDNEY
I'm in, Sonny Boy!
He is already on his way into doorway.
CAMERA SHOOTS TOWARDS the entrance to the TV theatre.
A
line of people are queuing for Hunsecker's TV Broadcast
which is advertised by large posters beside the entrance.
A
taxi drives up in foreground; Susan Hunsecker gets out.
SIDNEY
Sidney comes up Sixth Avenue towards the theatre.
As he
reaches the corner of the building, he halts, having seen...
SUSAN
Susan is seen in the act of paying the driver.
As the taxi
pulls away, Susan walks CAMERA left.
TV THEATRE
Susan pauses, deciding not to enter the theatre; turning she
looks about her and waits on the sidewalk outside.
SIDNEY
Sidney decides that this is not the moment to approach Susan.
He glances down the sidestreet then moves off in that
direction.
SIDESTREET
Sidney moves down the sidestreet towards a stage entrance,
through which are emerging some TV technicians.
He slips
inside.
Frank D'Angelo pays a taxi out of which he and Steve have
just emerged.
Frank turns towards the boy, resuming a
conversation as they stroll across the sidewalk towards the
entrance of the theatre.
STEVE
(depressed)
I still think he's responsible for
the smear.
D'ANGELO
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll
never prove it in a million years.
(gently)
Steve, you'll do what you want, but
it can't hurt; he offers you an
olive branch - so today like olives!
STEVE
I guess you're right, but -
Steve completes the sentence with a slow shake of the head;
compromise is a gesture which he finds very difficult.
D'ANGELO
D'Angelo studies the boy with a paternal affection.
D'ANGELO
Steve, sometimes it's better not to
look at your own honesty; but to
look the other man in the face.
Not because you're my meal ticket -
which you are - but because I like
you and the boys, please take my
advice: we -
D'Angelo stops, halted by an expression which he sees in
Steve's face.
STEVE
He is looking through the glass doors of the TV Theatre, no
longer listening to D'Angelo's words; his face has hardened
in anger.
Steve comes out of the door, pauses without looking back.
D'Angelo comes up behind him.
STEVE
(after a moment)
Look back, Frank, see if she's
still standing there...
D'Angelo looks discreetly over his shoulder.
SUSAN
From D'Angelo's point of view.
She is still standing where
Steve left her.
RESUME STEVE AND D'ANGELO
D'Angelo turns back to Steve.
D'ANGELO
Still there...
Steve, still without looking back, walks up the street;
CAMERA TRACKING WITH THEM.
D'ANGELO
(with sympathy)
Not that I don't like her - she's a
very lovely person, but who can
tell?
A year from now you might
thank your stars that it turned out
this way.
(changing the subject)
By the way, Robard said that...
Steve, his manner full of pain, stops.
STEVE
Frank, I don't want to make the
benefit.
They'll be jammin' all
night, and the way I feel -- I'd
like to be alone -- I'd like just
to walk and walk and never come back.
D'Angelo takes him firmly by the arm.
D'ANGELO
No.
I don't leave you alone on a
night like this.
And, anyway, you
promised...
Steve looks at him, knowing that he can never shake off the
devoted Frank; he shrugs.
They walk past CAMERA.
Susan walks across the terrace.
At this height the wind is
very strong.
CAMERA TRACKS with the girl, emphasizing the
dizzying panorama of New York at night.
The girl's manner
is strange; she moves as if under compulsion, a sleepwalker.
When she reaches the stone parapet, she leans against it
with her body slumped, still hugging the fur coat as if it
were some protection against her misery.
Vertically downward.
From Susan's point of view.
The stone
sidewalks of Broadway are a terrifying distance below.
SUSAN
An angle, shooting sharply upwards against the night sky.
Wind blows the girl's hair, as she looks fixedly downwards.
Her face is blank, expressionless. (For a moment we may fear
for her, afraid that she may have suicide in mind.) But
presently she lifts her head looking towards the horizon...
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
CAMERA SHOOTS PAST the entrance to Robard's Club, framing
the outline of the bridge in sky in background.
From inside
comes the sound of music -- the Quintet.
The taxi drives up; Sidney gets out; he glances at his
wristwatch, looks around and then makes his way into the club.
A long shot of the club exterior.
A different musical
number is now being played in the interior. (GOODBYE BABY).
A black car comes swiftly under the bridge, turns into the
little square opposite the club, braking sharply.
CLOSER ANGLE
As the car comes to a stop, CAMERA shoots across the hood
onto the windshield where we see the insignia: POLICE.
The occupants of the car are not visible.
Sidney lingers near the doorway of the club.
He is looking
across the square towards the car which can be seen in b.g.
Now he turns and walks towards the coat rack, CAMERA tracking
with him.
He takes his own coat and, as he thrusts his arm
into the sleeve, contrives neatly to slip some unseen object
into the pocket of Steve's overcoat; CAMERA notes the
gesture, but only very briefly.
Overscene a voice addresses
Sidney:
D'ANGELO (O.S.)
Hey!..........
SIDNEY
A CLOSE UP.
As he turns in swift apprehension, we note the
moment of panic in his face.
REVERSE ANGLE
CAMERA shoots past Sidney in foreground towards D'Angelo who
advances on Sidney.
D'Angelo's manner is unfriendly; for an
instant we feel, like Sidney, that D'Angelo may have seen
Sidney tampering with Steve's coat, but then we are reassured
as D'Angelo, deliberately using Sidney's surname, says:
D'ANGELO
(continuing)
Mr. Falco...I hate to give you this
satisfaction - they broke it off
tonight for good.
REVERSE ANGLE
Shooting across D'Angelo onto Sidney, who now relaxes, his
fears ungrounded.
D'ANGELO
(continuing)
Tell that to Hunsecker - tell him
we agree - he's a big man - he wins
all the marbles!
SIDNEY
As D'Angelo moves away again Sidney looks after him.
Once
more his face goes tense. (He asks himself, does this
development - which he himself anticipated - change the
situation?) He turns away, moving out of shot.
ANOTHER ANGLE
CAMERA moves with Sidney as he walks towards the doorway.
There he hesitates again; he looks back into the club.
DALLAS
From Sidney's viewpoint.
A LONG SHOT of Steve on the
bandstand.
CAMERA PANS deliberately towards the coatrack in
f.g.
A group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot,
setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up
their coats. (Clearly, Sidney could not now return to the
coat rack - even if he decided that he did want to undo his
handiwork.)
RESUME SIDNEY
CAMERA, shooting out across the square, frames Sidney in f.g.
Facing the inevitable, Sidney turns away, walks across the
sidewalk.
On the other side of the square the headlamps of
the car blink twice.
Sidney walks towards it.
POLICE CAR
A big man gets out of the seat next to the driver.
As he
comes round the hood of the car, the headlamps of a passing
truck illuminate him, identifying HARRY KELLO.
CAMERA PANS
as he walks to meet Sidney.
CLOSER ANGLE
Kello pauses as Sidney comes up to him, asks affably:
KELLO
What's all the rush?
You said
three o'clock.
SIDNEY
(glancing back
towards club)
He's leaving early.
After this
"set".
He'll be out in a couple of
minutes...
They wait for a moment, listening to the sound of the music
in the distance.
It is a blues number (GOODBYE BABY) Kello
hums nonchalantly; Sidney glances at him with irritation,
finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner.
Steve is putting his guitar away in the case, collecting his
overcoat.
In this gesture he is arrested by the sound of
D'Angelo's voice over scene.
D'ANGELO (O.S.)
(urgently)
Steve!
Steve, mildly startled, looks up.
REVERSE ANGLE
Shooting into the club.
D'Angelo comes forward from the bar.
He is a little drunk, a little emotional.
He waddles toward
Steve, then takes the white carnation out of his buttonhole
and puts it in the buttonhole of Steve's coat, saying:
D'ANGELO
(fondly)
Press this in your friendship
book...Love is a crooked thing,
friendship not...
(then, sheepishly)
You see, it comes out in the wash
of a few drinks -- I'm a very
sentimental guy.
RESUME ROBARD'S CLUB
Steve is touched.
STEVE
I like it that way, Frank...don't
change.
He picks up his guitar case and makes for the door.
D'Angelo
goes a few paces with him, CAMERA TRACKING.
Then it moves
past D'Angelo, following Steve out onto the sidewalk, where
he stands under the light of the club framed against the
dark background of the square.
FROM THE BRIDGE
CAMERA PANS from the small figure of Steve to include Sidney
big in foreground.
Below him Kello and Murph turn towards
the club.
KELLO
CLOSER ANGLE downward from Sidney's viewpoint.
Kello turns
deliberately to look at the bridge above.
RESUME BRIDGE
Sidney sees Kello's look; he nods deliberately.
Below him
we see Kello and Murphy move swiftly to get into the car.
Sidney, as if shrinking from a sight from which he doesn't
wish to witness, draws back from the balustrade.
He turns
and begins to walk towards CAMERA.
POLICE CAR
A LOW ANGLE SHOOTING upwards at the car, the stairs to the
bridge in background.
As the doors of the car slam, it
starts to move forward and, abruptly, its headlamps are
switched on, glaring into the lens.
Steve, concerned only with his only melancholy thoughts,
walks down the sidewalk under the bridge.
The car headlamps
illuminate him in their glare as they move across him.
Steve, without undue, interest, glances back but continues
on his way.
CAMERA SHOOTS eastward towards the silhouette of the bridge.
The Police Car turns as it comes out of the square under the
bridge towards CAMERA.
It moves slowly; again its headlamps
flare into the lens.
CAMERA PULLING BACK includes Steve in
foreground.
Behind him the Police Car slows down at the
curb; it barely stops as Kello slips out of the off-side
door; then the car moves forward along the curb leaving him
behind Steve.
As the car goes out of picture past CAMERA,
Kello strolls across the sidewalk, following Steve.
Steve,
looking past CAMERA, notices...
REVERSE ANGLE
CAMERA SHOOTS toward 2nd Avenue.
The Police Car slows down
again at the curb and Murph gets out of it, turning to face
Steve.
RESUME
Steve, seeing the man ahead of him, notes something slightly
menacing in his manner and slows down in his walk.
Then,
instinctively, he realizes that there is a second man behind
him, turns to look at Kello.
Kello approaches.
KELLO
Hey, fella...!
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and CLOSER on Steve.
In his face we see
a growing sense of something wrong...
CAMERA STARTS on D'Angelo at the bar.
He looks off after
Robard.
There is little concern in his face, but as he
watches, curiosity grows.
He strolls out after the
proprietor.
CAMERA TRACKS with him as D'Angelo comes to
join the little mob of two or three people on the sidewalk.
PANNING, THE CAMERA now SHOOTS TOWARDS 2nd Avenue.
Beyond
the bridge we can see the Police Car.
Kello and Murphy are
beside one of the open doors (into which Steve has been
carried). Murphy turns back, walks a few paces across the
sidewalk and picks up Steve's music case, which he carries
back to the Squad Car.
He gets in and the car drives off.
BOUNCER
Hey, Robard, somebody just picked
up one of your boys.
ROBARD
What sa -- Wha --
REVERSE ANGLE
D'Angelo's face shows a bewildered astonishment and dismay
as he turns back to the couple of people who are talking to
Robard.
D'Angelo is a little befuddled with drink.
He
pushes towards Robard.
D'ANGELO
(dazed)
Whatsa matter, Lou?
ROBARD
(turning to D'Angelo)
I'm trying to find out myself.
They just picked up Steve.
LOITERER
(blankly)
Some fat guy...
2ND LOITERER
A cop, a couple of cops.
LOITERER
They smeared him all over the lot.
D'ANGELO
He turns to look back towards the direction in which the
Police Car has departed.
He seems unable to comprehend what
he has heard; but a slow and terrible fear is dawning on
him...
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
Susan opens the door to discover Frank D'Angelo in lobby.
He speaks at once:
D'ANGELO
I'm looking for your brother.
Is
he home?
SUSAN
No.
(sensing the
seriousness of his manner)
Mr. D'Angelo - is something wrong?
D'Angelo has no wish to become involved with the girl; he
doesn't reply.
D'ANGELO
When does he usually gets in, your
night-owl brother?
SUSAN
Seldom before five.
(again)
What's the matter?
Would you care
to come in a minute?
D'Angelo backs away, shaking his head.
D'ANGELO
No...no.
Thanks.
He turns back to the elevator.
Susan closes the door, but
slowly; she is watching D'Angelo.
CAMERA MOVES WITH D'Angelo
as he goes to the bell of the elevator and rings it.
He
remains in this position, waiting for the elevator, but now
(believing himself to be alone) he leans his head against
the wall and begins to weep, quietly.
Surprisingly, Susan
is abruptly at his elbow, she seizes him forcibly by the
arm, demanding:
SUSAN
(taut)
Something's happened.
To Steve.
D'Angelo, with his face contorted in grief and bitterness,
can no longer refuse to answer her.
D'ANGELO
(in a broken voice)
He's in the hospital...He's under
arrest, too... They planted reefer
cigarettes on him...in his overcoat
pocket.
Susan is becoming hysterical.
SUSAN
(wildly)
Where is he...I want to go to him...
D'Angelo recovers his self control.
There is force and
authority in his voice as he insists:
D'ANGELO
Miss Hunsecker, if you see him
again they might...might kill him.
Susan is sobered by his seriousness.
SUSAN
(slowly)
Who is "they"?
D'ANGELO
Don't ask foolish questions.
(then)
Tell your brother I'm a sensible
man.
He understands only two
things - power-politics and homage -
tell him I came tonight to pay
homage!
The squad car comes down Broadway at speed.
Sidney is walking across the square.
The squad car appears
in foreground; it pauses hardly at all as Kello slips out of
it, and starts to move after Sidney.
Then the car
accelerates round Duffy Square to cut Sidney off on the
other side.
SIDNEY
Sidney comes up towards CAMERA.
Seeing something ahead, he
halts...
SQUAD CAR
From Sidney's viewpoint.
The car breaks to a stop.
It's
door opens and a detective gets out slowly.
It is Phil.
RESUME SIDNEY
Sidney is framed in foreground, the squad car beyond.
Sidney knows what this means.
He starts to speak before he
turns to look over his shoulder.
SIDNEY
Hello, Harry...
REVERSE ANGLE
Kello, moving silently up behind Sidney, slows down, amused
at Sidney's prescience.
KELLO
Hi!
(coming to join Sidney)
I just been on the phone to J.J.
Kello's manner is almost affectionate.
He shakes his head,
admonishing Sidney.
KELLO
(mildly)
You been a bad boy, Sidney.
J.J.'s
going to write about you in his
column tomorrow.
REVERSE ANGLE
SHOOTING ACROSS Kello onto Sidney.
Sidney's smile is tired.
SIDNEY
I thought he would.
KELLO
Yeah...
(then)
And another thing - he's gonna say
you 'resisted arrest'...
(as Sidney nods)
You know J.J....!
Sidney turns away to look back towards Phil.
Then, taking
Kello totally by surprise, he wheels, striking the cop
viciously across the mouth.
KELLO
Kello's head jerks back.
Recovering at once, he guffaws,
lurches into CAMERA with a sudden vicious movement.
There
is a sharp guttural cry over scene.
LONGER ANGLE
Phil runs forward towards the figures of Sidney and Kello
seen beyond him.
In doing so, he blocks the view so that we
do not clearly see the violence with which Kello strikes
Sidney down.
Phil, in foreground, is seen to relax.
When
he moves aside, clearing the view, Sidney is writhing on the
ground at Kello's feet.
CLOSER ANGLE
Kello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief.
He signals to
Phil to help lift the body at his feet.
Phil enters shot
and they raise Sidney, half carrying, half dragging him out
of shot.
LONG SHOT
The cops carry the figure of Sidney Falco across Duffy
Square; they bundle him into the police car.
The pigeons in
the square, circle.
HUNSECKER'S TERRACE
CAMERA LOOKS down towards Duffy Square in the distance.
The
police car can be seen moving off, circling the square and
disappearing southward on Broadway.
CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Hunsecker in foreground.
HUNSECKER
A CLOSE SHOT, SHOOTING sharply upward at Hunsecker.
He
looks down, quiet impassively, and there is a slightly
insane grandeur, a paranoiac superiority in the way that he
turns back, dismissing Sidney from his thoughts.
CAMERA SHOOTS STEEPLY UP towards the top of the Brill Bldg.
(At this angle Hunsecker's terrace will not be visible but
its position is established in relationship to the Budweiser
sign.) CAMERA PANS DOWN to pick up the figure of Susan
Hunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto
Broadway.
CLOSER ANGLE
Susan pauses on the sidewalk.
She stays there for a moment.
She breathes in the fresh morning air, looking around with
the expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes.
Then she starts up Broadway - away from the Times Square
area.
The girl's step has a purpose in it; she has
confidence and courage.
Music for the end titles is quiet,
simple and lyrical.
