VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of
brilliant greens:
A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD
pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
soaked lawn.
FLEET OF DUCKLINGS
No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.
GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER
At the bottom of a water hazard.
PALM FRONDS
After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that
surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the
air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt
Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the
palms to
A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.
Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers
moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips
it out. The trousers walk out after it.
HANDS
Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a
golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are
gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.
YELLOW TROUSERS
In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot
journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the
putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball
rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards
and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green
and into the hole.
THE GLOVED HAND
Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather
golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the
bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing
out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer.
The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot
firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the
face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.
We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with
him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course,
another green is barely visible through groves of trees and
rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view.
One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He
could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.
MARTIN'S ARM
Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second
later in the distance, the
RED SWEATER'S HEAD
Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His
body crumples to the green.
MARTIN
Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to
the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers
absently...
MARTIN
Hooked it.
The source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks
toward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets
the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.
MARTIN AT CAR
He fishes out the laminated "Personal
Pan Power" card, looks at it, and
tosses it onto the ground. Police
cars, now visible in the distance,
wind into the long club driveway.
Martin gets into his car and pulls
away.
LAMINATED CARD
As it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls
to a stop on it.
DOORMAN'S HANDS
unbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.
MARTIN
just finishes packing.
MARTIN
...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do
I have to do to get courtside tickets
for the Knicks...?
STREET
The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other
two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The
Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.
DOORMAN
a tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a
handlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he
flips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum
Charthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.
MARTIN
is closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.
MARTIN
Never mind. I gotta go.
Martin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the
window.
MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE
of the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards.
He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman
FIRES both guns.
MARTIN
reacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself
from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his
exit.
HIGH-RISE FOYER
Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of
bodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and
makes his way through the building toward the service exit.
He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.
MARTIN
his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel
and walks down the street.
DOORMAN
now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock,
walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.
The perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office
bungalows.
INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR
Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport
artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news.
BROADCAST (V.O.)
...with highs today in the upper
seventies. Related stocks on Wall
Street today as scandal continues to
rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech
Center...
MARTIN'S CAR
blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid-
eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied
by two figures.
INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE
are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast.
BROADCAST (V.O.)
...An unknown "whistle-blower" has
leaked a number of critical flaws in
the safety designs of next year's
models to authorities that could
cost millions in recalls....
MARTIN
flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes
fascistically.
MARTIN
Mein hero.
...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon
Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash.
Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past.
Dig it...
Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar
landscape.
MARTIN
(into phone)
Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick
up if you're there... It's Martin
Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not
here. My house is gone and now there's
a 7-11 here... And that's
unfortunate... You can never go home
again, Dr. Oatman.
Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go.
MARTIN
(to himself)
But I guess you can shop there.
They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings,
baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes
and hacks.
MARY
I bought a new rug.
MARTIN
That's wonderful, Mom.
MARY
What's a revival tent?
MARTIN
It's a place where religious people--
MARY
(knowingly)
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
MARTIN
Jim?
MARY
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's
son, only he wasn't. At least they
never said he was... I bet they were
lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers.
Wild Kingdom my ass!
Mary coughs horribly.
MARTIN
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're
curious about what I've been doing.
MARY
I spoke to your father the other
day.
MARTIN
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
MARY
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Martin decides to change the subject.
MARTIN
They told me you're taking lithium,
mom.
MARY
Yes, they give me headaches. I have
a headache.
MARTIN
You have a headache?
MARY
I have a headache. You have a
headache?
MARTIN
No, I don't have one.
MARY
You don't have a headache. I have a
headache.
Mary leans in close, smiling.
MARY
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
MARTIN
Yeah. I guess we did.
As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to
it.
MARY
Why don't you return this car and
borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to
the rent-a-car so you can get a ride
back.
MARTIN
I think I'll go see Debi today.
MARY
Of course you will.
MARTIN
I can't think of anything to say to
her that seems appropriate given I
left and never said goodbye to her.
MARY
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
MARTIN
Yeah...
MARY
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro
on foreign exchange?
MARTIN
I have always thought about her and
missed her.
A nurse approaches with a wheelchair.
MARY
Separate the wheat from the chaff
and you've got the candle cat.
Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes
at Martin, taking him in.
MARY
Remember no matter how impossible
your problems feel. I've known people
without a chance in the world. And
all of a sudden, they have lives.
Time allows miracles. Let yourself
breathe, son.
Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse
spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is
somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once
more to connect.
MARTIN
Mom...
The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks
up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel
Merman, arms out Broadway style.
MARY
"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/
What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/
Hey! Look out!
You're gonna hurt
someone,/ with that old shotgun,/
Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/
We really mean it!"
Mary stops short, and squints at Martin.
MARY
Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's
your name?
Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of
headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave...
MARTIN
Hey Pop... You got off easy. The
house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-
pharmacological punching bag and I
murder for cash. If you were here I
think you'd be proud.
He drives off.
Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of
town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger
window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his
lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings
his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...
MCCULLERS
"...Against the wind... just a young
man running... Against the wind...
let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on
it the thuuunder! Night moves..."
McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street.
He nudges Lardner, and points.
LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V.
of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the
radio station. He gets out, looking nervous.
Martin steps out of the storefront station along the
fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district. He stops in the
middle of the street with a strained look on his face.
Martin stops in his tracks. His face softens, then becomes
determined. He turns and walks back toward the station.
Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down.
MARTIN
Dammit. Never trust my instincts.
He scans the main strip.
MARTIN'S P.O.V.
A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish,
forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats
and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head.
Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he
remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.
FELIX'S P.O.V.
As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire,
and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.
MARTIN'S P.O.V.
follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches
their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that
they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His
P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark
sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet
away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...
Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....
THE MAN
pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is
PAUL SWIDERSKI.
MARTIN AND PAUL
Martin relaxes.
PAUL
(grinning ear-to-ear)
Hell, I would've voted for you, but
there's all this apple sauce stuck
in my phone... I don't wanna talk
about it. How the hell are you?!
(extends his hand)
Here's five good ones!
No trace of recognition on Martin's face.
PAUL
Marty! It's me. Paul.
MARTIN
(realizing)
Paul?
PAUL
(re: hand)
You're leaving me hanging here...
They shake. Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the
respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend.
PAUL
Hey. Give me a break.
MARTIN'S P.O.V.
of a lovely YOUNG COUPLE on the front porch of a mid-sized
Wright home... Perhaps that could be him if things were
different, but for now it feels like along shot. Paul is
hawking the house to them out of earshot.
SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)
Well, we do what we have to do if we
find you on the property. But we
don't really enforce the law, we
execute company policy for homeowners.
MARTIN AND THE GUARD
standing in the driveway.
MARTIN
So when are you authorized to use
deadly force?
SOUTHTEC GUARD
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your
basic service-- police and whatnot.
But our customers need a little more
than just that, you understand? This
badge doesn't mean that I am a peace
officer.
The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.
MARTIN
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or
anything. That badge is just the
badge of your company. If I look
suspicious on your customers' property--
well, under those heightened
circumstances you have the authority
to, ah... To shoot me.
SOUTHTEC GUARD
To shoot you. Correct.
MARTIN
How did you get this job?
SOUTHTEC GUARD
Well, they were hiring, and it was
only a two week course...
MARTIN
(pleasantly)
Wow.
Paul walks the happy couple down the steps.
PAUL
(to couple)
...What more can I say.
HUSBAND
(smiling)
We'll talk soon.
PAUL
(much hand gesturing)
You'll be raising your new family in
a work of art. A work of art in a
work of art.
Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the
sell.
SOUTHTEC GUARD
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
All look to Martin....
MARTIN
(heartfelt)
When my time comes, if it ever does,
I want a beautiful, normal place
like this... and a wife like you...
All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.
MARTIN
...and you'll be safe here...
Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.
Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house
in the distance.
Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The
sign above it says
"DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"
MARTIN
(looking ahead)
He sells BMW's?
PAUL
He sold me this bad boy.
MARTIN
How could you put your hard-earned
dollars into the hands of the class
bully?
PAUL
He gave me a great deal.
MARTIN
Mein Dealer.
Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry-
looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing
up amidst his stable of expensive cars.
PAUL
Hey! Bob! The car's running great.
BOB
(dismissive)
Glad to hear it.
Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away.
MARTIN
(shouts)
Bob...
BOB
(turning)
What?
MARTIN
It's me. Martin Blank.
BOB
Really...? So what?
MARTIN
Okay. See you later.
Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward
his own. Paul calls after him.
PAUL
See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
a-man-made-good party.
Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.
MARTIN
stands across the street from the radio station, looking at
Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from
his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...
MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE
of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the
beat of an unheard song.
MARTIN
dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.
The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is
peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.
Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi
looks up from some reading. "Nave Melody" by the Talking
Heads plays in the studio.
MARTIN
Are you going to the reunion?
DEBI
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're
here?
MARTIN
That's part of it.
DEBI
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem
to have everything everybody wants
when they go back. The car, the suit,
the watch. The look. That just leaves
the little things, like happiness,
character, point of view...
MARTIN
It's always the little things.
DEBI
Yep.
Beat.
MARTIN
I'm wondering how you've been. How
you are. I'd like to catch up with
you. If it's possible.
Beat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.
DEBI
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
MARTIN
Well, there's not much to tell.
DEBI
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things
in the last ten years. You've had
experiences.
MARTIN
Bad experiences.
DEBI
You met people.
MARTIN
Bad people.
DEBI
Watched television?
MARTIN
Bad television.
DEBI
(amused)
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It
sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
MARTIN
What's that?
DEBI
It's a swift spiritual kick to the
head that alters your reality forever.
MARTIN
That'd be good.
Beat.
DEBI
What do you want?
The question is open.
MARTIN
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow
around seven o'clock.
DEBI
Let me get this straight, are you
asking me out?
MARTIN
Yes.
DEBI
Unbelievable.
MARTIN
Seven it is.
DEBI
I'll think about it.
Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around
a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is
Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."
She tends to
s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY,
her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small
boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's
finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to
the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan
Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.
MONTY
Baby, it's eight o'clock.
Marcella gets up.
MARCELLA
Thanks, Monty.
She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.
Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire
across the street.
MCCULLERS
I wish he'd do his job already so we
could do our job.
LARDNER
We can't do our job unless he does
his job.
MCCULLERS
Why don't we just do his job then,
so we can do our job, and get the
fuck out of here.
LARDNER
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded
killer.
MCCULLERS
Wait a minute--
LARDNER
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy,
but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until
a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and
then you come in and kill the Bad
Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
MCCULLERS
So if we do his job, we're the bad
guys. If we do our job, we're the
good guys.
LARDNER
Yup.
They both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is
caught short by the sight of
LARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV
GROCER
moving into the diner.
Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door,
holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front
steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.
DEBI
Flowers. That's funny.
MARTIN
As long as I get the laugh.
DEBI
(taking them)
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing
alcohol.
She backs into the house, and he follows.
Martin and Debi pull away from the curb.
Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
conversation.
MARTIN
(defensive)
...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but
someone tried to kill me and the guy
in the middle got killed. So if I
see that guy again I'm definitely
going to kill him, but I won't kill
anyone else. Oh, except for the guy
I was sent here to kill. I don't
know...
Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch
Martin and Debi pull into a space.
LARDNER
He's falling for her. Look at him.
MCCULLERS
He using her.
LARDNER
You're wrong. Look at his face.
MCCULLERS
One cannot love and kill.
LARDNER
(defensive)
I love. I kill.
MARTIN AND DEBI
climb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping
his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm
himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.
MARTIN
(to himself)
Shoulda brought my gun.
DEBI
What?
He pulls himself off the car and heads toward
GROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL
A sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It
is topped by church-like towers. It's scary.
Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym.
MCCULLERS
Looks like someone keeps trying to
do our job for us.
LARDNER
If he does our job, he's our job.
MCCULLERS
I get it.
Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke.
PAUL
What the hell happened to you?
MARTIN
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
PAUL
As long as you had a good time.
Beat. Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi.
PAUL
What now? Chase the girl?
There is a beat of silence. Nothing seems worth saying.
MARTIN
It didn't work out.
PAUL
That's too bad.
MARTIN
I have to get my head back into my
work.
PAUL
Work's good for the soul.
Martin gets up to leave.
MARTIN
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
PAUL
See you in ten years.
Paul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better
of it.
Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off
onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine.
They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin
loading...
Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable...
Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing
down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed.
Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out
and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is
shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.
NEWBERRY
Why? I build cars! They're paying
you to kill me? Why?
MARTIN
It was a cost-cutting effort. They
can't afford a recall.
NEWBERRY
It was a leaky sunroof! A design
flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof!
You want to kill me because of that?
MARTIN
It's not me! Why does everybody think
it's personal?!
They go through the front door and shut it behind them.
Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door,
about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.
LARDNER
Did you see Blank in there?
MCCULLERS
No...
LARDNER
Good. For a second there I thought
we were in trouble.
Debi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but
stops dead when she sees
MARTIN
sitting on the front steps.
Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the
porch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond.
After a while...
DEBI
This will never work out.
She turns to him, serious.
DEBI
You kill people.
(beat)
MARTIN
I have no illusions about the future.
What is, is. We make choices. And we
become the sum total of our choices.
I can live with that.
DEBI
Other people can't.
Martin looks at her earnestly... And smiles ever so slightly.
She does the same, and then just a little wider. He the same.
They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh...
