      INT. 28TH FLOOR - RECEPTION - DAY22

    Two plastic to-go containers flop open.  COURTNEY and LISA 
    THE RECEPTIONIST.  They eat their salads standing at the 
      reception desk, gossiping, taking bluetooth calls:

                                  LISA THE RECEPTIONIST
                    He s coming in today.  That s what 
                    I heard--
                          (bluetooth)
                    Lockhart, Gardner...  One second.
                          (after connecting)
                    Margie said he s coming in for a 
                    divorce settlement.

                                  COURTNEY
                    I thought he was dead.  
                          (bluetooth)
                    Agos & Florrick... I m sorry, she s 
                    on the other line.  Okay.

      Courtney disconnects, notices an ASSISTANT leaning against 
    the wall under the Stern, Lockhart sign, eating her lunch as 
    if at a bus stop.  

                                  COURTNEY (CONT D)
                    What s Chrissy doing...?

                                  LISA THE RECEPTIONIST
                          (laughs)
                    Oh, you don t know, do you?  When 
                    they put in the sign, they left a 
                    hole in the wall.  If you stand 
                    just right, you can hear everything 
                    going on in the conference room.

                                  COURTNEY
                    Nooo.  

      Yesss.  Lisa laughs, knocks on the glass for the Assistant s 
      attention, points toward Courtney: Give her a turn.  The 
      Assistant nods: all yours.  Courtney smiles at Lisa: Should I?

                                  LISA THE RECEPTIONIST
                    Hey, information is power.

      Courtney laughs, goes around the glass and to the exact spot.  
      Leans against the wall casually.  Listens.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      2.

      CONTINUED:22

      Just muffled mumbling.  Not exactly the right spot.  Lisa 
      waves her a foot over.  Oh, she moves and hears clear as day.

                                  DIANE (O.S.)
                    Come on, David, we go back a long 
                    ways. 

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY33

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Yes, and you ve always had such 
                    admiration for Family Law.

      Sarcasm.  DIANE and WILL trade a look: not going well.  A 
      meeting with DAVID LEE.

                                  DAVID LEE (CONT D)
                    Face it.  I do my thing.  You do 
                    yours.  The only difference is mine 
                    makes money.

                                  WILL
                    It s a bad economy, David, that s 
                    all.  We re righting this ship.

      David Lee stands to leave, always pleasant:

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Then right it.  I have no love for 
                    this place, but I don t want to jump 
                    to Harper & Greene unless I have to.  
                    I don t like boxes.  Dump the dead 
                    weight.  You ve got a half dozen 
                    equity partners phoning it in.

      Will and Diane trade a look.  Not a great thought.

                                  DIANE
                    We re bringing in a third partner.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Oh lovely.  Yes, I ve been hearing 
                    about this messiah partner for two 
                    months now.  Can t wait.

                                  WILL
                    You could help us.  Collect on 
                    overdue accounts.

                                  DAVID LEE
                          (smiles)
                    Yes, that s our problem.  
                                  (MORE)



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      3.

      CONTINUED:33
                                  DAVID LEE (CONT'D)
                    I start making collection calls to 
                    my divorcees, they ll bolt to 
                    another firm before I can hang up.  

                                  DIANE
                    Give us until the end of the week?

                                  DAVID LEE
                    That s what I like to hear.  

      David Lee exits.  Will stretches.  Diane paces.  

                                  WILL
                    Okay, we cull the herd.

                                  DIANE
                    Lou, Jocelyn, Derek.

                                  WILL
                    And Lenny.  

                                  DIANE
                    Accounts Lenny or litigation? 

                                  WILL
                      Litigation.  That s two of yours, 
                    two of mine.

                                  DIANE
                    And the Junior Associates, we need 
                    to decide now.  Cary or Alicia.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - RECEPTION - DAY44

      Courtney looks sharply up at that, still eavesdropping.  

                                  WILL (O.S.)
                    Okay.  Friday.  We decide Friday. 

                                  DIANE (O.S.)
                    Good.

                                  WILL (O.S.)
                    But keep it to ourselves.  I don t 
                    wanna deal with a lot of last minute 
                    maneuvering.

      Courtney.  She steps away from the wall, considers it.  

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAY55

    She starts down the stairs, bothered, thinking about it.  She 
      goes to her workstation, looks one way.  Alicia in her office.   


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      4.

      CONTINUED:55

    She looks the other way: CARY texting.  Which one?  She starts 
      toward Alicia s office...

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY66

                                  COURTNEY
                    Alicia, do you have-- oh, I m sorry.

    ELI GOLD.  Sitting on the couch.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, Mr. Gold.  On my couch.  Again.

                                  COURTNEY
                    Sorry, Alicia.  I was upstairs.  
                          (Alicia nods censoriously)
                    And David Lee needs to see you in 
                    ten minutes.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAY77

      Courtney returns to her workstation, feeling spanked.  Sees 
      Cary approaching.  

                                  CARY
                    Hey.  Really good work on my brief.   

                                  COURTNEY
                    Thanks.

                                  CARY
                    You wanna be a paralegal, right?

                                  COURTNEY
                    Yes, some day.   

                                  CARY
                    Well, any help you need.  

    And Cary returns to his office.  Courtney thinks about it, 
      crosses to Cary s office door.  

                                  COURTNEY
                    Cary.  Do you have a minute?

                                  CARY
                          (putting down everything)
                    Sure, what?

                                  COURTNEY
                    I just heard something upstairs.         THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      5.



      INT. 27TH FLOOR - ALICIA S OFFICE - DAY88

    And we re back with Alicia and Eli...

                                  ELI GOLD
                    I m here because of Peter.  He said 
                    I should lay all my cards on the 
                    table.  Tell you everything.

    He waits for a response.  Alicia doesn t offer one.

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    There s a good chance the State s 
                    Attorney won t prosecute Peter.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Because of Kozko s suicide?

    Eli stares at her: pointed?  

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Yes, actually.  Now if that 
                    happens, you and I will need to get 
                    on the same page quickly.  

                                  ALICIA
                    And that page is...?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    The campaign.  

    Ah.  Alicia leans back.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m not doing interviews.  I m not 
                    doing photos.   

                                  ELI GOLD
                    I know, I respect that-- 

                                  ALICIA
                    And my kids won t either.

                                  ELI GOLD
                          (not good)
                    If I could be so bold--

                                  ALICIA
                    No, you can t.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      6.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Right.  Got it.  Anyway that s not why 
                    I m here.  Peter has it in his mind 
                    that he won t run unless you approve.

      Alicia smiles.  Eli smiles back.  He actually likes her.  

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    Yes, I tried to convince him 
                    otherwise.  I told him wives get in 
                    the way, but he was adamant.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Gold, Peter is an adult.  He 
                    doesn t need a mother.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Are we talking about you or me?

      Alicia laughs, sees David Lee approaching.  Gets up... 

                                  ALICIA
                    I have to get back to work.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Think about it, Mrs. Florrick.  Glenn 
                    Childs has been a disastrous State s 
                    Attorney.  Peter can make a difference.

    And Eli watches her exit, go to David Lee.  

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAYA9A9

                    Thank you.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    This one is bubble gum flavored.  And 
                    cotton candy.  See, sectioned off.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I see that.  Another divorce case?

                                  DAVID LEE
                    With pre-nup.  Her expectations are 
                    too high.  We need to get her down 
                    to $300,000.    


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      7.

    And David Lee rushes her upstairs as Courtney follows:  

                                  COURTNEY
                    Alicia, can I get a minute with you?  

                                  ALICIA
                      Regarding...?         

                                  COURTNEY
                          (looks at David Lee)
                    That s alright.  Later.  

    And she watches Alicia continue up the stairs.  Courtney 
      looks back guiltily toward Cary industriously on the phone.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DAVID LEE S OFFICE - DAY99

                                  DAVID LEE 
                    Here she is.  I told you.

      CAROLINE WILDER (40) stands to greet Alicia.  At one time a 
      young rocker.  Now an older rocker.  Pretty.  Using all her 
      money to stay current.  Still a spark of sympathy and small 
      town roots underneath it all.

                                  DAVID LEE (CONT D)
                    Mrs. Caroline Wilder, meet Alicia 
                    Florrick.

                                  CAROLINE
                    Mrs. Florrick.  So nice to meet you.  
                    I think I ll be turning to you for 
                    some advice on how to bounce back. 

      Alicia smiles politely.  A show horse.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    But first things first.  Alicia and 
                    I were just discussing our  ask,  
                    and she worries our eyes might be 
                    bigger than our stomachs.  Alicia?

      David starts out to his assistant, leaving Alicia with 
      Caroline.

                                  ALICIA
                    The pre-nup makes this very 
                    difficult, Caroline.

                                  CAROLINE
                    I know, I was young and-- in love.  
                    I signed everything.

                    Yes, soon to be ex-Max Wilder.

                    That s okay.  I m being replaced by 
                    a younger model.  It happens.  I can 
                    go to couples therapy, I can get a 
                    facelift.  But I can t be 28 again.

      Alicia smiles an understanding smile.  

                                  ALICIA
                    You know the best revenge, 
                    Caroline?

                                  CAROLINE
                    I d love to know.

                                  ALICIA
                    Make him see how happy you are.

      Caroline laughs, nods.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Let us be angry for you. 

    And the two hear commotion in the hall.  A man being led to 
    the office by David Lee, signing autographs for Lisa the 
      Receptionist.  MAX WILDER (50s).  Bearded, sunglasses: one-
      time John Mellencamp rocker, friendly, coasting on his 
      reputation.  More a curiosity, than subject of screaming fans.

                                  CAROLINE
                    Yep, here comes the parade.

    Max enters followed by the newest version of Caroline.  
      SHAINA WHITMAN (28).  Sexy back-up singer.  Trying to seem 
      older, wiser.   

                                  CAROLINE (CONT D)
                    I thought it was just going to be 
                    us, Max.

                                  SHAINA
                    It s my right.  

      Caroline starts to argue, sees Alicia, and plasters on a 
      smile.  A wide smile.

                                  CAROLINE
                    Great.  Love it.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DAVID LEE S OFFICE - FIVE MINUTES LATERA10A10

      Max s lawyer, JULIUS KREUTZER (#108), hands out a document to 
    all the players: Alicia, David Lee, Caroline on one of side 
    of the table from Max, Shaina, Kreutzer: 

                                  KREUTZER
                    So, here s where we stand.  We-- 

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Chocolate raisins anyone?

                                  KREUTZER
                    No... thank you.  

                                  MAX
                    I will.

    Max takes one.  Shaina copying him, takes one too.  Caroline 
      smiles.

                                  KREUTZER
                    Anyway we considered your counter-- 
                    thank you, by the way-- and we ve 
                    decided we re sticking with our

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Ah.  Well, that s unacceptable.

                                  KREUTZER
                    We don t think it is.

                                  CAROLINE
                    After all we ve been through, Max, you 
                    really think $140,000 a year is fair?

                                  MAX
                    I never thought of you as being 
                    greedy, Caroline. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      10.

                    dollar estate.

      They all turn to Alicia.  Whoa.  David Lee smiles to himself: 
      some fire in her belly.  

                                  KREUTZER
                    Look, we re not here to argue or  
                    bandy numbers about.  We have a 
                    court date tomorrow, and Max has 
                    been more than generous with his 
                    offer.  We advise you to take it.  

    But Alicia sees Kalinda outside the office.  With folder.  
      Alicia taps David Lee s arm.  He looks up, sees it, nods.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Could you give us a minute?

      KALINDA shows a folder to David Lee, Alicia.

                    Max Wilder is on probation for a

      EXT. FAMILY COURT - DAY1313

      Blossoms on trees.  Spring in the air.  And a cellphone 
      rings.  It s coming from...

      INT. FAMILY COURT - DAY1414

      ...court where-- klunk--a trash pail is placed on the 
      plaintiff s table by... our good friend, JUDGE TIMOTHY 
      STANEK.  Frowning at Kreutzer.  

                                  KREUTZER
                    Sorry, your honor, this is an 
                    important call.  My client.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Then let me answer it for you.

      Kreutzer looks at the cell, reluctantly hands it over, and, 
    of course-- plop-- Stanek drops it in the trash pail.  

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    Anybody else?

      David Lee, Alicia, and Caroline quickly shake their heads.  
      Stanek heads toward the bench:  

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    Good.  Then I understand we ve 
                    reached an agreement...  

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Yes, your honor.  Mrs. Wilder has 
                    acquiesced to a divorce.  We have a 
                    signed divorce agreement.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    And Mr. Wilder.  Where is he?

      Kreutzer looks toward Shaina: where is he?

                                  KREUTZER
                    Sorry, your honor, my guess is that 
                    call was in fact from Mr. Wilder. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      14.

      CONTINUED:1414


                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Then it was unfortunate you didn t 
                    answer it before court, counselor.

      David Lee s cellphone vibrates.  He carefully slips it out of 
    his pocket, glancing at the text. 

                                  KREUTZER
                    If I could ask for a thirty minute 
                    recess, your honor, to ascertain 
                    Mr. Wilder s whereabouts. 

      David suddenly jumps to his feet, startling Alicia:

                                  DAVID LEE
                    We have no problem with that, your 
                    honor.

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Mr. Weinberg, in my courtroom, the 
                    people s time will be respected. 
                    Even by rock stars.  You have five 
                    minutes to locate him.

      INT. FAMILY COURT - HALLWAY - DAY1515

      Bang-- David Lee bursts out the door, dialing, shooting looks 
      over at Kreutzer, running to a payphone.  David Lee cackles. 

                                  ALICIA 
                    What happened?

                                  DAVID LEE 
                    Max Wilder was just in a motorcycle 
                    accident.

      Alicia looks up, startled...

                                  ALICIA
                    He--  Is he alright?

                                  DAVID LEE
                    No, he s in a coma.  
                          (cackles, loving it)
                    Can you believe it?

      Alicia stares at him oddly. 

                                  DAVID LEE (CONT D)
                    Kreutzer is going to have a fit!  
                          (into phone)
                    Yes, Margie, shh, shh.  
                                  (MORE)


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      15.

                                  DAVID LEE (CONT D)
                    Listen, you made notes on the 
                    Wilder pre-nup.  What s it say on 
                    power of attorney?   

      David Lee looks down toward the payphones at the end of the 
      hall.  Kreutzer on the phone.  As Alicia realizes:

                                  ALICIA
                    She could get half.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Yep.  If he stays in a coma: a 40 
                    million dollar estate.
                          (into the phone)
                    Margie.  You re killing me.

      Alicia and David shoot a look toward Caroline coming out of 
      court behind them. 

                                  ALICIA
                    We need to tell her.  

                                  DAVID LEE
                    No, first we need to make her 
                    filthy rich. 

                                  ALICIA
                    I think she s still in love with 
                    him.  

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Damn.  

      What?  David Lee sees Kreutzer starting back toward court-- 
      fast.  

                                  DAVID LEE (CONT D)
                    Margie.  Now.  
                          (to Alicia)
                    We re good... we re good!

    And David Lee spins toward court, Kreutzer 40 yards behind 
      him. 

      INT. FAMILY COURT - DAY1616

      David Lee struts toward Max/Kreutzer s table, snatches the 
      last page from the Divorce Agreement, just as Kreutzer enters 
      court:

                                  KREUTZER
                    What did you do?  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      16.

      CONTINUED:1616


    But Kreutzer sees Judge Stanek entering...

                                  KREUTZER (CONT D)
                    Your honor!  We already have a 
                    divorce agreement--!

                                  DAVID LEE
                    No, it s not signed!  We don t have 
                    a properly signed--

                                  KREUTZER
                    Because you took a page!  

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Stop it, both of you!  Where s Mr. 
                    Wilder?

      David Lee slips the now crumpled page to Alicia.   

                                  KREUTZER 
                    He was in an accident, your honor.  
                    He s in a coma.  But this divorce 
                    is done.

      Caroline, entering court, looks up, startled at this. 

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Your honor, in our rush to make it 
                    to court on time, I m afraid we may 
                    have overlooked the very last page 
                    of the divorce agreement--  

    And David shoots a look toward Alicia: step out.  

      Alicia nods, stands, and starts out of the court, the crumpled 
      page tucked in her hand.  She pushes out the door, and...

      INT. FAMILY COURT - HALLWAY - DAYA17A17

      ...pauses, seeing Caroline on her cellphone.  Her body 
      language says it all.  She s just been told.  She slowly 
      switches off the cellphone, and crumbles onto a bench.  

      Alicia takes a deep breath, and approaches her as...

                    Hey, John, if you could put in a 
                    good word for me with Will and 
                    Diane.  I think they re deciding on 
                    Junior Associates this week.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - ANOTHER PARTNER S OFFICE - DAY1919

      Cary in another office.  Young woman.

                                  CARY
                    The thing is: I like Alicia.  I 
                    think she s doing really well given 
                    all her problems at home, you know?   

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - MEN S ROOM - DAY2020

      Cary talking to a guy next urinal over: 

                                  CARY
                    It s not really ageism to ask: how 
                    many more working years does anyone 
                    have left.  That s just good sense.  

      INT. HOSPITAL - DAY2121

      Alicia meanwhile rushes behind David Lee, on his cell with 
      Will:

                                  DAVID LEE
                    You don t understand, this just 
                    turned into a 40 million dollar 
                    divorce-- No, it s just me and 
                    Alicia.  I need troops.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - WILL S OFFICE - DAY2222

      Will on his cell, looks up, waves Diane in.

                                  WILL
                    On their way.  And I ll take

                          (hangs up, to Diane)
                    Max Wilder was just in a motorcycle 
                    accident; he s in a coma.

                                  WILL

                    million estate ifhe stays in a 
                    coma.  

      Diane stares at him.  Quickly pushes compassion aside:

                    What s our payday?

                          (Diane whistles)
                    Here s the rub: David is looking at 
                    the will.  Our guess is he wrote 
                    our client out.  So if he dies...

                    So we re cheering for him to stay

      Cary knocking on the door of another partner, turns, 
      approaches.

                    We need you on the Wilder divorce.  
                    It just suddenly became important.

                    Sure-sure.  Anything.  I ll head 
                    off right now.  

    And Cary starts off: a bit too eager.  Diane and Will trade 
    an accusing look.

                    I didn t say anything.

      INT. HOSPITAL ICU - DAY2323

                    I always hated that thing.  Alicia, 
                    this is Jay Van Zandt.  Max s 
                    manager.  Alicia s my lawyer.

                                  JAY
                          (nods to Alicia)
                    He talked about you, Caroline.  
                    Just last week.  

                                  CAROLINE
                    No, he didn t.  Don t try to make 
                    me feel better.  Look at him.  Just 
                    so... [small.]

    She sees Max s hand hanging slightly off the bed.  She goes 
    to it.  Puts it back on the bed.  Tucks it under the blanket.  
      Pats his hand.  Glances up to make eye contact with Alicia.  
      Caroline shrugs: what am I going to do?   When...

      They look toward David Lee talking loudly on his cell in the

                    Shh.  He s in with Mrs. Wilder.  

      Mrs. Wilder?  David Lee pauses, looks at Alicia and Caroline.

      INT. HOSPITAL - CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY2424

      Shaina.  She sits teary-eyed in a dark consultation room 
      listening to DR. HANSON pointing to CT scans.  Kreutzerlooks 
    up to see Caroline, Jay, Alicia, David Lee enter at the back.

                                  DR. HANSON
                    The helmet protected the frontal and 
                    temporal bone.  But the base of the 
                    helmet snapped back causing severe 
                    trauma to the cerebellum.  We ve 
                    stopped the bleeding, but... I m 
                    sorry, it s a subdural hematoma.  

                                  SHAINA
                    Which means?

      Caroline looks toward Shaina, jealousy.  You re not his wife. 

                                  DR. HANSON 
                    Mrs. Wilder, your husband is... 
                      effectively brain dead.  I m sorry. 

                                  DAVID LEE
                    But he s not dead-dead?

                                  DR. HANSON
                    He--  Excuse me, who--?

                                  SHAINA
                    Just ignore them.

                                  CAROLINE
                    I m his wife.

                                  SHAINA
                    You divorced him.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    She did not.  

                                  KREUTZER
                    Doctor, are you saying Mr. Wilder 
                    can never be revived?

      Alicia glances over at another doctor at the back of the 
      room.  DR. BOYD (65).  Older, avuncular, kindly blunt.  

                                  DR. HANSON
                      Effectively yes.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    Doctor, I look at contracts all 
                    day; and when I see the word 
                       effectively  I know it means  no. 

                                  DR. HANSON
                          (stares at him)
                    Medicine, sir, is not a contract.  
                    This massive loss of brain tissue 
                    means there is a one in million 
                    likelihood he will revive. 

                                  DAVID LEE
                    But a million-to-one means life.  
                          (sermonizing)
                    And life needs to be cherished and 
                    treasured.  What other value do we 
                    hold higher--? 

      Kreutzer starts to argue with him, but Alicia sees Dr. Boyd 
      leave.  She considers it, follows.

      INT. HOSPITAL ICU - DAYA25A25

                                  ALICIA
                    Doctor, do you have another 
                      assessment?

    Dr. Boyd turns.  Looks at her.  Sees she really wants to 
      know.

                                  DR. BOYD
                    No.  I had a patient-- he fell off 
                    a ladder in 1988 and ended up in a 
                    persistent vegetative state.  I 
                    made the same speech I just heard 
                    in there.  Then 21 years later, he 
                    just...  woke up.   I don t know 
                    how else to say it.  He woke up 
                    from a 21 year sleep.  

      Alicia nods.  Likes this guy.

                                  DR. BOYD (CONT D)
                    He was a one-in-a-million shot.   
                    And, yes, science and medicine deal 
                    in repeatable phenomenon, and not 
                    this.  But I don t know what to do 
                    with this.   

    And the doctor starts off.  Alicia watches him go, then turns 
    to find Caroline behind her having listened to it all.    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      23.



      INT. 28TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY2525

    12 lawyers.  Will, David Lee, Alicia, Cary.  Kalinda standing.

                                  CARY
                    Shaina has filed a petition for 
                    legal guardianship, so she can 
                    unplug Max. 

                                  WILL
                    She can file all she wants.  Wife 
                    trumps girlfriend.   

                                  DAVID LEE
                    My guess is Kreutzer argues intent.  
                    Both Max Wilder and Caroline 
                    initialed all but the last missing 
                    page of a divorce settlement.  Good 
                    job, by the way, Alicia.

      Alicia nods her thanks as Cary eyes her jealously.

                                  WILL 
                    When are we in court again?

                                  DAVID LEE

                    Should we be talking about 
                      negotiating with Shaina?  Caroline 
                    could live with half the estate?

                                  CARY
                    Are you kidding?   

      Alicia looks toward Cary.  Pretty tough.  

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    This is a gold-digger who wants to

      INT. BAR NOVO - NIGHT2727

      A hotel bar.  Nice.  After work crowd.  Alicia and Kalinda 
    sit at a table.

                                  KALINDA
                    You have until Friday.

                                  ALICIA
                    I have--?  No.  I have two more 
                    weeks.

                                  KALINDA
                    No, Friday.  Diane and Will are 
                    deciding between you and Cary on 
                    Friday.

                                  ALICIA

                                  KALINDA
                    Cary was going door to door with 
                    equity partners, lining up support.  
                    He heard it from your assistant.

      Alicia pauses: a slap to her face.  She sips her drink.  

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    My guess is he s phoning in 
                    accounts, loading up on 
                    receivables.  How re you with Will?

      Alicia glances up.  Another issue.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.

                    You do know.  You just don t want 
                    to say.  Did you sleep with him?

      Alicia looks toward Kalinda, not offended.  Blunt Kalinda.  
      Indifferent as a doctor.  

                                  ALICIA

                    It s a bad time to be a lawyer out

                    I know.  Thank you, Kalinda.  
                    Really, thank you. 

    And Alicia gets up to go.  Starts out of the bar.  Kalinda 
      turns her attention to Burton who smiles, starts toward her. 
      But, no, Kalinda gets up, goes to him.

                                  BURTON
                    So how d that Max Wilder info work

      A bartender places two drinks in front of them.  Burton 
      raises one.  Kalinda looks at the other, takes it, klinks.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    I was three hundred miles away, at

                    you.  Don t ask my why.  So I got 
                    in my car and I drove back here.  

      Burton smiles, eyes her.  Kalinda eyes him back.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    I m divorced.  I have one kid.

                    Yep.

      Kalinda starts out of the bar.  Burton watches her go, gets 
    up, follows.    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      27.



      EXT. BAR NOVO - PARKING LOT - NIGHT2828

      Kalinda starts toward her car in the parking lot.  Burton 
      follows.  Stops her.  Kisses her.  Kalinda lets him kiss her.  
      Arms limp.  Unmoved.

                                  BURTON
                    Okay, what am I doing wrong?

      Kalinda stares at him.

                                  KALINDA
                    Is that your car?

                                  BURTON
                    Yeah.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Get in it.

                                  BURTON
                    Why?

      Kalinda just shoots him a stare, and--

      --thirty seconds later-- klunk--he closes the door of his 
      four-wheel drive, in the driver s seat, window open.  Kalinda 
      outside.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Now what?

      Kalinda looks in the backseat.  Fishing equipment.  She 
      smiles.

                                  KALINDA
                    Three hundred miles, huh?

                                  BURTON
                    Seven hours.

      Kalinda nods, leans in, kisses him passionately through the 
      window.  Beyond passionately.  In control.  The door between 
      them.  Enjoying having the door between them.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Get in.

                                  KALINDA
                    No.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      28.

      CONTINUED:2828


    But Kalinda hears a buzzing.  Looks toward the dashboard.  A 
      large fly there.  

                                  BURTON
                    What s wrong?
                          (it s not a fly; it s a bee)
                    Oh, yeah, some bees found their way 
                    into my backpack.  It s just-- 

    But Kalinda violently jumps away from the window.  Banging 
      against the car behind her.  Swiping at her hair.  Appalled.  
      Burton laughs...  

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                      What reyou--?  What s this, like 
                    Indiana Jones with the snakes?

    But Kalinda suddenly winces, feels her neck.  Shit, shit.

                                  KALINDA
                    I got stung.

                                  BURTON
                    What s wrong?

      Kalinda.  We see it on her face.  Alarm.  Alarm we haven t 
      seen there before.  She takes a second, thinking.  And hops 
      into action, racing toward her car.  Burton gets out.  
      Something s up.  Something serious. 

      Kalinda opens her car door, fumbling in a way we ve never 
      seen.  Searching her seat.  The backseat.  Damn, damn, damn.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Kalinda, you re freaking me out.

                                  KALINDA
                          (under her breath)
                    It s at the office.

                                  BURTON
                    What?  What is?

      Kalinda turns to Burton.  Calm:

                                  KALINDA
                    Tony, in about five minutes I m 
                    going into anaphylactic shock.  I 
                    need you to take me to the hospital-- 
                    Saint Anthony s is the closest-- and 
                    get on the phone with the emergency

                    tell them I misplaced my Epi-Pen 
                    shot, and I need an emergency 
                    injection of epinephrine.

      Burton gets it immediately.  Man of action.

      INT. KALINDA S CAR - NIGHT2929

        Skidddddd--Burton driving expertly, on his cell, calm:  

                                  BURTON
                    No, sir, no, sir.  I m ten minutes 
                    away. 
                          (hangs up)
                    You okay?

      Kalinda strapped into her passenger seat.

                                  KALINDA
                    No.

                                  BURTON
                    Has this happened before?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes.

                                  BURTON
                    When?

                                  KALINDA
                    When I was thirteen.  Watch the 
                    road.

                                  BURTON
                    Should I be trying to keep you 
                    awake?

      Nothing from Kalinda.  Burton rolls down both windows.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    You re scaring me here.

                                  KALINDA
                    You don t sound scared.

                                  BURTON
                    I hide it well.

      INT. FAMILY COURT - DAY3030

      Three cellphones.  In a waste basket.  And we know exactly 
      where we are.  Judge Stanek s court.  He listens, un-awed to 
    the proceedings, a fly swatter in his hand.  The court more 
      crowded today. 

                                  KREUTZER
                    We would respectfully submit, your 
                    honor, that in view of the timing of 
                    Mr. Wilder s accident and the 
                    suspicious removal of the last 
                    signed page of our divorce 
                    agreement, clearly Max Wilder s 
                    intention was to be free of his ex-
                    wife-- 

                                  WILL
                    Objection!

      Will at the other table.  With David Lee and Caroline.  Cary, 
      Alicia, and four other associates behind them.

                                  KREUTZER
                    Withdrawn.  Free of the respondent.  
                    My client is the person Max Wilder 
                    had chosen as his partner, and 
                    therefore should be awarded legal 
                      guardianship.

                                  WILL
                    Your Honor, this is very simple. 
                    We re not even going to get into 
                    Shaina s motives in wanting to 
                    unplug Max--

                                  KREUTZER
                    Objection! 

                                  WILL
                    Like I said, it s not pertinent.  
                    Neither is the fact that she got 
                    him to change his will to leave her 
                    everything-- 

                                  KREUTZER
                    Objection!

      CONTINUED:3030


                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    Gentleman, you see there s no jury, 
                    right?  You realize all this  
                    bombast is going to waste? 

                                  WILL
                    Apologies, your honor.  My client 
                    is still married to Max Wilder and 
                    in legal terms  wife  trumps 
                       mistress. 

                                  KREUTZER
                    We would like to introduce a new 
                    piece of evidence, your honor.  

    And Kreutzer nods toward his second chair at the back of the 
      court who opens the door, revealing Shaina carrying an infant. 

                                  KREUTZER (CONT'D)
                    Your Honor, this is Max Wilder, Jr.  
                    Two months old.

      Alicia spins from the child to Caroline who opens her mouth, 
      stunned.  

                                  KREUTZER (CONT D)
                    And these are the results of his 
                    paternity test.  Shaina and Max 
                    have kept this child from the 
                    public eye for obvious reasons.

      Caroline just stares at  Max, Jr.  as Alicia studies her 
        compassionately, while...

                                  JUDGE STANEK 
                    Okay, let me see if I can sum this 
                    up.  I ve got the fianc  over here, 
                    who also happens to be the mother 
                    of Mr. Wilder s sole offspring--

                                  WILL
                    Your honor, we would question this 
                      paternity--

                                  JUDGE STANEK
                    And she wants guardianship so she 
                    can withdraw Mr. Wilder s life 
                    support, in which case she inherits 
                    his fortune.  
                                  (MORE)




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      32.

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT'D)
                    Then over here I have the wife, who 
                    wants to maintain Mr. Wilder s life 
                    support, in which case she is free 
                    to spend his fortune. 

      Both Kreutzer and Will overlap:  Your honor, I think that s 
    an unfair--    We would argue, your honor-- 

                                  JUDGE STANEK (CONT D)
                    Yes, everybody s got Mr. Wilder s 
                    welfare at heart, I m sure.  So 
                    here s what we re going to do.  The 
                    court is taking temporary 
                    guardianship of Mr. Wilder, and we 
                    will hear evidence on his wishes 
                    regarding end-of-life decisions.  
                    Please prepare briefs and testimony.  
                    We will hear on it this afternoon.  

      And-- gavel-- that s it.  Will turns to Cary... 

                                  WILL
                    Let s get into Max s house.  Find 
                    anything you can: songs, poems, e-
                    mails-- anything that points to him 
                    valuing life. 

      Alicia looks toward Will making eye-contact with Cary.  Then 
      finally to her...

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    And Alicia, sit down with Caroline.  
                    Dig up any memories you can that 
                    would help.  And where s Kalinda?

                                  ALICIA
                    She was supposed to be here.

                                  WILL
                    Phone her.  Let s get her over to 
                    Max s house.

                                  ALICIA
                          (takes out her cell)

      INT. MAX S MANSION - HOME STUDIO - DAY3636

      ...Cary and Alicia accompany Jay through the home studio.  
      Very cozy.  All sorts of recording equipment:

                                  JAY
                    If he had a Living Will, I woulda 
                    known.  He said he wanted to be 
                    frozen, and then we could wake him 
                    up when the technology was 
                    available.

                                  CARY
                    Good.  Stories like that.  Doesn t 
                    sound like someone who wants the 
                    doctor to pull the plug.

      Alicia eyes Cary.  A perky Cary.  It makes her mood darken.   

                                  JAY
                    Who knows.  Like most creative 
                    geniuses, his deepest convictions 
                    changed hourly.

                                  ALICIA
                    Is there any chance he could ve 
                    downloaded a Living Will--?

                                  CARY
                    From some place like Legal Zoom?

                                  JAY
                    No. It would never have occurred to 
                    him outside of a lawyer s office. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Can I get your cell number?  We may 
                    need to prep your testimony.

                    No problem.

    And as Jay hands her his business card, Alicia turns to see a 
      slightly awkward and sullen Kalinda entering.

                                  KALINDA
                    Does it matter?  

                                  CARY
                          (whoa, whoa)
                    Okay.  Could you show us Max s computer?

                                  JAY
                    Sure.  This way.

    And as they start out, Kalinda notices Alicia s sullenness.

                                  KALINDA
                    You alright?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yeah.  You?

                                  KALINDA
                    Never better.  

      Both lying, they continue off, Kalinda nodding toward Cary:

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Why s he so cheery?

    But Alicia is distracted, noticing in an alcove... a daybed.  
    And a chair by itself with a DIGICAM on a tripod pointed at 
    it. 

      Alicia considers it, approaches, studies the digicam, 
      switches it on.  Flips the side-screen open.  A warning title 
      appears over the image...  No Memory card.   Hmmm.  Kalinda 
      approaches too, pops open the memory card slot in back.  Yep, 
    no card.

                                  CARY
                    You two coming?

                                  ALICIA
                    What s this set up for?

                                  JAY
                    Oh, that s where Max composed.  He liked 
                    to sleep, get up with any inspiration, 
                    shoot whatever he composed.

      Kalinda nods, studies the camera, sees a cable coming off the 
      back.  Mac white cable.  USB to iPhone.  Interesting.

                    Okay, good.

                    him.  Oh my god, was he charming.  
                    He used to write these songs for 
                    me.  Just stupid.  

      Alicia smiles.  Sits with her.  As Caroline reaches out, 
      combs his hair off his forehead.

                    One of the reasons we didn t want

                    because we didn t want a lot of

                    I think I am.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    What s wrong, Alicia?

                                  ALICIA
                          (deathly embarrassed)
                    Do any of your clients want to 
                    change law firms?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Do any of my clients--?  Do they

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

    Eli grabs a well-worn tennis ball, squeezes it, paces.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    I can ask.  Is there some reason 
                    I m asking?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Because we re a good firm.

    Eli laughs.  Nods.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Okay.  Well, I can arrange a few 
                    calls.  Next week okay?
                          (off Alicia s hesitation)
                    Or not next week.  What timeline 
                    are we talking about?

                    This is stupid.  I m sorry, Mr.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    No, no.  Alicia, stop.  What s

                                  ALICIA
                    It s my own thing.

                    No, it s not your own thing.  I 
                    know I don t seem like the warm and 
                      understanding type.  But this is my 
                    warm and understanding face.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m in competition with another

                          (Alicia nods)
                    Okay.  Look, I can hire this guy 
                    away, and then dump him.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, no--

                                  ELI GOLD
                    I ve done it before.  Offer him a

                                  ALICIA
                    No, please.  I was wrong to come 
                    here.  I don t want to-- I m not this

      Alicia stares at him, beaten down.

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    I m just making the calls.  You get 
                    the client, it s your client. Okay?

      Alicia nods, gets up, turns back, shakes Eli s hand.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thank you.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Hey, we re like family, right?

      Alicia smiles, leaves, as Eli sits back in his chair, throws 
    his tennis ball up in the air, catches it.

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    Hmmm, interesting.

      Caroline on the stand.  Back in Judge Stanek s court.

                    I guess I can t let go.

                    When Max and I were in rehab 
                    together, there was this 12-step 
                    quote we used to say.  Don t quit 
                    before the miracle happens.   

      Alicia eyes her.  Caroline s eyes tearing up.  

                                  CAROLINE (CONT D)
                    They say it s a million to one shot-
                    - after a coma like this.  But 
                    Max s life-- growing up poor, high

                    Max loved life.  He loved action.  
                    He wanted to sky-dive on his 80th 
                    birthday.  The reason he worked so 
                    hard was he didn t want to end up 
                    dying in Vegas like Elvis, you 
                    know, some shadow of his former 
                    self.  So I know for a fact, he 
                    would never want this.  

    And Shaina finds herself moved.  No calculation in this.

                                  SHAINA (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, but he s gone.  Caroline.  
                    I know we both love him, but he s...  
                    This is torturing him.  This is 
                    putting yourself ahead of him. 

    She stares straight at Caroline, and Alicia looks between 
      them.

      INT. BAR NOVO - NIGHT4747

      Detective Burton stands, smiling, with two drinks waiting as 
      Kalinda approaches.  An uncomfortable Kalinda.  She sees a 
      FOLDER on the bar.  Just out of her reach.

                                  KALINDA
                    Is that the tox report?

                                  BURTON
                    Yep.

                                  KALINDA
                          (sees it s out of reach)
                    You re not gonna let me see it, are you?

                                  BURTON
                    I m thinking about it.  

      Kalinda sips her drink.  Waits.  Okay, Burton slides the file 
      toward her.  She opens it, devours it.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    I had them re-check for alcohol and

                    check for other foreign substances.  
                    Mr. Wilder ingested ethylene glycol.  
                    Anti-freeze.

                    We re opening a murder investigation.  
                    With your client as prime suspect.

                    A 40 million dollar motive, for one 
                    thing.  

      Kalinda reads, flips the page.

                                  KALINDA
                    Where s the rest?

                                  BURTON

                                  KALINDA
                    Because I m in a relationship.

                                  BURTON
                    I don t believe you.

                                  BURTON
                    Not with that kiss.  Look, I know 
                    you have vulnerability issues--

      Kalinda laughs.  He likes her laugh-- even at his expense.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    But I don t want to cuddle with you.  
                    I don t want to discuss your little 
                    bee problem.  I just want to...

    But Burton sees a nice tourist couple approaching, sitting 
      next to them.  Burton leans in and whispers in Kalinda s ear.  
    She chuckles.

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    That s all.  Purely recreational.  Go to 
                    somebody else for emotional validation.

      Kalinda smiles.  Likes it put that way.   

                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Drink your drink.  Pay the bill.  
                    Then follow me out.

    And Burton starts away.  Stops.  Turns back, grabs his 
      toxicology report.  Leaves.  

      Kalinda smiles, sits there, drinks her drink.  The bartender 
      pours her another, unasked.  Kalinda looks up.  A sexy female 
      bartender with a California smile.

                    Well, I don t think we re speaking 
                    out of turn to say we re happy to be 
                    looked over.  We re hoping you can 
                    open some doors for us to 
                      Washington.

                                  VERNON
                    Well, it s the new economy.  We all 
                    have to diversify.

                                  WILL
                    We sure do.  So after your tire-
                    kicking, what do you think?

                                  VERNON
                    Your firm lacks definition.  Focus.  
                    It feels like cases are chosen on a 
                    whim.

      Will and Diane trade a smile...

                                  WILL
                    Well, I think you ve just nailed our 
                      vulnerability.  More passion 
                    sometimes than sense. 

                                  DIANE
                    Will and I know we need a referee so we d 
                    be willing to offer a three-way split.  

      Vernon pauses.  Stares at them.

                                  VERNON
                    I m sorry, I thought--  I m wanting 
                    to buy you out.

      Will and Diane trade another look.

                                  VERNON (CONT D)
                    That s not what you want?

    The room.  Silence rules.  Diane and Will frozen in place.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DIANE S OFFICE - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAYB49B49

      Will loosens his tie, falls back in a seat.  Diane rubs her 
      forehead.  Just the two of them.

                                  WILL
                    Well, that didn t go well.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      49.

                    Who would ve thought our firm means 
                    more without us than with us?

                                  WILL
                    Really undercuts one s confidence.  
                          (after a second)
                    Okay.  Time to cull the herd.

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - NIGHTC49C49

      Numbers.  Large numbers fill the screen.  835.  1,987.  
      35.00.  They re on bills.  Phone bills.  Cable bills.  
      Energy.  All being sorted through by...

      ...Alicia at the dining room table.  Writing checks.  One 
      check after another.  She stops, looks at the stack of bills, 
    and her eyes tear up.  She wipes the wetness away.  When...

                                  ZACH
                    I m sorry, mom.

      Zach coming into the dining room.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, why?  What s wrong?

                                  ZACH
                    I found out about Becca-- saying... *
                    things about you.  I m sorry.  We broke *
                    up.*

      Alicia wipes her eyes.  Reaches out a hand.  Zach goes to 
      her.  Lets her hug him.

                                  ZACH (CONT D)
                    Please don t be sad.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, it s not--  It s not about you.

                                  ZACH
                    Dad will be fine.

                                  ALICIA
                    I know.  It s not us.  *

      Zach looks at the bills.  Can t decipher what any of it means.

                                  ZACH
                    Are we going to be alright?

      Exhales deeply.  Turns back to her bills.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYD49D49

    The video of Max composing plays again.  Burton watching it.  
      A drunken Max.  The off-screen Bach ringtone.  

                                  BURTON
                    And you weren t here?  

      Detective Burton and another cop question Caroline, as Alicia 
      sits beside her.  Kalinda and Jay look on.

                                  CAROLINE
                    No.

                                  BURTON 
                    You never went to his house?

                                  CAROLINE
                    That day?  No.

                                  BURTON
                    And who had keys to his house?

                                  CAROLINE
                    Well, I m not completely sure.  
                    Jay?

                                  JAY
                    As far as I remember: Max, Shaina, 
                    and the housekeeper. 

                                  BURTON
                    And Mrs. Wilder too?

                                  JAY
                    Well, yes.

    But Kalinda looks from Burton to Jay.  Considers it. 

                                  BURTON
                    And the last time you saw Max?

                                  JAY
                    Me?  The night before.  And he 
                    seemed in a good mood.  Looking 
                    forward to his wedding.

      Burton nods, scribbles in his notepadas Kalinda leans toward 
      Alicia, whispers:




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      52.

                    Let me see his business card.

                                  ALICIA
                    Whose?

      Kalinda points toward Jay.  Oh, Alicia reaches into her 
      pocket, finds it, slips it to Kalinda:

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Why?

      Kalinda takes out her cellphone, dials the number in as 
      Alicia stares at her.  What are you doing?  And...

      ...Jay s cellphone rings-- the Bach tune.  

      Both Kalinda and Alicia look up sharply.  The Bach tune they 
      heard off-screen on Max s recording.  Burton looks up from 
    his notepad too-- recognizing the tune as Jay pulls out his 
      cell, answers it:

                                  JAY
                    Hello.

      Kalinda smiles at Burton, answers:

                                  KALINDA
                    Hello.

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT4949

      David Lee and Kreutzer finish negotiations.  Alicia and Cary 
      offering assistance... 

                                  DAVID LEE
                    So we re set?

                    Of a comatose patient.

                                  DAVID LEE
                    It s what she wants.

                    So you re the reason Jay did it?

                                  KREUTZER
                    Well, I m not thereason.  But 
                    Shaina and Max were planning to 
                    change the will after they got 
                    married: Shaina wanted to remove 
                    Jay. 

                                  KREUTZER (CONT D)
                    Ah, money.  Dependable money.

                    Pleasure doing business with you.  

                                  KREUTZER
                    And you.

    And the two start out, leaving Alicia and Cary to clean up 
      documents.  An awkward silence.  Courtney enters:

                                  COURTNEY
                    Alicia, Cary.  Will and Diane want 
                    to see you.

                                  CARY
                    Thank you, Courtney.  Be right up.

    She nods, pauses, realizes she s not getting the same 
      acknowledgement from Alicia.  She leaves again, regretfully. 

                                  CARY (CONT D)
                    Weird, huh?  

                                  ALICIA
                    Like a date with the executioner.

                    I hear it s always the first one

    And they turn the corner toward the office, seeing Will and 
      Diane in Diane s office meeting with a suited man.  Alicia 
      pauses, eyes him.  The man turns.  

    Eli Gold.  

      Alicia s eyes widen as an oblivious Cary takes a chair, 
      waits.  Eli shakes Will and Diane s hand, exits.  Sees 
      Alicia.  Smiles.

    Oh.  Alicia stares at him.  Gets it.  Nothing s free.  Eli

                    Alicia, could you come in please?

      It s Will, leaning out Diane s door.  Alicia nods, as Cary 
      looks over at her.  He nods, comforting: you ll be fine.

      Alicia enters.  Will closes the door.  Nods toward a chair:

                    Go ahead.

      Alicia sits.  Diane looks up from a report, takes off her 
      glasses.

                    We don t mean to draw this out any

                    Very good job.  Thanks for going 
                    all out this year.  It s been... 
                    quite a ride.

                                  DIANE
                    And we re not out of the woods yet.  
                    We have a lot of trimming to do, so 
                    we re all going to have to work 
                    harder.

                                  WILL
                    Do more with less.

      Alicia is more relieved than overjoyed:



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      56.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m ready.

                                  DIANE
                    We know you are.  And thanks for 
                    listening the other day.  You heard 
                    us.  That s all we needed to know.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, thank you.

    And Alicia gets up, turns to go, stops, pauses.  Her smile 
      disappearing.  What about Cary?  But, no, she leaves, 
      finding...

      ...Cary looking up at her.  Checking on her.

                                  CARY
                    Are you okay?

      Alicia studies his face, all joy out of her now.  Appalled.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

                                  CARY
                    Don t worry, everything will be 
                    fine.

                                  WILL
                    Cary, do you have a minute?

      Will leaning out the door for him now.

                                  CARY
                    Yes.

    And Cary shoots one more comforting smile to Alicia, then 
      enters the office.  Alicia stands there, staring in, seeing 
    the same moves by Will, nodding toward a chair, Cary sitting, 
    the same casual look up from Diane.  And...

      ...Alicia finds her breath coming with more difficulty, as...

                                  WILL
                    I m sorry.

      Cary just stares at them, face composed.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #120   "Unplugged"   BLUE COLLATED   4/1/10      57.

                                  DIANE
                    You were great, Cary.  And if we 
                    weren t in this situation, this 
                    financial situation, we would want 
                    you both.

                                  CARY
                      I understand.

    And Cary does.  It s actually heartbreaking how well he s 
      taking it.  Grace under pressure.  

                                  WILL
                    We can make a few calls for you if 
                    you want.  And we ll give you 
                      unqualified references. 

                                  CARY
                    Thank you.

                                  DIANE
                    Do you have any questions?

                                  CARY
                    No.  I get it.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - SECRETARIAL SUBSTATION - NIGHT5555

      Alicia.  She watches Cary.  Watches him stand.  Watches him 
      start toward the door.  Watches him exit, and sees him stare 
      right at her.  Dead burning eyes.  

      Then he passes by her, and Alicia watches him go.
