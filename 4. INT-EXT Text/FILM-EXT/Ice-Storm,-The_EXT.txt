Suburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973. The
still after a terrible storm. Trees dripping, their branches
torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. The
train lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow
emergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from
the track.
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested
landscape.
PAUL (V.O.)
And that's what it is to come from
a family, if you analyze it
closely. Each of them is negative
matter for the other ones. And
that's what dying is -- dying is
when your family, which is in fact
your personal negative matter from
which you emerge -- it's when the
family takes you back, thus hurling
you back into negative space...
The train slowly pulls in.
The train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night,
emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining
traces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant
even in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen
suburban Lolita.
He pauses, regarding them.
They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.
To establish. A typical New England prep school.
Paul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut.
Some kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him.
A large New England Colonial, with a few modern additions and
touches. We hear the sound of dinner chatter.
A nondescript, cleanly "modern" building. Engraved on the
doors: "Shackley and Schwimmer, Securities Brokerage -
Established 1964"
An august New York institution. To establish.
A cool gray afternoon. A group of boys are playing flag
football on the field, while two groups of girls are gathered
underneath the bleachers at either end, warily smoking
c1garettes.
Wendy, Beth, and a couple of other girls are gathered in one
group.
BETH
(referring to one of the
girls gathered in the
other group)
She said you licked Dave Brewster's
weenie in the third floor bathroom.
WENDY
She's a liar. I wouldn't touch Dave
Brewster's dick if you paid me.
It's probably crawling with v.d.
after he put it in her, which he
did.
The conversation peters out at this point, as the two groups
of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar.
Wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the
field where the boys are playing.
A group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them.
The quarterback takes the hike and Mikey runs out for a pass.
As he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his
ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard
before.
The quarterback spots him and throws a long one.
He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound.
The ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his
own, to run.
Suddenly, the humming ends and he stops and turns around, to
see all the other kids just standing there looking at him.
One of them makes a pot-smoking gesture, as if that's the
explanation.
MIKEY
(as he returns to the
group, ball in hand)
Did anybody hear that?
The other kids snicker. Wendy looks on, and catches Mikey's
eye for a fleeting moment.
WENDY
I gotta go.
She takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off.
Wendy pulls her bike up to the back, locks it, and walks in.
As she walks her bike onto the sidewalk, Wendy comes across
Sandy.
SANDY
Hey Wendy.
WENDY
Hey Sandy.
SANDY
Mikey was looking for you.
WENDY
Yeah? See ya.
She pushes off on her bike.
Sandy gazes after her. He takes his G.I. Joe out of his coat
pocket, and points it at her.
SANDY
Bam.
Wendy flies along on her bike. It's a desolately beautiful
fall day.
Wendy rides by the front gates of the posh grounds of the
private psychiatric clinic. A security guard leans against a
booth.
Once a bit past the gate, she gets off her bike and walks it
into a grove of trees near the front drive.
Mikey is waiting amid the trees next to his bike as Wendy
arrives.
MIKEY
Want some gum?
WENDY
Sure.
(pulling them out of her
pocket)
Twinkie?
MIKEY
(opens his mouth,
displaying the gum on his
tongue)
I'm chewing.
She puts the Twinkies back, and pops the gum in her mouth.
They stand together chewing.
WENDY
(after a pause)
Did you tell Sandy?
MIKEY
Tell Sandy? What?
Wendy doesn't say anything.
MIKEY (CONT'D)
You didn't tell him either, did
you?
The wind is picking up and the light is fading. Mikey and
Wendy climb the fence around the pool, which is empty and
half-covered in dead leaves and twigs.
They climb down into the concrete recess and walk into the
deep end, leaning against the far wall of the pool.
They each matter-of-factly take their gum out and put it
behind their ears.
They begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in
each others' mouths.
We see them from high above the pool, as the dead leaves
swirl lightly around them, Mikey groping under Wendy's
poncho.
To establish.
Ben cautiously walks out he back door and heads for the side
gate.
Elena rides her bike into town, infused with the girlish
sense of freedom she imagined for her daughter.
Suddenly, there's a pop -- a tire is blown out. She slows
down and gets off the bike. As she bends to look at the
wheel, a station wagon slows near her. The driver's side
window rolls open. It's Janey Williams.
JANEY
Need a lift?
Janey's car pulls to the curb.
Elena watches the car pull away. She turns and walks into the
store.
In a wide shot, from across the street, we see Elena leave
the store, followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and
taps her on the shoulder. They converse for a minute, and
Elena is accompanied back into the store.
Through the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of
her purse. She's obviously distraught -- offering to pay,
talking quickly, etc. The shopkeeper is holding a telephone,
not yet decided on whether to call her in.
PAUL (V.O.)
To find yourself in the Negative
Zone, as the Fantastic Four often
do, means that all everyday
assumptions are inverted -- even
the invisible girl herself becomes
visible, and so she loses the last
semblance of her power.
Janey pulls up in the driveway. As she gets out of the car,
she hears a small explosion from the back of the house.
Janey comes around the back to discover Sandy stuffing a
model airplane with m-80 firecrackers. He lights them and
runs back a safe distance. The plane explodes, its wreckage
joining the debris from a few other dolls, models, and toys.
JANEY
Sandy!
Sandy looks up -- busted.
Janey marches over to him.
JANEY (CONT'D)
You little idiotic prick, you could
blow yourself fucking sky high with
all this demented crap.
Sandy looks on the verge of tears. She softens and bends down
to him.
JANEY (CONT'D)
(sighing)
Hey.
(picking up the
firecrackers)
I'll take this stuff.
SANDY
You going to tell dad?
JANEY
Would it matter?
(sees something else lying
on the ground)
And what's that?
SANDY
(sniffling)
You know, it's the whip -- the one
uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
JANEY
It's not packed with explosives, is
it?
SANDY
No!
JANEY
(going into the house)
Play with the whip.
Sandy flicks his enormous whip in the direction of a small
bush.
One by one, he snaps off its leaves.
Elena walks unsteadily, pausing to rest against a brick wall.
She takes a deep breath, then walks to a corner where a local
taxi station wagon sits idling. She gestures to the driver,
who beckons her in.
Wendy walks her bike with the wind in her face.
From behind her, Mikey rides up on his bike and rides
alongside her.
She doesn't look at him.
Trying to stay on his bike, but moving slowly, he wobbles,
nearly falling off.
MIKEY
I don't ever want to see you.
WENDY
Then why'd you come after me?
The taxi pulls up. Elena gets out and pays the driver.
Wendy walks and Mikey rides along.
WENDY
You have to follow me?
MIKEY
I dunno. I --
They're now in front of the Hood's house.
Ben exits the house in a rush, and sees Wendy and Mikey on
the street in front.
BEN
Hey there Mikey, how's business?
CONTINUED: 85
MIKEY
(tripping off of his bike)
Business? Uh, I dunno.
Ben grimaces, fiddles for his car keys.
As Mikey remounts and rides off, Wendy passes her father on
the driveway.
BEN
I'm picking up Paul at the station
- want to come?
WENDY
Nah.
BEN
What you been up to?
WENDY
Nothing.
Paul walks to the parking lot with his father, who carries
his duffel bag.
Ben's car heading back to the house with Paul.
The car pulls up. Paul gets out, looking shell-shocked. He
sees Wendy waving to him from a second floor window. He nods
back.
BEN
Um, Paul. On second thought, can
you do me a favor and pretend I
never said any of that.
PAUL
Sure dad.
BEN
Thanks.
In the doorway, Elena waits.
Morning. To establish.
Hood and Wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain.
He looks at her from time to time, then takes her arm.
BEN
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it.
I really don't care that much. I'm
just not sure he's good enough,
that's all.
WENDY
Huh?
BEN
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end
up living off Janey and Jim, you
watch.
It's just that you develop a sense
when you get older, if things are
going to work out or if they won't,
and sometimes it's not worth the
mess...
She looks at him. They keep walking. She walks through a
puddle.
BEN (CONT'D)
Your toes cold?
WENDY
Yeah.
He stops and lifts her in his arms.
BEN
I'll carry you up the drive.
She puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up.
On her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real
intimacy.
Elena and Ben emerge from the house, and look up at a
darkening, foreboding sky. A light rain falls. They jog
toward their car.
The car moves slowly through the rainy suburban streets.
Inside, Elena and Ben don't speak.
Their Firebird pulls up. There are already many other cars
parked on the lawn and driveway.
Ben and Elena climb back in the car and close the doors,
shivering.
ELENA
This just isn't the best moment for
this.
BEN
I know, I know. I had no idea --
ELENA
That this was going to be a key
party?
BEN
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we
could have invented some kind of
excuse. A key party -- did you see
how stuffed that bowl was already?
ELENA
Well?
BEN
I think we're here and we don't
have to stay -- we ought simply to
put in an appearance and then we
can head home.
ELENA
Damn it, Ben --
BEN
I'm not staying at this party so we
can go home with someone else's
wife. That's not why we're here,
right? We're simply being neighbors
here, and I think we should do just
that --
ELENA
You're not going to --
BEN
I'm not.
ELENA
You have some marker, that's what I
think, if you want to know the
truth.
You have some marker and you're
going to put it on the house keys
so that Janey can find them and
then when I get back to the house
I'll find the two of you in there
and Wendy'll be able to hear you
and Paul will be back and he'll
hear you and I'll catch you, that's
what I think. She'll be swearing
and banging against the wall and
I'll catch --
BEN
Elena.
She rubs her eyes.
BEN (CONT'D)
Elena, it's not what you think.
It's not a big plot. Honestly.
Honestly. I don't know if you want
to go over this now, but it's just
something that comes over me. I
don't feel good about it. I know
I've done what I didn't want to do.
I don't know --
ELENA
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a
confession.
BEN
Elena, you're just getting wound up
to get wound up.
ELENA
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben.
Thank you. So let's just go to this
fiasco if that's what you want to
do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather
talk to anyone else but you.
She pulls the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car,
and slams the door. He follows her.
Paul gets out of a cab and heads inside. He's met by the
doorman.
PAUL
Libbets Casey, please.
DOORMAN
Your name?
PAUL
Paul Hood.
DOORMAN
(a smirk)
Elevator on the right. Eighth floor
-- she's waiting for you.
Wendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike, but the
ice makes it too slippery. The storm is now in full swing.
She gets off and walks.
Wendy walks, barely keeping her balance in the wind.
Elena and Jim walk outside into the freezing, pelting rain.
Covering their faces, they jog to his car, an oversized
Cadillac. A thick glaze of ice forms on his windshield.
Wendy walks up the drive in the rain, pauses, then goes to
the front door and knocks lightly. The door swings ajar. She
pushes on it, and lets herself in.
The car moves haltingly through the sleet and ice, inches up
a hill, then falters and slides back silently, circling a
couple of times before crashing into an embankment.
Jim and Elena get out, shaky, from the car.
They pause for a moment.
The street lamp above them sizzles, but stays on.
They start to walk.
Mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain. He
climbs up on the diving board and bounces lightly on it, but
then gets off and stands, looking down at the pool again.
Mikey walks across the field.
The storm has let up. Mikey walks along. With a running
start, he slides on the ice down a hill.
He walks back up and slides again, hollering with joy. He is
an image of a tiny yet absolute and positive freedom.
The streetlights sputter on, then off.
A power line is down. It hisses and HUMS -- a humming very
much like the humming Mikey has been hearing earlier.
The humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which
Mikey has become so accustomed at such moments.
Mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the
sound and the snaking coil of electricity.
A strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face,
as the power line connects to the guardrail.
MIKEY
Oh shit.
Glued by an electrical pulse to the rail, he shakes as the
current flows through him.
After a minute, his body slumps and slides down the road.
Ben drives home.
An emergency vehicle, lights flashing, crawls by Ben's car.
He drives on slowly.
Jim and Elena arrive on foot.
JIM
You want to come in, get a cup of
coffee -- warm up? I can either
walk you home, or you could crash
in the guest room.
ELENA
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Ben gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy
embankment. In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a
parka.
He walks hesitantly toward it. Mike's body lies face down in
the wet ice.
Ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in
amazement and saddened shock.
He stands there for a moment, then picks Mike's body up,
carrying him over the hill and onto the street. We see now
that he is parked just a short block from the Williams's
house.
He bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward
the house. The effort is obviously enormous. He falls from
time to time, then gets back up.
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested
landscape. On the street below the bridge, an emergency
highway crew is removing a fallen tree, their trucks aglow in
flashing yellow lights.
Elena and Wendy come out the front door, as Ben lays Mikey's
body onto the ground before the front steps.
ELENA
Ben?
He's too breathless to speak.
They stand there, looking down at Mikey.
Behind Elena and Wendy, Jim appears.
He pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.
BEN
Jim -- he was just up --
in Silver
Lane -- I think maybe -- a power
line --
Jim picks up his son.
He carries him silently into the house.
Sandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back
against the wall as they pass, without expression.
After a moment, from outside, the Hoods can hear Jim's
wailing.
BEN
Do you think? Maybe we should call
someone --
ELENA
The phone's out.
BEN (CONT'D)
Yeah. Well, we can just --
ELENA
Ben, I don't think he wants us
here.
Wendy has been watching Sandy through the screen door.
WENDY
Wait, I --
She turns back up the front steps and gently goes in --
ELENA
Oh you know, for a minute I thought
it was --
BEN
Paul? Yeah. You think --
WENDY
He's probably been waiting all
night at the station.
BEN
C'mon.
Elena, Wendy, and Ben reach the car and get in. The car
starts and drives off.
There are more crews out cleaning up the storm's debris and
fixing the power lines as they drive.
The train slowly pulls in. The Hood family walks down to the
end of the platform.
The train doors open, and Paul, tired and a bit cramped,
emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform, and walks to them.
They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.
When he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get
in.
From above:
The car, the first morning light shining upon it.
