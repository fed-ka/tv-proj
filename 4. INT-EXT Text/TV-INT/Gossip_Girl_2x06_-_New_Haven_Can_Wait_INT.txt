      CLOSE ON: a beautiful bouquet of flowers.  As the original 
      score to My Fair Lady plays, we PAN BACK to REVEAL: Professor 
      Higgins (AKA DEAN BERUBE) pacing in his book-lined study.  
      He s in his 50s, scholarly and proper. 

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                            (exaggerated elocution)
                    The rain.  In Spain.  Stays mainly in 
                    the plain.  Again?

      We see that the  student  perched on his couch is BLAIR as 
      Eliza Doolittle, dressed in drab street urchin garb. 

                                  BLAIR
                          (slightly Cockney)
                    The rain... in Spain... stays mainly 
                    in the plain?

      Higgins sighs, disappointed, provoking more Cockney:

                                  BLAIR (CONT D)
                    I m a straight-A student, I am!
                            (determined)
                    The rain in Spain...

      The door to Higgins  office opens, interrupting Blair.  
      SERENA glides in, in an elegant white dress, and perfectly:  

                                  SERENA
                    The rain in Spain stays mainly in the 
                    plain.

      She smiles her 1000 watt smile at the Dean, who is enchanted.

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    By George, I think she s got it!

                                  BLAIR
                          (excited)
                    I do?

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    No, she does.

      As the Dean takes SERENA s arm, Blair pounds the couch in 
        frustration, letting out a full-on Cockney SQUAWK worthy of 
      Audrey herself.  The squawk turns into BEEPING.    GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   2.



      Blair sits up in bed, tugging off her satin sleep-mask, 
      fumbling for her alarm.  Her eyes dart to the LV luggage 
      packed and ready near the door.  She relaxes; just a dream.

                                   GOSSIP GIRL (V.O.)
                    Rise and shine, Early Birds, Gossip 
                    Girl here.  We all have dreams: some 
                    good, some bad, some fun and 
                    Freudian.  Some fade with the first 
                    sip of cafe au lait, some stay with 
                    you all day...

      Blair steps out of bed, catching a glimpse of a PHOTO of 
      herself and Serena on her dresser, and nonchalantly tosses 
      the sleep-mask over it, covering the image.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And some are the dreams you ve had 
                    your whole life.  

      As Blair puts on her Yale blue robe, DOROTA enters, carrying 
      a tray with breakfast and tea, morning newspapers under her 
      arm.  Blair opens her shades to let light in, cheery.

                                  DOROTA
                    Morning, Miss Blair.  Your mother 
                    already left for work but she was 
                    very specific about your breakfast.

                                  BLAIR
                    Dorota, can you believe in three 
                    small hours I ll be stepping through 
                    the gates of Yale?

      Dorota smiles at her as she puts down the tray and hands 
      Blair her morning papers -- NY Times, Observer, Post.  Blair 
      takes them to her desk, picking up a breakfast pastry with 
      her other hand.

                                  DOROTA
                    You used to sleep in your father s 
                      sweatshirt every night until it fell 
                    apart.

                                  BLAIR
                    I ll get a new one.  Right after I 
                    attend the Dean of Admissions  
                    private reception, of course.  Most 
                      candidates think it s an urban 
                    legend, but Daddy was invited when he 
                    first visited.

                                  DOROTA
                    Some Kombucha, Miss Blair?

                                  BLAIR
                    Since the Dean handpicks guests after 
                    their interviews, I m a shoo-in.  If 
                    there s one thing I know, it s that I 
                    give good interview.  I could make 
                    Larry King cry. 

                                  DOROTA
                    Just like we practiced.  I am so 
                    proud of you.

                                  BLAIR
                    And I m so ready to be surrounded by 
                    people who are more like me and less 
                    like --

      Blair looks down to see Serena s face smiling up at her from 
      a photo in Page Six.  She scowls.

                                  BLAIR (CONT D)
                    ... her.

                                  DOROTA
                    Miss Serena and you are still not 
                    speaking?

                                  BLAIR
                    Not a word in a week, but I can t 
                    escape her.  Since Mother s show, 
                    Manhattan has turned into 
                      Serenaville.  

                                  DOROTA
                    I heard Marc Jacobs named a purse 
                    after her. 

                                  BLAIR
                    I simply don t understand the 
                      fascination.  Fortunately, Yale is 
                    out of her reach.

      Blair emphatically sets down her teacup on Serena s face.  We 
      CUT TO:

      CLOSE ON: THE PAGE SIX PHOTO. It s Serena, at an event with 
      Lily -- or half of Lily; she s been nearly cropped out.

      Serena regards the photo as LILY enters with two garment bags 
      and a letter.  Serena pushes the paper aside so Lily won t 
      see.

                                  SERENA
                    I m all packed and ready!  Aren t you 
                    excited, me at your alma mater?

                          (re: letter)
                    So I guess that means you turned down 
                    this personal invitation to tour Yale 
                    this weekend...

                                  SERENA
                    Brown s always been my plan, like it 
                    was for you.

                                  LILY
                    And I loved it there, but if Yale had 
                    invited me, I would have said yes.  
                    The invitation is handwritten, 
                    Serena.  In cursive. 

                                  SERENA
                    Yale is for overachieving bookworms 
                    and preppies, the Blairs of the 
                    world.  And even though we re not 
                    exactly talking right now, there s no 
                    way I m going to step on that 
                    particular land mine.
                          (subject change)
                    On your way to lunch with the Ladies 
                    Who Lunch?

                                  LILY
                    Actually, it s brunch with the Ladies 
                    Who Lunch, which is almost the same 
                    except there s a lovely seafood 
                    frittata and a lot of hangovers.
                          (spotting page six:)
                    By the way, you don t have to hide 
                    it, that photo was all the talk this 
                    morning.

                                  SERENA
                    I m sorry they called you my 
                       unidentified friend. 

                                  LILY
                    I guess it s better than  Mother. 

      Lily unzips a garment bag.

                                  SERENA
                    What s in the bag?

      Inside the bag is a short, sexy dress.  Serena crosses over.

                                  LILY (CONT D)
                    Oh, my...  It s edgier than I 
                    expected, but I like it.

                                  SERENA
                    And it s apparently for me. 

      Serena points to a tag that reads  Serena van der Woodsen.   

                                  LILY
                    Then this one must be mine.  

      Lily unzips the bag labeled  Lily Bass.   Inside is an 
      elegant, sophisticated, yet much less-revealing dress. 
      Although she tries to cover, Lily feels outmoded. 

                                  DAN (O.S.)
                    What do you think of the color?


      At the breakfast bar, waffles on the table, DAN holds out one 
      of his stories to RUFUS. 

                                  RUFUS
                    Of the paper?  It s white.

                                  DAN
                    It s not white, it s  soft ecru. 
                          (holds up another version)
                    This is white.  I like the ecru 
                    myself.  But I m not sure about this 
                    font --

      The paper looks the same to Rufus.  He pats Dan on the 
      shoulder.

                                  RUFUS
                    I used to get the same way before a 
                    big show.  But don t worry.  You ll 
                    be fine.  More than fine.

                    Maybe, but I just can t help thinking 
                    Yale is for Presidents, not 
                      Humphreys.

                    After that, you find a  but? 

                                  DAN
                    But what if it s not enough?

                                  RUFUS
                    If that s not enough, something s 
                    wrong with Yale, not you.

      As Dan slides his folder of stories into his beat-up 
      backpack, he looks at Jenny s closed bedroom door.

                                  DAN

                    I don t know... I still have my heart 
                    set on USC.  I just wish my mom 
                    wasn t pushing Yale so hard.

                    She s only pushing it  cause the 
                      Vanderbilt side of her family 
                      practically owns it.  Think of it 
                    this way: Yale s your safety school.

                    I guess I can get away from all the 
                    drama on the other side of my family.

                    I m evaluating colleges based on 
                    their secret societies.  Columbia s 
                    were clammy-handed mama s boys and 
                    Harvard s were obsessed with the 
                      Constitution.  Yale has the creme de 
                    la creme: the Skull and Bones.  My 
                    goal is to get inside their inner 
                    sanctum.

                                  NATE

      Constance and St. Jude s SENIORS gather around HEADMISTRESS 
      QUELLER and HEADMASTER PRESCOTT.  Blair and Serena are on 
      opposite sides of the group.  Dan, Nate and Chuck are there,

      Blair smiles, supremely confident.  Her eyes meet Serena s.  
      Both girls look away quickly.

                    possible light.  Good luck.

                    sure the Dean of Admissions at Yale 
                    will actually appreciate my ability 
                    to write stories about damned and 
                    damaged characters such as yourself.

                    Looks like we ll be spending the 
                    weekend together, how nice.  But 
                    since I ll be traveling to New Haven 
                    in a stretch with a single malt, say 
                    hello to all the other  characters  
                    on public transportation for me?

      Off Dan -- Chuck will be at Yale this weekend, too.  Ugh.


      Rufus is at the counter with a now-cold plate of waffles when 
      Jenny comes out of her room, showered and dressed.

                                  RUFUS
                    After that shower there won t be any 
                    hot water left in the building.

                                  JENNY
                    I wasn t in there the whole time.  I 
                    was waiting for something.

      Rufus is confused.  Just then, VANESSA enters.

                                  VANESSA
                    I got here as fast as I could.

                                  JENNY
                    I know.  I saw you running up the 
                    block from my window.

                                  RUFUS
                    What s going on here?

                                  JENNY
                    As soon as I smelled the caramelized 
                    bananas I knew it was a trap.  So I 
                    called in reinforcements.  Before you 
                    launch into school stuff, Vanessa and 
                    I have a pitch for you. 

                                  RUFUS
                            (reluctantly settles)
                    I m listening.

                                  JENNY
                    Did you know Vanessa s applying to 
                    NYU for next fall?

                                  VANESSA
                    I m really hoping to get into the 
                    Steinhardt School; I can study fine 
                    art and take film classes, and they 
                    have an amazing grad program.

                    to work to support herself.  Living 
                    as an adult when you re a teenager is 
                    not what any parent wants for their 
                    child --

                                  JENNY
                    What about what I want for me?

                    Until you re eighteen, what you want 
                    is trumped by what I want.

      It s a standoff.  Jenny looks to Vanessa, who nods, with:

                                    VANESSA
                    Plan B.

      Jenny tries logic in place of emotion:

                    Come to the atelier with me today?

                                  JENNY
                    I ll make you a deal: spend the day 
                    with me.  If at the end of that day 
                    you honestly think I should go back 
                    to Constance on Monday, I will.

                                  RUFUS
                    Jenny, I ve seen your designs and I 
                    heard about your internship all 
                    summer long.  What more is there?

                                  JENNY
                    Things are different now.

                    Sometimes doing things by the book 
                    isn t the only way.  You have to have 
                    an open mind.  In my humble opinion.

      As Rufus mulls it over...

                                  RUFUS
                    At least we ll be moving forward one 
                    way or another.  It s a deal. 

                                  JENNY
                    Really?  You mean it?

      Rufus realizes what this means to her.  And:

                                  RUFUS
                    You have my word.

      Dan sits across from DEAN BERUBE (pronounced Barraby), whom

                    To summarize, I really do think that 
                    I have something to say --

                    It seems you only have one letter of 
                      recommendation, from J.L. Hall.  Noah 
                    Shapiro declined to write on your

                    Mr. Shapiro and I had... creative

                      internships and recommendations are 
                    crucial for students who are applying 
                    for scholarship.  If you want your 
                      application to stand out, you need 
                    another letter, one about your work.

                    Another letter?  From whom?  And how?

                    Looks like he s ready for you now.

    As Serena exits her interview, the Dean stands at the door.

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Shall we, Miss Waldorf? 

                                  BLAIR
                          (staring back at Serena)
                    I ve never been more prepared.

    But we don t believe her.  Off Blair, rattled beyond belief.


    The hood is pulled from Chuck s head.  He s in a pitch-black 
      room.  Six SKULL AND BONES MEMBERS surround him.  One shines 
      a flashlight in Chuck s face -- he is the LEADER.  When he 
      speaks, his measured tone is menacing.

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    Chuck Bass.  Heir to Bass Industries, 
                    champion of the legendary Lost 
                    Weekend; rumor has it you've slept 
                    with more Maxim covers than John 
                    Mayer.

                                  CHUCK
                    And better, I might add.

      Off Chuck -- the circle around him growing tighter.


      Blair sits across from the Dean.  We can tell she s nervous. 
      The Dean is looking over her application packet; WE SEE her 
      rather long essay typed on Blair Waldorf stationery.

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    I have to say, your application is 
                    most impressive Miss Waldorf.  
                    There s just one thing I d like to 
                    know.  Tell me something about you 
                    that isn t in this packet.

                    I know I must seem rather traditional 
                    compared to that  young lady,  but 
                    isn t tradition what Yale is all 
                    about?

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Well, yes, but we ve been trying to 
                    change that image.  Too stuffy.  So?

                                  BLAIR
                          (slowly unravelling)
                    Well I m aware I lack some people s 
                    easy grace with strangers, and I 
                    don t exactly make you feel like 
                    you ve known me forever even though 
                    we just met.  When I laugh you might 
                    not smile just at the coquettish 
                    sound of it.  And I may not be 
                       spontaneous  and  delightful  and 
                     full of surprises,  and my hair 
                    might not sparkle when it catches the 
                    light --
                          (catching herself:)
                      Everything worth knowing about me is 
                    in that envelope.  I made sure of it.

      After a small but very awkward pause, the Dean stands.  

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Well, then.  Thank you, Miss Waldorf.

                                  BLAIR
                          (hinting)
                    Isn t there anything else you d like 
                    to ask me?  Perhaps what my plans are 
                    for this evening?  

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    There s so much to do on campus, I m 
                    sure you ll find something.

      Not exactly the invitation Blair was angling for.  The Dean 
      crosses to the door and opens it, extends his hand to Blair. 

                                  BLAIR
                    It was so nice to meet you.

      She takes his hand but instead of shaking it -- she kisses 
      the Dean on the cheek.  The Dean pulls away, aghast.  He 
      ducks into his office, shutting the door.  Blair realizes how 
      inappropriate she was, and how badly her interview went.

    The atelier is busy.  Jenny seems in the center of it as 
      Laurel s ASSISTANT comes up to her.

    As Jenny walks, she passes Rufus, sitting at her workstation.  
    He smiles at her, proud.  As she exits, Rufus sees Eleanor at 
    her desk.  He stands and crosses to her.

                    Yes, well, it was Jenny s idea to 
                    show me why this is so important to 
                    her.  Do you have a moment?

                                  ELEANOR

                    this morning but I m not sure I can 
                    keep it.  I need your help.

                    I ll do no such thing.  Fashion is a

      Eleanor s question sinks in as Rufus looks at Jenny.


      Nate and Jordan are entwined on her bed.  Clothes are about

                    I had a feeling.  Thank you.

      Blair smiles.  Transaction complete.


      Chuck enters the room where seven Skull and Bones members 
      (including the Leader, SKULL and BONES) wait for him.  

                                  CHUCK
                    Your party has arrived.

      Entering behind him are THREE MASKED WOMEN.  The women are 
      gorgeous, mysterious and a little scary.  They drop their 
      capes, revealing very scant lingerie underneath. 

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    Straight from... well, I can t tell 
                    you where they re from, actually.  
                    But they re the best that money can 
                    buy -- with knowledge that isn t even 
                    on the internet yet.  Before you ask, 
                    they don t speak English.

      One of the women goes over to the LEADER, and sits on his 
      lap, and starts kissing him, hard.  Chuck smiles.

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    And they don t care.  By the way -- 
                          (turning to SKULL and 
                            BONES)
                    -- that s not one for each of you.  
                    They do their best work in threes.

      The other two women cross to Leader.  One bites his ear.  The 
      other pulls his tie tight around his neck.  He can barely 
      speak.  

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    Not bad, Bass.

      He dismisses the girls for the moment, turns to Chuck.

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER (CONT D)
                    But you re not done.  Sure, the girls 
                    are all right, but they re just... 
                    girls.  You still need to prove your 
                    loyalty.  Show us the coldness of 
                    your soul.

                    Done.

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    We want Nate Archibald.  We know 
                    you re tight with him.  We know he s 
                    on campus, but we haven t been able 
                    to find him.

      Chuck reacts -- didn t expect this, tries to deflect.

                                  CHUCK
                      Archibald s not worth your time.

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    We think he is.  Pull him in, take 
                    him down.  You ve got one hour.

                                  CHUCK
                          (playing it cool)
                    Please, there are so many things one 
                    could do in an hour, why waste your 
                    time pranking a kid like Nate?

                                  SKULL
                    My family lost our compound in 
                    Newport because of his father.  Not 
                    to mention he totally killed my trust 
                    fund.

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    In your little twelve-block universe, 
                    you may be the King, but up here, 
                    you re just another clown.  You want 
                    in?  You ll bring us Archibald.  And 
                    if you don t, you ll be watching your 
                    back all the way to the bridge.  
                          (to SKULL and BONES)
                    Go with him?

      As the Leader goes off with the Girls, Chuck s wheels turn -- 
      will he betray Nate?

                    Sometimes to fit in, you have to give

                                        ACT III


    The private reception has begun in the Dean s house, a lovely 
      Colonial on campus.  A fire in the fireplace, classical 
      music.  APPLICANTS mix among two dozen FACULTY MEMBERS. We 
      find Serena, looking lovely, standing over a table.  She 
      clutches an index card in one hand and a pen in another.  

                                  BLAIR (O.S.)
                    Trying to come up with an answer for 
                    the Dean s parlor game?  

      Serena looks up to see Blair standing next to her, a big 
      smile on her face.  Blair folds her index card in half and 
      slips it into a hat.  Serena reacts -- she should have known.

                                  SERENA
                    You manipulated your way in here.

                                  BLAIR
                    I get what I want, Serena.  Just like 
                    I m going to win tonight.  What s 
                    your answer?  Wait, no: let me guess,  
                    Lauren Conrad?  

      Serena boils.  If that s how she s going to play it:

                                  SERENA
                    Try George Sand.

                                  BLAIR
                    Wait.  That s --

                                  SERENA
                    Your answer?  Not anymore.  
                          (writes on her card)
                    If you re going to cheat your way in, 
                    why should I play fair?  Oh, and I 
                    heard the Dean asks his question in 
                      alphabetical order.  So since  V  
                    comes before  W,  it seems like the 
                    answer is all mine.

      Serena s pleased, tucks her card into the hat and turns away, 
      victorious.  We hold on Blair, stunned, as she glances back, 
      nervously, to the hat...  GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   31A.



      Serena stands with a FACULTY MEMBER and his WIFE, charming 
      the pants off them -- in French.

                                  SERENA
                    J'adore Lelouch.  "Roman de Gare" 
                     tait un de mes films pr f r s cet 
                    ann e, et toi?

      Suddenly, there is Blair, taking the orange slice off of 
      Serena s glass of sparkling water and eating it.

                                  BLAIR
                    Actually, it s  vous,  as a sign of 
                    respect.  I m sure that s why you 
                    don t know it very well.  
                          (turns to Professor:)
                    Blair Waldorf, I ve been looking for 
                    you; you were my father s favorite 
                    teacher.  You inspired his 
                      expatriation to France.  Shall we?

      As she leads him away, Serena watches her, pissed. CUT TO:


      ROUND TWO: Blair stands with a stuffy HISTORY PROFESSOR. 

                                  BLAIR
                    Although I love Henry the eighth, I 
                    prefer Sir Thomas Moore.  I think it 
                    was great that Pope Benedict 
                    canonized him when he did --

      And there is Serena, right there depositing her dirty 
      cocktail napkin in Blair s outstretched hand with: 

                                  SERENA
                    Don t you mean Pope Pius XI? 

                                    HISTORY PROFESSOR
                    Quite right, Miss... van der Woodsen, 
                    is it?  Most people don t know their 
                    Popes in succession. 










                                                                              (CONTINUED)  GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   31B-

      CONTINUED:2626

      As Serena smiles, the Professor smiles back and moves off.  
      Blair turns to Serena, trying not to let Serena get to her.

                                  BLAIR
                    How do you even know that, you slept 
                    through history last year.

                                  SERENA
                    I love  The Tudors.   Henry Cavill is 
                    a total babe.  You re pretty calm for 
                    someone who no longer has the perfect 
                    answer to the Dean s question.

                                  BLAIR
                    You don t think I came all this way 
                    without a backup answer, do you?  Oh, 
                    and it s a real crowd-pleaser, too.  
                    It s going to kill.

      Serena is confused, but then there s the ding-ding-ding of a 
      fork hitting a champagne glass.  The Dean is standing in the 
      doorway to the dining room. 

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Everyone, everyone, it s time for my 
                    favorite part of the evening, what 
                    has delightfully become known over 
                    the years as Probatur!

                                  BLAIR
                          (to Serena)
                    That s Latin for  the quiz.  

      Serena throws Blair a look.  The Dean is excited, jovial. The 
      potential Yale applicants are nervous.

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    When I say your name, it ll be your 
                    turn to expound upon your answer and 
                    tell me why.

                    Let s begin with Mr... Applebaum?

      As Serena gets increasingly nervous, we CUT TO:


      Dan sits at the bar, eating a burger.  He has given up all 
      hope and is cracking open a novel ( Then We Came to the End  
      by Josh Ferris) when his phone rings.   

                                  DAN

                    I m on my way.  

      A stoked Dan throws a $20 down for his burger and rushes out.


      Chuck on his phone.  We don t know where, or what he s up to.

      It's the end of a very long workday.  People are packing up 
      to go home. Jenny approaches Rufus for his judgment.  

                                  JENNY

                    I have to say, I m impressed.  You re 
                    clearly valued here, and you handle 
                    yourself very professionally.

                    Uh oh.

      It kills Rufus to say what he s about to say, but:

                    I think you should go back to school.

                    But you said you were impressed.  I 
                    don t understand.

                    I am.  Just not enough.  

                                  JENNY
                    But --

                                  RUFUS
                    I m sorry, sweetheart.  I just think 
                    school is too important.

      Jenny looks like she s going to cry, but she doesn t.  
      There s a moment.  She stops herself, pulls back.

                                  JENNY
                    If that's what you think, then that s 
                    what you think.  We made a deal, and 
                    I agreed to it.  

      Rufus is surprised at her maturity.  He also feels bad about 
      lying, but he feels he has to.

                                  RUFUS
                    I have to say I thought there d be 
                    some yelling.  That high-pitched 
                    thing you do, maybe...

                                  JENNY
                    You said you d give me a day, and you 
                    did.  I respect that.  Your decision 
                    is your decision.

                                  RUFUS
                    That s very mature, Jenny.

                                  JENNY
                    I know.  That s what I was hoping 
                    you d get.
                          (quietly)
                    Can you at least take me to complete 
                    one last errand before we go home?

                                  RUFUS
                    Sure.

      As Jenny moves off, Rufus stares after her, conflicted.


      The Dean holds the ten students' answers in his hands.  They 
      are lined up alphabetically -- ending with Serena and Blair.  

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Alright, onto Miss Steinberg.  Your 
                    answer is Artemis.

                    I can tell you right now: the look on 
                    my face will be one of vindication.

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Very nice, Miss Steinberg.  And now, 
                    Miss van der Woodsen, the person you

                          (looking at her card)
                     Pete Fairman.  

      Serena s shocked.  Blair smiles wide.  The Dean is confused: 

                                  DEAN BERUBE (CONT D)
                    Hmm, I do not know this person.  Who

                                  SERENA
                    He s... he s...

        A victorious Blair calls out: 

                                  BLAIR
                    He s the man she killed!

      Amidst the whispers of the crowd, the titters, people asking 
      questions -- Serena and Blair start fighting.

                                  SERENA
                    I can t believe you did this!

      The Dean calls from the front, with:

      Lily examines herself in front of a full-length mirror.  We 
      see that she's wearing the short, sexy,  Serena  dress, not 
      the one that had been sent over for her.

      She looks beautiful, but is not at ease in the dress.  She 
      starts to pull it down lower on her legs when she hears the 
      elevator doors open, and VOICES.  She exits the bedroom...


      Jenny and Rufus exit the elevator.  Rufus is apprehensive.

                                  RUFUS
                    You sure it s okay for us to just

                    Whose maid is Larissa, exactly?  You 
                    didn t say where we were going.

      Rufus spies a piece of mail on the ottoman.  To LILY BASS.

      Lily has come out from the hall wearing the dress.  Rufus  
      jaw might drop a little.

                    So.  How have you been? 


      Nate is drinking by himself at the bar where Dan was earlier. 
      He looks at his watch -- where is Chuck?  He takes out his 
      phone, calls.  He gets Chuck s voicemail, leaves a message.

      The S&B Members look between them... and then they bum rush 
      Nate.  But Nate s quicker than they are, and he s grabbed a 
      nearby barstool and tipped it over.  The S&B Members fall to 
      the floor.

                    eighteen anymore.

                    Still, it s quite a dress. 

                                  LILY
                    Of course it is.  Your daughter made 
                    it. 
                          (off Rufus, stunned:)
                    You re lucky you have a daughter who 
                    is this good at what she wants to do 
                    this early in her life.  It s a gift.  
                    You had one, too, if I remember 
                      correctly...

      Jenny returns with a great pair of shoes.  As Jenny hands the 
      shoes to Lily, and she puts them on...

                                  JENNY
                    There we are.  The perfect pair of 
                    Jimmy Choos.

                                  LILY
                    Thank you.  I ll lend them to Serena, 
                    when she wears the dress.

                                  RUFUS
                    Jen, we should get going.

                    you wear; you look fantastic at any 
                    age.    GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   44.



      Jenny comes out from her bedroom to find Rufus cooking 
      breakfast.  Vanessa's also sitting there, with a big smile on 
      her face.  Jenny is suddenly nervous as she crosses to them.

                                  JENNY
                    Why do I feel like you re going to 
                    tell me the cat died?

                                    VANESSA
                    No, no, it s nothing bad.

      A happy Rufus hands a confused Jenny her waffles.

                    When I was your age, the only thing I 
                    wanted was to be a musician, but my 
                    parents didn t think it was a good 
                    idea.  Which made for some pretty 
                      uncomfortable years, and ended up 
                    causing more damage between us than 
                    it needed to.  Last night I realized 
                    we don t have to do things that way.

                                  JENNY
                    I don t understand.  Are you saying --

                                  RUFUS
                    I m saying I want to support you and 
                    your talent like they could have 
                    supported mine.  
                          (Jenny reacts:)
                    But it isn t going to be easy.  
                    You ll have a lot on your plate. 

                                    VANESSA
                    Your Dad asked me to bring over all 
                    my stuff on homeschooling.  We won.

                      Apparently the state requires the 
                      equivalent of five and a half hours 
                    of coursework per day.  Which, with 
                    your workload at Eleanor s, will be 
                    pretty tough.  But if this is what 
                    you want...

                    It is!

                    After Christmas, we can re-evaluate. 
                    If it s working out, maybe you apply 
                    to the Professional Children's School 
                    for next semester.

      Jenny jumps up and grabs Rufus into a hug.  Vanessa looks on, 
      happy for Jenny.

                    Thank you, Dad.  Thank you thank you

                                  DEAN BERUBE 
                    We see hundreds of candidates like 
                    Blair every year, but you, my dear, 
                    are one in a million.

                    Oh, I m not so sure about --

                    If it s alright with you, I d like to 
                    issue a press release that you came 
                    up to visit our glorious campus... 
                    and, between us, do you know how my 
                    wife might get invited to the Costume 
                    Ball at the Met next year?  I told 
                    her I was sure you must know 
                      someone...

      ON THE DEAN S DESK, we see that Serena s file includes

                    I won t accept.  Not like this.

                                  BLAIR
                    You have to.  It doesn't matter how 
                    you got it or why.  It's an

                    Yeah, but you can t share this.

                                  SERENA
                    We'll find a way, together.
