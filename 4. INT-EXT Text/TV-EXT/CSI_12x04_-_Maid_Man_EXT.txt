    Russell and Catherine exit the rear door, see a DEAD SECURITY
  GUARD (STANLEY GANT, 40's) lying on the concrete.  There's a
  BIG BULLET HOLE where the Guard's nose used to be. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  Body.  Museum security.  

    Russell checks his pulse, dead.  Catherine notes his empty
    holster.  Spots a 38 REVOLVER a few feet away.  Picks it up,
  using her SHAWL, swings the cylinder open --

                                    CATHERINE
                Got two shots off.  Before he snorted
                  a bullet.  

    Russell, back on his feet, now eyes a pair of TIRE IMPRESSIONS
  in the nearby trickle of water, running down the alley.  

                                    RUSSELL
                  Tire impressions in water.  Better
                  snap before they dry up.

    Improvising L-scale, he lays a DOLLAR BILL down beside the
    treads and snaps a PHOTO of the impressions with his iPHONE,
  then angles it up at Catherine.  CLICK.

                                    CATHERINE
                  What are you doing?

                                    RUSSELL
                          (innocent appreciation)
                You look great in this light. 
                        (then)
                  C'mon, tell me you're not gonna
                  want to remember the night they
                  shot Oscar Goodman.

  OFF Catherine, moonbeamed again.

                                                                            SMASH TO:

  Still taped off.  Black and white at each end of the alley. 
  Greg is searching for the MISSING ROUNDS from the Guard's
    weapon.  Russell approaches from the back of the museum.

                                    RUSSELL
                You find those two missing rounds
                  from the Security Guard's gun?

                                  GREG
                  Nope.  I'm starting to think they're
                in the next county.  Or in Vinnie*
                  Sapphire.  

    Russell walks over, eyes the Security Guard's blood pool.

                                    RUSSELL
                  Only blood in this alley is from
                the guard.  
                        (then, mulling)
                He was shot with a 44.  Two shooters
                  inside had 38s.

                                  GREG
                        (re: tire impressions)
                  Maybe whoever was driving Vinnie's*
                  getaway car was packing the 44.

                                    RUSSELL
                          (considers, then)
                  Greg, do me a favor.  Shoot me in
                the face.

                                  GREG
                  What?

                                    RUSSELL
                  Shoot me in the face.  Pretend gun.  
                        (mimes a gun)
                One foot away.  Don't miss.

                                  GREG
                  You're the boss.

  Greg 'draws' his finger and stalks Russell.  



                                                              (CONTINUED)  CSI: "Maid Man" - 1204 - WHITE - 8/23/1132.

  When he gets within an arm's length of Russell, Russell
    quickly draws his own finger and instinctively unloads into
  Greg.  Six times. 

                                    RUSSELL
                  BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

                                  GREG
                  Hey, I wasn't ready.

    Russell is deaf to his protests, his wheels turning, a piece
  of the puzzle falling into place.  Finally, to Greg --

                                    RUSSELL
                  This was good.  I'm glad we worked
                  this out.  You're done.  Bullets
                  aren't out here.  And they're not
                in the next county.  Or in Vinnie*
                  Sapphire either.

  Greg, at a loss, watches as Russell turns and heads back
  into the museum.  What was that?  As he 'holsters' his finger --

                                                                                CUT TO:







  OPEN ON a '79 Coupe de Ville with a familiar license plate,
  but a new sticker.  Catherine turns, sees Brass breaking off
  from a Q & A with the MOTEL MANAGER.  He passes by UNIs, one
  with a shotgun, pressed up against a wall, eyes on ROOM 137. *
  He joins her --

    Stanley Gant, the Security Guard, runs out of the museum. 
    Approaches the Caddie, leans in the passenger window, handing
  over the journal to --
