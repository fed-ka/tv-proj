  SAKAR (32), fear on his face a complete contradiction to 
  his huge muscular frame. By his side is CHALAK (19) wiry, 
  taut and filled with dangerous amounts of adrenaline. 
  In rear of van: LEYLA (28) Composed in her beauty and 
  totally focused in her intent. The leader. Prayer beads 
  in hand are gently caressed. 
 
  IN BG: (V/O) Sound of over one hundred Kurdish women, 
  warbling the battle cry... 
  SELAMET (22) and EBRU(23) identifiably sisters... 
  LEYLA nods to SELAMET and EBRU. 
  SELAMET and EBRU open duffel bag, containing AK47 s. 
  Rolls of black cloth lie lengthways down van. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                      (Kurdish) 
            Today we will remind the world that all we 
                              want is our home. 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                      (Kurdish) 
            Today the Turkish government will release our 
            mother and father and all of our people, or 
                            we will kill theirs. 
 
  CHALAK grabs his AK47. LEYLA watches on with concern.

                                        CHALAK 
                              (Kurdish. Insistent) 
                            He cannot be trusted. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                      (Kurdish)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 4
 

                Chalak. Stop with all that. Our parents 
                          trusted him didn t they? 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                      (Kurdish) 
            But he is not one of us. What does all this 
              really mean to him? Why? Why is he helping 
                                  us. For what? 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                      (Kurdish) 
            He owes our people a great debt and despite 
              what you feel, he believes in us. How else 
          did we get here? Who else could have obtained 
                                        these? 
 
    Indicating weapons and rolls of cloth - 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
                                      (Kurdish) 
                                    And these?

                                        DANNY 
          It s just a routine check, Zoe. Be careful in 
                                        there. 
 
  DANNY jumps up, grabs his coat - heads for a box by front 
  door. 
 
                                  DANNY (CONT D) 
            Helen s things, for her mum. Rest of them are 
            still at work. I ve been putting it off. It s

  handbag with lock-picking tools in it. 
 
                                        ZOE

                                (Gets the joke) 
          One of the Haseem family told me four British 
            men approached him a few days ago. British                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 16
 

            but not local boys, you know, they had tans.

                                      (Sarcastic) 
                                    Did they? 
 
                                        STAN 
            Definitely ex military he reckoned. Looking 
          to purchase SD Hecklers and short stock AK s. 
                                  (The expert) 
                Could cause some serious close quarter 
                  carnage with that little lot my man. 
 
  TOM picks up the pace - STAN can hardly keep up. 
 
                                  STAN (CONT'D) 
              MOD should know about this sort of thing, 
                              don t you reckon? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Thank you Stan, but stick to informing the 
                              police. I m busy... 
 
  TOM picks up his pace - STAN struggling to keep up. 
 
                                        STAN 
            Hang on? What do I get? Come on! I could be 
                                  good for you! 
 
  Tom runs off - points to the sky - STAN can t keep up, 
  comes to a standstill - Slowly STAN looks up. 
 
  INT. TURKISH EMBASSY - UPPER LANDING. DAY 1. 1319 
 
  ZOE reaches the upper landing. She moves quickly, looking 
  around her at all times. She goes to a satellite socket 
  on the wall, kneels down and unscrews it. ZOE very 
  quickly checks the bug, then starts to screw it back 
  together. The glass lift slowly makes it way up towards 
  her... 
 
  INT./EXT. VAN/ROAD NEAR EMBASSY - DAY 1. 1320 
 
  LEYLA can see JOHNNY in the car behind.

                            (Kurdish. Calm. Proud.) 
            We are not alone. The blood of our ancestors 
              pumps through our hearts. A blood line we 
            must fight for, and if God wishes, die for.

  INT. TURKISH EMBASSY - DINING ROOM - DAY 1. 1327 
  (FORMERLY SCENE 37) 
 
  Loud Sufi music - ZOE enters room. She strides over to 
  SONAY locked onto OZAN and others, overselling his 
  company. ZOE sidles up and sits down between them, 
  smiling. OZAN in some discomfort. 
 
                                        SONAY 
              You will not find a more dedicated travel 
                              company in Turkey. 
 
  OZAN pulls out inhaler. Only enough for one hit. SELIN 
  comes to the rescue. 
 
                                        SELIN 
            That is the last one Ozan? I ll have someone 
                                      fetch.. 
 
                                        OZAN 
                      Stop fussing woman. I m fine. 
                              (Back to business) 
 
  SELIN turns back to ZOE. 
 
                                        SELIN 
                                  (Back to ZOE) 
            My husband is also stubborn. So, Emily, how 
                                  many months? 
 
  ZOE s handbag lodged between ZOE s feet - 
 
                                        ZOE 
                I told him not to tell anyone! He's so 
                                      excited. 
 
                                        SELIN 
            He'll want a boy you know. All Turkish men 
                                    want boys. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  You have boys?

                          No. Everything is fine. 
 
                  EXT. EMBASSY ENTRANCE - DAY 1. 1328 
 
  CLOSE ON: PC STEVE. Catches glimpse of masked raider 
  appearing from behind car - 
 
                                      PC STEVE 
                              (Grabbing his radio) 
                                        Shit! 
 
  PC STEVE just manages to hit the panic button on his 
  radio before SAM rips it off of him, and hits him - 
 
  His head jars back - blood spurts from his nose - 
 
  SELAMET and EBRU carrying ladders; SAKAR and CHALAK 
  emerge with rolls of cloth on their shoulders. 
 
  The three dark destroyers (SAM and his men) head straight 
  through front door. 
  LEYLA and her team race up behind them. The whole thing 
  is done with clear and obvious practised ease. 
 
  INT. TURKISH EMBASSY - RECEPTION AREA - DAY 1. 1329 
 
  Three MASKED-a-TEERS moving at speed- SAS style -- LEYLA, 
  SELAMET and EBRU deal with PC STEVE and a security guard. 
  Behind them, CHALAK and SAKAR, carrying black cloth, 
  struggle to keep up -- 
 
  On they move, up the beautiful marble staircase... 
 
    A security guard emerges from doorway - 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 19
 

  SAM renders him unconscious with a single blow. LEYLA 
  steps over him as on they go, signalling to SAKAR to 
  barricade the front door... 
 
  INT. TURKISH EMBASSY - DINING ROOM - DAY 1. 1330 
 
  Waiter offers ZOE champagne -- ZOE goes to accept, but 
  then finds SELIN's look of concern. Declines the offer. 
 
  The main doors burst open -- SAM -- LEVI -- VICTOR the 
  first to enter -- Crashing -- Guns in hand -- pumping 
    adrenaline -- Everything executed as loud and as quickly 
  as possible -- 
 
                                        SAM 
            Get on the floor! On the floor now do it! Do 
                                      it now! 
 
  CLOSE ON: ZOE expertly grabs her mobile from handbag then 
  drops her handbag and kicks it as far across room as she 
  can -- 
 
                                        VICTOR 
                                      (Booming) 
            Everyone get on the floor - Get on the floor! 
 
  (SCREAMS) 
 
  ZOE -- professional calm - without looking -- punches in 
  numbers -- 
 
                                        SAM 
              GET ON THE FLOOR. DO IT! DO IT NOW! MOVE! 
 
  ZOE hits send ---

  EXT CLOSE ON: SAM s Heckler and Koch -- his balaclava - 
 
  ON TO -- VICTOR UPS KOCK SEMI AUTO -- masked face -- 
  handgun - LEVI - same weapon - same mask - 
 
  ZOE has no pockets for her mobile - but SONAY does. She 
  begins to play the terrified hostage, grabbing SONAY for 
  comfort, while slipping her mobile into his pocket- it s 
  aerial just poking up out of his pocket. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 20
 

  SONAY is too busy shitting himself to notice, or be of 
  any comfort. 
 
                                        SONAY 
                                    Oh my god! 
 
  LEYLA, CHALAK, SAKAR, SELAMET and EBRU rush in, dragging 
  PC STEVE, security guards and waitress -- 
 
  ZOE now confused - 
 
  Five unmasked terrorists? - AK 47s in hand. SAKAR throws 
  down rolls of cloth - SELAMET and EBRU drop holdalls - 
  open them up - explosives inside --- 
 
  EXT CLOSE ON: ZOE. Oh shit! 
 
  SAM picks out SONAY, drags him away from ZOE - 
 
  ZOE can only watch. Observe the scene. Take it on board. 
  Ignore the fear and panic that has gripped her fellow 
  diners and is trying to grip her. 
 
  INT. THAMES HOUSE, THE GRID - DAY 1. 1332 
 
  DANNY closes the box - it s done. He sees HARRY still 
  busy behind his desk -- time to leave -- he strides up 
  towards pods, as HARRY exits his office. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                We just got a flash message from Zoe s 
                                      mobile. 
 
  DANNY quickly turns on his heels. 
 
  INT. TURKISH EMBASSY - DINING ROOM - DAY 1. 1333 
 
  SAM and his men violently divide up room. Men one side, 
  women the other -- VICTOR rains down blows on SONAY -- 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                      (Kurdish) 
                        Leyla! What are they doing? 
 
                                        SONAY 
                                      Aghhh!!! 
 
                                        SAM 
                              Hands on heads --

  LEYLA is not in control -- and her men know it -- 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                I will do this. 
                                    (to LEYLA) 
                                        Leyla! 
                                  (back to SAM) 
                  This is not your fight, this is... 
 
                                        SAM 
            Til  we re out of here, stay out of my way. 
                                Is that clear? 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                    (Broken English, loud and proud) 
                                    OKAY OKAY! 
 
  LEYLA steps into the centre of the room. 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
                              (shouts in English) 
                We are soldiers of the Kurdish Freedom 
                  Fighters. If just one person tries to 
                sabotage our actions, we will all die. 
 
  Every Turk in the room suddenly becomes passive. This 
  takes SAM and VICTOR by complete surprise. 
 
  LEYLA has the controls. 
 
  INT. THAMES HOUSE - HARRY S OFFICE - DAY 1. 1335 
 
  HARRY and DANNY transfixed by computer screen. An 
    annoyingly masked image being sent by a camera in ZOE s 
  mobile phone - from SONAY s pocket. 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
                                      (Muffled) 
            Do as we say and you will come to no harm... 
 
  HARRY s phone and the Grid come alive with technological 
  activity. DANNY visibly concerned. HARRY assesses his 
  options. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Get Tom and Tessa in here. In twenty minutes 
            COBRA will be looking to us for answers, and 
            having to publicly explain to the cabinet why 
                    we re in there might be a little 
                                    embarrassing.

                                        DANNY 
                                What about Zoe? 
 
                                        HARRY 
            We ll tell the Turkish we got a tip off from 
            an unreliable source, but thought it best to 
                put an officer in there just in case. 
 
                                        DANNY 
              If the terrorists get her, she ll be the 
                              first person they... 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      I know. 
                                        (BEAT) 
            All the more reason to get you and Tom down 
              there. Scotland yard and the SAS will want 
              that building wired for sound. You already 
                          know the rough lay out. 
 
  DANNY goes to leave, dissatisfied. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
              Danny? Of all the people in that room, Zoe 
                    will know how to handle herself. 
 
  DANNY rushes off. 
 
  EXT. TOM S HOUSE - DAY 1. 1337 
 
  TOM sucking as much oxygen into his lungs as possible. 
  His hands resting on his knees -- he s outside his house 
  about to go in, when mobile rings. Doesn t want to get 
  it. But does. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  (Into phone) 
                                        Danny? 
 
  INT. THAMES HOUSE, THE GRID - DAY 1. 1338 
 
  DANNY in front of computer screen. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                  This is coming in from Zoe s phone. 
 
  DANNY flicks a switch on his phone - 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
                          My name is Leyla Bakuri.

  INT. TURKISH EMBASSY - DINING ROOM - DAY 1. 1339 
 
  LEYLA is head of this class! 
 
  In the background, SELAMET and EBRU take a corner of 
  cloth each then run towards wall and up ladders without 
  stopping and with Cirque du Soleil-style acrobatics -- 
  Black cloth rolls out and rises up wall - SAKAR pulls out 
  staple guns and throws one each to SELAMET and EBRU! 
 
  CLOSE ON: ZOE clocking the stunning action!! 
 
                                        LEYLA 
            Today the people of the world will not close 
                it s eyes to the genocide of my people. 
 
  Pan around Turkish faces - 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
                No longer will we suffer in silence or 
                tolerate oppression and we will not be 
              humiliated, and we will, we will fight for 
            the future of our children! We however are 
          not animals and wish you no harm. But we will

              It s your birthday, Matthew? I can't make 
              excuses for you. I did that for her father 
              and all we got was more lies and excuses. 
 
  TOM. Pow!! 
 
                      ELLIE (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)

            The police negotiator s only concern will be 
          how they can secure the safe release of every 
            hostage in that building, including Zoe. But 
            they need to understand who they are dealing 
                with, what they want and what they may

              The Kurdish were promised an independent 
            state by the Allies at the end of the First 
                World War. In 1923, the British Foreign 
              Secretary - and major shareholder of an oil 
            company - discovered the amount of oil in the 
                    area, and the treaty was suddenly 
              renegotiated. The Kurdish lost out to Iran, 
              Iraq and Turkey. Now they find themselves 
                  unwanted guests of these countries. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Yes, yes, but that s all in the past. The 
            point is that the Turks are as patriotic as 
              the British - even more so. They are not 
            about to give back their lands as easily as 
                      the Kurdish feel they should.

            She hardly has an impressive track record. 
                    Certainly nothing on this scale.

            They re an oppressed people. I d say they re 
                minded to use whatever tactic they deem 
              necessary to bring their cause to a world 
                                        stage.

               Suicide bombings  have so far not been a 
                          tactic they ve employed.

                          Try to be calm, for him. 
 
  LEYLA, unsettled by the distress of SELIN and the horror 
  on OZAN s face, nevertheless opens the balcony doors as 
  SAKAR and CHALAK lift OZAN, the chair and the explosives 
  out...

  ...onto the balcony. 
 
  Down below - people are being evacuated from all 
  buildings in the street. 
  SO19 officers - one sits perched high up in a tree - all 
  pointing guns in their direction. 
  SAKAR freezes, but CHALAK sticks his arm up into the air. 
  He is clearly holding a detonation device.

  JOHNNY MARKS  CV. 
 
  Scrolls down his CV, starting with his Middle Eastern

  Farsi, Urdu, Turcoman and Pushtu - as she continues 
  scrolling down, we see JOHNNY s photo, together with a 
  deceased date (the same as Helen s file earlier). TOM and 
  DANNY exit meeting room - TESSA shuts off her screen -

                They usually let the women out first. 
 
          TOM and DANNY stride off - TESSA goes back to 
                                      JOHNNY. 
 
  In listening booths, officers are busy jotting down every 
  Kurdish word they hear... JED struts in and takes sheets 
  of paper from each officer.

                We re checking with all our agents and

            Why would you be interested in Johnny Marks, 
                    in the middle of a bloody siege? 
 
  TESSA. Caught Red handed. But still cool as a cucumber.

                          He was our man in Iran.

                                Is that right?

                  He worked in the middle east for us,

                                        HARRY 
            The only person Johnny Marks worked for was 
            himself. He procured information and sold it                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 34
 

            to the highest bidder. Anyway how does this 
                  help us, he died fifteen years ago. 
 
  TESSA hands HARRY the screen grab from the CCTV. 
 
                                        TESSA 
                He became sympathetic with the Kurdish 
              people, grew close with a Kurdish mountain 
            tribe. They probably helped him move through 
                the mountains from country to country. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Johnny Marks betrayed the entire British 
              intelligence community and most of the Arab 
              states. When he was done with them he tried 
                  dealing with the Irish, big mistake. 
                              (Handing back Photo)

                  The man in that car is Johnny Marks.

                                    (Leans in) 
              I identified his remains. What little was 
                                  left of him. 
 
                                        TESSA 
              It s him. I know it s him. At the Embassy. 
                                Today. He s back.

              Marks for Christ s sake. He worked it all 
            out. He knew the British Government wouldn t 
            pay him direct. He also knew if he found the 
            bank we used as a cover to pay agents, that 
              information alone would be worth a fortune.

              Our people. Raped. Murdered. Our children 
            denied their heritage. We have nothing, but 
              we do have everything to fight for. This, 
            you, the Turkish, call it terrorism. I call 
                  it war and it s one worth dying for.

                                        LEYLA 
          What are you talking about? The world s media 
          is out there right now, discussing our cause. 
              Your people are listening. We have already 
                            won a great victory. 
 
                                        ZOE

                As you can see, we have not hidden our

  WELKS, by his side, panic rising to the surface.

                      You gave him the swift codes. 
 
                                        ROGER 
            They were going to kill her. What else could 
                                        I do? 
 
  In the background, TOM is escorted through an open-plan 
  glass fronted office by NICK and MIKE. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      Given them the wrong numbers. 
 
                                        ROGER 
          They took her with them and said if I came to 
            you they d kill her. Now what are you going 
                                to do about it? 
 
  TOM joins the party. ROGER becomes even more agitated. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        What the hell is going on? 
 
                                        ROGER 
            I can t do this. If they find out I m here... 
            How could you let this happen? Jesus Christ, 
                          she just... She just... 
 
  ROGER is about to blubber. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Right now this man is your only hope of 
                                seeing her alive. 
 
  ROGER takes a breath, finds TOM s questioning eyes. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                      (to TOM) 
            Roger here manages a bank. A bank we use to 
              pay all of our agents, around the world. 
            Until today we thought only three people knew                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 49
 

            where it was located, myself, Roger and the 
            director of five. Now one other knows, Johnny 
                                        Marks. 
 
                                        TOM 
                Johnny Marks - I thought he was dead. 
 
  On TOM as this sinks in. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Roger? 
 
                                        ROGER 
                                    (a wreck) 
                The MOD credits our bank. We credit the 
            accounts of agents working for five and SIS. 
            To protect the agent from any form of trace, 
            we use swift codes. They allow us access to 
            credit or debit the accounts of the MOD and 
              the agents accounts with protected ease.

                                  ROGER (V.O.) 
              Swift codes are keys that unlock the bank 
                                      accounts. 
 
  SAM starts up banks of computers. 
 
                            ROGER (V.O.) (CONT D) 
              If someone obtained these codes and knew 
              where the main computer was, he could not 
                  only transfer millions of pounds -

  On HARRY. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            He could trace the personal details of every 
            single undercover service agent MI5 and MI6 
            use. If the next world war comes down to who 
                knows what about whom, we ve just lost. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    And Johnny Marks has the codes. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 50
 

                                        HARRY 
            He managed to find out the location of the 
            bank and he s got the swift codes. He saw an 
                opportunity with the Kurds, and now he s 
            taken it. If Johnny Marks accesses that bank, 
            he will pose one of the biggest threats to 
                  national security we have ever faced. 
 
                                        TOM 
            The three guns for hire are working for him? 
 
  TOM getting the picture. 
 
                                        ROGER 
                And my bank is five doors down from the 
                                Turkish Embassy. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        This whole thing s a cover. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              This is our business. No one else needs to 
              know. If Johnny Marks gets into the MOD s 
                accounts, he ll get the names of every 
              informant and spy this government has, and 
          with that goes years of intelligence down the 
              drain. Now that really would be a tragedy, 
            and one you and I will not walk away from. 
                  You get in there and you stop him.

            demand the immediate release of Pejan Bakuri,

            Prisoners, not hostages, that would imply we 
          are terrorists. You have one hour to meet our

                Many Turks are on your side. Even the

              Turkish Government definitely has something 
          we want. So, the Turkish government will free 
              the Kurdish prisoners in exchange for the 
                          lives of our prisoners.

  CHALAK, who has hold of the string, is looking through

                                        SELIN 
            Please help him. He is asthmatic! Please, he 
                              needs an inhaler. 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                  Shut up woman! 
 
  LEYLA shoots a withering look at CHALAK. 
 
                                    TOM (V.O.) 
            If anything happens to him, the Turkish will 
                give us nothing. Let us bring over the 
            medication he needs. No one needs to come in, 
            you just have to take it and give it to him. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
            You will bring the medication, no one else.

              You really want to know? I was pregnant. 
 
  First time JOHNNY has looked surprised all night. He 
  checked the room, the photos, there were definitely no

                  Found out -- a few weeks after they 
            discovered your body. I let it grow in me -- 
                and-- I've never felt so whole since. 
                              (Lets it sit on him) 
                          I had your life, in me.

                              (Killing memories) 
              A girl. That's twice you broke my heart. 
 
  Tears build in TESSA's eyes. JOHNNY moves in to hold her. 
  TESSA fighting back the tears. A gentle hand greets 
  TESSA's tear. 
 
  PHONE RINGS - TESSA answers it - 
 
                                  TESSA (CONT'D) 
                                  It's for you. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                                  Come with me. 
 
  JOHNNY moves to the phone - Answers it - Looks out window

  Standing with an army of agents - 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              Long time, Marks. 
 
  JOHNNY replaces handset - turns to TESSA. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                          Did you give her a name? 
 
                                        TESSA 
                                        Yes. 
 
  JOHNNY makes his way out - 
 
  TESSA Stands at window... 
 
  EXT. TESSA S STREET - NIGHT 1. 2223 
 
  JOHNNY and HARRY in middle of the street. 
 
  Blues and twos surround them. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              Outstanding effort. 
 
  HARRY holds out his hand. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
            I m not done yet. You see, you created me. 
          You trained and manipulated me, just like the                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 71
 

            west manipulates entire countries, and then 
            acts so shocked when they turn round and rip 
                        off the hand that fed them. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      (Bored) 
                              Who was in the car? 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                                  My brother. 
                                      (Whispers) 
                    Your people killed the wrong man. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                I really don t know what you re talking 
                                        about. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
            Three thousand agents  names and addresses. 
            All of them out there trying to affect the 
              course of world events. Why? Because this 
            tiny island can t stop trying to punch above 
                                it s own weight. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Did you really believe you could get away 
                                    with this? 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                I already have. I ve got a lot of money, 
            Harry, and all of it is yours. You know the 
                      part I m really going to miss? 
                                      (-BEAT-) 
            The part where you have to try and explain 
                        away fifteen million pounds. 
 
                                        HARRY 
          You and I both know you are not going to walk 
                                away from this. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
              How much are three thousand agents  lives 
            worth to you? You willing to sacrifice all 
                those people, for just little old me. 
 
  HARRY's smug grin slides slowly off his face. 
 
                                JOHNNY (CONT'D) 
                        I walk. You get the names. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 72
 

                                        HARRY 
                            How can I trust you? 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                  Because I have never broken my word. 
 
  HARRY smiles politely - then steps aside -- Johnny 
  strides past - HARRY grabs him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Neither have I. Know this. I always do my own 
                                    dirty work. 
 
  HARRY has just confessed to killing JOHNNY s brother. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
          If one of those names is ever revealed I will 
                    not make the same mistake again. 
 
  Johnny strides off... 
 
  INT. TESSA S APARTMENT - NIGHT 1. 2224 
 
  TESSA at window. 
 
  JOHNNY and HARRY face to face in street below... 
 
  TESSA looks down and sees a floppy disk in the centre of 
  the coffee table, picks it up - looks back to see if he 
  has gone... 
 
  JOHNNY MARKS has gone... 
 
  INT. TOM S HOUSE - LOUNGE - NIGHT 1. 2225 
 
    Painfully, TOM takes a seat - pours himself a glass of 
  wine - Then becomes aware there is someone in the room. 
 
  Maisie is half asleep. She walks over to the dining room 
  table and scoops up present and card then waddles over to 
  Tom and places the card and present on his lap. She sits 
  by his side, snuggling into him. Instantly she is asleep. 
  Gently he strokes her head. 
 
  Ellie is in the doorway - watching - 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              You fixed it then.

                                        TOM 
                                      Kind of. 
 
  ELLIE holds out her hand. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              My mother always said, everything looks 
                            better in the morning. 
 
  A smile shared. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              I hope she s right.
