WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT
Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking"
tables.
A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door.
HIGH CONSTABLE
He will be burned pursuant to
statutes of health.
ICHABOD
I could determine if he were dead
before he went into the Hudson.
HIGH CONSTABLE
Must we again hear these heretical
rantings?
MAGISTRATE
Yes, must we?
ICHABOD
There is nothing heretical about
science, sir.
The Chinese have
written on it for hundreds of
years... procedural study used to
solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.
The door is opened.
The corpse again leads the way.
WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- NIGHT
A two-tiered prison, alive with MOANS of AGONY and CRIES of
INSANITY.
Cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron
gags.
Many are against the bars, watching.
ICHABOD
Our first night watch is adequate
against fire and some violence,
but if we were more often able to
ensure justice, after the fact,
then criminals would truly have
something to fear from law
enforcement.
HIGH CONSTABLE
Have they nothing to fear presently?
ICHABOD
Without disrespect, look around you.
(motioning to cells)
We overflow.
As do our courts.
HIGH CONSTABLE
And, with disrespect, Constable,
if jails and courts overflow, it is
testimony to success, not failure.
ICHABOD
But, how many innocents rot here?
And, how many victims are buried
without reprisal while guilty men
roam our streets?
The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat.
Guards
wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.
HIGH CONSTABLE
Very few, if any.
ICHABOD
Even though I have seen confessions
pried from the lips of the accused,
often quite literally?
HIGH CONSTABLE
For one who calls himself a
Federalist, your mouth reeks of
Republican liberalism.
ICHABOD
Not Liberalism.
Equanimity.
MAGISTRATE
(to High Constable)
Um, sir... might I suggest...
The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear.
Ichabod
notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the
corpse onwards into another room.
The Magistrate finishes.
The High Constable smiles faintly.
HIGH CONSTABLE
(to Ichabod)
There is a farming community
upstate, Constable... ten days
journey north in the Hudson
Highlands.
It is named Sleepy
Hollow.
Within a fortnight, three
persons have been murdered there.
Each with their head lopped cleanly
off.
(holds up papers)
The elders of the Hollow have sent
dispatches to me, requesting
assistance, and now, just this very
moment, I have chosen you.
ICHABOD
Chosen me?
HIGH CONSTABLE
These "methods" of yours... there
has been no practical application.
ICHABOD
Not for lack of trying.
HIGH CONSTABLE
Just so.
Granted.
And so you take
your experimentations to Sleepy
Hollow and catch the murderer who
has tainted the place.
Bring him
here to face our good justice.
Will you do this for me?
ICHABOD
(swallowing doubt)
I shall, gladly.
HIGH CONSTABLE
Excellent.
Then, you are excused
till morning.
Ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.
HIGH CONSTABLE
Oh, and, Constable...
(off Ichabod's look)
Do make certain that you meet with
success.
Otherwise... perhaps you
should not come back at all.
The High Constable smiles a sardonic smile.
WATCHHOUSE, INCINERATION ROOM -- NIGHT
The corpse burns in a raging furnace.
Flesh sizzles.
Constable One pumps bellows which fan the flames.
Ichabod
steps from darkness nearby.
He watches with bitter regret as
the corpse is consumed.
ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY
Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and
jars of chemicals.
Charts of anatomy above a small bed.
ICHABOD (o.s.)
Such a day for such a sad farewell.
But, this is goodbye, my sweet.
At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL
inside.
He opens the cage.
The bird flies free.
Ichabod watches it go, then looks down.
A COACH halts in the
street below.
The forlorn DRIVER looks up.
ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY
In motion.
Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the
strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of
tissue.
Many scars.
Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.
VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY
MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN
spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN
BRUNT.
A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.
Brom releases the
woman.
Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
This is such a silly game.
BROM
Be a sport and stop complaining.
The woman moves to Brom's voice.
He backs away, flanked by
peers GLENN and THEODORE.
Children laugh.
Ichabod enters, clearing his throat.
No one notices.
The
blindfolded woman keeps grasping.
One LITTLE GIRL sees
Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.
LITTLE GIRL
Play along.
You must.
She tugs him.
Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in
the blindfolded woman's grip.
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
There, I have someone.
Am I
finished?
LITTLE GIRL
You have to tell who it is.
The woman touches Ichabod's face.
He is uncomfortable,
affected by this caress.
Brom watches jealously.
LITTLE GIRL
At least make a guess.
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
I don't know.
Is it Brom Bones?
BROM
Certainly not.
ICHABOD
Excuse me, Miss...
(takes her hands)
They have a laugh at your expense.
She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty:
KATRINA VAN TASSEL.
Ichabod tries to compose himself.
KATRINA
Forgive me, I didn't know.
ICHABOD
I... I am looking for Baltus Van
Tassel.
BROM
We haven't heard your name yet,
friend.
ICHABOD
Well, unless your name is Baltus,
you should not worry over mine.
Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed.
Ichabod's baffled.
BROM
You need some manners.
KATRINA
Brom!
Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod.
MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
What is this, then... ?
BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class
aristocrat.
LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of
home-spun wife and well-kept lady.
BALTUS
Can I help you, sir?
Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.
Children
gather around Katrina and hide behind her.
ICHABOD
I have been sent from the city
with a letter of introduction.
I am told you offer me room and
board.
Ichabod hands over papers.
Baltus reads, furrows his brow.
ICHABOD
If we could speak alone.
BALTUS
(nods, looks to Katrina)
This is not a time for frivolity,
Katrina, is it?
Am I mistaken?
KATRINA
They're only children, father.
Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod.
The others huddle to
gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to
watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY
DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by
the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders.
A pretty
servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel
sets down food.
Ichabod is standing.
BALTUS
That will be all, ladies.
(waits as they exit)
We are joined by Doctor Thomas
Lancaster, Constable.
And to his
left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and
our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse,
both keeping order in their own ways.
PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in
mouth.
CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a
constant look of disapproval.
BALTUS
I myself am in charge of financial
matters and the regulation of
currency in our commonwealth.
And,
lastly, this fine fellow is James
Hardenbrook, our Notary.
HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.
ICHABOD
An honor, gentlemen.
In time I
will need every detail of the
three murderings you've had, but,
for now, I ask only if you have
any theory at all as to who the
killer might be?
DOCTOR LANCASTER
Excuse me?
ICHABOD
I say, is there any one person
suspect in these acts?
DOCTOR LANCASTER
I was afraid of this.
Philipse shoots a look to Baltus.
Angst amongst the elders.
PHILIPSE
Well, Constable... are you aware...
to be honest, you are not what we
expected.
We sent for the militia.
ICHABOD
The militia?
FATHER STEENWYCK
Why not tell us what you have heard?
Hmm?
How much have your superiors
bothered to tell you?
ICHABOD
All I know is three are slain, their
heads found severed from their
bodies...
FATHER STEENWYCK
The heads were not found severed.
The heads were not found at all.
Withered Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.
HARDENBROOK
Taken.
Taken by the Headless
Horseman.
Taken back to hell.
ICHABOD
Pardon me?
BALTUS
You have not been well informed of
our troubles, sir.
If you would...
Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit.
Baltus lights his pipe.
BALTUS
The Horseman... he was a Hessian
mercenary, sent to our shores by
German princes to help keep
Americans under the thumb of
England.
However, unlike his
compatriots who came as muscle in
trade for currency, he came
willingly.
For love of carnage.
FLASHBACK -- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD -- DAY
The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory,
close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged
weapons.
He cuts down Americans left and right.
BALTUS (v.o.)
He was infamous for taking his
horse, Daredevil, hard into
battle... chopping off heads at
full gallop.
He dismounts, hoisting a battle axe.
With sword and axe, he
annihilates.
Blood gushes.
Bones crack.
BALTUS (v.o.)
Just to look on him made your
blood run cold, for he had filed
down his teeth to rapiers... to
add to the ferocity of his
appearance.
The Horseman lets out a war cry.
Jagged teeth.
Grotesque.
FOREST BATTLEFIELD -- DAY
Winter.
CANNONS can be HEARD BOOMING from afar.
Daredevil
lies dead in red snow.
FOLLOW FOOTPRINTS away...
BALTUS (v.o.)
He would not finally meet his end
till the winter of seventy-nine,
when New York City was held by
Henry Clinton and Washington
occupied West Point.
It was
between those two places, not far
from here...
The Horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by FIVE rag-tag
REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS.
Ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents
escape.
Soldier one aims a rifle and FIRES...
Blood explodes from the Horseman's arm as he runs.
His sword
falls from his now functionless hand.
Soldier Two grabs the sword.
At the rocks, the Horseman faces the men.
Another Rifleman
raises his rifle.
The Horseman reaches over his shoulder to
grasp a sheathed knife, THROWS --
THOCK!
The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.
The Horseman readies an axe.
The Revolutionaries move in
with swords.
They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL.
The Horseman
fends off blows from all sides.
Soldier Three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the
Horseman's side.
The Horseman roars, brings his axe DOWN...
BREAKS the sword at the hilt...
An UPWARDS stroke sends Soldier Three head over heels in a
fountain of blood.
The Horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from
his ribs.
The remaining soldiers close in.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT
Pipe smoke wafts from Philipse's mouth.
PHILIPSE
Cut off his head with his own sword.
It's a legend told for twenty years.
BALTUS
But, only recently has the Headless
Hessian been seen prowling the
Hollow, in search of a head to suit
his shoulders.
ICHABOD
Just a moment...
(sits back, incredulous)
Are you saying it is he?
HARDENBROOK
(aggravated, loud)
When a goblin leaps from the nether
world, others follow.
Poltergeists
of the air, water and earth follow
and cheer his desecrations!
Hardenbrook BANGS his cane on a table.
Baltus puts a calming
hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
No one knows why he chose to now to
climb out from his grave.
FATHER STEENWYCK
It is very clear why.
Citizens
here have long tried to hide sins
behind closed doors.
Their failed
faith has saturated the soil and
called forth one of Satan's own.
ICHABOD
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who
has seen this Horseman?
BALTUS
Many have.
ICHABOD
Then, name one person who has seen
him with their own eyes.
A long wait.
No reply from the elders.
Ichabod rises.
ICHABOD
While I will do everything I can
to find your assassin, I will look
for a man of flesh and blood.
Not
some goblin-demon from hell.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK.
KATRINA (v.o.)
You will dream.
Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed.
Ichabod is nervous.
KATRINA
Did they tell?
It is something in
the air so that dreams come to
everyone.
According to the elders,
an Indian prophet held powwows here
before the land was taken, and
spells cast then still linger to
this day.
ICHABOD
Do you often make a habit of
sitting on strange men's beds?
KATRINA
You are horribly old-fashioned,
aren't you?
ICHABOD
Feel free to form your own opinion.
(facing his ledger)
Though it appears you already have.
KATRINA
Well, I intended to apologize for
the behavior of my friend Brom Van
Brunt, but it seems I've made
matters worse.
(getting up to go)
I'll leave you to your business.
ICHABOD
Excuse me... I should apologize.
I,
um... I... have no great love of...
KATRINA
Other people?
ICHABOD
Small talk.
KATRINA
It might have been more.
Might have
been positively grand talk.
Ichabod offers his chair, backing away.
Seeing it is the
only one, he remains standing.
Katrina sits.
KATRINA
Is it me, or are you this nervous
around all women?
ICHABOD
Perhaps it is because your suitor's
hands were recently very nearly
wrapped around my throat.
KATRINA
My suitor?
ICHABOD
The massive fellow... Brom.
For
someone you call "friend," he
misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
KATRINA
He has proposed to me twice.
ICHABOD
Which may explain his temperament.
To have asked twice means the answer
was "no" at least once.
Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.
KATRINA
I've read a great deal about your
New York City.
Do be a dear and tell
me all about it.
Sounds like an
extraordinary place to live a life.
ICHABOD
Extra ordinary, yes.
But first, you
tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Ichabod leans on a dresser.
Katrina's still seated.
KATRINA
Not all think it is the Horseman.
Many say witches come from the
Western Woods to steal skulls for
their cauldrons.
Some believe a
person in this very town kneels
before Lucifer, offering death as
tribute.
And, still others believe
none of it.
ICHABOD
Are you so superstitious?
KATRINA
To call a person superstitious is to
imply they fear magic, but not all
magic is black.
ICHABOD
There is no such thing as magic.
KATRINA
Really?
Then... what is your
rebuttal to those romantic poets
claiming proof of magic in a rose at
full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
ICHABOD
Poets have silly notions about
plants and bodily secretions.
KATRINA
(laughs)
You are funny.
Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.
The DISTANT
TOLL of a BELL is HEARD.
Katrina looks fearful.
She goes to open a window.
The BELL TOLLS...
Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN.
A coffin on
a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby.
ICHABOD
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
DOCTOR LANCASTER
To place it inside its coffin.
Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.
He puts the horseshoe into a
hoofprint in the dirt.
It fits.
Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.
Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.
Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.
Huge.
He compares the
horseshoe.
The hoofprint is much larger.
Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl,
bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water
and powder with a fork to make plaster.
The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.
Brom
comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated.
BROM
What the hell are you doing?
ICHABOD
(ignoring pause)
You are the blacksmith.
Ever shod
a horse with a hoof this large?
BROM
Never.
A shoe that size I would
have remembered.
Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.
ICHABOD
Van Ripper.
Can you show where the
body lay?
VAN RIPPER
I can show exactly.
Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.
Ichabod rises to
follow with his satchel.
VAN RIPPER
Here... in front of this oak, facing
north.
Horrible...
ICHABOD
To the best of your recollection,
where did the open wound fall?
Van Ripper points.
Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER
from his pocket.
He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on
the dirt there, then waiting.
A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.
ICHABOD
There was not much blood, was there?
VAN RIPPER
I didn't see none.
Ichabod stands, puzzled.
He walks to the coffin cart,
rolling up his sleeves.
Others come to watch, but keep
distance.
Ichabod removes the blanket...
Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse.
Philipse can't look.
Ichabod takes strange spectacles from
his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.
MAGNIFICATION
SPECTACLES.
He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.
He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.
ICHABOD
No bleeding.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
What is that?
ICHABOD
This should have bled by the pint.
Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh.
How... ?
Whatever weapon was used...
it cauterized somehow....
Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.
ICHABOD
It instantly burnt the wound shut.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY
Dining room.
Sarah and two other servants collect plates.
A
few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE
and two kids.
Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something
his also-drunk wife says.
IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly.
FURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke.
Young Masbath
is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving...
ICHABOD
I am not here for revenge.
I am
here to bring justice.
YOUNG MASBATH
Whatever.
You still need a second
to tend to your things.
ICHABOD
I manage fine alone.
YOUNG MASBATH
I deserve to help you.
Don't you see
how much this means?
My father...
he... he was a good man...
ICHABOD
(faces Masbath)
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your
loss.
It is a great and sad tragedy.
However... I cannot be the one to
look after you now.
YOUNG MASBATH
(angry)
I did not ask you to, did I?
Young Masbath exits.
Ichabod remains impassive.
DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING
Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.
There's an inch-long
WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.
Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.
Lancaster watches,
anxiously mopping his face.
Young Masbath's in a corner.
Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.
ICHABOD
What is the common thread between
these victims?
YOUNG MASBATH
I'm sure I don't know.
ICHABOD
We must discover it.
The reason the
murderer chose these persons.
Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.
ICHABOD
The wounds are the same.
Cauterized.
No chopping or half-measures either.
One stroke took the head.
Have you
seen, doctor... ?
(pointing to it)
Even the spinal bone... sliced as
smooth as butter.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
I do not care.
You are welcome to
use my work area, but I beg you...
return her to her resting place.
ICHABOD
In time, doctor.
Soon as I finish.
Ichabod picks up an iron knife.
He looks to Young Masbath.
ICHABOD
You should step outside.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Ichabod sleeps, dreaming...
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY
A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us.
A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Ichabod!
Ichabod... come along.
The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.
He runs.
We FOLLOW
to a clearing behind a frontier home.
MOTHER waits.
Lovely
woman.
She kisses him.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Dark.
Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.
Across the
room, Mother has her back to him.
She's WHISPERING something
to no one.
She turns...
Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.
A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.
Mother exits.
Ichabod gets up,
curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.
It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern
with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.
Young Ichabod
replaces it, closes the drawer.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY
A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.
Young
Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.
Father stops
to examine tools.
Young Ichabod stays by him, but something
captures his attention...
Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a
FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.
They shout.
People stop to watch.
Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT
LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.
THUNDER BOOMS.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Ichabod jerks awake in his bed.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.
He sits,
studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT
Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight.
She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter.
ICHABOD
Sorry for disturbing you.
I thought
a forgotten candle was burning.
Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with
another on her lap and covers them.
KATRINA
You do not disturb me.
Please stay.
Having trouble sleeping?
ICHABOD
May I ask... why do you cover your
book that way?
KATRINA
You pay great attention to small
things.
I hide these as I hide all
my books.
Father would not approve,
lest it were the Bible.
ICHABOD
I, um... I have something to show you,
if you have a moment.
Ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.
KATRINA
These are strange... may I?
She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.
She
touches the many evenly spaced scars.
KATRINA
These scars.
How did you get them?
ICHABOD
I have had them since childhood.
I
cannot remember what from.
KATRINA
It would be interesting to find out.
Their eyes meet.
Ichabod gets back to the ledger.
Katrina
seems to relish the effect she has.
Ichabod finds a paper
disk on string, illustrated thusly:
ICHABOD
Here it is.
A bird on one side.
His cage on the other.
Now,
stare at it.
(spinning it)
The bird seems to be in his cage.
KATRINA
Yes, he does.
May I try?
Ichabod gives it.
She spins it, smiling.
ICHABOD
He only appears to be inside the
cage.
The point being...
KATRINA
You made this, and the drawings?
ICHABOD
Yes, but listen.
The illusion is
easily explained.
The eye retains
each image, till they combine.
And
yet, some would call this toy magic.
KATRINA
Don't you see why?
Look closely a
moment.
Put your intellect aside.
(spinning it)
Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Ichabod watches it spin.
He shakes his head, unimpressed.
KATRINA
Oh, you are hopeless.
May I keep
it at least?
ICHABOD
If you want.
But...
KATRINA
Then, I also have a gift for you.
True magic which even you will not
be able to deny.
She hands him a book.
"ROMEO AND JULIET."
Ichabod stands,
offering it back, but she will not take it.
ICHABOD
Thank you.
No.
Here...
KATRINA
I insist that you have it.
ICHABOD
(resigned, leaving)
Very well.
But, it will only sit
gathering dust.
KATRINA
That would be a pity.
Those words
might show you something you've never
seen before.
Ichabod stops at the door, looks back.
He exits.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT
Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks.
Sarah stands behind
with a tray of food.
Young Masbath is seated near.
LADY VAN TASSEL
(to Young Masbath)
Has he not come out at all?
Young Masbath shakes his head.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
KNOCKING is HEARD.
Ichabod sleeps restlessly.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
THUNDER BOOMS.
WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window.
Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young
Ichabod in bed.
MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.)
Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY
A keyhole.
Young Ichabod's eye peers in...
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE
Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor.
She draws
patterns in it, whispering.
She blows the flour away.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY
The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the
home, supported by a SAD MAN.
She weeps, carrying something
in a blanket.
Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.
The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls.
The blanket
opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt.
The
Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT
TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach.
She looks back,
fearful, pulled along.
A THIRD MAN in black follows.
Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him.
YOUNG ICHABOD
No... mother... no... !
The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish
man with a villainous face.
FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
The night of the great storm, I saw
her cross my windows.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY
Many people in the gallery.
The Third Man stands in front of
the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box.
THIRD MAN
You are certain it was she?
FREAKISH WOMAN
In the lighting, I did see her.
(points)
Her.
Lady Crane...
Mother sits in shackles.
FREAKISH WOMAN
I will never forget.
The next moment,
I found my infant dead... with the
blood welt on his breast.
Those in attendance cry out at this.
Ichabod is seated
beside Father, eyes filled with tears.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
As before, a STORM RAGES.
Ichabod is in Mother's arms.
FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
The night of the great storm, I saw
her cross my windows.
MOTHER
Don't be afraid...
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY
KNOCKING is HEARD.
Ichabod gasps awake.
KATRINA (o.s.)
Constable Crane?
Ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists.
He opens them
-- has ONE HALF of PHILIPSE'S TALISMAN in each palm.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Katrina holds a tray of food.
The DOOR is HEARD UNLOCKING.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Katrina enters.
Ichabod sits at his work table.
KATRINA
Are you hungry?
Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up.
Katrina crosses.
She begins picking up pieces of the PLASTER HOOFPRINT CAST
which lies shattered on the floor.
KATRINA
You promised justice.
ICHABOD
If these are the random stalkings of
a monster, what good am I?
KATRINA
People have put their trust in you.
ICHABOD
They have done nothing of the sort.
KATRINA
Won't they still have that justice?
(patience waning)
Or, was it a vain promise?
Ichabod stews, head in his hands.
Someone is HEARD
RUNNING... Young Masbath enters, frightened.
YOUNG MASBATH
Constable Crane... something has
happened.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY
A DRAWING of the Lenape's WOVEN PIECE in Ichabod's ledger.
The piece lies near.
Ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like.
Masbath waits.
Long silence.
ICHABOD
The Lenape Indian had much to tell
once I opened his mouth.
YOUNG MASBATH
How could he?
ICHABOD
His teeth.
Someone had cut them and
chipped off rotten pieces far back
in his mouth.
The Lenape could not
have done that for himself.
(closes his journal)
Someone out there cared for him.
Ichabod rises, deciding.
He picks up his satchel and exits.
Young Masbath is surprised.
He follows.
WINDMILL -- DAY
Ichabod and Young Masbath enter via a ladder from the
underbelly.
Gears and counter wheels turn millstones.
A few
men work in the grain powder filled air.
Ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.
YOUNG MASBATH
Where are we going?
ICHABOD
Up.
CAVE HOME -- DAY
Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.
Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed
grass in patterns.
An OLD CRONE sits facing away.
The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey
features, sits disinterested.
Ichabod edges closer.
ICHABOD
Pardon.
You did not answer when I
knocked.
Are we intruding?
OLD CRONE
You are from the Hollow?
ICHABOD
In a way, yes.
Ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and
acorns.
Knifes, scissors, yellow bones.
He takes the
Lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.
ICHABOD
The Lenape who lived in these woods...
do you know him?
The Redman?
(uncomfortable wait)
I should tell you... he has been
murdered.
OLD CRONE
Leave me.
You are not welcome here.
The old Crone places something on a table beside her -- a
dead cardinal, bright red.
Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the
woven piece and steps to the Crone.
YOUNG MASBATH
Were you a friend to the Indian?
(waits)
You should have this... if you were
his friend.
Young Masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal.
He
walks to join Ichabod in leaving.
OLD CRONE
You seek remedy against the Horseman?
The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving.
She stands,
faces them.
Tall.
Ichabod nods.
OLD CRONE
(to Young Masbath)
Go out and keep away, child.
(to Ichabod)
You stay.
Follow with me.
The Old Crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.
CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY
The Old Crone comes through a passage in the wet walls.
Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.
OLD CRONE
I hear him.
He rides to the Hollow
and back.
ICHABOD
The Horseman.
Yes.
OLD CRONE
Sit.
Ichabod sits on crooked stool.
The old Crone kneels with her
back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.
ICHABOD
Can you help?
OLD CRONE
You want to see into the nether world...
I can show you.
Whatever you see, do
not move or speak.
I will hold him.
She gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.
ICHABOD
What... what are you doing?
OLD CRONE
(turns, furious)
Close your mouth!
Keep silent.
She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from
one.
She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and
upends it.
A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.
The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its
head.
She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES,
guttural.
Using a wick, she lights the straw.
She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these
onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.
OLD CRONE
He comes now.
Ichabod would like to leave now.
CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY
The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod.
She
does not move.
Wind howls through a hole/window.
Rain.
Candles blow out.
Ichabod stands, worried.
ICHABOD
Excuse me... um...
She remains motionless.
The STORM outside intensifies.
WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in
the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.
Some thing Ichabod cannot see.
He inches closer.
ICHABOD
Are you alright... ?
The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human,
half-demon CREATURE.
Its black clawed hands reaching.
Ichabod recoils, crying out.
Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back.
Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.
The
creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.
It SCREECHES.
The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood
red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.
CREATURE/OLD CRONE
You seek the warrior bathed in
blood... the Headless Horseman.
Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature
claws the rock floor, yearning.
CREATURE/OLD CRONE
Follow the Indian trail to where the
sun dies.
Follow to the tree of the
dead.
The creature pulls, testing the chains.
Behind, the BOLT
holding the chains to the wall slips.
The wall cracks.
CREATURE/OLD CRONE
Climb down to the Horseman's soulless
place and let loose his silent
shrieking.
Do you hear?
Do you hear?!
Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast.
He glances to the exit.
The chain bolt gives more... coming loose...
CREATURE/OLD CRONE
He who holds fast the Horseman's
desire will guide his reaping hand.
Catch hold of his desire.
Ichabod bolts for the door.
The creature HOWLS, leaping...
The chain bolt breaks...
Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor...
It is the Old Crone who landed on him.
She has returned to
human form, semi-conscious.
Ichabod shoves her off.
DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
Ichabod examines the Crone's neck wound with magnification
spectacles.
Young Masbath is seated, ledger in his lap.
ICHABOD
The wound is neither smooth nor
cauterized, but jagged.
She bleeds
like a fountain.
Ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts.
ICHABOD
She did not go quietly.
DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT
Doctor Lancaster wrings his hands.
His WIFE rocks nervously
in a rocking chair.
The CROWD outside ROARS as a bonfire
lights up the curtained windows.
The front door is POUNDED open.
ANGRY MEN enter.
Lancaster
stands, lips quivering.
He points insistently to a door.
DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
Angry men break in.
Ichabod looks up.
ANGRY MAN
Step aside, Constable.
Step aside...
Ichabod is shoved aside, spectacles knocked off.
The group grasps the Crone.
Masbath stands on his chair,
clutching the ledger.
Ichabod grabs one man.
ICHABOD
What are you doing?
The man slams Ichabod back.
Magnification spectacles are crushed under foot.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.
FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.)
The night of the great storm, I saw
her cross my windows.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY
Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.
We are
back in the court where Mother stands trial.
FREAKISH WOMAN
In the lightning, I did see her.
(points to Mother)
Her. Lady Crane... I will never
forget it.
The next moment, I found
my infant son was dead, with the
blood welt on his breast.
The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN.
THIRD MAN
You have heard it.
The blood welt
is the mark of Satan's touch.
As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father,
who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT
In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table.
Father stares into his food.
YOUNG ICHABOD
She was with me, father.
FATHER
Nothing can be done against them.
YOUNG ICHABOD
She was with me that night.
Father doesn't even look up.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT
Empty church.
Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.
A
soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle.
YOUNG ICHABOD
May I see her?
The soldier exits through a white door.
Young Ichabod waits,
looking up at the vast church.
The white door opens and the
Third Man steps out.
THIRD MAN
Go home.
YOUNG ICHABOD
May I see my mother?
THIRD MAN
You do not want to be here.
Go home
to your father.
YOUNG ICHABOD
She did not do it... please listen...
THIRD MAN
She is guilty.
YOUNG ICHABOD
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
THIRD MAN
She has confessed.
YOUNG ICHABOD
No.
THIRD MAN
She has admitted to her evil and
signed a written confession.
Do
you know what confession is?
(off Ichabod's nod)
All that is left for you now is to
pray for her soul.
The Third Man leaves through the white door.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
Young Ichabod buttons his shirt.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING
Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not
understanding.
Father loads a wagon full of belongings.
FATHER
We are leaving.
(long pause)
She has gone away.
Realization comes to Young Ichabod.
He runs, away across the
lawn as Father calls after him.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING
Young Ichabod runs, weeping.
THIRD MAN (v.o.)
She has confessed.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING
Empty.
Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters.
He
goes down the aisle, towards the white door.
THIRD MAN (v.o.)
She has admitted to her evil and
signed a written confession.
YOUNG ICHABOD
Mother.
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING
Young Ichabod enters, halting.
The room contains TORTURE
DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.
THIRD MAN (v.o.)
Do you know what confession is?
He walks, numb, eyes locked forward...
In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron
spikes.
Hundreds of spikes.
It is fitted with straps for
holding down the "accused."
Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face.
He kneels, hands on
the spikes of the chair, pressing hard.
As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes.
He sits up, bringing
his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks.
His hands trail
blood. He looks to them...
The old scars are bleeding.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT
Katrina comes to the door.
Ichabod is seated by the fire,
eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth.
KATRINA
Constable Crane?
Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair.
ICHABOD
Allow me some time.
I have spent
every hour in the company of others.
I need to be alone.
KATRINA
What troubles you?
She moves in front.
Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit
facing away.
Katrina takes the chair he deserted.
KATRINA
The things I said to you before...
I was wrong to say them.
ICHABOD
No, actually, you were not.
Every
word you spoke had truth in it.
KATRINA
What has happened?
Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed.
ICHABOD
Lady Van Tassel... she is your
stepmother, isn't she?
She bears so
little resemblance.
KATRINA
What?
ICHABOD
She is not your birth mother, is she?
KATRINA
No, but... why do you ask that?
ICHABOD
What happened to your mother?
Is she
still alive?
KATRINA
She died.
Her lungs were diseased...
two years ago.
What is this about?
ICHABOD
Memories have come back.
I had them
forgotten, and wish I could forget
them again... but they are here now.
(pause)
Lord, how I hate this place.
KATRINA
If you want me to go, I will.
Do you
want me to leave?
ICHABOD
I... I do not know.
I no longer know
what I think or what I feel.
Katrina walks to him.
She touches his back.
KATRINA
Why are you so afraid of that?
Is
there truly such harm in uncertainty?
She kneels, smiles a little for him.
She reaches to touch
his face, holds his head in her hands.
Leans to kiss him.
He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms
around her.
They kiss passionately.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING
Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand.
He looks down the
hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase.
AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door.
He bends,
slipping the white rose under the crack of the door.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
Small home.
Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper.
Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.
THOMAS
May I be excused, father?
KILLIAN
Do you deserve to be?
THIRD MAN
(shyly)
I think so.
KILLIAN
(smiles)
Then, go.
Thomas gets down from his chair.
He goes to the fireplace to
light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.
KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a
lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with
silhouettes of lions and monsters.
Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the
creatures, shadows are thrown.
He roars for them, imagining
them real and having a grand time.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
Beth comes for more dishes.
BETH
Don't pick teeth.
You teach Thomas
bad habits.
Killian pulls her to him, playful.
KILLIAN
I am a bad habit.
There's nothing
for it.
BETH
(kisses him)
No one knows better than I.
KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.
In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in
the wall.
Then, another spider skitters out.
More follow.
KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else.
He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all
directions. Thomas is amused.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost
imperceptibly.
Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform
again, shifting.
WIND HOWLS.
KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
Beth enters, looking at Thomas.
BETH
What are you doing there?
The magic lantern stops spinning.
Shadow creatures freeze.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.
Killian looks up.
CREAKING STOPS.
The HOWLING WIND is LOUD.
KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY
Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points.
THOMAS
Spiders.
Beth bends to see the swarming spiders.
She looks up,
noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
Killian stands, looking up.
The HOUSE CREAKS again, then
suddenly the WIND CEASES.
Silence.
KILLIAN
Beth...
KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY
Beth picks up Thomas.
The magic lantern creatures begin
spinning anew, all around.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
With a ROAR, the fire flares.
Killian looks.
WHHOOOSH the fire shoots up the fireplace.
Gone.
Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS.
The Horseman
steps in, a battle axe in each hand.
WIND BLASTS...
The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.
Killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman.
The Horseman swings, smashing it aside.
KILLIAN
Beth... run!
KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
Beth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away.
KILLIAN (o.s.)
(from kitchen)
Get out!
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
Killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to
fend off a blow from the Horseman.
The Horseman swings the other axe.
Killian ducks.
The axe
cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks.
Killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman.
The skewer comes through the Horseman's back.
The Horseman
swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside.
Killian hits the wall, bashing his head.
Hits the floor.
KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it.
He
goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back
the axe in the other...
KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY
At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the
cellar.
Thomas is crying.
BETH
Don't let him get you.
THOMAS
Mommy...
BETH
You hide now... go...
Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.
The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in,
carrying Killian's severed head.
Beth shrieks.
The Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern.
KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY
Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF.
Her BODY is HEARD
HITTING the floor above.
Thomas crosses the cellar,
stumbles.
He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow
propped against the wall.
FOOTSTEPS are HEARD.
KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY
The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a
sack, cinching the sack shut.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle
axe he left.
He stands.
Pause.
KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY
Thomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer.
QUIET.
He tries to control his sobbing.
KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
The Horseman turns, falls to his knees.
He starts to chop at
the floor with both axes.
CHOPping,
CHOPping,
CHOPping...
making quick work of it...
KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY
A hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls.
Thomas looks up, terrified.
He gets up to run away...
The Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and
yanking him up.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Candlelight.
Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.
The wound at the top of his chest is raw.
Katrina inserts a
needle in the skin around it.
KATRINA
Lay still, Ichabod.
Do not move.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Doctor, he is awake.
Ichabod tries to sit.
Pain stops him.
Lady Van Tassel helps
bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a
SUCTION JAR of blood.
ICHABOD
(barely a voice)
What... what are you doing... ?
KATRINA
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Doctor Lancaster comes to the bed.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
Keep still, Constable.
You were
half-drowned when they found you.
ICHABOD
... Brom Bones...
DOCTOR LANCASTER
He is dead.
You would be also, if
your wound had not somehow shut.
ICHABOD
Bring Young Masbath here.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
You need to sleep.
ICHABOD
Bring him.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
You need rest.
Ichabod gives up, closes his eyes.
Katrina, needle in one
hand, brings her other hand to hold Ichabod's.
Blood drips into the suction jar.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT
Ichabod is soundly asleep.
Across the room, Katrina is at
his work table.
Ichabod stirs.
Katrina looks to him.
Once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what
she was doing, turning a page.
She is reading his ledger.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING
Ichabod's hurting.
Masbath helps with a shirt.
YOUNG MASBATH
Someone left last night.
Looked
like they headed to the square, but
I lost them in the forest.
ICHABOD
Man or woman?
YOUNG MASBATH
All I saw was their lantern.
ICHABOD
Business, best hidden is hidden best
at night.
Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.
YOUNG MASBATH
If someone has the Horseman's skull...
if they control the Horseman, then why
haven't they sent him for your head
yet?
ICHABOD
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive.
It is perfection for our murderer if I
return to New York City with nothing
more than tales of a galloping ghoul.
(pause)
We must uncover the reason these
victims were targeted.
What was taken
from them... other than their lives?
Who benefits by their deaths?
Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.
It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.
ICHABOD
Damn it.
Ichabod kneels, pained.
A trail of the blood-detecting
powder has spilled.
The bottle is out of reach.
YOUNG MASBATH
I'll get it.
Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod
stops him, peering under.
ICHABOD
Wait...
Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.
Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain.
Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side.
Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD.
Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.
Masbath is
about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips.
Ichabod moves to lock the door.
YOUNG MASBATH
(whispers)
Who did this?
Ichabod does not answer.
He picks up a wash basin and dumps
the water to wash the Pentagram away.
NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY
Tidy room.
Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of
paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook.
ICHABOD
Do you have these persons' wills?
HARDENBROOK
I have everything... last testaments...
birth certificates, death certificates...
deeds.
ICHABOD
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.
HARDENBROOK
Certainly... certainly.
Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.
Ichabod
stands waiting.
Hardenbrook is still nodding.
ICHABOD
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
HARDENBROOK
Hmm?
See them?
ICHABOD
May we look at them now?
HARDENBROOK
Of course.
You want them... it shall
not take long.
Wait here.
Hardenbrook heads across the room.
Ichabod offers the list.
ICHABOD
Maybe you should take this.
HARDENBROOK
A fine idea.
Hardenbrook takes it and exits.
Young Masbath sits.
YOUNG MASBATH
What good is this?
ICHABOD
To discover what might have been taken
from those who died, it will help to
know what was there that could be
taken in the first place.
Ichabod waits.
After a moment, he looks uncertain.
He
crosses to the half-open door...
NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY
Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.
Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray.
Tables, shelves,
and baskets of unevenly piled documents.
Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,
lifting papers, mumbling.
HARDENBROOK
Damn... damn... damn...
ICHABOD
Master Hardenbrook...
Hardenbrook turns, a bit startled.
ICHABOD
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
HARDENBROOK
Well... that might be... helpful.
NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY
Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.
Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents,
with Ichabod focused on one will in hand.
YOUNG MASBATH
My father had farm land.
It was the
only thing we owned of any value.
ICHABOD
(still reading)
And it now belongs to you, according
to Baltus.
I heard him say it.
YOUNG MASBATH
Yes.
Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.
ICHABOD
Then look here at your father's will,
and tell me why you are not listed.
Young Masbath takes it, boggled.
Ichabod grabs another.
ICHABOD
Van Garrett had denoted his elder son
in his last wishes; the same son
murdered along with him.
But Van
Garrett's wife and two infant children
are not written... and they were spared.
(picks up another will)
Do you see?
Philipse had no family to
bestow his farm to.
But, here...
(picks up another)
The Widow Windsor was listed on her
late husband's will.
After her
inheritance, she amended the document
to include her bastard child.
This is
why the Horseman made absolutely
certain to impale the unborn descendant.
Ichabod sits back.
ICHABOD
Only the heirs were killed.
Proof that
the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
YOUNG MASBATH
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole
it away?
ICHABOD
No one yet, far as I can tell.
It has
gone intestate.
YOUNG MASBATH
In test... what?
ICHABOD
Intestate.
Your farm... all the
farms... they belong to no one.
YOUNG MASBATH
What does it mean?
Ichabod stares off.
ICHABOD
Often in such cases, property which
has gone intestate legally passes to
whomever the deceased was indebted to.
And, who in this town is owed a great
many debts?
YOUNG MASBATH
(realization)
Baltus Van Tassel.
ICHABOD
Did your father take a loan?
YOUNG MASBATH
Yes.
I rode with him on payment days.
Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.
ICHABOD
Tonight, we answer questions.
And, to
discover who moves about the Van Tassel
house after dark... all we need is a
candle.
A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room.
Ichabod looks.
HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY
Ichabod bursts in.
No one there.
A chair has been knocked
over and the front door is ajar.
Ichabod moves...
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY
Young Masbath is seated, bored.
Ichabod writes in his
ledger.
A KNOCK on the door.
They both look up.
KATRINA (o.s.)
(from outside door)
Constable... are you there?
(long pause)
Ichabod?
The knob is tried and found locked.
Pause.
At the bottom of
the door, a red rose is passed under.
This saddens Ichabod.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting.
Ichabod
takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock.
Midnight,
straight up.
Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.
ICHABOD
Midnight seems an appropriate time.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious.
They move to
the nearest door.
Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the
door and door frame.
He's making a low, wax seal.
If the
door opens, the seal will break.
They move to a second door, quietly.
Ichabod makes another
low wax mark.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.
Ichabod
continues his wax marking at each door.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT
Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.
Ichabod
walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound
DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath.
Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these "LOAN
AGREEMENT" parchments.
Ichabod brings another pile.
ICHABOD
(whispering)
They are alphabetical.
Young Masbath has the M's.
"MARYIE," "MEGAPOLENISIS," AND
"MELYN..." Not finding what he wants.
YOUNG MASBATH
There is no Masbath here.
My father's
loan papers are missing.
ICHABOD
(regarding his documents)
There are none for Magistrate Philipse
either.
"Paasch, James" "Pieter,
Thomas" "Pos, William."
A FLOORBOARD CREAKS.
Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.
He and Young Masbath stand frozen.
Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then
continues.
A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.
Ichabod
crosses to follow, pointing back.
ICHABOD
Keep looking.
Then, hide in my room
and bolt the door till I return.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Young Masbath unlocks the door.
Ichabod enters.
YOUNG MASBATH
I was getting worried.
Who was it?
ICHABOD
Lady Van Tassel.
YOUNG MASBATH
What was she doing?
ICHABOD
Something I really wish I had not seen.
Never mind it.
Did you find the
victims' loan agreements?
YOUNG MASBATH
No.
They are all missing.
This troubles Ichabod.
YOUNG MASBATH
There is more, though.
While you were
gone, I could hear someone else
walking through the house.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Ichabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner.
Going to the
LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing...
ICHABOD
(whispers, to himself)
Katrina.
The wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT
Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax
marks.
Young Masbath finds one broken.
YOUNG MASBATH
Here.
Ichabod comes over, pushes the door...
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
They enter.
The kitchen is empty.
Ichabod crosses to
another door, crouches.
Another broken wax mark.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT
They enter... the room with the elaborate loom.
Ichabod
moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.
He touches the top of a candle.
His finger comes away with a
bit of still wet wax.
YOUNG MASBATH
There are no other doors.
This is as
far as she could have gone.
ICHABOD
It is nothing.
She comes to read books,
so her father will not find her.
(to convince himself)
It is absolutely nothing.
YOUNG MASBATH
What books?
ICHABOD
Fiction plays and novels.
Baltus does
not approve.
Now, come.
It may not be
long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
YOUNG MASBATH
But, sir... what books?
Where are they?
Ichabod stops, looking around.
No books anywhere.
YOUNG MASBATH
If there is a secret place for books...
it could be just as good for the
missing loan agreements.
Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT
SEARCH MONTAGE:
- Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.
- Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.
- Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.
- Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of
sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.
Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.
Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.
Young Masbath crawls, doing the same.
He climbs under the
loom, tapping on the floor.
TAP... TAP... TAP...
He crawls further under the loom.
TAP... TAP... PLONK.
A
hollow sound.
He taps again... PLONK... PLONK.
YOUNG MASBATH
Constable.
Ichabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board.
Under the floor, there are piles of books.
Masbath brings
them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines.
Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.
He comes up
with "LOAN AGREEMENTS."
YOUNG MASBATH
Fie!
Here they are.
Ichabod takes them.
Names are near the top: "Masbath," "Van
Garret," "Philipse," and "Killian."
Ichabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING
Lady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open
fireplace/oven.
Ichabod enters, rushed.
ICHABOD
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina
is not in her room.
LADY VAN TASSEL
No.
She has gone out.
ICHABOD
Where?
LADY VAN TASSEL
She has taken the last of our grain
to be milled.
(crossing to him)
You do have a background in the
medical arts, don't you, Constable?
ICHABOD
Very little.
I must be going...
Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Will you look at this?
I cut my hand
this morning: I sewed it myself, but
I am afraid it will go bad.
Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.
ICHABOD
It appears well.
It has already
clotted.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Look closer.
Do you have anything to
clean it with?
ICHABOD
It is fine.
Now, I must...
Lady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight.
LADY VAN TASSEL
(whispering, close)
I know you saw me.
ICHABOD
What... ?
Lady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.
LADY VAN TASSEL
I know you followed last night.
You
must promise not to tell Baltus...
Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.
The FRONT
DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING.
Ichabod is panicky.
LADY VAN TASSEL
Have mercy on me.
Please... have mercy.
Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters.
Lady Van Tassel
goes back to work as if nothing happened.
BALTUS
Constable, it is urgent that we speak.
CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING
IN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families.
Pews filled with
bedding and belongings.
Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE
DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry.
FATHER STEENWYCK
You are astonishing, Constable.
Do
you truly think your ridiculous
accusations frighten me?
Ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.
ICHABOD
Only if I repeat them outside this
room.
And, I will if I must...
(points to doors)
Out there, for all to hear.
Or...
you may speak, as planned.
But, you
tell them you feel compelled to move
on to greener pastures.
FATHER STEENWYCK
No.
You will not run me out.
No one
will believe a word of what you say.
ICHABOD
Oh?
Far as I can tell, a rumor does
not travel alone for long here.
FATHER STEENWYCK
Are you a deist?
Is that it?
A free
thinker who does not believe in
divinity.
ICHABOD
It is only important what you are.
An adulterer...
FATHER STEENWYCK
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
ICHABOD
Wallowing in sin and lust...
FATHER STEENWYCK
They need guidance.
ICHABOD
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
FATHER STEENWYCK
(snapping, quaking)
Damn you, sir!
God damn you to hell!
ICHABOD
He may.
But, not soon enough for
you, and not on your behalf.
Ichabod walks.
Steenwyck is humiliated.
ICHABOD
You are so upset now... and yet, you
seemed in such good spirits last night.
FATHER STEENWYCK
You cannot do this.
I am a man of God!
ICHABOD
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder
you can find, Father.
That is the
closest you ever come to God.
CHURCH -- DAY
Pews are packed.
Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar.
EVERYONE QUIETS.
Steenwyck has composed himself, barely.
FATHER STEENWYCK
My friends... dear friends.
Those of
you still on your farms, I thank you
for coming.
He sees Ichabod near the back.
THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE.
FATHER STEENWYCK
I... I address unfortunate business.
(pause)
I am forced to take my leave from
Sleepy Hollow.
I will be moving on to
do the Lord's work elsewhere.
The GATHERERS MURMUR shock.
Ichabod walks out.
CHURCH -- DAY
Baltus makes his way in, shoving.
People are still clamoring
in through the doors.
Men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at
boarded windows.
Women herd children into a cellar.
Baltus searches for a hiding place.
He looks across the
church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living
quarters.
Baltus moves...
BALTUS
Steenwyck!
At the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and
Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed.
It's madness.
People outside begin pounding.
Katrina searches.
KATRINA
Father!
Ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.
CHURCH -- DAY
Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked
citizens.
He sees Katrina moving up the aisle...
She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to
Steenwyck's room.
BALTUS
Damn you, Steenwyck!
Help me!
Let me in!
RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing.
CHURCH -- DAY
Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows
to follow the Horseman.
Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade.
Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER
grips Baltus angrily and throws him...
HUGE FARMER
You'll kill us all!
Baltus falls, knocking over pews.
Katrina's nearby.
HUGE FARMER
You're the one the Horseman wants.
Why should we die for you!?
KATRINA
NO!
The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving
Katrina aside as she approaches.
Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them.
CHURCH -- DAY
The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again.
HUGE FARMER
Get out!
Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the
church, shouting.
Ichabod struggles to push them off.
ICHABOD
Stop this!
Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect.
ICHABOD
The Horseman cannot enter!
It does
not matter who he wants, he cannot
cross the gate!
At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out.
ONE RIFLEMAN
He's coming back!
More panic.
The huge farmer moves towards Baltus.
HUGE FARMER
We have to save ourselves!
Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing.
BALTUS
No!
Get away from me!
CHURCH -- DAY
Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol.
BALTUS
The next person to lay hands on me
will have a bullet.
Stand off!
KATRINA
Father...
BALTUS
No!
We're safe here.
(points at Ichabod)
You said it.
The Horseman will not
have me.
CRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window,
trailing rope tied to it...
CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point
bursting out his breast bone.
Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with
both hands.
Blood streams out his mouth.
Katrina screams.
The rope yanks Baltus back.
He SLAMS into the WINDOW...
SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS -- DAY
The storm has passed.
Empty forest.
Long, peaceful pause,
till Ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.
Ichabod comes to look down a small hill.
The corpse of Lady
Van Tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.
Ichabod walks to the body.
Lady Van Tassel's arm is twisted
behind.
The sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.
ICHABOD
(shouting back)
Here!
I have found her...
(looking at corpse,
quiet and miserable)
Here she is.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL -- EARLY EVENING
Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep.
He
closes the door, wipes his sweaty face.
Ichabod waits.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
It has been a terrible jolt to her
nerves.
ICHABOD
You will stay at her side?
Doctor Lancaster nods.
Ichabod walks.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
Ichabod packs up baggage.
Young Masbath is miserable.
YOUNG MASBATH
Won't you change your mind, sir?
What can I say to convince you?
ICHABOD
Nothing.
To hell with this place
and all the people here.
Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.
YOUNG MASBATH
Why... why are you like this?
ICHABOD
(pause, softening)
You do not know all that has happened.
(pause)
You cannot understand.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
The door is pushed open.
Young Masbath enters, looks around
the empty room.
He goes to sit in a chair at the work table,
crossing his arms and resting his head.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT
A plate of food sits untouched.
Katrina is slumped down in a
chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.
Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.
ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT
Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.
The window
between him and the driver slides open.
VAN RIPPER
Sir... this is yours.
(offering something)
The Van Tassel girl said to give it
to you after you were gone.
Ichabod takes it.
It is the bird/cage spinning toy.
He
studies it.
What melancholy.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
Katrina sits with her eyes closed.
A BOARD is HEARD
CREAKING.
She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind
her as she turns.
WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.
Young
Masbath takes notice.
He moves to the door...
ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT
Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.
The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird
appears to be inside the cage.
Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.
A tear rolls down his cheek.
The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.
Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans
forward to the window at front.
OUTSIDE THE COACH
Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.
ICHABOD
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
VAN RIPPER
What did you say?
ICHABOD
Turn around.
Now!
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT
Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly.
YOUNG MASBATH
Hello?
Katrina?
Masbath starts down a hall.
He does not see, in another
room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor.
DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT
Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his
door.
Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.
ICHABOD
Pardon the intrusion...
DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
Ichabod enters.
There are two coffins on the floor.
ICHABOD
I never examined these bodies.
Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.
Lancaster is about
to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
... help yourself, you pompous ass.
I will be in bed.
ICHABOD
Would you stay, doctor?
I may need
assistance.
Lancaster reluctantly remains.
Ichabod stares at the dead
Lady Van Tassel.
The neck wound is covered by a stained
brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps.
ICHABOD
Stains of blood.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
What of it?
Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the
magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.
ICHABOD
Jagged flesh.
(pause)
The Horseman did not do this.
Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand
with the stitched gash on its palm.
ICHABOD
Here, Doctor.
Hold this just so...
Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut
through it.
Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his
satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.
THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.
ICHABOD
No clotting or gathering of pus.
No
healing at all.
DOCTOR LANCASTER
What?
ICHABOD
When this cut was made, this person
was already dead.
(stands straight)
This is not Lady Van Tassel.
VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
Young Masbath enters.
The door swings shut.
YOUNG MASBATH
Katrina.
(steps forward)
Is anyone here?
Behind him, the door SLAMS open -- Lady Van Tassel reaches to
grab Young Masbath by the throat.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door...
slams it.
He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits.
The door buckles.
YOUNG MASBATH
It won't hold.
Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.
He
struggles to roll it.
Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.
It falls
on top with a thud.
The Horseman's sword jabs up through the
grindstone's center hole.
The sword withdraws.
A POUNDING begins.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
POUNDING CONTINUES.
The grindstone shifts.
Katrina and
Young Masbath back away.
Ichabod holds his lantern up,
desperate for ideas, searching.
Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is
ground and bagged.
To the left is the crooked staircase.
Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming.
He gives
his lantern to Katrina and points.
ICHABOD
Get up those stairs.
Open the door to
the roof and wait.
Katrina and Young Masbath obey.
Ichabod crosses and climbs
the ladder to the milling platform.
He grasps a wooden
lever, pulling it.
Gears above begin to turn.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
Katrina looks down from the stairs.
The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.
KATRINA
Ichabod...
ICHABOD
Keep climbing.
I will follow...
Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of
the milling platform.
ICHABOD
(under his breath)
Hopefully.
ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the
door to the roof.
BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled
grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.
He grabs one open bag and dumps it.
More grain dust.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through,
trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.
The
RACKING axe continues.
Won't be long.
Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with
effort, throws...
The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.
More and more dust rises.
Below, the Horseman enters.
Katrina shouts from above.
YOUNG MASBATH
Look out!
The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,
but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...
The Horseman just misses the final rung.
Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.
Ichabod looks to the staircase.
No way to climb down from
the milling platform and get there.
The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...
The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging...
Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...
Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.
The rail creaks, about to break.
Behind, the Horseman lands
on the milling platform.
Ichabod is losing grip.
Young Masbath races down the stairs,
grabs his hand.
He pulls Ichabod up.
Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.
Ichabod and Young Masbath look...
The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the
milling platform and leaps...
Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and
Masbath.
Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...
The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.
Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
The Horseman continues up.
The lantern falls past.
WINDMILL -- NIGHT
The lantern hits the ground and shatters.
FLAMES EXPLODE!
Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR
upwards, filling the windmill...
Engulfing the Horseman.
