Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.
CREDITS begin.
FRAN (SINGS)
Ah, such fleeting paradise
such innocent delight
to love,
be loved,
a lullabye,
then silence.
The song finishes.
Applause.
They're the entertainment at a
cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.
Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A
distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,
approaches Ripley, offers his hand.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
RIPLEY
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
(pointing at Ripley's borrowed
jacket)
I see you were at Princeton.
Then you'll most likely know our son,
Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
EMILY GREENLEAF
We couldn't help noticing your jacket.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Yes.
EMILY GREENLEAF
Class of '56?
RIPLEY
(hesitating)
How is Dickie?
Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
his share of their fee.
RIPLEY
Gotta run. I'm so late.
(he hands Fran's boyfriend the
jacket he's been wearing)
Thanks for the jacket.
BOYFRIEND
Sure.
Thanks for filling in for me.
From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.
EMILY GREENLEAF
Darling couple, aren't they?
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Yes.
An exceptional young man.
From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.
Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
heads for the theater. Music continues.
Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.
A
huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers
preparing the shell of a new liner.
If Central Park is where
the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.
And a
lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name
over the buildings behind them.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.
Marge, his uh, the young lade is
supposedly writing some kind of book. God
knows what he does. By all accounts they
spend the whole time on the beach. Or his
sailboat. That's my son's talent,
spending his allowance.
Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a
sober young man, listens attentively.
HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)
Could you ever conceive of going to
Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?
(Ripley looks doubtful)
I'd pay you.
I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
RIPLEY
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,
but...
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.
He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's
chauffeur.
CHAUFFEUR
Here.
I'll take that.
RIPLEY
Thanks.
CARETAKER
(nodding towards the apartment)
That thousand bucks should come in handy.
RIPLEY
Yes, sir.
CHAUFFEUR
(interupts Ripley, who is
about to open the car door)
I'll get that.
RIPLEY
Thanks.
CHAUFFEUR
(as he holds open the door for
Ripley)
Sir.
(Ripley laughs excitedly)
You're gonna have a great trip.
Mr
Greenleaf is personal friends with the
Cunard people.
The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.
END CREDITS.
A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a
cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.
And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side
there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men
working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the
street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on
their Vespas. The Driver chants -
DRIVER
MONGIBELLO!
Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on
its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.
A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops
the sail.
A couple dive off and swim towards shore.
ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's
watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony
in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched
on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,
mouthing the Italian words.
RIPLEY
(looking at a long, lean girl
about to dive)
La fidanzata a una faccia.
The fiance
has a face.
La fidanzata e Marge.
Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,
beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:
"BIRD".
RIPLEY (cont'd)
Questo e la mia faccia.....
The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the
water, grins.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
This is my face.
He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la
faccia di Dickie.
Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on
the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY
LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys
turn laconically and watch him.
Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels
ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.
Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes
and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness
of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up
to Dickie.
RIPLEY
Dickie Greenleaf?
Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.
DICKIE
Who's this?
RIPLEY
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at
Princeton together.
DICKIE
Okay.
(he sits up)
And did we know each other?
RIPLEY
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must
have known me.
DICKIE
(to Marge)
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a
fog.
(to Ripley)
This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what
was it?
RIPLEY
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
MARGE
How do you do.
DICKIE
What are you doing in Mongi?
RIPLEY
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
DICKIE
(finds this idea absurd)
Passing through! You're so white. Did you
ever see a guy so white, Marge?
Gray,
actually.
RIPLEY
It's just an undercoat.
(Marge laughs)
DICKIE
Say again?
RIPLEY
You know, a primer.
DICKIE
That's funny.
He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.
Ripley
stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.
MARGE
You should come and have lunch with us,
before you go - Dickie?
DICKIE
Sure.
Any time.
MARGE
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in
danger of turning a little pink.
RIPLEY
Thanks. Well, a coincidence.
ANOTHER DAY.
Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in
shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square
on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.
RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches
all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,
SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then
climbs on the scooter, behind him.
DICKIE
I've been looking for you everywhere.
SILVANA
Ah, today you're looking for me.
And
where have you been the rest of the week?
Pig.
With your American girl?
I hate
you, you know?
DICKIE
What?
SILVANA
I hate you.
And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards
the sea.
Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of
the remnants of lunch.
Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.
DICKIE
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,
I'm a swine.
MARGE
Did you forget where I live? It's four
o'clock.
DICKIE
I just woke up.
I'm sorry.
MARGE
You just woke up!
DICKIE
Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we
were fishing, and then it was dawn and
we'd caught absolutely nothing.
MARGE
Well, we ate everything without you.
DICKIE
We?
MARGE
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.
DICKIE
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We
thought you'd disappeared. We were going
to send out a search party.
RIPLEY
No, still here.
MARGE
Tom was telling me about his trip over.
Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
DICKIE
Is that good?
MARGE
Shut up!
Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,
excluding Tom.
RIPLEY
I'm intruding.
DICKIE
Can you mix a martini?
RIPLEY
(hesitant)
Sure.
MARGE
(going inside)
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
DICKIE
Everybody should have one talent.
(to Ripley)
What's yours?
RIPLEY
(without a beat)
Forging signatures. Telling lies.
Impersonating practically anybody.
DICKIE
(enjoying this banter)
That's three. Nobody should have more
than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
RIPLEY
Now?
Okay.
Wait a minute.
Talent -
(his voice ages, his face
changes)
The only talent my son has is for cashing
his allowance.
DICKIE
(absolutely thrown)
What? What's this?
RIPLEY
I like to sail, believe me, I love to
sail! Instead I make boats and other
people sail them.
DICKIE
(incredibly impressed)
Stop! It's too much!
You're making all
the hairs on my neck stand up!
RIPLEY
(relishing it)
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an
insolent noise.
DICKIE
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the
old bastard is here right now!
That's
brilliant!
How do you know him?
RIPLEY
I met him in New York.
DICKIE
Marge! You've got to hear this!
MARGE
(returning with the drinks)
What?
What?
DICKIE
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf
1st.
RIPLEY
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a
fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
MARGE
What's going on?
DICKIE
Uncanny!
MARGE
I don't get it.
RIPLEY
Could you ever conceive of going there,
Tom, and bringing him back?
DICKIE
What?
RIPLEY
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and
persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you
$1000.
A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm
in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
scheming.
DICKIE
I'm never going back. To actually hire
somebody to come all the way here to drag
me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
he?
SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.
DICKIE (cont'd)
I'm never going back!
RIPLEY
No, I think your mother, her illness -
DICKIE
It's got nothing to do with my mother!
She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
makes me boil about him! HE wants me
back! - it's got nothing to do with my
mother.
RIPLEY
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
you what I -
DICKIE
(interrupting)
Go back!
Go back to New York or call him
if you can find a telephone that works,
and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
back to him or his shipyard.
Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front
door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of
which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his
fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom
talking with Dickie.
MARGE
Hi Tom.
DICKIE
(looks up)
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
MARGE
I'll come down.
DICKIE
(to Ripley)
Did you speak to my father?
RIPLEY
You were right about the telephones.
There are no lines, there's some problem.
MARGE
(coming out of the front door)
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your
plans?
RIPLEY
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the
seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He
bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -
Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.
DICKIE
You like jazz!
RIPLEY
(gathering up the records)
I love jazz.
DICKIE
(holding up a Chet Baker)
This is the best. Marge says she likes
jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is
jazz.
MARGE
I never said that!
RIPLEY
Bird. That's jazz.
DICKIE
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -
RIPLEY
I don't know. What's the name of your
sailboat?
DICKIE
Bird!
MARGE
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,
everyone knows you can't call a boat
after a man.
RIPLEY
He's not a man, he's a god.
DICKIE
(excited)
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a
club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
MARGE
It's vile.
DICKIE
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't
have to come.
(to Ripley)
It's great.
You're going to love it.
Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
pants, his rings.
DICKIE
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
shows up for breakfast.
It's not love
it's the coffee machine.
MARGE
It's the one task Dickie can do on his
own - make coffee.
DICKIE
Shut up.
MARGE
Oh darling - is that for me?
DICKIE
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
RIPLEY
(as Dickie hands him his cup)
That ring's so great. The green one.
MARGE
(delighted)
Tom, I love you!
(to Dickie)
See!
(to Ripley)
I bought it for him, for his birthday.
RIPLEY
It's superb.
DICKIE
I had to promise, capital P, never to
take it off - otherwise I'd give it to
you.
MARGE
(flicking a crumb at him)
Bastard!
(to Ripley)
Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in
Naples.
I bargained for about two weeks.
DICKIE
I hope it wasn't cheap.
MARGE
Oh, it was.
RIPLEY
(to Marge)
I have to find a birthday present for
Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
MARGE
Frances?
RIPLEY
My fiance.
DICKIE
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
RIPLEY
Your parents met her.
DICKIE
Oh God - I can just imagine - if only
Dickie would settle down... doesn't every
parent deserve a grandchild?
Never! I
swear on your ring, Marge.
I am never
going back.
The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a
manoeuvre going on with the sail.
Captain Dickie supervises
his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please
Ripley.
Dickie goes over to help him.
RIPLEY
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
DICKIE
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor
of you yet. You're doing really well.
MARGE
Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing
Dickie's boat.
Alright, bar's open.
DICKIE
Yes please!
She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.
RIPLEY
Could we sail to Venice?
DICKIE
Sure.
I love Venice.
RIPLEY
I have to go to Venice.
DICKIE
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or
is it Rome? You do something and die,
don't you?
Okay, Venice is on the list.
RIPLEY
And Rome.
DICKIE
Do you ski?
(Ripley frowns)
Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
That's the next thing to deal with. We're
planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.
Excellent skiing. Excellent.
(as Marge reappears)
Marge - Ripley can't ski.
We'll have to
teach him that, too. Have you ever known
such low class?
MARGE
Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting
married. We might have to invite him on
our honeymoon.
Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down
the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the
little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.
MARGE
Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue
crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
book, and I was always going to this cafe
with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to
play his saxophone outside and I would
see him and he would see me, and he would
play My Funny Valentine. It was only
later that I realised he only knows about
six songs.
They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman
who owns the store greets them.
Silvana, who's her daughter,
is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's
order.
MARGE (cont'd)
(to Silvana, in Italian)
Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e
pane, e del prosciutto.
SILVANA
E fichi?
Come sempre?
MARGE
Si.
Come sempre.
Grazie.
Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.
MARGE (cont'd)
(back to Ripley)
Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see
Dickie, he starts playing My Funny
Valentine, and then all of a sudden he
just walks into the cafe, right in front
of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had
never spoken to him in my life - he said
I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want
you to come with me. So I did.
At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men
throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a
small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and
two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.
Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce
en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.
MARGE (cont'd)
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom
and I are running off together.
DICKIE
Okay.
Dickie and Ripley are leaving.
They're fooling around.
Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the
top of the garden.
Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's
grocery store.
Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's
tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.
SILVANA
Did you get my message?
I want to talk
to you.
DICKIE
I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.
And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him
then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.
Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains
speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.
DICKIE
You're breaking my ribs!
RIPLEY
What?
DICKIE
You're breaking my ribs!
An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
is used to it.
DICKIE
It is me. It's an old picture.
(sighs at Ripley)
Every time - 'is it you?
Doesn't look
like you'.
He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
with his initials prominently embossed.
Ripley watches him
sign and collect a large wad of notes.
CLERK
Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.
Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
holds up one letter to Dickie.
RIPLEY
Fran.
(anticipating her letter)
I miss you, where are you coming home?
Stop telling me what a great time you're
having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
and...
(the next letter)
And this one, I think, is your dad...
Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.
Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.
There are
already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of
Frascati.
Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly
impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the
duration.
RIPLEY
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,
or can we hire any of them - ?
DICKIE
Relax.
RIPLEY
It's just there's so much to do in a
single day.
DICKIE
Relax. The most important question is
where to eat. I hope Freddie made a
reservation.
RIPLEY
Freddie?
DICKIE
Freddie Miles.
You know - he's
organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A
horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his
open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and
bustles over.
He's a heavy-set American with a reddish
crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is
delighted.
DICKIE (cont'd)
Frederico!
FREDDIE
Ciao bello.
(noticing a beautiful woman in
an open-topped car)
Don't you want to fuck every woman you
see.
Just once.
They kiss cheeks, continental-style.
DICKIE
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
FREDDIE
(mugging)
Hey, if I'm late, think what her
husband's saying!
He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.
FREDDIE (cont'd)
So let's go. I got us a table outside at
Fabrizio's.
And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny
checks to work out the bill and pay it.
DICKIE
I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with
Mongi.
Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the
street to Freddie's car.
FREDDIE
I know.
I was there.
(looks back to see Ripley
struggling to settle the
check)
Tommy!
It's S.R.O.
Two seater.
Standing Room Only.
Chop, chop, Tommy!
Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He
has to crouch in the rear.
FREDDIE (cont'd)
You're going to have to sit between us.
But don't put your shoes on the seat,
know what I mean, put them one on top of
the other.
Okay?
Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's
looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then
he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This
is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by
antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't
alone.
Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and
Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks
perfectly happy.
MARGE
Hi, Tom.
Come join us.
FREDDIE
I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was
just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in
Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear
his clothes, and his father picks up the
tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll
do it!
The boat is drifting.
Freddie and Dickie and Marge are
swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley
is sitting alone, reading.
MARGE
You really should go in, it's marvellous.
RIPLEY
I'm fine.
She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a
red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.
MARGE
Are you okay?
RIPLEY
Sure.
They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.
MARGE
The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun
shines on you and it's glorious, then he
forgets you and it's very very cold.
RIPLEY
So I'm learning.
MARGE
He's not even aware of it. When you've
got his attention you feel like you're
the only person in the world. That's why
everybody loves him. Other times...
There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.
DICKIE
(laughing and choking)
He's drowning me!
MARGE
It's always the same whenever someone new
comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,
Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -
did you meet him, he's a musician? -
... and especially you, of course... and
that's only the boys.
They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.
MARGE (cont'd)
Tell me, why is it when men play they
always play at killing each other...?
I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
RIPLEY
What about Cortina?
MARGE
Didn't Dick say? - he talked to
Freddie... apparently it's not going to
work out -
(Ripley's devastated, Marge
notices, can't look at him)
Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in
his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.
DICKIE
Come on, Frederico, do you really have
to go back?
At least stick around for
the Festival of the Madonna.
FREDDIE
I don't think so. Come back with me to
Rome. There's this great new club.
Have
some drinks, lotta ladies...
Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie
makes a face at Freddie.
DICKIE
Do you think you can steer this thing?
FREDDIE
Sure.
DICKIE
Just point her at Capri and avoid the
rocks.
FREDDIE
What are you doing?
DICKIE
Marge-maintenance.
FREDDIE
Aye, aye.
Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the
tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the
water.
From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but
he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering
him a restricted view.
He looks down and there's a flash of
flesh, then nothing.
Then as the boat swings with the waves,
he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then
Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted
toes straining.
Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely
betrayed.
FREDDIE (cont'd)
Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,
you were looking.
Tommy Tommy Tommy.
Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting
before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.
The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.
Dickie as
ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting
instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.
Ripley
looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.
Dickie notices her too.
A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.
It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with
flowers and a lace veil.
As she is revealed, wooden,
staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,
wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their
shoulders.
The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their
fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from
Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is
carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,
the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
walking on water.
Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,
about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from
among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.
One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.
It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the
palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -
wades, swims, splashes towards the body.
PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people
splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,
Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.
Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below
them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the
whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,
police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle
A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her
brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls
away.
RIPLEY
What's the fight about? That's her
fianc, isn't it?
Are they blaming him?
DICKIE
(sharp)
I don't know! Why are you asking me?
(agitated)
How can it take an hour to find an
ambulance?
MARGE
(conciliatory)
Well, she was already dead, darling,
wasn't she, so I suppose -
DICKIE
I don't know why people say this
country's civilised. It isn't. It's
fucking primitive.
And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING
THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across
the terrace. Dickie storms inside.
MARGE
Dickie!
RIPLEY
I'll go and see what's the matter.
MARGE
I'll go.
Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express
Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,
Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter
from Herbert Greenleaf -
RIPLEY
...The thousand dollars, of course, was
only due in the event that you succeeded
in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I
hope the trip has afforded you some
pleasure despite the failure of its main
objective you need no longer consider
yourself obligated to us in any way...
DICKIE
You can't blame him.
You could hardly
expect this to go on forever.
RIPLEY
I thought you might write again. Now that
we're brothers...
DICKIE
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've
had a good run, haven't we?
RIPLEY
(increasingly miserable)
What about Venice? Can we stick to that
plan at least?
DICKIE
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on
here without money.
It's time we all
moved on.
Besides I'm sick of Mongi.
Especially now with everything - I really
want to move to the North. I need to
check out San Remo next week, find
somewhere new to keep the boat.
But it would be great, though, if you
came with me.
Our last trip before you
leave. There's a jazz festival - we could
say goodbye in style.
What do you think?
A last trip?
Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which
lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and
a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the
band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They
pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.
DICKIE
This is more like it. Didn't I tell you
San Remo was crazy!
They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while
their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.
He's got Dickie all to himself.
RIPLEY
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my
life.
DICKIE
To Mongi.
You're cheerful tonight.
RIPLEY
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going
back.
DICKIE
That's good.
RIPLEY
I've got plans!
DICKIE
Ripley's plans.
RIPLEY
Esatto. I'm always planning.
DICKIE
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I
didn't, did I?
RIPLEY
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
DICKIE
No reason. Because you're leaving, I
guess. I don't think you were there, were
you?
RIPLEY
Why?
DICKIE
I mean it as a compliment. You've got
such great taste, I don't know. Most of
the thugs at Princeton had tasted
everything and had no taste. Used to say,
the cream of America: rich and thick.
Freddie's the perfect example.
RIPLEY
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
DICKIE
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
RIPLEY
(a beat)
Ha.
DICKIE
Do you even like jazz - or was that
something for my benefit?
RIPLEY
(conceding, without guile)
I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
like everything about the way you live.
It's one big love affair. If you knew my
life back home in New York...
Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.
DICKIE
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
do you think about drums?
RIPLEY
What?
DICKIE
So cool.
He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
- it's superficiality.
The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor
boat.
DICKIE
That's how I found my place in Mongi.
Took a boat out round the bay.
The first
place I liked, I got it.
The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by
the speed.
RIPLEY
Dickie, slow down, come on!
Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the
motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.
DICKIE
(ecstatic)
I love it here! Gonna live here!
Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of
the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,
already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.
RIPLEY
I wanted to tell you my plan.
DICKIE
So tell me.
RIPLEY
I thought I might come back. In the New
Year. Under my own steam.
DICKIE
(suddenly tight)
Really?
To Italy?
RIPLEY
Of course. Let's say, for argument's
sake, you were here - perhaps we could
split the rent on a house - I'll get a
job - or, better still, I could get a
place in Rome and when we're there we
could be there and if we're here we could
be here -
DICKIE
Oh God, I don't think so.
RIPLEY
- you see, particularly with the Marge
problem, you can just blame me.
DICKIE
Marge and I are getting married.
RIPLEY
(appalled)
How?
DICKIE
How?
RIPLEY
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the
terrace, today you're getting married.
It's absurd.
DICKIE
I love Marge.
RIPLEY
You love me and you're not marrying me.
DICKIE
(cold)
Tom, I don't love you.
RIPLEY
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained
all of that.
DICKIE
I'm actually a little relieved you're
going, to be honest. I think we've seen
enough of each other for a while.
Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.
RIPLEY
What?
DICKIE
You can be a leech - you know this - and
it's boring. You can be quite boring.
RIPLEY
(volcanic)
The funny thing - I'm not pretending to
be somebody else and you are. I'm
absolutely honest with you. I've told you
my feelings. But you, first of all I know
there's something - that evening when we
played chess, for instance, it was
obvious -
DICKIE
(incredulous)
What evening?
RIPLEY
Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for
you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,
fine, then you do this sordid thing with
Marge, fucking her on the boat while we
all have to listen, which was
excruciating, frankly, plus you follow
your cock around like a - and now you're
getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive
me...you're lying to Marge then getting
married to her, you're knocking up
Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've
got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,
what do you really play?
Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.
DICKIE
(attacking him, administering
tiny slaps as punctuation to
his tirade)
Who are you - some imposter, some third
class mooch - who are you to tell me
anything? Actually, I really really
really don't want to be on this boat with
you, I can't move without you moving,
which is exactly how it feels and it
gives me the creeps.
(he goes to rev up the engine)
I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,
Dickie" - like a little girl.
You give
me the -
RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS
OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.
RIPLEY
Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!
The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.
Dickie looks
up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.
DICKIE
For God's sake.
Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,
catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,
apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and
then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.
A
terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
Ripley.
DICKIE (cont'd)
I'll kill you!
Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,
kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is
rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come
off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death
wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his
own blood, loses his grip.
Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like
a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood
on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,
letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's
let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls
there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.
Nobody's in sight.
The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling
indifferently on the waves.
Ripley lies by Dickie in the
bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.
The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.
The sea
calms.
A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley
clambers onto a rock over the shore.
He's watching the boat
slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he
finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat
disappears under the surface.
Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's
jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.
Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.
He
stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea
what to do.
The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very
together.
Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is
working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by
references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her
until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.
RIPLEY
Hello Marge.
MARGE
Tom, you startled me!
You're back.
RIPLEY
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going
well?
MARGE
Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.
RIPLEY
I was just looking at you -
(looking at her tenderly)
- so quiet.
MARGE
Where's Dickie?
RIPLEY
I think he's planning on staying in Rome
for a few days.
MARGE
(looks at him)
Ha. Did he say why?
RIPLEY
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,
Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
MARGE
What does that mean?
RIPLEY
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the
next day I'm not, one day we're all one
family, the next day he wants to be
alone. You tell me.
MARGE
Is that what he said - he wanted to be
alone?
RIPLEY
He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked
me to deliver this.
He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.
MARGE
Thanks. he knows I love this, although
why it couldn't have waited...
RIPLEY
Errand number one - deliver Marge's
perfume. Errand number two, pack some
clothes and his precious saxophone.
MARGE
(alarmed)
How long's he staying for?
RIPLEY
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,
forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.
Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe.
MEREDITH
But you're going skiing with us Yankees,
aren't you?
RIPLEY
What?
MEREDITH
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie
Miles and -
RIPLEY
(interrupting, astonished)
How did you know that?
MEREDITH
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
RIPLEY
(unsettled)
Is Freddie in Rome?
MEREDITH
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
of course, and we've chatted and I know
about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
were a rat and I thought to myself now I
know why he travels under R.
RIPLEY
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
the rat's here now, in Rome.
MEREDITH
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -
RIPLEY
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
I feel like I've been handed a new life.
Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head
inside the office.
MEREDITH
The truth is if you've had money your
entire life, even if you despise it,
which we do - agreed? - you're only truly
comfortable around other people who have
it and despise it.
RIPLEY
I know.
MEREDITH
I've never admitted that to anyone.
Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.
Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.
MEREDITH
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
RIPLEY
You're such a pal to understand. It's as
if Marge is here now - I look at you and
I see her face - and I can't, whatever
I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...
MEREDITH
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
RIPLEY
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
MEREDITH
Beating you away.
They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment
Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go
inside, then looks at him.
MEREDITH
Will you meet me tomorrow?
Just to say
goodbye in the daylight, properly? So
it's not just this, it's too...you should
always save pain for daylight...
RIPLEY
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll
meet you. Let's have coffee in the
morning at Dinelli's.
MEREDITH
(fluttering)
I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?
RIPLEY
Exactly. 10.30 -
(instantly correcting himself)
10.15.
He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.
Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish
Steps. Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,
among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an
outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via
Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.
She
acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.
MEREDITH
Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.
PETER
Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm
sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is
Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.
MARGE
Hello.
Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.
PETER
Join us, won't you? We're just waiting
for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did
we see you at the Opera last night?
MEREDITH
I won't actually, although I think this
might - are you waiting for Dickie?
PETER
Well no, as it happens, although...
MARGE
(stunned at the mention of his
name)
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
MEREDITH
You were at the Opera? Well, that
explains - yes I was there. I was there
with Dickie.
MARGE
(to Peter)
I told you! I knew it!
MEREDITH
(moving over to them)
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no
right, but Dickie loves you.
He's - I
think you'll find he's coming home to
you.
MARGE
(proprietorial)
How would you know that?
MEREDITH
He told me everything. I was supposed to
meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm
going to go now, I think. Unless he meant
us to meet - which would be a little
cruel, wouldn't it?
PETER
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom
Ripley.
MARGE
Do you know Tom?
MEREDITH
Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,
but no, I didn't meet him.
The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates
she's leaving.
MEREDITH (cont'd)
Not for me. No, grazie.
Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.
MEREDITH (cont'd)
I hope I didn't complicate matters, but
nothing, nothing untoward happened,
nothing to prevent you from welcoming him
back, from marrying him...Goodbye.
Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.
Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of
the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the
crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he
becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's
apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his
element, lying and believing in his lie.
RIPLEY
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.
Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp
when they can make you line up for three.
Have you been waiting long?
PETER
Not at all. Morning Tom.
RIPLEY
Hi.
(to Marge)
Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've
seen a ghost...
MARGE
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
RIPLEY
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't
drag Dickie to -
MARGE
He was there with someone. So I suppose
she must have dragged him - that's not
fair.
I'm going back to Mongi. I think
Dickie's coming home.
(to Peter)
I'm going to go home.
RIPLEY
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -
you're way ahead of me! Great!
PETER
We think he's had a change of heart.
(to Marge)
So we should be celebrating.
MARGE
I hope so.
PETER
(to Marge)
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith
said -
(to Ripley)
Meredith's the American girl I saw last
night, I know her, at the Opera, she's
been seeing something of Dickie -
RIPLEY
My God.
PETER
But the point is Dickie - well we know
this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
her and apparently he's come to his
senses...
RIPLEY
It's fantastic.
(to Peter)
I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
this, but anytime Dickie does something I
feel guilty.
It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows
towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley
talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He
pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.
RIPLEY
(mimicking Freddie's voice)
Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her
husband's saying.
The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs
punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,
Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.
He slows near a clump of trees.
Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
Italian, runs up concerned.
Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the
street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips
Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.
Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no
mood for pleasantries.
MARGE
Did he kill Freddie?
RIPLEY
Marge, when did you get here?
MARGE
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
RIPLEY
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
MARGE
I tried again, waiting here, watching for
him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look
for Dickie I find you.
(focusing on Ripley's cuts and
bruises)
What happened to your face?
RIPLEY
Dickie did it.
MARGE
(suddenly tense)
Dickie?
RIPLEY
My face! There was an argument. I said
some things I shouldn't have.
About you.
About the appalling way he's treating
you, all of us.
And the next thing I
know he's launched himself at me.
(he pulls the scooter off the
stand)
Are you getting on?
MARGE
What?
RIPLEY
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The
entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.
Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,
startled, drives straight past the entrance.
Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different
piazza full of book stalls.
Marge is confused.
MARGE
Where does Dickie live?
RIPLEY
We passed it a few blocks back, where the
police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They
don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not
going to incriminate Dickie -
MARGE
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
RIPLEY
(thinking hard, distracted)
No, well go if you want to, but don't
talk to the Police about my face - they
find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he
could've hit Freddie.
(sincerely)
Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you
later.
And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK
and roars towards the Palazzo.
Ripley drives towards the entrance.
As Ripley gets off and
pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,
LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm
around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off
a photograph.
It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away
as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.
Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the
entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the
police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off
into the darkness.
Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,
hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.
Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a
MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-
Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.
PETER
(indicating the taxi stop)
I'll see you over there!
Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
grey.
RIPLEY
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
through this. I just couldn't face going
to the police by myself when my Italian's
so rotten.
PETER
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
you finally made it to Venice. I'm
delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
still in one piece?
RIPLEY
What rumour?
PETER
That Dickie murdered you and is
travelling under your passport. I know,
ridiculous.
MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley
and Peter have come to meet her.
MARGE
(kissing him warmly)
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
RIPLEY
Hello Marge!
MARGE
(coolly)
Tom.
They walk towards the Vaporetto.
MARGE (cont'd)
So you found Peter...
PETER
I think we sort of found each other.
Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.
PETER (cont'd)
Where's Dickie's father?
MARGE
He's not coming till the morning.
Evidently his stomach - I don't think the
food here is agreeing with him.
RIPLEY
I was looking forward to seeing him.
MARGE
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of
that. There's a private detective on the
case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's
father's employing him.
RIPLEY
That's a terrific idea.
MARGE
He's American. He's already discovered
Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day
before he disappeared.
They step onto the Vaporetto.
MARGE (cont'd)
Is that what you do before you jump in
the Tiber?
I don't think so.
The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens
the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.
MARGE
(to Peter)
Is this you?
PETER
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
MARGE
Golly. Who's paying for this?
RIPLEY
Peter found it for me. I can afford it
because it's damp and, and falling down.
St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon
sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out
in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,
cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley
arrive.
RIPLEY
Mr Greenleaf.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Tom. How are you?
You look well.
RIPLEY
I'm well, thank you.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Far cry from New York.
RIPLEY
Yes it is.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Marge, good morning.
Unusual weather.
MARGE
Very.
RIPLEY
And you, sir?
Any better?
HERBERT GREENLEAF
Pretty good.
Sticking with hot water.
MARGE
Where's Mr MacCarron?
HERBERT GREENLEAF
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,
my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,
hasn't it?
RIPLEY
Yes.
What's the detective hoping to
find in San Remo?
HERBERT GREENLEAF
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm
learning about my son, Tom, now he's
missing. I'm learning a great deal about
him. I hope you can fill in some more
blanks for me. Marge has been good enough
to do that, about Mongibello.
RIPLEY
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do
anything to help Dickie.
Marge looks at him in contempt.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
This theory, the letter he left for you,
the Police think that's a clear
indication he was planning on doing
something...to himself.
MARGE
I just don't believe that!
HERBERT GREENLEAF
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk
to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?
Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say
to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to
another fellow -
MARGE
Such as?
HERBERT GREENLEAF
What a waste of lives and opportunities
and -
A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf
suddenly explodes.
HERBERT GREENLEAF
(cont'd)
- I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
right now to shut up!
Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.
RIPLEY
I could probably see my bedroom from
here. I can see my house. When you see
where you live from a distance it's like
a dream, isn't it?
MACCARRON
(coming out)
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to
hear it. I don't care to speak it.
RIPLEY
Okay.
MACCARRON
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him
to Europe in the first place? Did you
know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
killed a boy?
Ripley turns, shocked.
MACCARRON
(cont'd)
At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the
kid several times in the head. Put him in
the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in
his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to
ask Mr Greenleaf.
MacCarron gets up.
MACCARRON
(cont'd)
Nor did they think to check whether a
Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
Princeton University. I turned up a Tom
Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the
music department.
Ripley's head drops.
MACCARRON
(cont'd)
See - in America we're taught to check a
fact before it becomes a fact. We're
taught to nose around when a girl drowns
herself, find out if that girl was
pregnant, find out if Dickie had an
embarrassment there.
Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.
MACCARRON
(cont'd)
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
He really does. Marge, she's got a
hundred theories, but there are a few
things she doesn't know. We hope she
never knows.
RIPLEY
I hope she never knows.
MACCARRON
Three different people saw Dickie get
into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't
identify himself because he was jumping
someone else's wife at the time saw
Dickie removing license plates from a red
sports car. The Police know about this
man because he happens to be a Policeman.
He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
from Freddie's car.
MACCARRON
(cont'd)
I found these in the basement of Dickie's
apartment. They belonged to Freddie's
car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
them in the canal this evening.
Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.
MACCARRON
(cont'd)
Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
silent promise in Dickie's letter to you
which he intends to honor. He intends to
transfer a good part of Dickie's income
from his trust into your name. He doesn't
intend to give the Italian police any
information about Dickie's past. He's
rather hoping you'll feel the same.
There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.
Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and
then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert
Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.
RIPLEY
(to Marge)
I feel I never should have said those
things to you the other evening. I was
pretty flustered, the rings and - and you
looked so, I don't know.
Marge shakes her head to silence him.
RIPLEY (cont'd)
But I hope that note goes to New York in
your purse, for a rainy day.
MARGE
What are you going to do now, Tom?
RIPLEY
I don't know. Peter has a concert in
Athens next month - and he's asked if I
want to go along, help out. He says
goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,
otherwise -
MARGE
Why do I think there's never been a
Ripley rainy day?
RIPLEY
What?
MARGE
(lunging at him)
I know it was you - I know it was you,
Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed
Dickie. I know it was you.
RIPLEY
Oh Marge.
He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.
STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that
Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to
restrain her.
Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you
do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the
boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.
They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.
A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.
They're
laughing.
RIPLEY
Ask me what I want to change about this
moment.
PETER
What do you want to change about this
moment?
RIPLEY
Nothing.
Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.
MEREDITH
Dickie?
Dickie?
He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.
MEREDITH (cont'd)
Dickie, my God!
RIPLEY
Hello Meredith.
MEREDITH
I was looking at you, your clothes, I
wouldn't have known you...
RIPLEY
Well, you've spotted me and so you get
the reward.
MEREDITH
What?
RIPLEY
Just kidding. Are you alone?
MEREDITH
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER
COUPLES are walking around the deck.
RIPLEY
Of course.
Aunt Joan.
MEREDITH
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've
thought about you so much.
RIPLEY
I've thought about you.
And now he's thinking I can't kill them all...
MEREDITH
When I thought about you I was mostly
hating you. Where've you been hiding?
RIPLEY
I haven't been hiding. I've been in
Police custody. They've been trying to
flush out Freddie's killer.
MEREDITH
You're kidding.
RIPLEY
They're letting me have this vacation.
Which is why the get-up. Which is why you
haven't heard from me.
MEREDITH
You know, the whole world thinks you
killed Freddie? It's terrible.
RIPLEY
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.
Later?
He kisses her.
Full of future.
MEREDITH
So - are you travelling under R?
RIPLEY
You know what - I am.
MEREDITH
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-
Kingsley?
I bet you are. My aunt thought
she saw him.
RIPLEY
(horrified)
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him
in months.
No, I'm alone.
(and he understands this is not
any kind of lie)
