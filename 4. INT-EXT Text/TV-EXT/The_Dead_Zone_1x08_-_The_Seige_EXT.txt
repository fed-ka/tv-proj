  22OMITTED



          It's a fine day, and people are out doing their business,
          among them JOHNNY, SARAH and LITTLE JOHNNY, who's running
          ahead as they walk along the sidewalk.  They find him
          waiting for them in front of the general store, next door
          to the bank, where there's a coin-operated race car ride.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                                (re: the ride)
                        Mom, can I?

                                        SARAH
                        Not now, honey.  I have to stop
                        in the bank...

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                          Puhleeeeze...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (pulling out a quarter)
                        Here.  It's on me.

          He smiles, holds out a quarter, but little Johnny's still
          awkward around big Johnny and hesitates, looking at his
          mother.  And it's a passing moment but an important one
          as Sarah wants so much for these two to bond and it isn't
          coming easily.

                                        SARAH
                        It's okay.

          The boy takes the quarter.

                                        SARAH
                        Say, "Thanks."

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                                (mumbles)
                        Thanks.

          Johnny helps him climb in the race car and starts it up
          to tinny MUSIC and LOUD ENGINE NOISES.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (ironic)
                        He's really starting to warm up
                        to me.

                                        SARAH
                        He will. 
                                (dry)
                        If you have enough quarters.

          She smiles encouragingly.

                                        SARAH
                        Think you can handle a few minutes
                        alone with him?  I've got to run
                        to the bank.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can always turn to my hand
                        animals if things start to get*
                        rough.

          He makes a dog shadow with his hand...

                                        SARAH
                                (to her son)
                        I'll be right back, Johnny.

          Little Johnny is not pleased to see her go but he's on
          his ride.  A beat after she leaves, the ride rocks him as
          he stares uncomfortably at the man his mother always hangs
          around with.  Johnny grins but feels just as uncomfortable.



          She is approaching the general store and sees Johnny with
          little Johnny, who's still driving his car.  She comes
          up, smiling.

                                        DANA
                          Babysitting today?

                        Sarah just went to the bank.

          Dana is just beginning to feel a rivalry with Sarah over
            Johnny...

                                        DANA
                        It's great how the two of you
                        have been able to keep up your
                          friendship... under such difficult
                            circumstances... 

          The quarter runs out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whup, last quarter.  Where is she
                        anyway? 
                                (hand shadow time)
                        Look, Johnny, a chicken...

          Dana offers a quarter...

                        My treat... getting two Johnnies

                                (finally, a smile)
                        Thanks.

          She holds out the coin, their hands touch... and RAMP TO

88A VISION - A MATCHING SHOT OF JOHNNY - NIGHT

          outside the bank in the future... ambulance, fire trucks,
          patrol cars, paramedics... broken windows and smoke bombs
          still dissipating... body bags are being carried out of
          the bank... Dana is with other reporters as they cover
          the story... TV cameras rolling... still photographers
          shooting... one TV NEWSMAN sticks a microphone in Johnny's
          face...

                        when it was fifty feet away from

          And the vision ends as we...

          Dana sees Johnny's stricken expression...

                        Are you all right?

                        No.  It's okay.  You hang here
                        with Dana, okay?

          Dana's about to protest, but stops at what she sees in
          Johnny's eyes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call.  Now.

          He turns and walks toward the bank.  Dana grabs her cell
          phone and calls as we --

          steps away from Spahn and goes to the door, letting Walt

          Walt and Roscoe stop walking.  Walt puts one hand on his
          weapon in its holster and the other on his radio.  With

          The phone STARTS RINGING AGAIN.  Conrad shakes his head
          like he could make this all go away, and we think, maybe,
          he's starting to lose it.  Slowly PUSH IN on Conrad as he
          tries to get his mind around what's going on.  Mrs.
          Stratton's not responding to the CPR.  Conrad sees
          accusatory eyes, some angry, some frightened, all staring
          at him.  Tom and Mr. Stratton are bent over Mrs. Stratton,
          their efforts growing more frantic.  Mr. Stratton looks
          up at Conrad.

                                        MR. STRATTON
                        Damn you, Conrad, she's dying!

          Conrad's lips are moving, like he's talking to himself. 
          He scans the faces, all looking at him, and finds no
          comfort in any of them... except Johnny's.  At least, in
          his, there's something like compassion.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me tell them we need an
                        ambulance.

          Conrad just stares at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (not ungently)
                        If she dies in here, this won't
                        just be armed robbery and
                        kidnapping -- it'll be murder.

          Finally, Conrad nods assent, knowing he's losing control
          and unable to figure out how to stop it.  Johnny answers
          the ringing phone.

                                                                                INTERCUT

                        Johnny -- is Sarah okay?

          Johnny keeps it impersonal for Conrad's benefit:

                                  (completely neutral)
                        Yes.  This is an emergency -- we
                        need an ambulance here immediately --
                        a woman in her seventies is
                          suffering from a heart attack or
                        stroke.

                        Ambulance.  Code three.

          In the bank, Conrad starts to feel like he's getting his
          wits about him.

                                        CONRAD

          Johnny notices Conrad, staring at him suspiciously.

                        I'm not in a position to answer
                        that question.

                                        WALT

                                to Conrad)
                        The Sheriff wants to talk to you.

                        No.  Hang up.

          So Johnny breaks the connection.


          OUTSIDE THE BANK

          Walt shakes his head.

                                        WALT
                        Lost him.  We've got a woman down
                        in there with a heart attack.  I
                        need that ambulance!

          There's background movement and urgency with all that
          follows here:


          NEW ANGLE AS HE MOVES TO --

          HARLAN CASEY (mid-30's), leader of the Tactical Team, is
          looking at plans of the bank building, then at the building
          and the relative isolation of the lot.

                                        WALT
                                (to Casey)

                          Negative.  Simple building.  New.

          He nods approvingly.

                                        WALT
                        Let's put two of your men in the

                        If we need them, they can go up
                        through the ventilation system...

                        You got it, Sheriff.

          He moves away.  Dana follows him.  We can hear the distant
          siren of an ambulance moving this way in the background...

                        We don't send hostages back in
                        once they're out.  I can deliver

                        That was the deal, to get Mrs.
                          Stratton out.

          Walt shakes his head, takes his arm to hold him back...
          and suddenly...

                        Each time, I move a piece, the
                        picture changes - it's like a...
                        a ricochet effect... I've never
                        been in anything like this before. 
                        I only know I've got to keep
                        fitting the right pieces together
                        until I like the picture that's
                        coming out.  Right now, I don't
                        like it.  You wouldn't either.

                        think he's beginning to trust me.

          Walt and Johnny hold a look.  Reluctantly, Walt stands
          back and lets Johnny carry the TV back into the bank.

          Walt gives him a hard look.



          Arleta Hurley, a worn-out woman in her forties, is talking
          on Walt's car phone...

                        I don't like TV, you know that.

                        We are talking.

                        Just you and me.  Without the TV.

                                        CONRAD
                        I can't come out right now.  You
                        could come in.

                        He hung up.

          Walt frowns, looks to Casey... nods, It's time for Plan*

          Push in as he waits for Conrad to answer...



          At the command table, Casey gets the report on his radio,
          looks to Walt, shakes his head.

          ON WALT

          The tension's starting to take its toll on him -- his
          face is drawn, his features sharply etched with worry.

                                        CASEY

                        Hurley was expecting them.

          Walt reacts.  A beat as he thinks.

                                        WALT
                        Pull'em out.  Set me up

                        There's no way he could've known. 

          Walt just looks at Dana; they both know there is.  He
          puts his hands on the table and his shoulders sag a little. 
          Then he straightens up.

                                        SARAH
                        Your team was about to get us all
                        killed.  Johnny told me.

                                        CASEY
                        Sure, like this guy can really
                        see into the future.

          He laughs and looks over at Walt and Dana for affirmation,
          he gets none...

                                (beat)
                        We'll give Johnny a little more
                        time in there with him.  



          The door opens.  Conrad is the first one out, hands on
          his head.  Deputies move to handcuff and arrest him as 
          Johnny emerges, looking weary.  Crisis over, people start
          to come through the police line and into the parking lot,  
          Dana moves toward Johnny but by the time she reaches him,
          other reporters are with her...

                                        DANA
                          Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No questions right now, Dana,
                        okay?  Maybe later.

          He's treating her just like any other reporter and it
            stings... she watches as he moves to Walt and Sarah...
          the Sheriff has his arm around his wife...

                                        WALT
                        That jig-saw puzzle finally came
                          together.  Could have been a lot
                          different today.  Nice work.
                                (adding as an
                                  afterthought)
                        The state boys do have a few bones
                        to pick with you...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had no choice, Walt...

                                        WALT
                        It all turned out.    

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny needs a ride home.  He
                        came with me.

                                        WALT
                        No problem. 
                                (and he does this
                                  deliberately because
                                he wants to be alone
                                with his wife right
                                now)
                        Roscoe, drive Mr. Smith home.

          Johnny and Sarah exchange a last glance...

                        I'll call you later.

          Johnny nods, starts to move toward Roscoe...

                                        WALT
                        Hey, John.

          Johnny turns, pauses...

                                        WALT
                                (re: Sarah)
                        Thanks for bringing her back to
                        us.

          Johnny acknowledges and walks off alone toward Roscoe's
          car and as we pull back, we see Dana also alone, watching
          him... and the busy activity of the post siege begins to
          fill the screen as we...

                                                                              FADE OUT.
