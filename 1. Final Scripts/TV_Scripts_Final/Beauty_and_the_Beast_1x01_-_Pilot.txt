                                          TEASER

      INT. WESTCHESTER LOCAL BAR - NIGHT

      Closing time.  Dirty glasses, beer bottles.  MUSIC PLAYS, but 
      the LIGHTS are on.  A CHYRON tell us it s  Summer 2003 .

      CATHERINE CHANDLER, 19, pretty college girl full of optimism, 
      drive and the innocence that comes with a bright future, is 
      working her summer job, pulling BILLS from the REGISTER --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Wow, dollar Lemon Drops, and all of 
                      Westchester shows up.

      Fellow bartender LILA, a hot local, not quite the same sunny 
      future, touches up her eyeliner in the bar mirror --

                                  LILA
                    Never underestimate the power of 
                    cheap booze...
                          (buttering her up)
                    ...and a hot, new, ivy-educated 
                      bartender.

                                  CATHERINE
                          (seeing right through her)
                    I said I ll cover for you.  

                                  LILA
                    What, I m serious.  Cat, you had like 
                    five guys throwing themselves at you.

                                  CATHERINE
                    It was two, and one was borderline 
                      unconscious.  
                          (can t help being excited)
                    The other one did seem kinda sweet, 
                    didn t he?

                                  LILA
                    So you sure you don t mind?

                                  CATHERINE
                          (laughs, she was being buttered up)
                    Go.  You ll get me when I have something 
                    waiting other than an LSAT practice test.  

                                  LILA
                    You re the best!  If I ever get arrested 
                    or divorced, you re the one I m gonna 
                    hire. 
                          (grabs MARASCHINO CHERRIES)
                    Studler loves these.
                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  2.

      With that, Lila races out.  Catherine shakes her head, 
      amused, then starts tossing BOTTLES, and we DISSOLVE TO: 

      INT. WESTCHESTER LOCAL BAR - LATER

      Not a bottle in sight.  Satisfied, Catherine flips off the 
      MUSIC, the LIGHTS.  Suddenly it s DARK and QUIET.  A bit too 
      quiet.  Unsettled, she grabs two TRASH BAGS, heads out...

      EXT. WESTCHESTER LOCAL BAR/PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

      ...locking up.  She walks towards a DUMPSTER, when suddenly -- 
      RUSTLING.  She jumps, startled.  Just a POSSUM.  Still, she 
      hurls the TRASH into the dumpster, hurries to her lone car...

      INT. CATHERINE S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Cluttered with LSAT GUIDES, SODA CANS, LIPGLOSS.  Puts the KEY in 
      the ignition.  It won't start.  Shit.  She glances around to see 
      why... the VANITY MIRROR S open, shit again.  She grabs her cell, 
      sees the time, 2:25 AM.  Cringes as she dials, then, apologetic:

                                  CATHERINE
                      ...Mom...?

      EXT. PARKING LOT/CATHERINE'S CAR - NIGHT

      VANESSA CHANDLER, 40s, in SCRUBS, pulls out JUMPER CABLES from her 
      CAR --

                                    VANESSA
                    I m like Triple A, but with outerwear.  
                    Here, it s cold out.  

      -- and hands a SWEATER to Catherine, who guiltily takes it.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I m so sorry I dragged you out here.  
                    Good news is, I made a lot in tips? 

                                    VANESSA
                    Enough to cover tuition?

                                  CATHERINE
                    Books.  At least for one class?

                                    VANESSA 
                          (chuckles, bemused)
                    Already a lawyer, like Dad.  You re just 
                    lucky I was on call.  He would ve killed 
                    you.

      Just then, HEADLIGHTS FLOOD the parking lot.  They turn to 
      see a beat-up CAR pulling in - who else is out at this hour?  
                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  3.

      CONTINUED:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Uch, we re closed.

      But Vanessa s wary.  The Driver s door OPENS --

                                    VANESSA
                    We re good here.

      -- through the HIGH BEAMS, they see a MAN get out --

                                    VANESSA
                    I said we got it.

      No response.  Catherine uneasily turns to her Mom --

                                    VANESSA
                    Get in my car.

      -- she hesitates but Vanessa shoots her an urgent look.  
      Later she ll wonder, maybe her mom knew something, but for 
      now, Catherine does as she s told, starts towards the car --  

                                    VANESSA
                    Look, we already called Highway Patrol so-- 

      -- He pulls out a GUN, SHOOTS HER.  WHIP PAN to Catherine, 
      who stops, stunned, terrified... barely audible:

                                  CATHERINE
                      ...Mom...?  
                          (then, frantic)
                    Mom!

      Just as ANOTHER MAN emerges from the passenger side.  A 
      horrifying beat as she realizes he s headed for her.  She 
      TEARS off, DARTING across the parking lot, into&

      EXT. WESTCHESTER WOODS - NIGHT

      ...BRANCHES whip at Catherine from every direction as she runs, 
      tears streaming down her face, gasping for air.  FOOTSTEPS GAIN on 
      her as she whimpers in terror.  She glances back at her ATTACKER -- 
      TRIPS over a ROOT, falls HARD, hitting her head SMACK on a ROCK -- 

      Catherine s POV: everything s OUT OF FOCUS.  She turns to see 
      a FUZZY IMAGE of her Attacker, raising his gun...

                                  CATHERINE
                      ...please, no...

      She closes her eyes, bracing herself when -- a deep, guttural 
      GROWL -- then a DARK BLUR SPRINGS out of the woods with INHUMAN 
      SPEED -- POUNCES on the Man, sending his gun flying --

                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  4.

      CONTINUED:

      Catherine s barely able to make out what s happening but the 
      sounds are clear: RIPPING FLESH, SCREAMS of AGONY.  Just as the 
      other Attacker arrives --

                                  ATTACKER #2
                    What the -- ?

      He raises his gun, but before he can shoot -- the BLUR 
      POUNCES again.  Catherine s too terrified to move as, more 
      SOUNDS of a MAULING then SILENCE... STILLNESS... 

      She can just make out a FIGURE, broad-shouldered, muscular, 
      CANINE S glistening, eyes GLOWING, a Man-Creature, the BEAST.  

      They lock eyes, is she next?  And maybe it s her head injury or 
      the way he looks at her but she knows he won't hurt her.  Before 
      she can utter a word, distant SIRENS sound.  The Beast takes a 
      beat, almost not wanting to leave.  Then takes off, disappearing 
      into the woods.  Off Catherine changed forever we HEAR: 

                                  CATHERINE (V.O.)
                    Everyone told me it was a wolf.  That 
                    this thing I thought I d seen was the 
                    result of my concussion, or PTSD...

      PAN UP to the TREETOPS, out over Westchester, Queens, Bridges 
      and Tunnels, to the Manhattan Skyline as... 

                                  CATHERINE (V.O.)
                    ...You know, the men who'd killed my 
                    mother were beasts, so I'd created him 
                    in my mind as a way to deal.  
                          (then)
                      I believed them, until now. 

      We DESCEND into the CITY, as we CHYRON UP:  Present Day.  

      EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

      You know the saying, what doesn t kill you, makes you stronger?  
      Well, that s Catherine, now 28, her pluck and sense of humor 
      having gotten her through. 

      We find her running, this time not for her life but for an 
      Adele Concert.  She weaves through the CROWD, pulling her 
      hair out of a ponytail, primping when she sees --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Zeke!

      -- ZEKE, 30, handsome Music Exec, waiting under a MARQUEE, 
      turns, surprised to see her.  She kisses him, not noticing.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  5.

      CONTINUED:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Sorry, you know how my boss hates his 
                    wife, which means he never wants to 
                    leave, which means I don t get to --

                                  ZEKE
                    -- You didn t get my text.

                                  CATHERINE
                    No, what?

      Zeke takes a beat, almost annoyed, then:

                                  ZEKE
                    Okay, look, I m just not into this. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    What, Adele, or that I m five minutes late?  
                    Because I was stuck wrapping up a case --

                                  ZEKE
                    No, Adele s awesome.  It s just, at first 
                    your job was kind of a turn on.  Now it s 
                    kind of a drag.  Like tonight, if I wanna 
                    smoke some pot --

                                  CATHERINE
                    You can smoke pot, I don t care --

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey, Z-babe!

      Catherine follows Zeke s gaze to a hot, decked-out WOMAN, 
      20s, all smiles, approaching.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Z-babe?  

                                  ZEKE
                    Sorry, Cat, this...
                          (gesturing between them)
                    ...has just been stressing me out.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Really?  That s what you texted me? 

                                  ZEKE
                          (shrugs, then)
                    We gotta bust.

      With that, he heads off to his new date.  A beat, then: 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  6.

                    Oh, yeah?  Well, guess what  Z-Babe , 
                    this wasn t working for me either!
                          (then)
                    Security!  That guy s got pot on him!

      INT. CATHERINE & HEATHER S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      HEATHER, 20s, Catherine s younger sister/roommate, in silky PJ s, 
      reacts as Catherine yanks open the FREEZER, searching -- 

                                    HEATHER
                    You got him arrested?  

                                  CATHERINE
                    It s just concert jail, but at least 
                    I m not the only one missing Adele.  I 
                    mean, what, he couldn t have hung in 
                    two more hours?  But no, my job is too 
                    much of a drag -- why don t we have 
                    any real ice cream?  

                                    HEATHER
                    Skinny Cow s real enough.  Besides, Zeke 
                    doesn t deserve the calories of full fat.  
                    Sorry, Cat, but I couldn t stand that guy.

                                  CATHERINE
                          (stops, slightly defensive)
                    He wasn t completely lame until tonight.

                                    HEATHER
                    He was pretty lame.  He never picked 
                    you up, it was all about him --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Heather, I don t need to be picked up --  

                                    HEATHER
                    Are you actually defending him? 

                                  CATHERINE
                    No, I m just saying, my standards are 
                    different than yours.   

                                    HEATHER
                    As in, you don t have any.  I m serious, 
                    you keep dating these jerks.  It s like 
                    you don t feel like you deserve... 

                                  CATHERINE
                    What, love?  I m not looking for love.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  7.

      Heather realizes she put her foot in her mouth -- 

                                    HEATHER
                    He just told me.

                    Right, I m sure I m next on his call list.

      They follow it to a DOOR labelled  OFFICE . Catherine knocks:  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Hello, Mr. Forbes?  
                          (then, louder)
                    Mr. Forbes, NYPD.

      Beat. The DOOR OPENS slightly to REVEAL a Jonah Hill type, 30 s, 
      JT FORBES peers out, clearly not used to visitors, let alone Cops.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  14.

                    JT Forbes?  I m Detective Chandler, 
                    this is Detective O Malley --

                                  JT
                    Uh, this isn t about that speeding 
                    ticket, is it?  Because I m gonna pay --

                                  CATHERINE
                    No, we re here to talk to you about a 
                    former roommate, Vincent Koslow?  

                                  JT
                    Whoa, haven t heard that name in awhile.  
                    Sucks what happened, you know, so young. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Look, this may sound odd, but you haven t 
                    heard from him recently?

                                  JT 
                    Like voices or -- ?

                      TESS CATHERINE
      No, like him.  His prints just showed up at 
                                                    a crime scene.

                                  JT
                    Oof.  Sounds like you need new 
                      fingerprint guys.

      INT. CHEM. WAREHOUSE - LIVING SPACE/BEDROOM - INTERCUT AS NEEDED

      As a MAN hides behind a DOOR.  Broad shoulders, square jaw, 
      piercing eyes -- VINCENT KOSLOW!  He stops, sensing something as:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Unless, is there any reason Mr. Koslow 
                    might want people to think he s dead?  
                    Maybe he was in trouble, or --

      Vincent peeks out at the Detectives, his gaze lands on Catherine.  
      He s utterly taken aback as --

                                  JT
                    -- He was in Afghanistan, of course he 
                    was in trouble.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    He ever write to you, indicate some 
                    sort of plan -- ?  

      Vincent CROSSES to a DESK covered with SCIENCE EQUIPMENT, rifles 
      through a DRAWER as --

                    You think he faked his death?  Koslow 
                    was a stand up guy, never broke a rule 
                    in his life, including speeding.  But 
                    look, I really gotta get to the office.  
                    Still paying off Christmas shopping.

      But JT has already shut the door on them.  A beat --  

                                  CATHERINE
                    That was weird.

                    Guess no backseat romance for you.  

      Catherine smiles.  They head out, but she can t help glancing 
      back, suspicious, her gut telling her there s more here as... 

      INT. CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE - VINCENT S ROOM - DAY 

      JT marches towards a door, YANKS it open, dumb-guy facade gone --

                                  JT
                    What the hell did you do?

      INT. CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE - LIVING AREA/KITCHEN - DAY

      A bachelor pad/man cave complete with SECTIONAL and 
      FLATSCREEN.  JT s pacing as Vincent tries to calm him down -- 

                                  JT
                    Oh my God.  Oh my God.

                    You want a beer?  

                                  JT
                    No, I don t want a beer!

                                    VINCENT
                    Look, I didn t know it was going to be 
                    her case.

                                  JT
                    But you knew she was a cop?  What, 
                    have you been keeping tabs on her? 

      Vincent reacts -- he clearly has, but he deflects --

                                    VINCENT
                    This had nothing to do with her.  I 
                    was trying to help some woman. 

      JT stops, looks at him, wondering... 

                                    VINCENT
                    Don t even.

                                  JT
                    I didn t say anything.

                    I m not new to this.  But it s like 
                    I m a prisoner here.

                                  JT
                    Really?  What prisoner do you know has 
                    a Wii?  And by the way, you re the one 
                    who stopped working on an antidote.

                    expecting a different result!

      JT sees Vincent s nearing his boiling point.  Backs off:

                    Okay, okay...  

      A long beat, as Vincent struggles to regain control.

                    both dead men.  And I don t mean on a piece 
                    of paper dead.  I mean dead.  Like dead

                    Just give  em time to figure out their

                    Which I totally appreciate, but right 
                    now, all I have are a dead guy s prints,

                    No!  Evan, come on, you re my secret 
                    weapon.  You have DNA?  Cause of death?

                                  EVAN
                    Flight Attendant, and she s been 
                    relocated to Dallas.  Okay, head wounds 
                    were too superficial to have killed 
                    her.  No other signs of major trauma, 
                    but she does have dark postmortem 
                    lividity, which you get with low

                    Or maybe poisoning, she s got some 
                    rash.  But here s the weird part.  
                    Bruised sternum, cracked ribs.  You 
                    see that from CPR sometimes.

                                  CATHERINE
                    So someone tried to save her?  Why 
                    wouldn t they have stuck around?

                    Well, you were right about it not being 
                      a robbery.  Guy at the newsstand near 
                    the Royalton turned in a cosmetic bag 
                    and Taylor s wallet, filled with cash.

                                  CATHERINE
                    So she was attacked outside, that s why her

                    Busy.  Stressed.  Normal.  She d just 
                    landed this promotion, Managing 
                    Editor.  Finally gotten what she d

                    You two were high-powered.  That can 
                    be hard on a marriage.  
                          (re: PRINTS of a MODEL)
                    And you re clearly surrounded by a lot

                    You think -- ?  This is nothing, it s 
                    just work, but Taylor... my life 
                    doesn t work without her...

                                  CATHERINE
                    Mr. Webster, you said Taylor just got 
                      a promotion.  You think that might ve 
                    earned her any enemies?  

                                  ALEX
                    I guess, it s fashion, but you should 
                    talk to her assistant Emily.  Taylor 
                    and I tried not to bring work home.

                    Before I went to my studio, I stopped by.  
                    Taylor and I are -- were, on the Board.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I ve heard of it.  Amazing 
                      organization.  I m so sorry for your 
                    loss.

      Off Catherine, knowing what it s like to lose a loved one...

      INT. PRECINCT - CATHERINE S CUBICLE - DAY

      Taylor s teary-eyed assistant EMILY SILBERT, 20s, rummages 
      through her PURSE, searching as Catherine slides a BOX of 
      TISSUES towards her.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Seems like they were a great couple.

                                  EMILY
                    Taylor adored Alex.  And I would know, 
                    I was privy to everything...  

      ...pulls out MAKE UP BAG, GUM, SALTINES...

                                  CATHERINE
                    You have a sleeping bag in there?

                                  EMILY
                      I probably should, it s a 24-7 gig.

                                  CATHERINE
                    So, Emily, did Taylor have any rivals, 
                    enemies? 

                                  EMILY
                    No, everyone loved her.  Here it is...

                                  CATHERINE
                    Thank you.  Because Alex mentioned she 
                    just got a big promotion.  Was anyone 
                    jealous, or up for that job too?

                                  EMILY
                    I don t know, maybe the Beauty Editor, 
                    but everyone else was really excited 
                    for her.

                    deserved the job, but I m sorry, 
                    Taylor was the Fashion Editor.

                    I m not really familiar with Vogue

                                  EMILY
                    Okay, Taylor oversaw the clothing, the 
                    shoes, the handbags.  Chloe was just 
                    in charge of make up and products.  
                    That s like at Playboy, being in 
                    charge of the articles.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Got it.  So, did Chloe ever threaten

                    It s from that hair sample on Taylor. 
                    I m sure it doesn t mean anything, the 
                      Mass-Spec s probably just dirty, but I 
                    know what you told me about the sample 
                    from your mom s case --

                          (stunned)
                    ...can I keep this..?

                                  EVAN
                    Sure, but Cat, it s nothing.  I just 
                    wanted to give you a heads-up.  

      INT. CATHERINE & HEATHER S APT - CATHERINE S ROOM - NIGHT 

      Catherine clearly doesn t think it s nothing.   Armed with the 
      REPORT, she cross-references PAPERS, FILES, the SURVEILLANCE 
      FOOTAGE on her LAPTOP when Heather enters, all dressed up --

                    dessert, so this better be good.

                          (pausing the PLAYBACK)
                    It s really good.  Turns out, I m not 
                    crazy.  Here.  

      Catherine hands her a DNA REPORT.  

                                    HEATHER
                    I have no idea what this is --  
                          (re: surveillance footage)
                    And what is that?

                                  CATHERINE
                      Surveillance footage from my case.
                          (excited)
                    But that is a DNA report from a hair 
                    sample on the victim. 

                                    HEATHER
                    And Mom s files are out... why? 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Because it s the exact same animal-
                    human DNA they found on Mom s killers.

      Heather s concerned, realizing where this might be going: 

                                    HEATHER
                    So, it s contaminated too...?

                                  CATHERINE
                    That s what everyone thinks but --

                                    HEATHER
                    -- They don t think it, Cat, they know 
                    it.  The sample from mom s killers was 
                    taken from the woods after a wolf attack.

                                  CATHERINE
                    But the percentages aren t kind of the 
                    same, they re exactly the same.  What 
                    are the chances?  

                                    HEATHER
                    I don t know.  Maybe Taylor encountered 
                    a wolf too --

                                  CATHERINE
                    I know, crazy, but I also know what I 
                    saw.  I mean, nothing about Mom s murder 
                    made sense.  A car-jacking?  Those guys 
                    came at us like hired killers.

                                    HEATHER
                    Maybe it s easier to think that, because

                    Okay.  But you might feel better if 
                    you call Dad yourself, tell him he s a 
                    shmuck for not calling. 

      Catherine manages a smile.  Heather heads out.  Alone, she 
      turns back to the torn REPORT, starts picking up pieces when

                    planning the big party, I didn t even 
                    think twice about it...  I will try to 
                    be there, but I actually gotta run.  
                    Kind of a stake-out situation.  Tell 
                    Hilary,  yay  for me.  Okay, bye!  

      She clicks off, glad that s over with.  She steps out, when 
      RING again!  She answers, assuming it s Dad again --

                                  CATHERINE
                    I know, no jeans --

      But it s not Dad, it s...

                    Who doesn t want you in jeans?   

      Catherine growing quiet as she approaches the warehouse --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Tess, hey.  My Dad -- actually his 
                    future bride, long story. What s up?

                                  TESS
                    JT s car, you left me a message.  Nice 
                    catch, by the way, but I just spoke to 
                    his boss.  He says JT was at his 
                    office that night.  And it s nowhere 
                    near the Royalton.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Really?

                                  TESS
                    Yeah.  Why are you whispering?

      Cat stops, see there s no Hatchback here today as...

                    Uh, JT s warehouse.  Couldn t sleep, 
                    thought I d check it out.

      INT. CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE - DAY  

      Catherine KNOCKS at the  Office  door -- 

                                  CATHERINE
                    NYPD, I ve got a warrant.

      Nothing, until a faint CREAK from a floorboard.  She stops.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Mr. Forbes?  
                          (then)
                    Mr. Forbes, I know you re in there, I 
                    can hear you.  

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    He s at work. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    O-kay...  So, who re you?

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                          (beat)
                    A friend.

                                  CATHERINE 
                    You have a name?

      INT. CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE - VINCENT S LOFT - INTERCUT

      It s Vincent.  He stands there, frozen, a deer in headlights.

                                  CATHERINE 
                    Okay, look, you clearly don t want 
                    people to know you re here, but you 
                    don't open up, there's gonna be a 
                    whole squad of us.

      Finally, the door OPENS.  Vincent stays hidden behind it as 
      Catherine enters, surprised to find a normal living space -- 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Anyone else here?

      -- she glances at him, but he s stepped back into a shadow, 
      avoiding being recognized.  

                                    VINCENT
                    No.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  28.

      CONTINUED:

      She looks around, assessing the danger level as... 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Any idea why your friend s car was at 
                    the Royalton Hotel last night?

      He watches her, muscles tensing...  

                                    VINCENT
                    He didn t do anything.

      She turns at this, he knows about the case.  Then -- 

                                  CATHERINE
                    How do you know?

      -- he averts his gaze, heart pounding, brow sweats...

                                  CATHERINE
                    Sir?  
                          (a beat, no response)
                    I asked you a question.

      He could kill her and avoid discovery, but instead -- he 
      steps into the light.  A beat as she realizes, oh my God --

                                  CATHERINE
                    You re Vincent Koslow.
                          (then)
                    Why aren t you dead?

      Obviously too loaded a question.  Vincent deflects: 

                                    VINCENT
                    I didn t kill her.

                                  CATHERINE
                    But your prints...

                                    VINCENT
                    I was out driving.  Saw her trip.
                    She fell, hit her head.

      Catherine looks at him, it s consistent with what they know.  

                                    VINCENT
                    She was bleeding, disoriented.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    So you followed her.  You re the guy 
                    in the hoodie.  

                                    VINCENT
                    I tried to resuscitate her.
                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  29.

                    I called 911.  She d been poisoned.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Poisoned?  How do you know that?  

                                    VINCENT
                    Your phone.

      She stops, realizes her cell is BUZZING in her pocket.  She 
      looks at him, intrigued he could hear it, then answers:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Hey, has tox come back yet?

      INT. MORGUE - INTERCUT  

      It s Evan. 

                                  EVAN
                    Our telepathy is working.  Positive 
                    for lethal levels of nicotine, and she 
                      definitely wasn t a smoker.

                                  CATHERINE
                          (looking at Vincent)
                    So she was poisoned.

                                    VINCENT
                    Ask about truffles.

                                  CATHERINE
                          (confused)
                    Uh, any sense of what she ate?  Maybe 
                    chocolate or -- 

      Vincent shakes his head as:

                                  EVAN
                    No, but her stomach contents showed 
                    some kind of mushroom -- 

                      CATHERINEEVAN
          (quietly, to Vincent)-- but I don t think that s 
      That kind of truffle --the source of the nicotine. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Thanks for the update.

                    case.  Call you later. 

      With that, she CLICKS OFF, looks at Vincent:

                                  CATHERINE
                    How do you know all of this if you 
                    didn t kill her?

                                    VINCENT
                    Good sense of smell.

                                  CATHERINE
                    You could smell what she ate?

                          (intently)
                    I didn t hurt her.  

      Catherine sees something in his eyes, an honesty.

                                  CATHERINE
                    And you couldn t stick around because 
                    everyone thinks you re dead.
                          (then)
                    There was a hair, matches DNA from a 
                    murder case nine years ago.  Last night, 
                    did you see anything... strange or...? 

      Vincent looks away.  She follows his gaze, then stops, 
      noticing the NEWSPAPER CLIPPING -- moves to it -- Vincent 
      quickly tries to beat her to it -- 

                                    VINCENT
                    I was just cleaning up --

                      Catherine!

      It s Tess, from outside.  Vincent looks at her, pleading.

                                    VINCENT
                    No one can know I m here.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Then tell me why you have that clipping.

                    truffles?   

                                  TESS
                    Joe, it s not a tuna fish sandwich.  
                    You eat truffles on special occasions, 
                    like a date.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    But we know she wasn t with her 
                    husband, and there s nothing in her 
                    calendar.  This was a woman who put 
                      everything in her calendar, except the 
                    day she died.

                                  TESS
                    Not to mention, there was no activity 
                    on her credit cards.

                                  JOE
                    You think she was having an affair.
                    So much for the perfect couple.  So, 
                    who s the Other Man?  Dead guy?  

      Catherine stops, unsure how to respond...

                                  TESS
                    That we haven t quite cracked.  Or why his 
                    former roommate s car was on the scene --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Doesn t matter who was on the scene.  
                    It s a poisoning. 
                          (gesturing to the TIMELINE)
                    Now, we know from her doorman she was 
                    home until six. 

                                  TESS
                    And was dead by 8:30, so it was 
                    probably something in the apartment.

                    through everything.  Hate to say it, but 
                    perfect husband had perfect access.

                    Okay, you know my sister does PR for 
                    cosmetic brands?  She s always sending 
                    products to magazines, where they keep 
                    them in these huge closets.  So, if you 
                    work there, you get it all for free.  

                                  TESS
                    Meaning, whatever Taylor has at home 
                    likely came from the beauty closet?

                                  CATHERINE
                    Which is run by the Beauty Editor.

                    Rival s better than truffles.

      INT. VOGUE - BEAUTY CLOSET - DAY

      Okay, closet is a misnomer.  This is a huge room lined with 
      shelves, packed with every BEAUTY PRODUCT imaginable.  

      Catherine and Tess talk to CHLOE LONDON, 30s, as her 
      ASSISTANT re-stocks shelves.

                    Anyone who works here has access, but 
                    they have to go through me.

      Catherine spots a CLIPBOARD hanging near the doorway --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Is that a sign-out sheet?

      -- but Chloe has already taken off.  Tess follows as  --

                    Ms. London, we re not done yet. 

      Catherine takes the SHEET, puts it in her bag as we go to:

                    -- What about Taylor s promotion?

                    You think that s what this is about?

                    Well, we know you were gunning for it.

                     Gunning for it?   Lemme explain 
                      something.  Beauty Editor is a coveted 
                    title.  My ad revenue was triple 
                    Taylor s for the past three issues.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Sounds competitive.

      Chloe stops just outside an office.

                                  CHLOE
                    Look, I may not have loved her, but I 
                    didn t kill her.  These shoes? Don t 
                    tell anyone, but I bought them because

                    people were gonna wear next season.  
                    Used to drive me nuts. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Used to?  

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah, up until a few weeks ago when 
                    she totally checked out.  It s like, 
                    she worked her ass off to beat me out 
                    of this promotion, then she started 
                    missing meetings, taking personal 
                    days...

                    Look, I admired her, but it's not like 
                    we shared  feelings .  

      Just then, Emily approaches, holding MOVING BOXES.  To 
      Catherine and Tess:

                    Oh, hey.
                          (then, to Chloe)
                    Where do you want these?

                                  CHLOE
                    Just set them down in my office.

      Emily heads in.  Catherine and Tess share a glance.

                    Is Emily working for you now?

      PERSONAL ITEMS are out -- NOTEBOOKS, PHOTO PROOFS, HAND CREAM

      Catherine picks up Taylor s framed WEDDING PHOTO.

                    -- maybe that s why Taylor was

      She steps away as Tess watches, intrigued... 

      Out of Tess  earshot, Catherine continues by a FLATSCREEN:

      Before he can pull the trigger, her cop-training kicks in -- 
      she KNEES him in the groin -- he doubles-over -- she REACHES

      her to the ground, is about to shoot when--

      CRUSHED, LIMBS being TORN, FANGS RIPPING at FLESH -- and 
      then, just as suddenly, the SOUNDS are cut-short.  He tosses 
      the Agent s limp, mauled body onto the TRACK.  

      Catherine stares, stunned, shell-shocked.  There, before her, 
      though it s barely lit, is the Beast from her memories.  But 
      before she can speak, he races off into the TUNNELS...  

      But she's not that same girl she was back then.  She's a cop, 
      and she's not going to let him get away this time.  She grabs

      bluish glow on the TRACK.  Catherine races along the narrow 
      side path, calling out into the winding tunnel --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Hey!  I know you re in here!

      No response.  She runs on, arriving at an intersection. 
      RUMBLINGS of TRAINS echo from every direction, disorienting 
      her when -- a SHADOW DARTS across one of the tunnels --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Hey!

      She tears after him, but TRIPS hard, narrowly missing the Third 
      Rail.  BLOOD OOZES from her knee. Before she can pick herself up -- 

      -- A LIGHT suddenly upon her, an ONCOMING TRAIN!  Catherine s 
      frozen, paralyzed with fear as the train BARRELS towards her when--  

      -- SOMETHING grabs her from above, yanking her out of the way 
      just in time.  His face inches away, body pressed against 
      hers, HEAT between them, the TRAIN blasts past them.  

      Now that he s this close, and the flickering LIGHTS from the TRAIN 
      passing by illuminate his face, she realizes, even though the 
      fangs and glowing eyes are gone, it's Vincent.  She stares, then: 

                                  CATHERINE
                    You re him.

      INT. CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE - VINCENT'S ROOM - NIGHT

      Lights are low, everything s quiet.  Catherine watches Vincent 
      doctor her knee, gently covering it with gauze.  He applies a last 
      piece of tape.  A beat, then:

                                  CATHERINE
                    So, are we gonna talk about it?

                                    VINCENT
                    You need to keep this clean and dry.

                                  CATHERINE
                      Avoidance.  One of my favorite techniques.   

                                    VINCENT
                    I think you should go.

                                  CATHERINE
                    How about a drink?  Can you drink?  

                                    VINCENT
                    Not such a good idea.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Maybe not for you --

                                    VINCENT
                    Look, my roommate s home, and --

                                  CATHERINE
                    I ll be quiet.  It s just, after what 
                    happened -- 
                          (off him)
                    Not that we re talking about it.  But 
                    someone did just try to kill me, and a 
                    train almost pancaked me. 

                                    VINCENT
                    I think we ve got beer.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Great.  

      He heads out to get her a drink, she scans his room.  Sees 
      his science equipment, fiddles with a BUNSEN BURNER as --

                                    VINCENT
                    Just a hobby --

      She whirls around, almost caught.  He hands her a BEER.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Oh?  Is that what happened (to you)...?
                          (off him)
                    I didn t mean to... 
                          (changing the subject)
                    Just, my mom used to have stuff like this 
                    around too.  She was a vascular surgeon, 
                    used to do research.  She s the one --

                                    VINCENT
                    I know.  

      She sees he s not giving up anymore.  Another awkward beat.   

                                  CATHERINE
                    Sorry.  I don t get to talk about her 
                    that much.  

                                    VINCENT
                    What was she like?
                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  42.

                                  CATHERINE
                    She was the best person I knew.  Always 
                    doing pranks.  She d have us smell what 
                    she was baking, and then shove it in our 
                    faces.  Which is really funny when you re 
                    ten.  But she was also really demanding.  
                    I had to have like five jobs every summer.  
                    She wanted us to be be self-sufficient.  

                                    VINCENT
                    It worked.

                                  CATHERINE
                    How about you?  What happened?  I 
                    won t tell anyone.

                                    VINCENT
                    You can t know.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I already kinda do.

      She sees he s softening.  Tentatively:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Did someone do this to you?

      He takes a beat, can he trust her?  He takes the leap, nods.

                                    VINCENT
                      I should ve asked questions... but I 
                    was too angry.

      And we FLASHBACK to...

      INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL ER - SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

      Vincent, 20s, in SCRUBS, tends to PATIENTS, covered in DUST.  
      In the bg, a TV plays breaking news. An ATTENDING approaches:

                                  ATTENDING
                    Any word from your brothers?

                                    VINCENT
                    They re still trying to get everyone out.

      The Attending gives Vincent a sympathetic pat, then moves on to 
      help others.  Vincent turns to the TV, as a TOWER comes down...

                    So you enlisted.

                                    VINCENT
                    Yeah, but once I got over there, I was 
                    tapped.  They said I was gonna have 
                    the chance to be part of something 
                    great, that I could make a difference.  
                    It was called Operation Muirfield.

      Vincent waits in line with 10 SOLDIERS, the best of the best.

      He moves to the front, takes his SHIRT off, sits on an EXAM

                    Like I said, I should ve asked questions.  
                    All I know is they changed our DNA.

      EXT. AFGHANISTAN VILLAGE - DAY

      Images of a village decimated by what looks like a wild 
      animal attack: empty streets, SHREDS of clothing streaked 
      with blood BLOW in the WIND, one landing on a mauled body as:

      EXT. AFGHANISTAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

      Amongst rocks we can just make out Vincent's eyes, which GLOW 
      LIKE A CAT'S as he crouches, hiding.  Nearby, the sound of a 
      CONVOY, then GUNSHOTS.  Vincent grimaces from fear&

                    You did, you saved me.  And you tried

                    So, my mom -- 

      Just then, the SOUND of a SHOWER RUNNING.  Outside, a new 
      day.  Vincent s whole demeanor changes. 

                                    VINCENT
                    You have to leave.

                      Catherine, I ve told you more than I 
                    should.  That Agent on the platform was 
                    from Muirfield.  You re on their radar.

      The SHOWER SHUTS OFF --

                    You can t come back.  It s too 
                      dangerous.  For both of us. 

      He CLOSES the door and we STAY with Catherine, holy shit.

      INT. CATHERINE'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

      The door OPENS.  Catherine creeps in oh-so-quietly, when 
      Heather bounds out, cell in hand -- 

                                    HEATHER 
                    Where have you been?! I ve been

                                                  to voicemail.

      Catherine rummages through her BAG, then realizing:

                    I lost it, I lost my phone.

                    The sex glow.
                          (into phone)
                    She just walked in, looking like the 
                    Zeke Walk of Shame.  

                                    HEATHER
                    Yeah, I ll tell her.
                          (clicks off, to Catherine)
                      Apparently, Evan s been trying to 
                    reach you too.

      INT. PRECINCT - MORGUE - DAY

      Evan, surrounded by BEAUTY PRODUCTS, looks at something under 
        a MICROSCOPE as Catherine enters --

                    Evan, I am so sorry.

                    Oh, hey.  It s fine --

                    -- No, I totally flaked --

                    Cat, I flaked back.  I got called in.

                          (off the PRODUCTS)
                    Wait, are those Taylor s?  Did you 
                    find the poison?

                                  EVAN
                    No, and my guys have been through 
                      everything from her apartment.

                                  CATHERINE
                    What about a pregnancy test?

                                  EVAN
                    Negative, but I do have these, 
                    straight from our Power Couple s bed.

      Evan shows her a JAR of BUGS.  Catherine recognizes them --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Bed bugs.

                                  EVAN
                    Yep.  That rash I showed you was 
                    actually bites, and since they re 
                      disgusting, and live on human blood --

                    Maybe we can track down Truffle Guy.

                    I know, I m your secret weapon.

      She turns, starts to go, when --

                    Hey, you haven t seen that hair sample 
                    from Taylor s case, have you?

                                  CATHERINE
                    What? 

                                  EVAN
                    I want to re-test it.  But I haven t seen 
                    it since I showed you that report.

                                  CATHERINE
                    No, I don t have it, why?

                                  EVAN 
                    Just, this case I got called in on last 
                    night, guy got run over by the F train --  

      A sharp intake of breath as Catherine s night rushes back to her.

                                  EVAN
                    Yeah, pretty intense, but --  

                                  CATHERINE
                    You know who he was?  

                                  EVAN
                    No, waiting on dental records, but... 
                    Look, initial testing on some fibers 
                    show similar human-animal DNA, and... I 
                    know I ve been dismissing it for years, 
                    that thing you saw with your mom, but --

                                  CATHERINE
                    -- Evan, it was PTSD.  I compared the 
                    report you gave me to the one from my Mom s 
                    case, it s totally different.  You just 
                    need to clean your mass specu-thingie.

      INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - DAY

      Catherine marches over to Tess s desk -- 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Found the murder weapon.

      -- and sets three bottles of BEAUTY PRODUCTS down.

                                  TESS
                    This is why I don t use product.

                                  CATHERINE
                    No, it s what s not here that s 
                      important.  Evan tested everything from 
                    the apartment, all negative.  But look...
                          (re: Beauty Closet Sign-
                            Out)
                    Taylor signed out four products the day 
                    before she died.  Our guys only found 
                    these three, the killer probably took the 
                    fourth.

                                  TESS
                    So someone put poison in Taylor s... 
                          (off the Sign-Out Sheet)
                      ...L Oreal Sunlit blonde?

                          (off the label)
                    It sits on your scalp for thirty minutes, 
                    plenty of time for the nicotine to be 
                    absorbed.  Taylor would ve had no idea.  

                                  TESS
                    Who did her hair?  She didn t have an 
                      appointment on her calendar.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I checked her phone records.  Cindy 
                      Moynihan s listed on the masthead as 
                    hair stylist, Taylor called her twice 
                    that morning.  

      The two Detectives look at each other.  Finally a lead.

                    When I got here at 5:30, she already 
                    had a bottle out and ready. 

                                    CATHERE
                    You don t happen to know where that

                                  CINDY
                    Probably still in her apartment where I 
                    left it.

                                  TESS
                    You always do Taylor s hair at her place? 

                                  CINDY
                    Fashion editor at Vogue?  She didn t 
                    have time to come down to the studio. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Anyone know you were coming over?  
                    Work, her husband?  

                                  CINDY
                    I don t know, it was a last minute 
                      appointment.  I was completely booked, 
                    but she said she needed to look extra-
                    fabulous. 

                                  TESS
                          (quietly to Catherine)
                    Truffle Date?

                                  CATHERINE
                    Cindy, did Taylor say where she was 
                    going or who she was meeting?    

                                  CINDY
                    No, she was actually sort of coy about 
                    her plans, but her Pilates instructor 
                    was just leaving when I got there. 

                                  MARNIE (PRELAP)
                    Taylor s core strength was incredible. 

      INT. PILATES GYM - DAY

      Pilates teacher MARNIE is mid-interview with Catherine and 
      Tess, who s distracted by a WOMAN in odd poses on a REFORMER.

                                  MARNIE
                    She upped her sessions to 5 days a 
                    week.  That s the Supermodel schedule.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Sound like she was motivated to look 
                    good.  Think she was trying to impress 
                    someone?

                                  MARNIE
                    You mean other than her husband?  God, 
                    I hope so.  

                                  TESS
                    Why s that?

                                  MARNIE
                    Oh, I assumed that s why you re here.  

      A beat as Catherine and Tess look at her, realizing as --

                                  MARNIE
                    It was before I knew Taylor.  I mean, 
                    I knew Alex was married, but I was 
                    totally in love with him. 

                                  TESS
                    So he ended it?

                                  MARNIE
                    Said he couldn t leave her because of 
                    their Pre-Nup.  I guess if he cheats, 
                    he loses everything.  

      Catherine and Tess share a look: so much for perfect husband.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Marnie, we think Taylor might've been 
                    going to meet a date that night.  Did she 
                    say anything about where she was going?  

                                  MARNIE
                    She did ask me about a restaurant, 
                    something with a number in the name, 
                    52, 57?  When you re counting reps, 
                    it s kinda hard to focus.  

      INT. LOUNGE 47 - DAY

                    Well, Ms. Pilates may not follow Girl 
                    Code, but looks like she got us to the 
                    right place.  Second appetizer down.

      ANGLE ON THE SIGN --  Truffles Salad .  Just as a gorgeous

      The Hostess nods, wordlessly flips through a BOOK --

                                    HOSTESS
                    Nothing here, sorry.

      Catherine clocks a faint STAMP on her hand; Tess follows her 
      gaze.

                                  TESS
                    And you don t remember her name?

                    No, but I wasn t here Tuesday night.  
                    I called in sick.

                    Why, so you could go to the Operation 
                    Smile benefit?  Funny you wouldn t 
                    recognize her name then, she and her

                    coffee table. 

      The Hostess stammers, searching for a response... 


                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  53.

                    Taylor got her hair done, she d been 
                    working out for weeks... That s what 
                    you do when you know you re going to 
                    see the Other Woman --  

      Catherine looks at Tess, intrigued as...

                                  TESS
                    -- You were who Taylor was coming to 
                    see.  She wanted to confront the woman 
                    her husband was having an affair with.  

      The Hostess looks down at the STAMP, blinks back tears.

                                    HOSTESS
                    Alex told me not to say anything.   
                    Said I d look guilty.  But I didn't 
                    kill her, I swear.

                                  CATHERINE
                    No, you re just his motive.

      INT. PRECINCT - KITCHEN - EVENING

      Catherine and Tess fill Joe in as he takes his dinner out of 
      the MICROWAVE and settles in --

                                  TESS
                    We talked to the bartender who served 
                    her the truffles while she was 
                    waiting.  Said Taylor started feeling 
                    sick, left around 8:15.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Just over two hours after she d gotten 
                    her hair done.

                                  TESS
                    Ten minutes later we have her on security 
                    footage stumbling into the hotel. 

                                  JOE
                    So you have a time-line -- 

                                  CATHERINE
                    -- We have bed bug DNA --

                        JOECATHERINE
      I m eating ---- from seven different 
                                                  women.  The guy was a

                                  JOE
                    I keep telling Carla, no such thing as 
                    a perfect husband.

                                  TESS
                    Yeah, but you re not a killer.

      Joe shoots Tess a look as --

                                  CATHERINE
                    Joe, the guy had access and motive. 
                    He couldn t get out of his marriage 
                    because of the Pre-nup.  I say we 
                    bring him in.

                                  JOE
                    Except there was no Pre-nup. 
                          (then)
                    I re-read the forensic accounting 
                    report.  Nothing.  If he wanted out, 
                    all he had to do was file for divorce.  

      With that, Joe walks off.  On the two of them, frustrated...  

      EXT. PRECINCT/CITY STREET - LATER

      Catherine heads out alone, lost in thought as she starts down 
      the street when she stops at the sight of a MILITARY VAN  
      parked at the LOADING DOCK.  She watches as TWO SOLDIERS 
      carry a BODY BAG out of the Precinct.  

      She approaches, forcing a smile as they LOAD it onto the VAN:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Hey, don t see you guys around here 
                    too often.  What s going on?

      No response.  She flashes her BADGE.

                                  ARMY GUY #1 
                    Just following orders, Detective.  

      He shows Catherine TRANSFER ORDERS.  They re for  Agent 
      McCleary  -- holy shit, when she HEARS a POP --  

      She looks up, sees a silver-haired gentleman in a suit, SILVERFOX, 
      stepping out of the passenger side, who  pops  his gum.

                                  SILVERFOX 
                    Of course, we re going to need to take 
                    that back.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  55.

      CONTINUED:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Of course.  Just making sure you re 
                    not stealing a case.

                                  SILVERFOX
                    It s not polite to interfere with other 
                    people s affairs, Detective Chandler.

      With that, he steps back into the van.  Catherine watches 
      them pull away, utterly rattled.  How d he know her name?

      EXT. CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      Catherine, armed with a FLASHLIGHT, sees JT s HATCHBACK -- 
      Vincent s not alone.  She s about to leave, when -- 

                                    VINCENT (O.S.)
                    Hey.

                                  CATHERINE
                          (jumping, startled)
                    Oh my God, you scared me.

                                    VINCENT
                    You re the one snooping around my place.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Some military guys just showed up to take 
                    that agent from the platform away.

      Vincent stops at this --

                                    VINCENT
                    You didn t talk to them, did you?

                                  CATHERINE
                    I just asked what they were doing, but
                    I didn t tell them anything, I came 
                    straight here. 

                                    VINCENT
                    You shouldn t have done that.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I wanted to warn you.  I lost my phone 
                    on the platform, what if they have it?  
                    The guy knew my name.  

                                    VINCENT
                    This is why you have to stop all 
                    contact with me. 
                          (brow starting to SWEAT)
                    I knew last night was a mistake.  I 
                    never should ve let you stay.
                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  56.

                    really wanted me to go.

                                    VINCENT
                    I tried.

                    Look, it was one night, now you have 
                    to forget about me.

                                  CATHERINE
                    And my mom?

                                    VINCENT
                          (through gritted teeth)
                    I told you, I don t know anything.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    I don t believe you!

                    You don t get it, do you?!

                                  CATHERINE
                    I do, you can t tell me the whole 
                    story, which is fine, I don t need all 
                    the answers.  It s just, last night 
                    was the first time since my mother was 
                    killed that I haven t felt... crazy.

      That s it.  Vincent snaps, his eyes GLOW, CANINES appear --

                                    VINCENT
                    You are crazy!  Showing up here alone?  
                    I m a monster, I could kill you in 
                    less than a second!!  

      And to prove it, he picks up a RUSTED PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, 
      HURLS IT with INHUMAN SPEED and STRENGTH, a BLUR of MOTION -- 
      it TEARS through the CONCRETE with a sickening CRUNCH.  

      She stands there, frozen.  He turns to her with a roar: 

                                    VINCENT
                    Go!!!

      Catherine runs off, scared, humiliated, hurt, and we...

                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      Catherine sits across from Alex, who s flanked by his LAWYER.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I know guys like you.  I usually date 
                    guys like you.  Handsome, successful... 
                    You re even philanthropic. 

                                  LAWYER
                    Are you hitting on my client?

                                  CATHERINE
                    But you re really just a jerk.  A 
                    monster.  

                                  ALEX
                    I didn t kill my wife -- 

                                  LAWYER
                    Alex, you don t have to respond to 
                      name-calling.

                                  CATHERINE
                    How about hard facts?  I know of two 
                    women you slept with during your 
                    marriage, and I have a jar of bed bug 
                    DNA proving at least seven more.

                                  LAWYER
                    Since when s adultery against the law?

                                  JOE (PRELAP)
                    What the hell is she doing?

      INT. PRECINCT - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM - INTERCUT

      It s Joe, who joins Tess at the one-way mirror. 

                                  TESS
                    Cracking the case.  

                                  JOE
                    What d she bring him in on?  I told her --

                                  TESS
                    Just listen.

      Joe turns to watch, skeptical but intrigued.  BACK TO:



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  58.

                                  CATHERINE
                    You probably made every one of your women 
                    fall in love with you, and believe you 
                    loved them back.  That the only thing 
                    standing in the way of their fairy tale 
                    ending was this  Prenup .  
                          (then)
                    And what I realized last night is, when 
                    you ve fallen for someone, you can do 
                    crazy things.  Mr. Webster, you gave 
                    every mistress you ever had a motive.  I 
                    don t think you killed your wife.  But 
                    you are the reason she s dead.  Pretty 
                    monstrous in my book. 

      This lands on Alex.  Catherine reaches for PEN and PAPER.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I need a list.  Everyone you ve ever 
                    slept with during your marriage.  You 
                    owe it to Taylor.

      Alex nods, shaken, ashamed, he starts writing, Tess turns to Joe --

                                  TESS
                    You were saying?

      Joe shrugs, impressed.  He s not saying anything now.

      INT. VOGUE - HALLWAY - DAY

      Catherine and Tess stride down the hall with purpose.  Emily, 
      in front of Chloe s new office, sees them approach.

                                  EMILY
                    Hey.  Chloe s upstairs going over 
                    Taylor s tribute pages.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Actually, we want to talk to you.

      INT. VOGUE - CHLOE'S OFFICE - DAY

      Catherine and Tess settle in as Emily nervously busies 
      herself, neatening up.

                                  EMILY
                    Can I get you something?  Pellegrino?  
                    Soda?

                                  TESS
                    We re good, thanks.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Look, Emily, we appreciate how helpful 
                    you ve been, but one thing you forgot 
                    to mention is your affair with Alex.

      Emily stops, stunned.

                                  TESS
                    The missing pregnancy tests, we 
                    assumed they were Taylor's, but you 
                    used them, didn t you?

                                  CATHERINE
                    That s why you had saltines in your 
                    purse.  And like you said, you were privy 
                    to everything.  Her office was your 
                    office, her key was your key, which you 
                    used to get in and out of her apartment, 
                    and forging her signature, part of the 
                    gig, isn t it?  You re probably good at 
                    Chloe s by now. 

                                  EMILY
                    I don t know what you re --

                    The Sign-Out Sheet.  
                          (shows it to her)
                    I m pretty sure if we showed it to an 
                    expert, they d confirm this was you 
                    signing out Taylor s hair color.

                                  EMILY
                    ...No, Chloe ran that closet... 

                                  CATHERINE
                    You wanted us to think it was her.  And 
                    with Taylor gone, you and Alex could run 
                    off into the sunset.  But you fell for 
                    the wrong guy.  There was no Pre-nup.

                    He lied.  Just like he lied to all his 
                    women, including the one he was with the 
                    night you killed Taylor.

                    make sure the DA knows how remorseful 
                    you are.

      Emily nods, breaking down.  Catherine approaches, puts an arm 
      around her as Tess CUFFS her... 

      INT. PRECINCT - HALLWAY - DAY

      Elevator doors open. Tess and Catherine step out, bump into Evan --

                                  EVAN
                    Hey, it s Devil and Prada.  Nice work.

                                  TESS
                    As long as I get to be Devil.
                          (to Catherine)
                    I m gonna go call sanitation.  See if 
                    they can find me some Sunlit Blonde.  
                      A sentence I never thought I d utter.

      With that, Tess peels off, Evan turns to Catherine:

                                  EVAN
                    I m not letting you celebrate your big 
                    case alone at your Dad s engagement 
                    party.

                                  CATHERINE
                    You gonna come up with some great 
                    excuse to get me out of it?

                                  EVAN
                    No, I cancelled my plans and I m 
                      volunteering to be your plus one.  
                    What s the dress code?

                                  CATHERINE
                    Evan, you don t have to do that.

                                  EVAN
                    Oh, come on, free drinks and I m 
                    assuming vapid step-mom insisted on a 
                    really good caterer.

      She stops, looks at him, sensing something.  Gingerly:


                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  61.

                          (this isn t a date, right?)
                    You re just doing this out of --

                                  EVAN
                    Charity.  Poor little single girl.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    Tess told you about Zeke?  

                                  EVAN
                    No, Joe did. 

                                  CATHERINE
                    Joe?  How does Joe know?  

                                  EVAN
                    I don t know, but wouldn t ask him now.  
                    He s digesting the fact the department 
                    has to shell out for a new mass-spec.
                          (off her look)
                    You were right.  As usual.  I took a 
                    look back at some cases.  Six samples, 
                    all with the same corrupted DNA.  

      INT. PRECINCT - CATHERINE'S CUBICLE - DAY

      CLOSE ON a computer SCREEN of DNA REPORTS (charts with columns of 
      numbers and symbols).  Catherine s at her desk, looking at the 
      corrupted cases -- moved by what she s reading as Tess arrives --

                                  TESS 
                    I have something of yours.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Oh, hey.

      Catherine subtly blocks the screen as Tess hands over her CELL.

                                  TESS
                    One of the guys investigating that 
                    subway case found it on the platform.

                                  CATHERINE
                          (flooded with relief)
                    Oh my god, thank you so much.  

                                  TESS
                    It s just a phone.  Are we okay?

                                  CATHERINE
                    What?  No, of course.  I m just happy 
                    to get it back.

                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  62.

                                  TESS
                    You ve been having secret conversations, 
                    you executed that search without me, and 
                    what were you doing on the F train?
                          (off Catherine fumfering)
                    You know what, you don t have to tell 
                    me.  I just want you to know I m here, 
                    no judgments, if you ever wanna talk. 

      Catherine nods, grateful.  Tess heads off.  A beat, then:

                                  CATHERINE
                    Hey, did you tell Joe about Ze -- 

      She trails off, seeing Tess join Joe, an intimate look 
      between them as they head out.  Off Catherine, hunh.  She 
      then turns back to the DNA REPORTs and we go to...

      INT. CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      Catherine, all dressed up, KNOCKS on the  Office  DOOR.  

                                  JT (O.S.)
                    Hello? 

                                  CATHERINE
                    It s Catherine.
                          (no response, then)
                    Detective Chandler?

      The door OPENS just slightly.  JT stands there, baffled.

                                  CATHERINE
                    I need to talk to Vincent.

      Before JT can manage a response, Vincent approaches --

                                    VINCENT
                    Let her in.

      Catherine pushes he way past JT, into...

      INT. CHEMICAL WAREHOUSE - VINCENT'S LIVING SPACE - CONTINUOUS

      ...and walks up to Vincent.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Hi.

      Meanwhile, JT stands there, reeling at their familiarity. 

                                  JT
                    Hi?  Hi?  Did I miss something? 

                                                                              (CONTINUED)    "Beauty & the Beast" - Pilot Episode - 2nd Network Draft  63.

                                    VINCENT
                    JT, you mind?

      JT, head about to explode, heads off.  Vincent s distracted, 
      taking her in.  She s beautiful.

                                    VINCENT
                    You look...

                                  CATHERINE
                    I have an engagement party.  
                          (then)
                    Look, I know you re gonna try to kick 
                    me out.  I get it.  I get what it s 
                    like to hide out and push people away 
                    because you don t feel deserving. 
                          (then)
                    You know why I keep asking about my Mom?  
                    Because I m the reason she s dead.  I 
                    left the stupid vanity mirror open that 
                    night.  If I hadn t been putting on 
                    lipgloss, she d still be here today. 
                          (then)
                    But Vincent, I just found six cases of 
                    you trying to save victims around the 
                    city, even though you re putting yourself 
                    at risk.  You re not a monster.  And I 
                    would know.  Plenty of guys out there 
                    are, but you... you re like a superhero.

      Vincent laughs.

                                  CATHERINE
                    You are.  You saved me.  Twice.  

                                    VINCENT
                    You re not the reason your mom s dead.
                    They were tracking her.  I don t know 
                    why, but... 

      Catherine fights back tears.

                                    VINCENT
                    It wasn t the vanity mirror.  

      They look at each other, and for the first time, feel understood, 
      and seen.  MUSIC RISES, Adele s  Someone Like You , and we go to:

      Evan approaches, two DRINKS in hand, smile on his face.  She 
      smiles back, but he s not Vincent.  

      She sips her DRINK, looks around, spots Heather with her

      Heather waves it off, gives her a warm sisterly embrace, when 
      they re interrupted by their father, STEPHEN CHANDLER --

                    not crazy.

      She starts moving to the music, but as she glances out the 
      window, we know she s distracted, thinking of Vincent.

                                  CATHERINE (V.O.)
