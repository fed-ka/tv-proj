                         I'm Jimbo Kern and this here is Ned. 
                         Say hi, Ned.

                                     NED
                         Hi, Ned.

                                     JIMBO
                         HAAAAA!!! HAA-HAA!!! Now isn't that 
                         great?!

               Jimbo looks to the camera guy who gives Jimbo a 'thumbs up' 
               As Jimbo talks, titles come up "Pussy Law #4: No animal shall 
               be harmed even in self defense, unless specific license and 
               season is in order. Self defense can only be justified by 
               extreme provable peril and or documented visible bodily harm.

                                     JIMBO
                         We have a terrific show for you today. 
                         We're gonna kill some Elk and we're 
                         gonna kill some Mountain Goats. Now, 
                         the new law passed by Colorado 
                         legislature, which Ned and I call 
                         pussy law number FOUR -- states that 
                         we can no longer kill animals in 
                         defense. In other words, our old 
                         line of 'It's coming right for us'

                                     NED
                         It's coming right for us.

                                     JIMBO
                         -- No longer works. So now, we only 
                         kill animals to quote: "thin out 
                         their numbers". If we don't hunt, 
                         then these animals will grow too big 
                         in number and they won't have enough 
                         food. So you see? We have to kill 
                         animals or else they'll die.

               Jimbo and Ned have to just think about this one. The camera 
               guy scratches his head.

                                     JIMBO
                         Uhh... So roll the tape.


               We see a video image of Jimbo and Ned in full hunting gear.

                                     JIMBO (V.O.)
                         Here we are up at Schaeffer's 
                         Crossing, looking for some animals.

               Now we cut in to the video taped Jimbo and Ned.

                                     JIMBO
                         Lookie there, Ned! There's some 
                         deers!!

               A delicate grouping of five deer stand around eating grass.

                                     JIMBO
                         Quick, Ned! THIN OUT THEIR NUMBERS!!!

                                     NED
                         THIN OUT THEIR NUMBERS!

               Ned takes out his flame thrower and barbecues all five of 
               them. Their little deer skeletons fall to the ground.

                                     JIMBO
                         Good work, Ned! Now they won't starve!


               Back to the set. The boys are horrified.

                                     JIMBO
                         That sure was a great hunting trip. 
                         We saved those deer from extinction.

                                     NED
                         We're environmentalists.

                                     JIMBO
                         Coming up next, were going to drop 
                         some napalm on an unsuspecting family 
                         of beavers. And also try to thin out 
                         the numbers of some endangered 
                         species.


               Establishing.


               The camera shakes as if poorly hand-held. We see some trees.

                                     JIMBO
                         Now watch carefully, you're going to 
                         see the Mexican Staring Frog...

               After a few more seconds, a very brief, very faint blur goes 
               through the corner of the screen.

                                     JIMBO
                         THERE! THERE! DID YOU SEE IT?!?!


                                     JIMBO
                         ROLL THAT BACK AGAIN!!


               The same film, again we see the blur.

                                     JIMBO
                         NOW FREEZE IT!!

               It freezes into a bigger blur.


                                     JIMBO
                         Well, I'd like to know what all you 
                         skeptics have to say NOW!! What do 
                         you think Ned?

                                     NED
                         I'm scared.

                                     JIMBO
                         Well be sure to join us next time. 
                         Until then...
                              (singing)
                         We're so glad you spent your time 
                         with us, while we slaughtered our 
                         way through nature's guts, come again 
                         and stay a while, we'll kill a lot 
                         more living things and make them 
                         bleed.

                                     NED
                         Good night!

               The show ends.

                                     CAMERAGUY
                         And we're... CUT! Great show guys.

               Ned and Jimbo get up from their chairs and stretch.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh, lookie who's here! My little 
                         nephew Stanly!

               The boys walk over.

                                     JIMBO
                         So, you're interested in your Uncle 
                         Jimbo's big T.V. show, huh?

                                     STAN
                         No. We have to do a stupid report on 
                         Vietnam. You and Ned are the only 
                         guys we know who were there.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh. Yeah, we sure were.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Was it fun?

                                     KYLE
                         Cartman! What kind of stupid ass 
                         question is that?! Of course it was 
                         fun!

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not 
                         like going to the circus fun. Or 
                         flyfishing in Montana fun. No, Vietnam 
                         was more like shoving shards of broken 
                         glass up your ass and then sitting 
                         in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.

                                     STAN
                         Woa.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yepper, that's where me and Ned 
                         met....

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


               PAN ACROSS a very cliché Vietnam scene. 60's music plays in 
               the background, as helicopters and troops walk around. It is 
               a scene reminiscent of Platoon. Except that as the PAN 
               continues, we see that there is also a merry-go-round, a 
               beautiful garden with flowers, and a jolly log ride.

                                     JIMBO (V.O.)
                         I remember I had just gotten off the 
                         Ferris wheel...

               A younger Jimbo walks off a big colorful Ferris Wheel in the 
               middle of Camp.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh boy! What a gorgeous day!

               A bird flies down and lands on Jimbo's shoulder. It whistles 
               a merry tune.

               Jimbo whistles in return. (Like Snow White).

                                     SARGEANT
                         KERNS! Get over here!

               Jimbo walks over to a grouping of privates.

                                     SARGEANT
                         The new privates are here. I'm 
                         assigning one of them to you as a 
                         trainee. NED Gerblanksi!

               The privates part, and Ned steps out. He looks a little 
               different, he still has his arm and his beautiful voice.

                                     NED
                         Ned Gerblanksi reporting, sir.

                                     SARGEANT
                         Thanks Ned. The bad guys have been 
                         spotted about ten clicks north of 
                         here. I know that you and Kern are 
                         best suited to take them out. Are 
                         you up for it?

                                     JIMBO AND NED
                         Sir yes SIR!

                         And that's the way it happened, boys.

               The band ends with flourish. Fireworks go off behind the 
               set. Jesus looks around a little confused.

                                     JESUS
                         Uh... hi.

               The producer motions to Jesus to keep it going.

                                     BOB DENVER
                         Hi Jesus! Great to be here!

               An awkward silence. LONG silence.

                                     JESUS
                         So Bob... So you just get in town?

                                     BOB DENVER
                         Yes. Just got in.

               Another awkward silence.

                                     JESUS
                         So... So what've you been up to?

                                     BOB DENVER
                         Nothing. Nothing really at all.

               Yet another long beat. The Producer makes a gesture and the 
               band starts playing 'Nothing from Nothing'. Jesus looks 
               around.

                                     JESUS
                         Oh boy.


               Jimbo and Ned are on camera again.

                                     JIMBO
                         Welcome hunters! Boy have we got a 
                         show for you today! We have just 
                         received a tape from ANOTHER viewer 
                         who filmed the Mexican Staring Frog 
                         of Southern Sri Lanka RIGHT HERE IN 
                         SOUTH PARK!!

                                     NED
                         Agh!

                                     JIMBO
                         Yes, now we're about to roll the 
                         film, but remember, if you look the 
                         Mexican Staring Frog in the eyes, 
                         you can go catatonic. We don't know 
                         if this applies to PICTURES of the 
                         frog or not, but who wants to take 
                         chances? So when we roll this film, 
                         be sure to look away.

               Jimbo and Ned cover their eyes and look away from the video 
               screen.

                                     JIMBO
                         Okay, roll the film, Tom!

               FOOTAGE of an obviously fake little frog sitting on a front 
               porch. It just sits there. For a long time. It doesn't move.

               Jimbo and Ned keep their eyes off of it. The camera guy looks 
               away as well.

                                     JIMBO
                         Is it over?

               Jimbo sneaks a look at the screen just as the image 
               disappears.

                                     JIMBO
                         Okay, it's over.

               Everyone goes back to normal.

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, there you have it. Undeniable 
                         PROOF that the Mexican Staring Frog 
                         of Southern Sri Lanka exists!!!! And 
                         you saw it HERE on the Jimbo and Ned 
                         show!


               Kyle has a video camera.

                                     STAN
                         Ready you guys?

                         Okay? ACTION!!


               Through an unsteady videocamera, we see a blurry picture of 
               a small bush in the forest.

               Suddenly, it starts to shake slightly. Then, a dark blur 
               appears at one side of the screen behind the bush. It hops a 
               couple of times. Cartman is holding a stupid little plastic 
               frog on a string by the end of a stick.

                                     CARTMAN (O.S.)
                         Rrrrrr. I am the deadly Mexican 
                         Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. 
                         I am very scary and dangerous!

                         What?!

                                     STAN
                         It's supposed to be a frog!

                                     CARTMAN
                         I know that!

                                     STAN
                         Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         It's a Sri Lankan frog!

                                     KYLE
                         Der, Cartman!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Der yourself, hippie!

                                     KYLE
                         JUST DO IT AGAIN, CARTMAN, AND DON'T 
                         MAKE IT TALK!!

                                     STAN
                         Ok, here we go. Ready?

                                     KYLE
                         Are you ready, Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm ready, Steven Spielberg!

                                     STAN
                         Action!

               Cartman sloppily bounces his little frog up and down.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Rrrr... Screw you guys...


                                     CARTMAN
                         Why do I have to dress up like the 
                         old lady?!

               Indeed, Cartman has a little gray wig and a dress on. Kyle 
               has a video camera.

                                     KYLE
                         Cuz old lady's are fat and you are 
                         too!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ech, Goddammit!

                                     STAN
                         Come on Cartman, the way we're 
                         shooting this, nobody will ever know 
                         it's you.

                                     CARTMAN
                         They better not!

                                     STAN
                         Okay, when I yell action, you start 
                         to walk this way, then Kenny's going 
                         to pull the plastic frog in front of 
                         you and you have to be scared --

                                     CARTMAN
                         Scared? Of a plastic frog?

                                     STAN
                         It's ACTING Cartman. You have to 
                         pretend you're really scared then 
                         the Mexican Staring Frog will look 
                         you in the eyes, then you fall down 
                         like you're dead, okay? Ready?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Man this is stupid.

                                     STAN
                         Good, and... ACTION!


                                     JIMBO
                         Well, it appears as though a lot of 
                         you SKEPTICS thought that the film 
                         we showed of the Mexican Staring 
                         Frog Of Southern Sri Lanka was a 
                         FAKE. They say it didn't HARM 
                         anybody... Well, it just so happens 
                         that we just received ANOTHER film 
                         from ANOTHER anonymous viewer! ROLL 
                         IT!

               The shitty little film that the boys made appears on the 
               screen. The stupid plastic frog bounces through frame. It 
               then cuts to Cartman, as the old lady who sees the frog, and 
               then passes out. Then we see Kenny moon the camera.

                                     JIMBO
                         There you go! PROOF that not only is 
                         this frog REAL, but it is doing harm 
                         to people of South Park AS WE SPEAK!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Well that does it! All this week Ned 
                         and I will be risking life and limb 
                         as we go on location to HUNT THE

                                     CAMERA GUY
                         Yeah, it was left on our answering 
                         machine. All it said was that they 
                         saw the Mexican Staring Frog just 
                         south of Stark's pond this morning.

                                     JIMBO
                         Hey Ned, remember that time we got 
                         an anonymous tip back in Nam?

                         stationed?

                         Yup.

                                     CAMERA GUY
                         Man, I was in Tet. We had a badass 
                         roller coaster. But all we ever wanted 
                         was a log ride... We waited and we 
                         waited... But they never built us 
                         one.

               Jimbo and Ned look sad as they listen to the tale.

                                     CAMERA GUY
                         I think Danforth wanted a log ride 
                         more than anybody but he... He had 
                         to settle with that lame dinosaur 
                         water adventure ride...

               The cameraguy breaks down and starts crying. Jimbo puts a 
               hand on the cameraguy's shoulder.

               The boys are gathered in the forest. Kyle puts the little 
               plastic frog on a large rock in the middle of a clearing.

               crew pull up.

                         -- Jimbo, look.

               Ned points to a rock behind them all where the little plastic 
               frog sits motionless.

                                     JIMBO
                         HIT THE DECK!!!

               Everybody jumps to the ground.

                                     PRODUCER
                         What is it?

                                     JIMBO
                         It's him! The Mexican Staring Frog 
                         of Southern Sri Lanka! He's right 
                         over there on that rock!

                                     PRODUCER
                         He is?

               The producer peers up over the rock. Jimbo quickly yanks his 
               head back down.

                                     JIMBO
                         Dumbass! You've GOT to keep your 
                         eyes away from him! STAY DOWN! Ned, 
                         you take flank position, I'll try 
                         and keep it turned away from you.

                                     NED
                         Roger that.

                                     JIMBO
                              (into camera)
                         Hello fellow hunters. Have we got a 
                         show for you today! The Mexican 
                         Staring Frog is sunning itself on a 
                         rock directly behind us.

               Ned runs around and hides behind a tree, making sure the 
               whole time not to look at the little plastic frog.

                                     JIMBO
                         We've got to take the frog by 
                         surprise.

               Jimbo takes out a grenade.

                                     JIMBO
                         I'm going to create a diversion using 
                         this incendiary device, while Ned 
                         will ambush him from the rear.

               Jimbo throws the bomb over his shoulder. BOOOOM! It blows a 
               huge hole in the ground right next to the little plastic 
               frog.

                                     JIMBO
                         NOW NED! HE'S NOT LOOKING!!!

               Ned rushes in with the flamethrower.

                                     JIMBO
                         QUICK NED! HIT HIM WITH THE SHOTGUN! 
                         NOW NED!!!

               Nothing. No sound.

                                     JIMBO
                         Ned?!... Ned????

               Jimbo peeks over to the rock. Ned stands a few feet from the 
               frog, not moving.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh no...

               Ned is caught in the gaze of the frog. Little concentric 
               circles surround his eyes. He drops his gun.

                                     NED
                         Zzzzzz...

                                     JIMBO
                         Come on Ned buddy, snap out of it!

               But Ned is catatonic. He can't move at all.

                                     JIMBO
                         Come back to me buddy!!

                                     PRODUCER
                              (to cameraguy)
                         You getting all this?

               The camera guy nods.

                                     JIMBO
                              (to camera)
                         Hold onto your butts...

               Jimbo jumps up with his gun and BLASTS the little plastic 
               frog off the rock.

                                     JIMBO
                         TAKE THAT YOU DEMON FROG!!!

               Ned is still catatonic. Jimbo shakes him.

                                     JIMBO
                         Ned?! Ned?! Can you hear me?! Quick! 
                         Somebody call an ambulance! This man 
                         is catatonic!

                                     PRODUCER
                         Get the Flight for Life helicopter!

               The kids all climb out of the bushes.

                                     STAN
                         Holy crap, dude.


               Establishing.


               Jesus, Jimbo, Ned and the boys stand outside the studio.

                                     JIMBO
                         I'm sorry Stan, I was just trying to 
                         tell a good story. I never meant for 
                         you boys to get in trouble.

                                     STAN
                         We're sorry too Uncle Jimbo. We're 
                         sorry for making you look stupid in 
                         front of the whole world.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, and we're sorry for turning 
                         Ned into a vegetable.

                                     JIMBO
                         Ah, he'll be fine. I'll just take 
                         him home and show him some good hard-
                         core porn and he'll snap out of it. 
                         Won't you Ned?

               Jimbo slaps Ned on the back. He falls over on his face.

               Jesus walks in.

                                     JESUS
                         I want to apologize to all of you 
                         for what happened in there. in our 
                         competition for ratings we all lost 
                         sight of why we got into show business 
                         in the first place.

                                     JIMBO
                         Yeah, titties and beer.

                                     JESUS
                         Actually I was referring more to the 
                         pursuit of truth but... Well anyway, 
                         I can't wait to get back to my old 
                         show without all the glitz and ratings 
                         and producers...

                                     STAN
                         Wait a sec. Where IS your producer?

                                     JESUS
                         I sent her away.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Sent her away where?
