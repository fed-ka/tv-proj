Ann is walking down the street.
The firedog runs out of the
firehouse, she gives the dog a biscuit, and pats him on the
head.
The fireman is out front with a cup of coffee.
Ann hands him
a poster.
Morris and Spud, two codgers, are about to cross the street
when they hear a beeping and stop.
As they cross, we see the tail end of a van, and the group
nods in that direction.
MORRIS
You hear that?
SPUD
Yes, I hear it.
MORRIS
Drive a man to drink.
Took me near half
an-hour, get across the street
yesterday.
SPUD
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank
of the building.
Said, "What are you
doin'?"
He said, "I'm waitin' for the
'leven o'clock crossing..."
As Morris and Spud speak a car is coming down the street, and
bounces in the pothole.
MORRIS
Y'wanna fix something, you should fix
the pothole.
Yessir, they should be
trussed up, thrown off some high
building.
DOUG MACKENZIE, a young Republican type, walks up to join
them.
DOUG
Who's that?
MORRIS
Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand
dollars, a new traffic light, you could
grow old, paint your house before it
lets you cross the street, and then, not
fix the pothole.
SPUD
What was wrong with the old traffic
light?
As they walk out we hear a high pitched beeping sound at the
traffic light.
We see DOC WILSON crossing the street,
holding his doctor's bag.
An ELDERLY MAN approaches Doc at
the crossing.
As Walt and Bill walk, the airport van follows
them.
TOWNSMAN
Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back?
I'm not sure that they work.
DOC WILSON
Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't
hear me complain... come by th'office,
end of th'afternoon.
TOWNSMAN
Thanks, Doc...
BILL
This is your movie, this is small town
America.
WALT
Town in New Hampshire was small town
America, too.
Forty thousand dollars a
day, to shoot on the street.
And then
they kicked us out...
They stop in front of a rack of fifty "factory seconds."
Black and red hunting jackets, in front of the sporting goods
store.
The sign reads "FACTORY SECONDS, FIVE DOLLARS."
BILL
A jacket for five dollars... I can buy
this town for fifty bucks.
WALT
You told me that about the last town.
BILL
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
WALT
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm bleeding...
BILL
...why am I here?
WALT
What, what, what, what do they got that
can pass for the Old Mill?
Bill shows Walt a brochure from Waterford, which shows a
picture of the Old Mill.
Walt reads.
WALT (CONT'D)
"The Waterford Mill, built in 1825, and
long a tourist attraction..." Wake up

MAYOR
And we're glad to have you here...
WALT
My golly, you know?
All my life I grew
up in the city, but every summer...
would you like a cigar?
MAYOR
(of cigars)
Aren't these illegal?
WALT
Why would they be illegal?
BILL
...there's a trade embargo against Cuba.
Pause.
MAYOR
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to
say that anything I could do...
WALT
That's very kind of...as a matter-of
fact, one, I hate to bother you with...
MAYOR
...not at all...
WALT

MAYOR
Whatever you need.
The City Council, of

On your "permit," but that is less than
a formality.
WALT

MAYOR

MAYOR
And, my wife wanted to, wanted me to ask

I don't mean to be...
He hands an invitation to Walt.
WALT
Are you kidding me?
We would be
delighted.
Phone rings.
Walt motions to an aide, who writes in green on
a production board... "Tuesday 12th, dinner, Mayor."
MAYOR
Well, I won't take more of your time...
BILL
Walt, it's Marty on the Coast...
MAYOR
We'll see you Tuesday, then...
Walt starts for the phone.
WALT
It's one of the great, great pleasures
meeting you...
Mayor leaves the office.
BILL
It's Marty on the Coast.
WALT
On the coast?
Of course he's on the

Walt goes to the phone.
WALT (CONT'D)

Hi.

A production assistant comes in, installing a piece of
equipment.
She brushes past the drywipe board, where we see
she wipes out "Dinner with the Mayor."
WALT (CONT'D)
Baby, baby, I want to save the money

He hangs up.
Pause.
FIRST A.D.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
WALT
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything
we want.
FIRST A.D.
It burnt down.
BILL
When did it burn down?
First A.D. takes out a book, "The History of Waterford" and
reads.
FIRST A.D.
Nineteen-sixty.
"Part of a spate of
suspicious fires, the Old Mill, the..."
He hands Polaroids of the burnt Old Mill around.
All look at
them.
ANGLE IN
Debris by some water.
WALT
You told me they had on Old Mill here...
FIRST A.D.
"Suspicions of arson, these fires,
believed set by a disturbed teenager
were, in fact, the inspiration for the

He puts the Polaroids down by the model of the Old Mill.

Joe White, the WRITER, enters.
BILL
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
JOE
Hi.
WALT
Does it have to be an Old Mill?
Where
have you been?
JOE
I was in New Hampshire.
I was at the
Old Location.
WALT
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
JOE
(laughs)
You know, they told me there were gonna
be some jokes.
Kid the New Guy...
BILL
The Mill burnt down.
He shows the Polaroids -- they show the debris, and Bill
standing by them.
BILL (CONT'D)
Wonderful scr...
JOE
(pause)
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
WALT
We're out of money.
JOE
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire.
BI
They're holding it for ransom.
JOE
Uh -- why did we have to leave New
Hampshire?
PAUSE
The phone rings.
WALT
Halo?
Marty?
(to Joe)
What would they have used instead of an
old mill?
We need it tonight.
(to phone)
Marty?
Yeah you were saying?
JOE
I can't write it.
PAUSE
JOE (CONT'D)
I lost my typewriter.
WALT
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
JOE
I can only write on a manual.
WALT
I know the feeling.
JOE
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie,
I, I...
WALT
Grace...
JOE
That's a real fault, I...
WALT
Grace.
Get Mr. White a manual
typewriter.
(to Joe)
It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction.
And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
He nods at Joe, who leaves the office.
Hold on Walt as he
looks at horse pictures.
WALT (CONT'D)
How big is this horse?
BILL
(looking at the resume)
Fifteen hands.
WALT
What is that in fingers...?
Just
kidding, get me this horse.
BILL
This horse is booked.
WALT
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll
give him an associate producer credit.
ANGLE ON
Joe, outside Walt's door, looking at his script and shaking
his head.
ANGLE HIS POV
INSERT THE SCRIPT
We see for the first time that the name of the script is "The
Old Mill," by Joseph Turner White.
We hear raucous laughter from Walt, et al, in the B.G.
Joe, pacing in front of the window.
Theatrical sign in the
window.
Sign in the window: "Out!
Will return at..." Ann
comes up to the door.
Starts opening it with a key.
JOE
I, excuse me, the sign says you'll be
back at two.
It's quarter to three...
She looks up at the sign, changes the hand to read a quarter
to three.
She opens the door.
Goes inside.
He follows.
Camera follows.
ANGLE ON
Anne, who is putting up posters of the play.
She sighs and
walks forward, into Joe, who is waiting at the traffic light,
his bag on the ground beside him.
ANN
(of typewriter)
All ready to go?
He nods.
Looks down at her posterior.
JOE
So young, so unlined, so full of
promise.
(pause)
So innocent.
ANN
I beg your pardon?
He extracts the book of his she had in her back pocket.
He
looks at his photo on the back cover.
They start to cross
the street.
JOE
I quit.
ANN
You quit.
JOE
I quit the movie.
ANN
Why did you quit?
JOE
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.
I
think that I got fired.
I'm such a
liar.
I never could tell the truth.
ANN
Don't be so hard on yourself.
JOE
I just got kicked off my first movie.
ANN
Well.
Everybody has reversals.
If you
were never down how would you know when
you were up?
JOE
That's good.
That's really good.
You
have a gift for words.
ANN
It's in your play.
She holds up "Anguish."
JOE
You like my play.
ANN
Yes.
JOE
Why?
ANN
It's about life.
JOE
Could you tell me when's the next train?
ANN
N'about ten minutes.
What was your
movie about?
They stop by the park bench.
ANN (CONT'D)
(off his pause)
No, of course, you don't want to talk
about it.
JOE
(hands her the script)
It's about a man who gets a second
chance.
The cop, CAL, passes.
CAL
Evening, Annie.
ANN
Evening, Cal.
(to Joe)
Would you tell me about it?
JOE
I...
ANN
No, of course, you want to get out of
town.
JOE
It's...
He starts to walk, she puts the typewriter down on the
ground.
Joe hesitates.
He puts the script under the
typewriter.
He shakes his hand.
ANN
It's okay...
They walk on.
The OWNER is closing up.
OWNER
Evening, Annie.
See you at rehearsal.
ANN
You know your line?
OWNER
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before
the throne of justice."
ANN
Go you Huskies.
He walks away.
JOE
(of the clothing on the rack)
They leave it out all night?
He tries on a jacket.
One sleeve is one foot shorter than
the other.
ANN
Not worth stealing.
Only thing in town
worth something.
Stained glass window.
She gestures at the Firehouse.
JOE
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the
symbol of the firehouse?
ANN
First organized fire department was on
the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in
the year 642.
JOE
But why the dalmation?
ANN
It was either that, or a sardine.
He nods, a BEAT.
He looks down at the jacket with one sleeve
too short.
ANN (CONT'D)
You get what you pay for.
JOE
That's true.
You grow up here?
ANN
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou
Theatre.
They walk past the firehouse.
She gives the dog biscuit to
the firedog who runs out of the firehouse to her.
JOE
Nice town.
BEAT.
He gets a bit choked up.
ANN
You want to talk about it?
Joe shakes his head.
They walk off.
JOE
...that...that he prayed for a second
chance.
But...do you see?
ANN
Yes.
JOE
That, he says, there are no second
chances...that he's been presented what
he prayed for...and: he's ruined it.
ANN
Yes...
JOE
But, but but but...
ANN
No, no, I see...
JOE
That: in an act of...
ANN
Yes...
JOE
Of mercy...off...
ANN
I understand...
JOE
...that...he sees that...
ANN
As the Old Mill goes around...
JOE
Of course, of course that's what I'm
saying.
As the Old Mill goes around, he
sees...
ANN
Of course.
JOE
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
ANN
That's that's that's that's beautiful.
JOE
And you're the only one who'll ever hear
that speech.
Just you.
BEAT.
They stop and look at each other.
BEAT.
A railroad
crossing bar comes down behind them, as we hear the DINGING
and realize we are at a railroad crossing.
ANN
Well.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
JOE
And likewise.
ANN
Goodbye.
JOE
Goodbye.
PAUSE.
We see the train pass in the b.g.
We hear the train
whistling.
It's way off.
ANN
(pause)
Next train in'nt for two hours.
They walk on away from the station.
In the b.g. we see the
stationmaster.
He and Ann wave.
They walk past the shingle
for Doc Wilson.
ANN (CONT'D)
So that the Old Mill, the Old Mill
represents...the wheel of fate is that
too...
JOE
No, no.
Of course, that's exactly what
it represents.
ANN
That whole...
They walk on together and find themselves on a residential
street.
They are walking.
They stop in front of an old picket fence
with a porch swing.
JOE
The, the, the, the sanctity of everyday
things...
ANN
Everyday things...yes.
JOE
For example, he's just come back from a
fire and he...um...
(he shakes his head)
That's a fine house.
You look at that,
and you know, there's nice people that
live there.
ANN
I live there.
JOE
Really.
With the porch swing and
everything...
ANN
Surest thing you know.
PAUSE
JOE
I don't mean to impose, but...do you
think we might...
ANN
That's what the swing is there fore...
They walk onto the porch and sit on the swing.
JOE
(to himself)
...that's what the swing is there
fore...that its purpose, isn't it...
ANN
...I always thought so...
They swing back and forth.
The swing creaks.
JOE
...such a pleasant sound.
ANN
Mmm.
JOE
Cause, cause, it's...it's the simple
things that...
ANN
Yes...
JOE
...that.
Doug walks up.
DOUG
Waal, there you are, and Have I Got Some
News for you...
ANN
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is,
this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
JOE
Sa pleasure.
DOUG
Guess who is THIS CLOSE to a nomination
to State Senate...which is this close to
one stop from Congress!
ANN
...who...?
JOE
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the
station.
It was lovely meeting...
ANN
Mister White is...
Doug, as he takes Ann toward the door.
DOUG
Nice meeting you...they were, let me
tell you, they were a bit coy at first,
I told them: Look: the people are tired,
they're going to vote their pocketbook,
yes, but...
Joe walks off and exchanges glances with Ann, who lingers
behind.
She pushes the porch swing and exits.
As it swings,
Joe watches.
The production assistant is stapling a casting notice for
"The Old Mill" half over the notice of the amateur
theatricals poster.
Doug shows up, looks in the window.
Looks at poster, takes it down, looks around.
ANGLE ON
The park bench.
Ann, her feet up on the old typewriter, is
sitting, reading the script.
Doug comes up.
DOUG
What, what what are you doing here?
ANN
Yes, that's right.
DOUG
Look at this.
Do you know what they're
offering?
Look at this.
They treat us
like we're their backyard.
Do you know
what they're offering for three days to
close down Main Street?
ANN
What are they offering?
DOUG
Ten thousand dollars.
ANN
That's so beautiful...
DOUG
I beg your pardon?
Ann gestures at the script.
ANN
"The mill grinds the grain, but the
grain is not destroyed.
Although it is
altered..."
DOUG
Sure, but... ten thousand dollars.
Do
you know what they... this movie is
budgeted at fifty million dol...they're
coming up here, offer us a meal...
Joe walks up.
Ann is standing there.
JOE
Hi.
ANN
(simultaneously)
What are you doing?
(pause)
I love your script.
JOE
(simultaneously)
They decided, I decided to, to...you

ANN
You're still here.
JOE
I...I decided to give it another ch...
ANN
I love your script.

JOE
What?
POSTMAN
(as he delivers mail to Ann)
Mornin', Annie...
ANN
See you at rehearsal tonight?
POSTMAN
"In the name of justice, sir, I bid you
pause; for she is our Queen..."
Postman exits.
JOE
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure
if I'm giving them a second chance, or
they're giving it to me.
That's the
truth.
The truth's best, don't you
think?
ANN
You'd know better'n me.
JOE
How can you say that?
ANN
It's in your script...it's about getting
a second chance.
Innit?
"You can go
back..."
JOE
I can?
ANN
You bet your life.
(refers to script)
"The mill wheel goes around...some times
it's even under water -- then it rises
up, as high as it can go..."
JOE
But how do I...how do I do a film called
"The Old Mill" when I don't have an old
mill?
ANN
Well, first, you got to change the
title.
Ann and Joe sit on a bench.
He is looking at her as she
finishes the script.
Tears in her eyes.
She closes the
cover.
JOE
(beat)
What I need to say...
ANN
Yes...
JOE
About conflict...
ANN
That's why you didn't want to take the
Mill out...you've...
JOE
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
ANN
The Firehouse...
JOE

ANN
But but but but but it's better

JOE
How...?
ANN
Wait wait wait wait wait he get's a
second chance, do you see?
And you get
a second chance!
JOE
No, I don't...
ANN
(as she holds the script)
He doesn't go back to the mill, he gets
a second chance to go back to the
firehouse...
Joe takes off one pair of glasses and changes them for
another.
ANN (CONT'D)
You don't need the Mill.
This is what
(she gestures at the script)
you see: this is what you are.
This is
what the script is saying...
(a person walks by)
Hi, Emma, see you tonight?
Emma waves and nods.
ANN (CONT'D)
This is, look:
(to Emma)
Go you Huskies.
(to Joe)
...what I see you saying, is: you have
the two elements, Fire and Water.
The
Firehouse, and the Old Mill...do you
know, you could...
JOE
What are you doing tonight?
ANN
Me?
JOE
Yes.
Joe and Ann walk down the street.
As they do so they are
passed by the airport van.
ANN
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play
practice...
JOE
...oh...oh.
Well.
That's very
important.
Walt and the A.D. come down the steps to meet the arriving
airport van.
It stops.
MARTY ROSSEN gets out.
Walt hands
his bags to a P.A.
WALT
Marteleh, vos macht a yid...?
He hands Marty the breadloaf.
Marty takes a bite.
MARTY
You cool the broad out?
WALT
I left that for you.
MARTY
That's thoughtful.
(of the bread)
Ziz good, you try this?
As they speak, a P.A. is unloading Marty's high-end luggage
from the van.
WALT
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat
carbohydrates.
MARTY

What'd you do, build this...?
WALT
How was your flight?
MARTY
We're flying over pigs, we're flying

WALT
Did you bring Bob's weights
MARTY
They're coming Fed Ex.
WALT

What's in all the bags?
MARTY
My undies, cause, you can't get this
picture off on time I'm gonna wet

WALT
I'm gonna bring it off.
MARTY
55 days and I take home the camera.
I

They start up the stairs when Doc Wilson walks by.
Girl on a
scooter scooting the other way, her arm in a cast.
Marty and

MARTY

Stop...
WALT
That's what I said.
MARTY
How are you getting on with these fine
people?
WALT
Like dykes and dogs.
Joe is walking down the street.
A script in his hand,
scribbling.
Uberto walks next to him.
UBERTO
Because if you cannot tells me what is
it, how I, how does I take a pictures of
it?
Wally wants me, push in through the
weendow...
Joe, as he is scribbling in the script.
JOE
Yeah, no, can I...if you'd excuse me,
I've just got to...
He walks away and the CAMERA takes him into a backyard, by a
bunch of clotheslines.
His glasses fall apart as he changes
them.
He looks up as the wind blows the sheet.
He sees Ann, sitting on the backstairs of what, as we draw
closer, we see is the playhouse.
In back of her we see the
"Trials of the Heart" flats, seen from the back.
ANGLE JOE'S POV
ANN
Hello.
JOE
I thought you had Play Practice.
ANN
Don't look good for "Trial of the
Heart."
JOE
Well, then, it don't look good for the
Huskies...
ANN
That's for sure.
They walk down the street.
As they walk down the street, the
dog comes over and Annie throws him his bone over her
shoulder.
JOE
What happened?
ANN
Cast stood me up.
JOE
Uh huh.
ANN
They're all preparing for the auditions -
your movie.
He gets an idea, and trades glasses, one pair for the other.
He kneels.
ANN (CONT'D)
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before

JOE
What?
ANN
What are you doing down there?
JOE
My glasses fell apart.
I lost the...
ANN

JOE
You got a paperclip?
A little kid is walking by, carrying a fishing rod.
LITTLE KID
Evening, Annie.
ANN
Evenin', sweetheart.
LITTLE KID

ANN
You said it.
JOE
You like kids?
ANN
Never saw the point of 'em.
JOE
Me, too.
You have a paperclip?
ANN
Paperclip?
JOE
Fix my glasses.
ANN
Better idea.
She ducks under the sheet hanging by the door, she and Joe
come upon the fishergirl, who is standing by the bank about
to make a cast.
We see Annie take some leader from the little girl and burn
one end to make a hinge.
JOE
Gonna be good as new.
ANN
Better'n new, cause it's got a story.
Want to do the other part?
Joe takes the hinge, and a match and tries to fix the hinge,
and burns his finger.
JOE
Ow.
He grabs for the nearest object.
PAUSE.
ANN
What?
Joe shows her.
ANN (CONT'D)
Y'know what you got there?
You got a

He gives her the bouquet.
ANN
Hi!
DOUG
We had a date.

We did...?
DOUG
Where have you been?
ANN
I've been thinking.
DOUG
Where have you been, we had a date for

I have to tell you something...
DOUG
Well, I know, because they told me you

DOUG
Oh.
What were you doing, then, that's
so important that you shouldn't call

ANN
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm

DOUG

Let me review here: You're...what are

ANN
I'm sorry.
DOUG
Who is this person that you've found?
ANN
(pause)
He works on the movie.
DOUG
No.
Don't tell me that.
ANN
I'm sorry.
DOUG
Why, you whore!
Doug starts to cry.
First A.D. shows up.
FIRST A.D.
Can you type?
ANN
Never admit you can type.
FIRST A.D.
If you can type, they need you over at
the hotel.
The postman walk sup.
We see two workmen putting up a sign
over the door '1835.'
One has a copy of "The Hollywood
Reporter" in his back pocket.
MAYOR
And don't you worry about that permit...
MARTY
Why, that's right fine...
POSTMAN
Mornin' George.
MAYOR
Hey, Chunky.
(to Marty)
Well, we're glad to have you here.
My

We're having a party, matofact, Tuesday
night, for Walt and Bob Barrenger...
MARTY
Mmm....
MAYOR
Havin' 'em over, home-cooked meal, if
you'd...
MAYOR (CONT'D)
Well, I'd be awfully...
A paint truck pulls up outside the Mayor's house.
Painters
come out.
Sherry comes outside the house.
SHERRY
Where the hell have you been?
It's...
MAYOR
Sherry, this...
POSTMAN
(come back out of house with
cup of coffee)
Mornin' Sherry.
SHERRY
It's a quarter after nine, I've been on
the phone to...
PAINTER
Morning, Mrs. Baily, Mista Bailey...
He and his assistant go into the house with wallpaper.
SHERRY
I've got two days to get this house...
MAYOR
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the
producer.
SHERRY
I am so glad to meet you.
We are so
glad to have you here, and welcome you

yearly I redecorate our, to restore it
to the, 1835...
MARTY
What is that?
SHERRY
The house, the 1835.
The original
kitchen, of course, burned in 1960, as
part of a spate of fires...
MARTY
It's lovely.
SHERRY
A spate of suspicious fires which were
in fact the inspiration for the
formation of the Waterford Huskies.
MARTY
My oh my.
SHERRY
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an
informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be
'on set,' but if you'd like to join

Doug comes up the walk, a bit rabid.
DOUG
I have to talk to you.
MAYOR
Doug, this is Mr...
SHERRY
Oh, how thoughtless of me.
Would you
like a cup of tea...
Sherry disappears into the house.
MAYOR
...he's the producer of the movie.
DOUG
(to Marty)
I want you to hear this, pal...
(consults notebook)
Forget the overages, forget Ten Thousand
Dollars, for three days to two weeks.
You know what it would cost for them to
build this set?
(pause)
Two Million Dollars!
Now:
MAYOR
Doug...
DOUG
Now:
The Waterford Merchant's
Association, of who I am Council...
In the B.G. we see Sherry and the painter.
SHERRY
Don't tell me you're out of Wallpaper.
PAINTER
I told you, we could have it by
Wednesday...
SHERRY
Wednesday, don't tell me Wednesday, the
biggest grossing box office star in the
world is coming for dinner Tuesday...
PAINTER
Waal, if you ordered something common...
SHERRY
Something common?
I'm going to give you
something common.
I'm going to give you
an injunction, is what I...Mister Mayor.
DOUG
Huh.
Well, the Waterford Merchant's
Association demands, through me as their
council, five percent of the profits of
the movie, as figured by and...
(checks his notebook)
geared to the most favorable definition
of profits of either A) the Producer...
From INSIDE THE HOUSE, we hear the Mayor's wife screaming.
Mayor runs inside, Doug and Marty follow.
DOUG (CONT'D)
Why, you little sheeny...
Joe, happy as a clam, sauntering down the street.
Smoking a
huge cigar.
He passes two old codgers, Morris and Spud.
SPUD
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the
Old Farmer?
MORRIS
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on
sixty years.
SPUD
I read for that part.
Did pretty good,
too.
MORRIS
Bet you did.
SPUD
But I couldn't r'member all the words.
Ast them would they gimme a second
chance.
MORRIS
Ain't no second chances in life.
SPUD
Zat true?
MORRIS
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the
same mistake twice...
ANGLE ON
Joe, as he nods to himself, takes out a pad, starts to jot a
note, fumbles with his glasses.
Joe saunters on, writing, we
hear the beeping from the traffic light.
Joe hears a
screeching of tires.
He looks up, a film station wagon comes barreling around the
corner, hits the pothole, goes out of control, careens, turns
over, knocks down the control box of the traffic light.
Joe holds a beat, runs over to the car, to driver's side.
Battered driver, bleeding, upside down.
Joe drags him from
the car.
It is Bob Barrenger.
BOB
Get the...
JOE
Are you al...?
Barrenger points to the other side.
Joe looks.
ANGLE POV
Carla is the passenger, she is dazed but unhurt.
ANGLE ON
The car.
BOB
We gotta get her out of here.
Carla has extracted herself from the wreck, stands, woozily,
on the sidewalk.
BOB (CONT'D)
(to Carla)
Are you alright?
CARLA
(nodding)
I...
BOB
You got to get out of here...
BEAT.
She nods, understanding.
A light comes on in the
apartment over the store.
She looks up, starts away down the
street.
BEAT.
Bob rocks back and forth.
BOB (CONT'D)
Oh G-d, oh G-d, oh G-d...do you have a
cig...
The firetruck is being backed into the firestation.
Outside
a couple of passerbys are running in the rain, putting their
collars up.
We see Joe is in the firestation writing in his book.
As the
firetruck backs up we see the firedog bark, and Joe looks up.
ANGLE JOE'S POV
Ann is walking past the firestation.
Joe comes out to look
at her.
JOE
Hi.
ANN
Hi.
JOE
Where you going?
ANN
Going home.
They start to walk down the street in the rain.
JOE
Going home, yeah.
I told them what you
said...
ANN
(over a clap of thunder)
What?
JOE
I told them what you said about the
script...
They take refuge under the awning of the printshop.
ANN
I didn't say anything special, I was
just talking out loud.
JOE
...how else can you talk?
ANN
No, that's true.
JOE
No.
You, I told them, you can't betray
with the picture what you're saying with
the words.
And, I don't know, the
movies, I don't know.
They should be
socially uplifting, why does she have to
show her br...what is this...?
They look in the window of the old printshop, the awning
under which they have sheltered.
ANN
Yessuh.
Joseph Knights printshop.
Vacant for thirty years.
JOE
Is it...
ANN
Yep, n'it's for sale.
(pause)
One of the few things money can buy.
Joe looks in the window of the printshop.
JOE
I told them what you said about the
script...
They take refuge under the awning of the printshop.
ANN
Would you like to see it?
I've got the
key back at my store...
JOE
I'd love to.
ANGLE ON
Ann, runs out into the rain, Joe runs along side her.
In the
b.g., we see the fireman closing the doors of the firehouse,
and the firedog being restrained, on a leash, by him and shut
up inside the firehouse.
ANN
How's your star?
JOE
Gosh, you look nice.
ANN
...what...?
There's a huge flash of lightning and a clap of thunder and
the lights on the street flicker, and come back on.
BEAT.
ANGLE ON
Bookshop.
JOE
What would you do with it, the
printshop...
ANN
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel.
Town newspaper.
Show you the plans.
She goes into the washroom area, and comes out with two
towels.
She throws one to Joe, and begins toweling her hair
with the other.
She hands him some plans, which show photos of the old
printshop, and copies of the Old Waterford Sentinel, circa
1900.
JOE
Yes, it's a lovely idea...
She emerges from the back room.
She has stripped off her wet
jacket and shirt, and put on a light stockboy's jacket.
ANN
Print it right here.
There's another clap of thunder, and all the lights go out.
PAUSE.
ANN (CONT'D)
Oh, my.
(pause)
Life in the country.
One second.
Ann takes a small match from the drawer, and lights a small
kerosene barn lantern.
ANN (CONT'D)
Well.
There you go.
She sits down on the couch, and spreads the plan on a small
table.
ANN (CONT'D)
Press still works.
JOE
It does?
ANN
Did as of last week.
She shows him the poster for "Trials of the Heart."
ANN (CONT'D)
Best way I know to get ink on your
hands.
JOE
You'd do the newspaper right here.
ANN
That's something a man could do...?
JOE
You know what else a man can do?
ANN
What?
He moves closer to her.
He is about to kiss her when the
firedog appears on the couch between them.
ANN (CONT'D)
One moment...
She goes in the pocket of her jacket.
The dog follows her.
She cannot find a dog biscuit.
BEAT
Joe pats the dog on the head.
Leads him to the front door,
puts him out.
The door blows in the rain.
JOE
Pelting down out there.
ANN
People might be better off.
They
thought about it, spent the evening back
in the...
She comes close to him.
The dog reappears between them.
Joe
looks around, and goes back to a window, and shuts the
window.
Ann crosses to her desk.
Takes out a box of dog biscuits.
The box is empty.
The two of them lead the dog out, and pet
it on the head.
They turn back and the door is slammed.
BEAT
They start back to find the door locked.
ANN
Left the keys inside, in my jacket.
Joe nods.
JOE
Well.
'S'pose I should be getting
home...look.
They turn and Cal, the policeman, is standing next to them.
In raingear.
ANN
Cal...
CAL
Annie, got an umbrella?
ANN
Nope.
CAL
I'll walk you home, you can have my
coat.
He starts taking off his slicker.
ANN
Then you'll be wet.
CAL
I'm goin' off-shift.
Come on... I'll
walk you home.
He covers her with his slicker, and they walk away.
WE SEE in the b.g. Uberto and his helper at the firehouse.
Uberto swings a shuffleboard disk, and the dalmation window
shatters and falls in the street.
Some falls on his head.
A sign in the window, "Sold" is stamped over and reads "Under
Agreement."
Early summer morning.
Joe, holding a cup of coffee, looking
at the print shop.
Ann walks up.
JOE
Good morning.
ANN
Sleep well?
JOE
Yeah, you?
ANN
Oh yeah...
JOE
We could live up here, live up in the
country.
ANN
Now you're talking...
JOE
And we could get up every morning...
ANN
...well, we do that anyway...
JOE
And come to the printshop.
You know
why?
JOE (CONT'D)
To print the newspaper.
And I'd come to
write.
To write.
To write.
Right here
in the office.
ANN
Not without a rolltop desk.
JOE
Well, I could get a rolltop desk.
ANN
Happen to know where there's one for
sale.
JOE
Well ain't you amazing.
They walk on, onto the scene of various filmfolk setting up.
ANN
Lookit that, up already.
JOE
That's why we filmfolk get along so well
with you farmers.
Both up with the
chickens.
They push through the mass.
The street is closed off by
Police Cars.
They come upon a TV REPORTER doing a standup in front of the
firehouse where we see, in front, both the old firetruck and
state trooper cars.
TV REPORTER
Where Movie Star Bob Barrenger, fresh
from his troubles with the law last
year...
ANGLE ON
Ann and Joe, as they look on.
ANGLE ON
A state trooper and Doug, as they walk through the crowd.
Marty walks up to the TV REPORTER.
TV REPORTER (CONT'D)
...is once again in hot water.
Involved
in a car crash last night with a young,
a very young woman, Mr. Barrenger is
being arrested today for...
MARTY
You better make sure you got your facts
straight, pal, cause, you step off the
line and I'm going to sue you personally
for...
The trooper, Doug, and Bob Barrenger walk up to Marty.
TROOPER
We're looking for a Joseph Turner White.
MARTY
Oh, good, yes.
Good morning.
Where are
you taking Mr. Barrenger?
TROOPER
We are looking for a Mr. Joseph Turner
White?
MARTY
What are you doing with Mr. Barrenger?
DOUG
He's under arrest.
Doug hands the arrest warrant to Marty.
MARTY
Oh, good.
I'm his lawyer...and you must
be Perry Mason.
Guess what, you're
about one-half step from a world of
hurt...how diverting...the Mayor's gonna
have your ass.
Can I watch?
CAMERA takes the group, the trooper, Doug, Bob, in handcuffs,
Marty talking with them, through the crowd, on the back of
which we see Ann and Joe.
DOUG
Well, you guess what.
The Mayor sent
me.
I have your Mr. Barrenger with a
history of...
MARTY
...a history of nothing, he was
acquitted.
DOUG
Moral turp...you're on my home court,
friend.
I have the Mayor and the town
behind me, and forget making your movie:
I may own the studio when I get through
with you: I got a civil suit, I got
rape, I got collusion...
MARTY
You've got nothing, you don't have a
witness...
DOUG
And I've got a witness!
Your Mr. White
saw the crime.
MARTY
He told you that!?
DOUG
He didn't have to tell.
MARTY
I want to talk to him.
Would you ex...
DOUG
Oh, you're his attorney, too?
MARTY
Later for you, pal.
DOUG
Okay.
He motions the cop to take out Barrenger.
Marty sees Joe in
the back.
MARTY
Bobby, don't say anything.
BOB
Nothing happened.
DOUG
We'll see about that at the inquest.
ANGLE ON
Marty, as he leads Joe down into an alleyway, and into a
backyard, hung with washing on the lines.
MARTY
Yeah, hi, pal.
I need to talk to you.
Cal walks with Joe, still holding the newspaper.
As they
round a housecorner, Walt appears and walks with Joe.
WALT
(checks watch)
Let's speak English.
You've got to help
the side.
JOE
You want me to lie.
WALT
To the contrary.
I want you to tell the
truth.
(pause)
The truth is, you can't tell me, to a
certainty, that you saw the thing.
You
don't remember, a gun to your head,
which glasses you have on.
And you have
a fertile imagination.
Imagination
wants to fill in the blanks.
Now.
IF
you aren't sure, then they have nothing.
Bob walks free.
As he should.
(pause)
Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors
at the crossroads with a stake through
their heart, you know?
The people who
are talking to you about the way we live
though we may praise them, we fear them.
And they fear us.
Because we tell the
truth.
About our lives.
Now, this is a
damn roost, and everyone knows it;
the guy is looking for a case, he wants
to make a name for himself...If we let
him do that, if we let him do that, then
we're being false to our community...to
our community, you understand?
To our
world.
Cause you are a part of that
world, now.
You have to take off the
steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.
(pause)
And be part of your world.
I got a five
picture deal with the studio.
And you
stick with me.
You write one, two more,
you stick with me, and you'll direct the
third one.
You are a part of this
world.
You have to do the right thing:
we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff,
literally is at our door.
You have to
stand with the troops, Joe.
That's the
bottom line.
You have to...if you had
the leisure to think it through, you'd
see it for yourself.
The girl wasn't in
the car.
Cal takes Joe to a side door of the courthouse.
A crowd, moving along, with the TV Reporter.
TV REPORTER
(talking into camera)
...the arraignment, as we said of Bob
Barrenger, The Bob Barrenger, star of
"The Old Mill," about to begin shooting
here, in picaresque and sleepy...
(sound of shouting, and
reporter looks around)
we should say, formerly sleepy...Yes,
yes, it's...yes, it's Claire Wellesley,
and we're going to try to get a look
at...
The crowd moves away, revealing Ann, standing in front of the
realtors, looking at a card in her hand.
She looks up to see
Joe coming toward her.
ANGLE ON
Extreme close up, she smiles.
ANGLE ON
Extreme close up, Joe.
He looks toward Ann, sheepishly.
ANGLE BACK ON
Ann, as she looks down at the card in her hands.
ANGLE INSERT
It is the real estate placard for the printshop, marked
"under agreement."
ANGLE ON
Ann, as she rips it up.
On Doc Wilson, as he walks down the street.
A little kid, on
a scooter is going in the other direction.
KID ON SCOOTER
Mornin', Doc.
DOC WILSON
Mornin', Billy, where ya goin' in such a
hurry?
KID ON SCOOTER
Down the corner, see the ruckus...
DOC WILSON
Watch the curbs, now...
ANGLE ON
Joe, as he stands across from Ann's house, looking at it.
He
holds his suitcase.
DOC WILSON (CONT'D)
(of his suitcase)
Where you off to?
JOE
I, uh...I'm leaving...
DOC WILSON
Why?
JOE
I perjured myself.
(pause)
I told a lie, and I ruined my life.
That's what I did.
(shrugs)
I don't suppose you could help me with
that, could you?
Turn back the clock,
or something?
Give me back my, give me
back my purity, I don't suppose you
could just wave your magic wand and do
that, could you?
But what is truth?
Eh?
Ain't that the thing?
What is
true?
DOC WILSON
It's the truth that you should never
trust anybody, wears a bowtie.
Cravat's
s'posed to point down to accentuate the
genitals, why'd you wanna trust
somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate
his ears?
Joe turns to see Doc swigging from his flask.
In the b.g.,
we see the bellhop walking.
BEAT
JOE
Aren't you supposed to set an example
for people?
DOC WILSON
Nope.
I'm just supposed to hold
people's hands while they die.
What'd
you say your problem was?
JOE
I just swore my life away, back in
that...
DOC WILSON
(as he sees an older woman off
on a porch to the side)
Mornin', Chessy, how's the back?
Doc walks off to his office.
JOE
I ruined my life.
Isn't that funny,
that you can actually do it in one
moment just like they say.
I ruined my
life back in that courthouse.
Bellhop, who has walked up beside him...
BELLHOP
What courthouse?
JOE
Courthouse back in town.
BELLHOP
Town ain't got no courthouse.
JOE
What?
BELLHOP
Ain't got no courthouse.
Courthouse
burnt down, 1960.
The train is arriving.
The stationmaster puts out the steps
to help the people down.
JOE
Well, where do they hold court?
BELLHOP
Hold court, they have to, science lab,
the high school.
An ELDERLY LOOKING JUDGE FELLOW descends from the train,
followed by the CADDY with his golf bag.
STATION MASTER
Mornin', judge, what brings you here?
JUDGE
I'm s'posed to hear some deposition,
some fool saw the accident last night.
JOE
...the courthouse burnt down...?
STATION MASTER
Yep.
Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Part
of a spate of fires, Old Mill,
Courthouse... S'posed to've been set by
some deranged teenager.
Joe looks around.
ANGLE JOE'S POV
The old bellhop walking down the tracks.
ANGLE ON
Joe, as he turns back into town.
ANGLE CLOSE UP
On the Station Master.
STATION MASTER (CONT'D)
Yep, never did discover who set 'em...
He smiles, and lights his cigar.
We see the crowd has moved down the street and the
"Courthouse" building is empty.
ANGLE THEIR POV
At the end of the alleyway, in Main Street.
We see Sherry,
the Mayor's wife, leading a crowd.
SHERRY
...a blight, a blight and an
obscenity...that's good English, isn't
it?
How's that for entertainment?
ANGLE
At the mouth of the alleyway, on Main Street.
We see:

friend, Bob Barrenger."
ANGLE XCU
The distorted face of Chucky, heaving the baseball.
ANGLE ON

him in the back of the head, as troopers hustle him toward
the courthouse.
In the b.g., Ann and Joe emerging in the
alleyway.
ANGLE ON
Ann and Joe, who starts to cross the street.
We see the
airport van.
ANN
What are you going to do?
JOE
I'm going to tell the truth.
They start to cross the street.
In the b.g., a little man
with a bag (HOWIE) gets out of the airport van.
Joe and Ann
walk toward the crowd at the mouth end of the high school.
Walt on the scene, talking with the cinematographer, and the
Camera Operator, preparing the first shot.
The First A.D.
instructing the extras.
FIRST A.D.
Okay.
Are we getting set up here...are

Can we
settle...can we settle now...?
ANGLE ON
Ann.
As she, holding the placard starts to cross the street.
An old farmer smoking a pipe, driving a pick up is stopped by
a P.A. talking on a walkie.
We see that it is the "Judge" who listened to Walt's
testimony.
Ann waves to him, and proceeds to the Old
Firehouse, where they are about to make a movie...
FIRST A.D.
Okay, this is picture...
Ann stops at the back of the crowd of onlookers.
She waves

old fire engine.
The actor playing Doc Morton walks past.
DOC MORTON
Mornin', Harry.
Heard you had a little

FIREMAN
Waal, you didn't have nothin' to do,

ANGLE ON
Crew, and the film within the film.
We see the lively stable
across the way.
On its side are painted various ads.
Among
them, one which says: "Stefan P. Bazoomercom" and Marty is
standing next to it.
Looking on at the scene being filmed.
An A.D. brings him a cup of coffee.
The A.D. is passing out
