                                              TEASER

          FADE IN:

  11JOHNNY

          stands in front of a 3-way mirror, looking at himself. 
          He's dressed in his usual plain suit, tie and overcoat. 
          We pull back to reveal we're in:


          INT. MALL - UBER-HIP CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT

          Banging MUSIC.  Leggy salespeople.  Fashion forward
          clothes.  BRUCE approaches with some clothes in hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you're taking me here, why?

                                        BRUCE
                        How you dress reflects how you
                        feel.  And when I look at you I
                          sense... uptight.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is classic.  Never goes out
                        of style.

                                        BRUCE
                          I guess, if you're Johnny Cash.

          Bruce picks up a bright shirt, places it in front of him.

                                        BRUCE
                        Now this is what I'm talkin' about. 
                          A little color to brighten things
                        up.  It says, "Hey, I'm fun.  Get
                        to know me."

          Johnny just looks at Bruce, stone-faced.












                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - TEASER - 2/23/04 - PINK     2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is this, "Bruce Eye for the
                        Psychic Guy?"

                                        BRUCE
                        Your loss.

          As Bruce puts the shirt back, Johnny notices a mysterious
          YOUNG MAN (26) wearing a dark overcoat, and an expression
          to match. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is it my imagination, or has that
                        guy over there been following us
                        from store to store?

          Bruce looks over, shrugs it off.

                                        BRUCE
                        My guess?  I think he's a fashion
                        victim and senses your expertise.


  22INT. THE MALL - NIGHT

          Johnny and Bruce walk as they carry shopping bags.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm just saying -- a little
                        variety...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I dress to fit my mood, you know
                        that.

                                        BRUCE
                        You dress in black.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like I said, I dress to fit my
                        mood.

                                        OVERCOAT MAN (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.

          The man with the overcoat stands right in front of them,
          smiling warmly.  He looks Johnny square in the eye.

                                        OVERCOAT MAN (LENNIE)
                        Johnny Smith, right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, do I know you?

          And the Overcoat Man GRABS his hand.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - TEASER - 2/23/04 - PINK     3.


    2CONTINUED:2

          Johnny snaps into a vision....


  33INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

          It's terrifying, obscure.  Little FLASHES - narrow stairs
          descend into a dark basement.  We hear the sound of a
          CLOCK, in the distance, gonging the hour.  Faint whimpers
          of someone CRYING.  Water drips from rusty pipes.  

          Then a quick glance of a gleaming BUTCHER KNIFE.  A man
          wearing a MASK STABS the knife into a young, brunette
          WOMAN, her hair askew, bound and gagged in a chair.


  44RESUME - INT. MALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          The Overcoat Man releases Johnny's arm, still smiling.

                                        OVERCOAT MAN (LENNIE)
                        I'm a fan of your work, Mr. Smith. 
                        So nice to finally meet you.

          Then he DARTS away, disappearing into a thick crowd of
            shoppers.  Johnny's too shaken to speak.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's up?  You see something?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That man - which way did he go?

          Johnny looks around, panicked.  People are everywhere. 
          He looks over heads, then up the multi-level mall. 

          The Overcoat Man is suddenly TWO FLOORS above them.  How
          did he get up there so fast?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come on. 

          Johnny limps towards the escalator, shoving people out of
          the way.  Bruce tracks behind him, confused.


  55INT. MALL - ESCALATOR - NIGHT

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, man.  What the hell is going
                        on?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That guy in the overcoat is going
                        to kill a girl.

    5CONTINUED:5

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        And he wanted me to see it.

          They THRUST their way up the escalator but the rush of
          shoppers is too thick.  As they ascend they see the
          Overcoat Man is on the next escalator going down.  What
          the - ?

          Johnny and Bruce backtrack down the escalator, causing a
          ruckus.  The Overcoat Man swiftly moves towards a glass
            elevator. 

          Johnny and Bruce run after him, too little, too late. 
          Just before the glass door closes --

                                        OVERCOAT MAN
                        Nine P.M. tomorrow... Tick, tock. 
                        Tick, tock.

          And the door WISPS shut, taking the Overcoat Man down. 
          Off Johnny - horrified.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          an artist's SKETCH of the man in the overcoat.  It's fairly
            accurate.  We pull back:


          INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

          A SKETCH ARTIST sits with Bruce, Johnny and WALT.  Johnny
          still seems shaken.

                                        WALT
                        Nine P.M. tomorrow.  Doesn't leave
                        us much time.

                                        BRUCE
                        You think he's taunting you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why else would he approach me? 

                                        WALT
                        You sure you didn't recognize
                        him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Never seen him before in my life.

                                        WALT
                        What about the girl?

                                        JOHNNY
                        She was maybe 18, 19.  And
                        terrified.  Like she knew she was
                        about to die.  Her arms were bound
                        to a wooden chair.  I didn't get
                        a good look at her, but she had
                        long brown hair.
                                (off Walt's look)
                        That's all I saw.

                                        WALT
                        What did the room look like?

          As Johnny speaks, the sketch artist draws a schematic
          layout of the basement.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was dark, wet, lit by a single
                          light-bulb.  Long narrow stairs. 
                        Maybe a basement.  The kind in
                        old houses.  I also heard a clock
                          striking the hour.  A big clock.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - ACT ONE - 2/23/04 - PINK    6.

                        Could be anywhere from here to
                        the Maine coast.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And he was wearing a plastic mask. 
                        One of those comedy ones, from
                        the comedy-tragedy masks.

                                        WALT
                        How do we know it's the same man,
                        then?  All we have to go on is
                        his face...

          CLOSE on the black and white sketch.


  77INT. THE MALL - MONTAGE - DAY

          Bruce, Johnny and Walt walk around the mall, sketches of
          the mysterious overcoat man in hand. 

          They show security guards, food court employees, store
          workers.  All shake their heads.  Nobody remembers seeing
          him.  Dead ends...


  88INT. THE MALL - PARTY STORE - DAY

          Party favors, streamers, tacky cards for every occasion. 
          One of those stores you can't believe makes money.  Walt
          shows the store OWNER the sketch.

                                        OWNER
                        Oh.  Yeah, I remember him.  Came
                        in last night.  I think he bought
                        some masks.

          Johnny shoots Walt a look.  Bingo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Which ones?

          She points up to a wall of masks and costumes.  To two in
          particular - the Comedy and Tragedy Masks.

                                        OWNER
                        Bought the matching set.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the one I saw him wearing. 
                        The Comedy mask.

          Johnny points to the Comedy mask.

                        Do you remember how he paid for
                        it?  Do you have the credit card
                          receipt?

                                        OWNER
                        Nope.  He paid cash.

                                        WALT
                                (deflates)
                        Are you sure?

                                        OWNER
                        Yeah, it was a fifty.  Don't see
                        many of those.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you still have it?

                                        OWNER
                                (confused)
                        The fifty?  Ah, yea, maybe...
                        haven't taken yesterday's receipts
                        to the bank yet.

          She opens the register, digs a little and pulls out the
          fifty dollar bill.  The cashier hands it to Walt, who
          hands it over to Johnny.  Johnny rolls the bill in his
          hands... and snaps into a vision:


  99VISION: INT. MALL - PARTY STORE - NIGHT - FROZEN ARRAY

          Time spins back. 

          The party store fills up with kids.  The fifty dollar
          bill is pulled out of a leather wallet.  It becomes a
          FROZEN ARRAY shot, everything stops...

          A kid has let go of a helium balloon that stops mid-air. 

          Another rambunctious kid has fired water from a squirt
          gun at his sister, the water suspended, frozen.

          The mystery man with the overcoat stands at the register. 
          Johnny walks up to him.  Looks at the wallet.


          CLOSE ON THE WALLET

          There's a driver's license, but the name is obscured. 
          Next to it, however, is a gold & red WHITLEY COLLEGE I.D. 
          But no name.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - ACT ONE - 2/23/04 - PINK    8.

          JOHNNY

          Frustrated, he looks around the store.  His glance stops
          at one of those dome SECURITY MIRRORS.


          P.O.V. THE MIRROR

          Sees something odd:  the reflection doesn't match up.

          The man with the overcoat is standing in a different spot
          than his reflection.


          RESUME JOHNNY - FROZEN ARRAY

          Johnny walks to the next aisle.  There's ANOTHER MAN,
          dressed identically in an overcoat.  Johnny approaches
          this second man and sees: the same face as the man at the
            register.

          There's two of them.


  1010RESUME - INT. MALL - PARTY STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny snaps out.  The cashier stares at him, puzzled.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There were two of them.

                        That man has an identical twin. 
                        I think they're students.

          Walt, Johnny and Bruce hold a sketch in front of TAMI

                        I'm sorry, but we can't give away
                          personal information.  School
                        policy.

          Walt flashes his badge.

                        We're trying to stop a crime from
                        being committed.

          Tami looks at the badge and back at Walt.

                                        TAMI
                        What kind of crime?

                                        WALT
                        We can't really discuss that.  Do
                        you recognize the man in this
                        sketch?

                                        TAMI
                        Hmmm... we have so many students.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He might have an identical twin.

                                        TAMI
                        Oh sure, that could be either
                        George or Lennie Todd.  I can
                        never tell them apart.  They're
                        T.A.s in the law department.
                                (checks a schedule)
                        Looks like they're in seminar
                        today, the R.J. Whitley Law

                        Do you have an address for them?

          She copies their address off the screen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're also looking for a female,
                        long brown hair, who might be in
                        one of their classes.

                        Has something happened to her?

                        That's what we're trying to
                        determine.

                                        TAMI
                        All our students have a photo
                        I.D. on file... but there must be
                          hundreds of girls with long brown
                        hair.

                        Maybe she's in a class with one
                        of the twins.

                        Can you cross reference them?

                        It will take some time.

                        It's very important that we find
                        her.

                                        TAMI

                        Let's go talk to these guys.


  1313INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

            A massive lecture hall. 

          GEORGE TODD and his twin brother, LENNIE TODD, stand in
          front of a hundred-plus class of first-year law students.

          A white board projects detailed outlines for class.  Lennie
          transcribes "FREE SPEECH" as George lectures using a laser
          pointer.  They work as a team.

                                        GEORGE
                        ...does it extend to other areas,
                        like tech and internet privacy? 
                        I'm sure your gut reaction is
                        yes, of course, this is America. 
                        But how many of you have logged
                        onto a chat room and typed in
                        statements that were not so honest?




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - ACT ONE - 2/23/04 - PINK   11.


    13CONTINUED:13

          The class LAUGHS.  Both brothers seem respected, calm -
            certainly not capable of committing brutal homicide.

                                        GEORGE
                        That's free speech, of course. 
                        But when does lying cross the
                          boundary into breaking the law?

          Walt enters and walks up to George and Lennie and tries
          to be discreet.

                                        GEORGE
                        How can we help you? 

                                        WALT
                                (out of class' earshot)
                        Mr. and... Mr. Todd, I'm Sheriff
                          Bannerman from the Penobscot County
                          Sheriff's Department.

          George speaks up, for all to hear.

                                        GEORGE
                        Oh, Sheriff Bannerman.  Is there
                        some sort of problem?

          The class looks on, fascinated. 

                                        WALT
                        I'd rather speak to you and your
                        brother in private.

                                        LENNIE
                        Can it wait?  We're in the middle
                        of class.

          Johnny appears in the doorway next to Walt.  At the sight
          of Johnny, George LIGHTS up.

                                        GEORGE
                        Wow.  Class.  A special guest. 
                        The one, the only, Mr. Johnny
                        Smith is gracing us with his
                          amazing, yet often questionable
                        and inconsistent outlooks on life.

          George condescendingly points the laser pointer at Walt.

                                        LENNIE
                                (addresses the class)
                        And you're together!  How epic! 
                        The thought of the police working
                        in tandem with a psychic is
                        absolutely Orwellian.

                        Class, take a look at the briefs
                        for a few minutes.

          George and Lennie shoot one another a knowing look, and
          follow Walt and Johnny into the hallway.


  1414INT. COLLEGE HALLWAY - DAY

          George and Lennie stand next to Johnny, Bruce and Walt. 
          Johnny looks them over, intensely.  The door open, the
          class buried in their books, they speak in hushed tones.

                                        WALT
                                (to Johnny and Bruce)

                                        BRUCE/JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  That's them, all right.

                        I don't know exactly what kind of
                        game you're playing, but you're
                        not gonna get away with it.

                                        GEORGE
                        Excuse me?  Get away with what?

                                        WALT
                        Did you approach Johnny Smith at
                        the mall last night?

                        I don't know, what if he approached
                        us?

                        Look, we've got witnesses.  A
                        store clerk recognized you, too.

          Lennie tries to speak up, but George cuts him off.

                                        GEORGE

                                (to Walt)
                        Witnesses?  Are we being charged
                        with something?

                        Did you buy any masks?

                        Wait a second.  Are you seriously
                        asking us whether or not we were
                        at the mall buying masks?  When
                        did that become a crime?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a vision and saw you murder
                        a girl with short, brown hair.

          George and Lennie stop, share a look.  Then break out
            laughing.  The class looks out the door.

                        This is some kind of joke, isn't
                        it?  Did Fuller in I-Tech put you
                        up to this?  C'mon, show me the
                          cameras, where are they?

          Johnny unfolds the sketch they've been walking around
          with.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw you at the mall.

          George grabs the sketch, looks it over.  (This would be a
          good split screen moment.  Can they hand the sketch across
          split screen?)

                                        GEORGE
                        I don't think you know who you
                        saw.  But this does look like me.

                        sound when I breathe through my

          Johnny leans in and touches George, triggering a vision --

          It's the same basement from the teaser.  George opens a
          bag and pulls out a large BUTCHER KNIFE, the brothers
          pull down their masks, George in the Comedy mask, Lennie
          in the Tragedy mask.

          George and Lennie walk back into their class.  Walt and
          Bruce look to Johnny.

          George marches to the front of the lectern holding the
          sketch up for the class to see.  Lennie goes up to the
          white board and writes:  "PRIVACY."

                        What happens when a psychic touches
                        you without consent?  Is that an

                        May I?

          Johnny begins flipping through a stack of file folders --
          each one has a photo of a girl with long brown hair and a
            signature card clipped to the front.

                        what the theme of the party is...


          BRUCE'S POV

          George and Lennie by the bar, their masks tipped up on
          top of their heads so we can see their faces as they laugh
          and greet a room packed with guests, all wearing COMEDY
          AND TRAGEDY MASKS.


  25B25BEXT. GEORGE & LENNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Walt and Johnny are approaching the house.

          lower their masks, and blend into the crowd of identical
          masks.

          as Johnny and Walt ENTER, wading into the crowd of masked
            partiers.  One PARTICULARLY STONED GUEST isn't paying
            attention and passes a JOINT to Walt.

                                        WALT
                        Good thing for you I'm busy.

          He crushes the joint and moves off to follow Johnny deeper
          into the party.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: the masks)
                        I'm really starting to hate these
                        guys.


            FOLLOWING JOHNNY AND WALT

          as they wade through the party, finding Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bruce... where are they?

          Bruce points across the party to Lennie and George, still
          in their masks, identifiable only by their clothes.

                                        BRUCE
                        Over there... I think.

                        these two until the clock runs
                        out.

                        Wait... look!

          The two people in the Comedy/Tragedy masks lift their
          masks to drink their beers, revealing that it's NOT George
          and Lennie.

                                        WALT
                        Damn.

          Johnny touches the door knob, triggering:

            A serious-looking Lennie opens the door and they spill
          inside, laughing.  As he shuts the door behind them, Lennie
          lowers his mask.  The vision ends --

          A CLOCK begins gonging in the distance.  Johnny takes
          notice.

                        That's definitely the same clock
                        I heard in my vision.  Walt, this

          Bruce grabs a gardening tool from nearby, getting ready
          to pry open the door.

          bits from Johnny's original vision.

  2828INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          It's a horror show.

          A man wearing a COMEDY MASK, butcher knife, raised, post-
            stabbing, stands over Fernanda, who's bound and gagged in
          a wooden chair.  There is a black tarp laid out on the
          floor.  Walt LOCKS his gun on the man.

                                        WALT
                        Drop it.  Don't move.

          The masked man does as he's told.  Johnny sees a SECOND
          MASKED MAN, lurking in the darkness.  Bruce sees him too,
          and snaps into action, pinning the man against the wall.

          Johnny rushes to Fernanda.  She's motionless, covered in
          blood.  Brown hair, pulled into a ponytail.  His face
          fills with dread.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're too late.

          Walt shines the flashlight on her face.  Still nothing. 
          Terrified, Johnny checks on Fernanda.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's still breathing.

                        No kidding.

          Then, her EYES SNAP OPEN and she LAUGHS, scaring the
          bejesus out of him.  Bright lights FLICK ON, nearly
          blinding everyone.  Bruce is confused.

                                        BRUCE
                        What... what is this?

          George and Lennie pull their plastic masks up.

          Excited, George rushes up to Fernanda and they engage in
            a celebratory kiss.  Lennie averts his eyes.

                        But our show wouldn't be complete
                        without a victim.

          We reveal Fernanda sitting in a chair, hands bound, and
          gagged.  George removes her gag.

                        Hey, everybody!

          And they kiss.  George places the gag back on.  George
          and Lennie put their masks on.

                        Lennie, will you do the honors?

          And Lennie takes the butcher knife and SLASHES it into
            Fernanda.  Blood seeps off the knife.  Fernanda acts
          "dead."  It looks more campy than vicious and brutal.

                                        GEORGE
                        Quite harmless.

          And George shows how the knife literally retracts into
          its handle.  Fernanda looks up from her "dead" position.

                                        GEORGE
                        But this wouldn't be any fun if

          in such a way that it has ominous music and slow-motion
          shots.  A montage of events from the past day:

                        Johnny Smith's psychic "powers"
                        are the ultimate invasion of
                          privacy.


3232- WALT AND JOHNNY - INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

          Appear at the law class.

                                        GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Do we want to live in a world
                        where a man who has suffered brain
                        damage from a car crash can lead
                        the police to harass you, or even
                        break down your door?


3333- WALT - INT. GEORGE & LENNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          From the point of view of a tripod camera, set-up in a
          corner with a night filter, we see Walt break down their
          basement door.

                                        GEORGE (V.O.)
                        And if he's wrong about this,
                        what else, who else, is he wrong
                        about?

          Ends with a slow-motion shot of Johnny clumsily entering
          the basement, being blinded by the light, and finally
          Johnny's angry face and his hand coming toward the camera. 
          They hold on that image.

                                        GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Wasn't it just a few months ago
                        that Johnny Smith himself was
                        accused of murder?  And now he's
                            a self-appointed judge and jury.

          We pull out to reveal we're in:


  3535INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

          Johnny stands next to Bruce near a desk.  They've just
          watched this streaming video on the internet.

                                        BRUCE
                        You all right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They used me.  They set me up
                        like some kind of prop and used
                        me.

          Walt comes out of his office in his dress uniform.  Doesn't
          look happy.

                                        WALT
                        You think that's bad?  They're
                          threatening to sue the Sheriff's
                          Department, and us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        For what?

                                        WALT
                        For violating their rights.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But they came after me.

                                        WALT
                        Go home, let us handle the cleanup
                        from here.  We got had.  It's
                        that simple.

          And Walt walks off, leaving Johnny with Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        So that's it?  Johnny Smith gets
                          'Punk'd' and we just go home? 
                        End of story?

                        Maybe Walt's right, we got had. 
                        I made a mistake.

                                        BRUCE
                        You might make a mistake, but not
                        your visions. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What I want to know is, why me? 
                        What did I ever do to them?

                                        BRUCE

  3838EXT. GEORGE & LENNIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce walk up to the door.  As they do, a
          COLLEGE KID passes in a hazy, smoke-filled car with his
          buddies.

                                        COLLEGE KID
                        Catch any killers, Johnny?

          They LAUGH as they drive past.

                                        BRUCE
                        Higher education, huh?

          And they KNOCK on the front door.  George answers.

                                        GEORGE
                        Mr. Smith?  What a surprise.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You got a minute?

                                        GEORGE
                        Sure.  C'mon in.  I've been
                          expecting you.


  3939INT. GEORGE & LENNIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          George escorts Johnny and Bruce through his home.  The
          house is cleaned up since the party, everything meticulous
          and symmetrical.  The only sign that anything happened is
          the broken basement door.  They notice a fish bowl with
          two fish.  There's a half-finished jigsaw puzzle on the
          table - being worked on from opposite ends, heading toward
          the middle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, so you won.  You got me. 
                        What was the point?

                                        GEORGE
                        Our law review article on non-
                          traditional law enforcement.  Our
                        big chance to get published.  It
                        was genius, really.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What were you trying to prove? 
                        That I'm a fake?  My visions still
                        led me right to you.

                                        GEORGE
                        But ultimately your visions were
                        wrong.

                                        GEORGE (CONT'D)
                              (a beat)
                        What you "see" is warped by your
                        own psyche.  You have such a dark
                        view of the world that all you
                        see is crime and ugliness.  You
                        may have visions, but you don't
                        know how to interpret them.
                              (a beat)
                        Bottom line?  We just wanted to
                        prove you can be wrong.  That you
                        can't be trusted.

                                        BRUCE
                        You know how many people this man
                        has saved?  You didn't prove a
                        damn thing.

          Johnny motions to Bruce that it's okay.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How did you know so much about
                        me?

                                        GEORGE
                        We've been studying you for months. 
                        It's amazing how much information
                        is out there if you know where to
                        look.  We learned a lot following
                        the Rachel Caldwell murder.  We
                        read everything about that.  See
                        that stack?

          George points to a stack of books, VHS tapes, newspaper
          articles strewn about in a corner.

                                        GEORGE
                        Lotta ink on you, lotta ink.  Oh,
                        wait, you're Johnny Smith, what
                        am I telling you for?  Let me
                        just show you.

          And George touches Johnny, sending Johnny into a vision:


  4040INT. MRS. TODD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - VISION

          VISION JOHNNY watches A WOMAN, mid-50s, sits in a bathrobe,
            zombie-like, in front of the TV, watching a Reverend Purdy
            telecast.  Her two twin boys - George and Lennie - college
          age, stare at her, a little frightened at the catatonic
          state of their mother.

    40CONTINUED:40

          ON THE TELEVISION

          Purdy evangelizes from his podium.

                                        REVEREND PURDY
                          Miracles do happen.  Just look at
                        Johnny Smith.  His powers are
                        truly a divine gift, proof of
                        God's abilities to intervene in
                        our lives.

          Without turning away from the television, the woman
          mumbles:

                                        MOTHER
                        ...so handsome.

                                        REVEREND PURDY
                        Let Johnny's gift be an inspiration
                        to us all.  Please, pick up the
                        phone and call in a pledge.

          She reaches for the phone and dials...


  4141RESUME - INT. GEORGE & LENNIE'S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          George, smiling, lets go of Johnny, waiting for an answer.

                                        GEORGE
                        So, what'd you think?  Pretty
                        clever, huh?

                                        JOHNNY
                        So that's what this is all about? 
                        Your mom gave all her money to
                          Reverend Purdy and you blame me?

          George's smile fades, clearly expecting Johnny to have
          had a different vision than the one he got.

                                        GEORGE
                        My mom?  What did you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        So all this was just a misguided
                        act of revenge?

                                        GEORGE
                        Nothing misguided about it.  My
                        mother gave you and Purdy
                        everything she had.  Do you know
                        what it's like to lose your mother
                        to a phony man of God?

                              (a beat)
                        Yes, actually I do.

                                        GEORGE
                        She died with nothing.  Probably
                        more so from regret than the
                        cancer.  Guess you and Purdy were
                        fresh out of miracles.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry about your mother. 
                        Truly.  I have nothing to do with
                        Purdy's fundraising or Faith
                          Heritage.

                                        GEORGE
                        Your denial is too late to help
                        our mother.  Now I think it's
                        time for you to leave.  I've got
                          a lawsuit to prepare.

          The front door opens and Lennie enters, a little wary at
          the sight of Johnny and Bruce.

                                        LENNIE
                        George, what are they doing here?

                                        BRUCE
                          Leaving.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just wanted to know why.

          As Johnny approaches Lennie, Lennie backs away from him. 
          Lennie joins George and they stand side-by-side, a living
          diode.  Lennie then speaks to George as if Johnny isn't
          even there.

                                        LENNIE
                        What does he want?

                        Please go, Mr. Smith.

          Bruce and Johnny exchange glances - this is weird.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We'll find our way out.

          As they leave, Bruce picks up a picture from the table of
          the boys as children.  Identically dressed.  He places it
          back on the table, but askew; the display of pictures no
          longer symmetrical.  Lennie compulsively moves it back to
          its original spot.

                                        GEORGE
                        See you ...

                        ... in court.

          As Johnny shuts the door behind him, he catches a glimpse -
          one of the twins is smiling, the other bears a cold look
          on his face.  Just like the masks - comedy and tragedy.


  4242INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny broods as he watches TV, occasionally changing the
          channel with his remote.  Bruce is with him.

                                        BRUCE
                        So, you're just gonna sit here
                        and veg out?

          Click.  New channel.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I am.  Anything wrong with
                        that?

                                        BRUCE
                        Not a thing.

          And Bruce joins him on the couch as they stare at the TV,
          not really paying attention.  There's a long beat where
          neither says anything.

                        That's it?  No sage advice?  N
                          existential pep talk to spur me
                        into action? 

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, you want to sulk, be my guest.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This isn't sulking.  It's...
                              (a beat)
                        It's over.  What else can I do? 
                        Maybe I did see it wrong.  Maybe
                        you were right.  The mood I'm in,
                        the clothes I wear.  Maybe I only
                        do see the worst.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'd argue with you if I thought
                        you believed what you were saying.

          Johnny flips the channel.  A FOOTBALL GAME appears on
          screen, but nobody pays attention.

                                        BRUCE
                        You and I both know this isn't
                        over yet...

          Johnny gives Bruce a look that says, "Yeah, I know, but I
          don't want to hear about it" -- then goes back to his
          channel surfing.


          ON TV

          In slow-motion, we see a football player catch a ball and
          as he lands, his toe hits out-of-bounds.

                                          BROADCASTER (ON TV)
                        The ref totally missed that call. 
                        From this angle, they'd have to
                          overturn that play.


          CLOSE ON

          Johnny as he watches the replay.  Over and over.  Lost in
          thought.  Then, an idea sparks that hits him like a truck.

          Johnny sits in front of the computer downloading the

                        on the hoax video it was brushed
                        and pulled back in a ponytail,
                        see?  There was no sense of a
                          struggle.  But in my vision, it
                        was wild, like she fought back,
                        but couldn't escape.

  4848EXT. CAMPUS HOUSING - NIGHT

          Johnny sits idling in his car outside of Fernanda's house. 
          He finishes a cup of coffee, crumples and tosses it on
          the floor, joining a few other cups. 

          A light turns on in the house.  The blinds open just a
          bit.  Nicole, the roommate, looks outside.  Then quickly
          shuts the blinds.

          A moment later, Fernanda emerges at the door, marches
          towards the car.  Johnny steps out.

                                        FERNANDA
                        Come up and ring the doorbell, do
                        something, but quit watching us,
                        it's freaking out my roommate. 
                        What are you doing out here?

                        I'm calling the cops unless you
                        leave.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, this is going to sound crazy,
                        but you're in danger.  You need
                        to stay away from George Todd.

                                        FERNANDA
                        Why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Please.  I wouldn't be out here
                        if I didn't believe it.

          Fernanda scrutinizes.  Smiles.

                                        FERNANDA
                        You can't take it, can you?  We
                        got you and now you gotta do
                          something to justify whatever's
                        going on in your head.  It was
                        nothing but a joke.  That's it. 
                        A joke.

                          Consider the possibility.  For
                        even just a moment, that I'm right

          She starts to walk away.  Johnny watches as his chance
          fades, and grabs her arm -


  4949INT. MORTUARY - VIEWING CHAPEL - DAY

          It's Fernanda's viewing.  She lies dead in an open casket,
          her brown hair laid softly against a satin white pillow. 
            A Mourner crosses his chest - Father, Son & the Holy
          Spirit.  The view WIDENS to reveal Vision Johnny watching.

          Her bereaved MOTHER fixes her daughter's collar and opens
          a gold locket necklace.


          CLOSE ON THE LOCKET

            A picture of Fernanda as a child with her mother. 

          She fixes Fernanda's collar and gently places the necklace
          on Fernanda's chest.  Then the mother breaks down, stumbles
          backwards, emotions overtaking her...


  5050EXT. CAMPUS HOUSING - NIGHT

          Fernanda breaks away from Johnny's grip.

                                        FERNANDA
                        Let go of me!

                        I saw your funeral.  Your mother,
                        she had a locket... with a picture
                        of her holding you as a child. 
                        She'll give it to you in your
                        casket.  And then she'll fix your
                        collar.  Even in death she wants
                        you to look beautiful.

          Fernanda stares at Johnny, a bit surprised, scared.

                                        FERNANDA

          Fernanda rushes into her house and shuts the door.

          Keeping vigil.  A Sheriff's cruiser pulls up next to him.

          Walt sighs, a little annoyed.  Been through this already.

                        Next time, just call me rather
                        than stalking someone for the
                        night.

                        to her.


  5252EXT. FERNANDA'S HOME - NIGHT

          Walt rings the doorbell, Johnny at his side.  No answer.

                                        WALT
                          Fernanda Lauer, it's Sheriff
                        Bannerman.

          No response.  They notice the lights are all OUT.

                                        WALT
                        Lights are off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've been watching the door the
                        whole night.  Unless...

          Johnny and Walt walk around the house to the backyward
          where they notice the back window is OPEN.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She left!  I can't believe it.

                                        WALT
                        Calm down.  Let's not assume
                          anything just 'cause she's gone.

          BWOOP BWOOP.  Two campus cop cars FLY by them on the
          street.  Racing towards something.  They hear SIRENS in
          the distance, coming closer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  Something's wrong.

          Walt's radio crackles.  A Dispatcher is directing Sheriff's
          deputies to join the campus police.  They look at each
          other.  They already know what the call is...


  5353EXT. GEORGE & LENNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          The Todd house SWARMS with activity - Sheriff's Deputies,
            including ROSCOE  campus police, medical examiners, and
          bystanders.  Walt and Johnny head inside.          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - ACT THREE - 2/24/04 - YELLOW   42.


  53A53AINT. GEORGE & LENNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          George and Lennie, flanked by a couple of Sheriff's
            Deputies, watch as Johnny and Walt pass them, heading for
          the basement.  Johnny locks eyes with them as he passes.


  53B53BINT. BASEMENT - FROM THE BODY'S POV

          Johnny and Walt reach the bottom of the stairs, their
          faces registering the horror of what Johnny saw in his
          vision -- now real.

                                        WALT
                        I'm sorry, Johnny.  You were right.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (surveying the scene)
                        I wish I wasn't.


  53C53CINT. GEORGE & LENNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Roscoe meets Walt and Johnny as they reach the top of the
          stairs.

                                        ROSCOE
                        It looks just like the video off
                        the 'net.  Found this next to the
                        body...

          Roscoe pulls out a COMEDY MASK.

                                        WALT
                        Any sign of forced entry?

                                        ROSCOE
                          Basement door was broken.

                                        WALT
                                (damn)
                        We broke that door the other night.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Anything else?  

                                        ROSCOE
                        There was a note.

          Roscoe hands Walt a note sealed in a transparent evidence
          bag.

                                        WALT
                                (reading note)
                        "I don't like what you did to
                        Johnny Smith.  You deserve this."

                        A copy-cat killer?  You gotta be
                        kidding me.

                                        WALT
                        These guys picked you 'cause they
                        saw you on the news.  Who's to
                        say somebody didn't pick them
                        after seeing all the footage on
                        the internet?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  George and Lennie,
                        they planned it, they rehearsed
                        it, it's in their own basement.

                                        WALT
                        You can't deny you have a history
                        of attracting psychos from out of
                        the woodwork. 
                              (a beat)
                        In your visions, did you ever see
                        George and Lennie killing the
                        girl?  Or just someone in a mask?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw this girl killed.  Here. 
                        At nine P.M.

                                        ROSCOE
                          Coroner's estimated time of death
                        is nine P.M...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Roscoe)
                        Who phoned it in?

          Roscoe points to George and Lennie.  Walt walks up to
          George and Lennie, who look genuinely devastated.  Neither
          of them in good shape.

                                        WALT
                        You two are coming down to the

                          actually going through with it?

  5555INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny and D.A. Schweigel wait, watching.  Walt enters,
          shakes his head.

                                        D.A. SCHWEIGEL
                        They're right, this story's been
                        all over the media - papers, TV,
                        the net.  Anyone could have broken
                        into their home and done a copy-
                        cat murder given the well-
                        publicized blueprint.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me touch one of them.

                                        D.A. SCHWEIGEL
                        Can't do that.  Not without their
                          permission.  You have no legal
                          standing.  They'd see that as a
                          violation of their civil rights.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How do we not have a case?  It
                          happened in their own home.

                                        WALT
                        Let me just play Devil's Advocate
                        here.  The bloodstains found on
                        the boys?  Corn syrup.  From their
                        hoax.  There are fibers of the
                        girl's clothes all over the boys,
                        but seeing as how George was dating
                        her, that all adds up to a thick
                        cloud of reasonable doubt.

                                        D.A. SCHWEIGEL
                        If you hadn't fallen for their
                        scheme and searched their house
                        without their consent, we might
                        have had a case.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not going to charge them? 
                        You're going to just let them
                        walk?

                        I share your dislike for these
                        two, but we have no evidence other
                        than your - for lack of a better
                        word - "visions."  Visions which
                        we both know are unreliable and

  5656EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

          Johnny watches as George and Lennie walk out the front
          door.  Met by a media circus.  A REPORTER shoves a
          microphone towards them -

                        I want the man who did this brought

                                        LENNIE
                        We both do.  We're very sorry
                        that our thoughtless prank has
                        led to the death of a dear friend. 
                        We'll miss her very much.  Our
                        hearts go out to her family.

          They turn and get into a cab, ignoring questions from the
          press.  Cameras FLASH, confusing us as to which twin
          brother is which.

          Before the cab pulls away, Johnny catches the faintest
          glance of one of the brothers glaring back at him - one
          of them smirks at him.  But which one? 

          Off Johnny's look, determined he's not gonna let them get
          away with it.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          We pull back, Fernanda lies dead in an open casket.  Her
          mother sobs, a Mourner crosses his chest - it's the same
          scene that Johnny envisioned.  But this time, Johnny
          watches from just outside the door, saddened.  Bruce is
          with him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She died because I couldn't help
                        her in time.

          Walt approaches behind him, eyes the room.

                                        BRUCE
                        You really think a copycat did
                        this?

                                        WALT
                        No, but until there's solid
                          evidence that puts those two at
                        the scene, I've got to investigate
                        all possible suspects.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't you have any physical
                          evidence that ties them to the
                          murders?

                                        WALT
                        The forensics are inconclusive. 
                        But the Todd brothers have been
                        more than cooperative.  Even
                          volunteered to stay in a hotel
                        while we swept their home.  They
                        may be guilty, but they sure aren't
                        acting that way.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just want to know why.  Why did
                        they do it.

          George notices Johnny and Walt watching them.  Incensed,
          he comes to confront them, Lennie getting up to follow.          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - ACT FOUR - 2/24/04 - YELLOW   49.


  5858INT. EMPTY HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          George and Lennie enter.  Johnny walks in right behind
          them.  The door SNAPS shut.  They turn and face him. 
            Symmetrically.

                                        GEORGE
                        What do you want?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Having fun?

          George's face darkens.

                                        GEORGE
                        You think this is "fun" for us? 
                        Show some respect.

                                        LENNIE
                        I think you should leave.  This
                        is harassment.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You call this harassment?  This
                        is nothing.  I know you killed
                        her.  And I'm gonna prove it.

          George gets in Johnny's face.

                                        GEORGE
                        Listen, our stupid prank got
                          Fernanda killed.  Isn't that enough
                        for you?

                                        LENNIE
                        How could you take it this far? 
                        We deceived you, opened you up to
                        public ridicule.  And now, the
                        only way you can seem credible is
                        to continue pursing your own
                          delusion.  But this isn't the
                        time for your crusade.

          The door OPENS.  Walt and Bruce enter.

                                        WALT
                        Johnny?

                                        GEORGE
                          Sheriff, this man is harassing
                        us.

                                        LENNIE
                        Please, do your job.  For once.

          Bruce shoots them a look.  Walt bites his tongue as he
          pulls Johnny away.

                                        WALT
                        This is still an active murder
                          investigation.  Come on, let's
                        go.

          Bruce and Walt pull Johnny away.  Lennie smirks, and waves
          Johnny bye-bye, that same dark smirk he's flashed to him
          in the past...

                                        LENNIE
                                (biting)
                        Don't feel bad, Mr. Smith.  We
                        all make mistakes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're Lennie, right?

                                        LENNIE
                        Yeah.  Why?

          Johnny yanks away from Walt and BAM!, punches Lennie in
          the face. 

          As he makes contact, the image FREEZES as we RAMP INTO
          JOHNNY and HEAR a Dead Zone "whoosh."  Johnny's eyes go
          wide - he's clearly seen something disturbing.  As we
          unfreeze -

          Lennie crumbles to the floor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're sick.

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoah!  Chill.  Walt?!

          Bruce jumps between them.  George quickly goes to his
            brother's aid.  (Note:  from here on, Lennie will be
          recognized by a BRUISED CHEEK.)

                                        GEORGE
                        Back off Smith!  Sheriff?!

          Walt PULLS Johnny off Lennie, they TUMBLE back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You killed her...

          Johnny glares at Lennie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You killed her, and you made sure
                        it hurt.

          George seems confused.

    58CONTINUED: (2)58

                                        GEORGE
                        Lennie, what's he talking about?

                                        LENNIE
                        You're psychotic!  This is assault!

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to George)
                        While Fernanda was being murdered,
                        your brother pretended to be you. 
                        She called out your name. 

          George processes the possibility, pale with fright.

                                        LENNIE
                        It's a trick.  He's just trying
                        to get us to turn on each other.

                                        WALT
                        Johnny.  Out.  Now.

          Walt and Bruce scoop Johnny away, but not before he shoots
          the brothers a challenging look.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She thought you killed her, George. 
                        And she had no idea why...

          Off George's reaction...


  5959EXT. MORTUARY - DAY

          Walt escorts Johnny away from the bathroom.

                                        WALT
                        You better hope they don't press
                          charges.

                                        BRUCE
                        Guy is gonna have a nice shiner
                        after a hit like that.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Exactly.  Now I can tell them
                        apart.


  6060INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          From the vantage point of the hallway, we watch as each

          of the twins, identically dressed, walk between the rooms,
          changing out of their suits.

                                        LENNIE
                        Why aren't you saying anything?

          In and out, back and forth as they argue with one another. 
          It's fast, blurry and confusing as to who is who.

                                        LENNIE
                        George?

                                        GEORGE
                        What was Johnny Smith talking
                        about?

                                        LENNIE
                        It was nothing.  He's a joke and
                        he's bent that we proved it.

                                        GEORGE
                        He said she called out my name.

                                        LENNIE
                        It's the basic divide-and-conquer
                        cop strategy.  He fabricates a
                        story so we turn on each other.

                                        GEORGE
                        Why would we turn on each other
                        if we didn't kill her?

          They finally stop moving, meeting each other halfway.  Up
          close, we notice Lennie's cheek is bruised from the punch. 
            Mirroring each other.  A looking glass.

                                        GEORGE (Cont'd)
                        Tell me the truth, Len.  Did you
                        kill her?

                                        LENNIE
                        Did you?  I can't believe you're
                        falling for this -

    60CONTINUED: (2)60

                                        GEORGE
                        Did you kill Fernanda?

                                        LENNIE
                        What?  That's crazy.

                                        GEORGE
                        Say it.  Let me hear you say it.

          Lennie looks George in the eye.

                                        LENNIE
                        I did not kill her.

          George sinks.  Like a mother, Lennie caringly buttons
          George's shirt up.

                                        LENNIE
                        But they might think we did.  You
                          understand?  They'll look for
                        reasons to blame us.  We made
                        them look bad and now they're
                        going to pin this on us.


          ON GEORGE

          As a flood of emotion overcomes him as he absorbs the
          worst.  A tear rolls down his cheek.

                                        LENNIE
                        We need to stick together.  We're
                          brothers.

          George gently pushes Lennie's hands away, and walks into
          the other room.  Off Lennie, it's clear that he hasn't
          told his brother everything...


  6161INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Johnny sits alone, drinking a beer.  Distant.  The doorbell
          RINGS.  He answers the door.  It's George, filled with
          despair.

                                        GEORGE
                        I need to know what you saw in
                        your vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why the sudden interest?

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a beat)
                        Come inside.


  6262INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

          George sits with his head buried in his hands.  Shaking. 
          Johnny watches him, sympathetic.

                                        GEORGE
                        Thank you for talking to me.  I
                        had no where else to go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know the feeling...

                        You're probably wondering what I
                        was doing that night.  The night
                        she died...

                                        JOHNNY
                        The thought's crossed my mind.

                                        GEORGE
                        Why don't you just touch me and
                        find out?

          George offers Johnny his hands.  Johnny shakes his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want to hear it from you.

                                        GEORGE
                        I was out buying some groceries. 
                        For Fernanda and her mom.  Was
                        gonna cook for 'em.  Wanted to
                        get in good with the mother, you
                        know?  Impress her so I could ask
                        her daughter to... but my brother
                        left that night, said he forgot
                        some papers in class.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you don't believe him.

                                        GEORGE
                        I don't know what to believe.
                                  (miserable)
                        It was just supposed to be a hoax.

          He falls apart.  Short, sharp, panting breaths.

                                        GEORGE
                          I didn't hurt her.

          Johnny reaches out, touches George's hands.  We hear a
          Dead Zone WHOOSH.  After a moment...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.


  6363INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - EVENING

          Not a lot of officers here on night watch.  Johnny enters
          the station with George in tow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt around?

          Walt emerges from his office, eyeballs George, suspicious. 
          He pulls Johnny aside:

                                        WALT
                        What's going on?  What are you
                        doing with him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think you should listen to what
                        he has to say.

                                        WALT
                          I assume he's here to accuse his
                        brother of murder?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  How did you know?

          Walt points into the waiting area where Lennie sits. 
          Waiting.

                                        WALT
                        Because Lennie just walked in and
                        accused his brother George of the
                        same crime.


  6464INT. WALT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Walt circles his desk.  Johnny listens.

                                        WALT
                        Be careful, they could be playing
                        you again.

                        This could be another part of
                        their plan.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think so.  George didn't
                        kill her.  Lennie did.

                                        WALT
                        Lennie makes a compelling case
                        for George being the killer.  He
                        and Fernanda were having an affair
                        and George found out.  Problem
                        is, a jury will never be able to
                        convict either one.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Reasonable doubt?

                                        WALT
                        A smart defense attorney puts
                        those two on the witness stand,
                          George's word against Lennie --
                        the jury will never be able to
                        sort out the truth.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We can't let Lennie get away with
                        this.

                                        WALT
                        I'm open to suggestions.

          Johnny thinks for a moment, gets an idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can you get me into the evidence
                        room?

                                        WALT
                        Sure.  Why?


  6565INT. HOLDING AREA - LATER

          Lennie sits, bruised cheek.  Sipping a cup of coffee. 
          Cool as a cucumber.  Johnny walks in, carrying an evidence
          box. 

                                        LENNIE
                        You working for the Sheriff now? 
                        How apropos.

          Johnny takes the seat across from him.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: LOOKING GLASS - ACT FOUR - 2/23/04 - PINK   57.


    65CONTINUED:65

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your brother George just came in. 
                        Claims you're the one who murdered
                          Fernanda.

                                        LENNIE
                        Of course he would.  But George
                        is the guilty one.

          Johnny DUMPS the contents of the box onto the table. 
          Items from the hoax are wrapped in plastic evidence bags -
            a retractable knife, the rope he used to tie Fernanda up,
          the video camera, etc.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you did it.

          Lennie leans forward, whispers in Johnny's ear so that
          only he can hear:

                                        LENNIE
                                (sotto)
                        You can't see everything.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm here to offer you a chance to
                        save your brother.  There's no
                        such thing as a perfect crime. 
                        It's only a matter of time before
                        the physical evidence ties you
                        and George to the crime.  Then
                        you'll both go down for murder. 
                        But you and I know it was just
                        you who killed Fernanda, wasn't
                        it?
                              (a beat)
                        Are you gonna let your brother go
                        down for something you did?

          Lennie extends a hand to Johnny.

                                        LENNIE
                        Go ahead, Vision Quest, look all
                        you want.  Your visions aren't
                        admissible in a court of law.

                                        GEORGE (O.S.)
                        What have you done?

          George appears in the doorway.  Tears in his eyes.  Johnny
          seems confused.

                        George.  Get out. 

                                        GEORGE
                        Did you hate her, Len?  Is that
                        why you killed her?  Wasn't she
                        good enough for you?

          Lennie remains calm, maintaining composure.

                                        LENNIE
                        Stay out of it, George.  We'll
                        clear this up.  Just don't say
                          anything without our lawyer.  K?

                                        JOHNNY
                        George, leave.  Now.  I'm handling
                        this.

                                        GEORGE
                        Shut up, you freak.  I'm talking
                        to my brother.

          George, looking considerably distraught continues on
          Lennie.

                                        GEORGE
                        Were you jealous of her?  Just
                        give me reason.  I-I need a
                          reason...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt!  Get him out of here!

          Walt appears in the doorway.

                                        WALT
                        George, what are you doing?  Come
                        with me.  Roscoe?  Get him out of
                        here.

          Roscoe appears at the door.  He and Walt try to pull George
          out.  George strains against them.

                                        GEORGE
                                (shaking)

                        with you... knowing what you did...

          Lennie sees how pained George is.  This is no act.

                        Please, don't say anything 'til
                        our lawyer gets here.

          George resists as Roscoe drags him out of the room.

                                        GEORGE (O.S.)
                        Get off me!

          Lennie turns back to Johnny and Walt.

                        You were saying?

          Then O.S. we hear a SCUFFLE.  Walt goes to the door.

          BAM.  A gun shot.  Johnny DUCKS.  Lennie springs up.

                        Oh-my-god!  He... he shot himself. 
                        Walt?!

          Lennie panics, runs to the doorway, but Walt and Johnny
          grab him and stop him from going any further.

                                        WALT
                        No, Lennie, don't.  Everyone stay
                        where you are!

          Lennie wriggles but can't get free.  He cries out.

          LENNIE'S POV

          Lennie stares at George's lifeless body, laying face down
          in a pool of blood, the gun still in his hand.  Roscoe
          kneels over him.

                                        LENNIE (Cont'd)
                          No-no-no... why?  Why did he do
                        that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you crying for, Lennie? 
                        George just did you a big favor. 
                        Now that he's dead, you can pin
                        the murder on your brother and
                        nobody will be able to prove
                        otherwise.

          Lennie jumps up, paces in front of the mirror.

                                        LENNIE
                        Shut up!  Shut up!

          He punches the wall, in agony.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe there's such a thing as the
                        perfect crime after all.

          Lennie stares at himself in the mirror.

                                        LENNIE
                                (through tears)
                        You don't know anything... I loved
                        my brother.  Everything I did I
                        did for him!  He didn't understand
                        what she was doing to us.  She
                        blinded him to what was
                          happening... How she was pulling
                        us apart... I did it for him...
                        for us.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You killed her?

                                        LENNIE
                        I had to.  She left me no choice.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And George helped you?

                                        LENNIE
                        No... no... He didn't know.  He
                        loved her.  He just wanted to get
                        back at you.  The hoax was his
                        idea... But then he decided to
                        leave me -- to move in with her...
                        She messed up his mind... Don't
                        you see?  And now he's dead...
                        It's her fault... She left me no
                        choice.  I did it for him.

          As Lennie looks at his own reflection, the lights go up
          in the next room and the mirror becomes transparent....

          ...to reveal George standing on the other side of the
          glass.  Lennie is baffled.

                                        GEORGE
                                (through a speaker)
                        You did it for me?

                                        LENNIE
                        ...George?

          George walks to the doorway, wiping the blood off his
          face with his hand, holding his bloody hand up for Lennie
          to see...

                                        LENNIE
                        You're alive?  But...

                                        GEORGE
                        Fake blood from our hoax.  And
                        that was all it was supposed to
                        be, a hoax.  But you killed her. 
                        Why?  Because I loved her?

                                        LENNIE
                        She was just a girl.  We're
                          brothers.

                                        GEORGE
                              (a beat)
                        You're no brother of mine.  Not
                          anymore.

          And George walks out.  Leaving Lennie shocked, betrayed. 
          Walt slaps a pair of handcuffs on him.

                                        WALT
                        You're under arrest for the murder
                        of Fernanda Lauer.

                                        LENNIE
                        George?  Don't leave me?!  George!
                                (George walks away)
                        What am I going to do without
                        you?
                              (a beat)
                        George?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's gone, Lennie.  It's over.

          Off Lennie's pained look...


  6666EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - LATER

          Johnny walks out with Walt and Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, the press is going to have a
                        field day with this story.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I guess.

                                        WALT
                        At least your reputation will be
                        set straight.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My reputation got us into this
                        mess in the first place.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't you want people to know you
                        were right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        People believe what they want to
                          believe.  Lennie believed Fernanda
                        would take away his brother...
                        and in the end.  He didn't know
                        how right he was.

          And Johnny pulls up the collar of his dark coat, and walks
          off into the night.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
