      The California sun shines.  Palm trees sway with a light 
      breeze.  Convertibles cruise past with their tops down.  
      Tourists snap photos and local hipsters buzz by.  It appears 
      to be another glorious day, hooray for Hollywood, until...

      ...we PAN along THE WALK OF FAME -- find LISBON and JANE 
      reaching a taped off crime scene.  An EARLY MORNING CROWD 
      beginning to gather.  TV NEWS CREW setting up.  Lisbon and 
      Jane make their way through to...


      ...where, toward the back of the lot, FELIX HANSON (40's) is 
      on the ground, dead.  CSI creep about, collecting evidence.  
      UNIs keep onlookers at bay as LISBON and JANE find RIGSBY and 
      VAN PELT bagging the victim's wallet, taking notes... 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Victim is Felix Hanson, forty-
                    seven.  Took three bullets to the 
                    chest.  No weapon found.  The 
                    coroner estimates the shooting  *
                    occurred between midnight and three 
                    am. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Why's this ours boss?  Looks like a 
                    mugging to me.  Hollywood Homicide 
                    could handle it.  

      Jane kneels beside the victim.  Leans in close.  Gets a good 
      look.

                                  LISBON
                    The brass called it.  Hanson's 
                      super-rich, and he was a  
                      California State Rep the last six

                    Correct, but not quite fair.

                    Hanson was a good guy.  He ran a 
                    long crusade against the drug 
                    trade.  He kicked butt and named 
                    names and made a lot of enemies.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Wait, I know this guy.  He's semi-
                    famous.  He's the super rich guy 
                    that married Felicia Scott.  
                    She left movies to be with him.

                                  LISBON

                    Hot actress.  You know her.  She's

                          (can't place her)
                    Okay.  My point, if this was drug 
                    trade related, the AG will approve 
                    whatever resources it takes to 
                    close.  Anybody hear the shots, see 
                    what happened?

                                  RIGSBY 
                    No one's come forward so far.  But 
                    Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Chaplin 
                    over there were with Hanson when 
                    the first officer arrived on scene.  

      JANE'S POV: CHO talking with good, but not great 
      impersonations of MARILYN MONROE and CHARLIE CHAPLIN several 
      feet away.

      Jane looks around to Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe, both 
      grumpy and tired.

      NEW ANGLE 

      On Cho and Charlie and Marilyn.  Jane comes over and studies 
      them intently.

                    The other police already asked us

      Marilyn sounds nothing like Marilyn.

                    For the umpteenth time, I was going

                    very much like Marilyn Monroe at

                    No.  We left soon after.  We were 
                    having a good time, but I wanted to 
                    be up early this morning.  First 
                    day of production is tomorrow.

      Gabriel holds up a SCRIPT.

                                    GABRIEL
                    The movie I'm directing, "A Dozen 
                    Roses."  Felix financed the 
                    picture.  That's why we had dinner 
                    last night, we were celebrating his 
                    first foray as a film producer.

                    How did Hanson get into film 
                      producing?

                    And she looks better now than she 
                    did then.  Just as good anyhow.

                      A mother's quest to find good men 
                    for her three daughters.  It's 
                    funny, it's moving, it's sexy.  
                    It's about family, and redemption, 
                    and --

                    I loved him.  Loved him. So many 
                    people in this town are phonies.   
                    Felix Hanson was real. Felix, he 
                    didn't like something, he'd say so.

                                  JANE

                                    GABRIEL
                    Nothing.  I'm saying, in general, 
                    he was real, like that. 

                                  LISBON

                    Yup.  Brave man.  But he's doing it 
                    for Felicia, of course.  Not just 
                    for the potential profits.

                    Didn't see anyone.  I parked down 
                    the street.  We shook hands and 
                    said goodbye.

      under and step over heavy equipment, the crew mill about,

                    Sure you were.  Even after all 
                    these years, you still lie awake at 
                    night sometimes, thinking of all 
                    the ways you could wreak revenge on 
                    your tormentors.  

      Mitch says nothing, a palpable hit. *

                    And now out of fear and avarice, 
                    you let this man Fanning bully you 
                    the same way.  Same way.  Get a 
                    life, Mitch.

                    Or get arrested.

      Mitch takes a beat, steps aside.  Jane and Lisbon step up to 
      the trailer door.


      Felicia is in character -- as ROSE, the hip, wry, witty, 
      radiantly beautiful owner of a hip wry witty New York City  
      flower shop.  Felicia is ever more alive under CAMERA LIGHTS, 
      fully engaged and in her element.  She's arranging a flower 
      display outside her store and talking on the phone... 

      We start IN CLOSE and PULL BACK as the scene progresses so 
      that we see the camera crew and the ADs sending extras across 
      the set.  Jane is seated behind Gabriel in Video Village.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Daisy, where are you?

      JUST OFF CAMERA, Sydney replies, reading from the script.

                          (flatly)
                    I'm home.  I'm not feeling so good.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Oh but pudden, you have to come.

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    Why?  Why is it so important?

      Felicia stops suddenly.  Takes a beat.  Her emotions weigh 
      heavy.

                    Rowan's not even interested in me

                    Let's pick it up where we left off.  
                    Rowan's not interested in me... 

      Gabriel gestures to the Assistant Director, who gets the 
      cameras turning...

                                  SOUNDMAN (O.S.)

                    Action.

      Sydney puts real life into her lines this time.

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    Rowan's not interested in me and 
                    I don't want him anymore anyway. 

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Oh honey.  Don't give up on your 
                    dreams so easily.

      Gabriel silently cues the entrance of a handsome young actor, 
      (20's) playing ROWAN, a preppy rich guy.  Rose doesn't notice 
      him at first and keeps talking on the phone.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     26.

      This last as she notices Rowan.

                    Hello, Rowan.

                                  ROWAN
                    Good morning, Mrs. Atkins.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    I'm sorry, Daisy's not here right 
                    now.

                                  ROWAN
                    Actually, it's you that I wanted to 
                    speak with.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE

                    What you said just now?  About 
                    love?  

        Impetuously, he takes her in his arms and kisses her.      
      She pulls away after a beat, and slaps him, hard.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Cut!  Lovely.  Great.  Let's go 
                    again.  Geoff baby, don't flinch 
                    before she throws the slap.  You 
                    don't know it's coming.  

      Rowan's real voice is estuary English...

                                  ROWAN
                    She's taking a right old wallop at 
                    me.  It hurts.

                    I have an idea. 

      Only Jane notices that Sydney drops her script and slips 
      away.  Jane follows her off the set...

                    Speed. *

        Felicia/Rose arranges flowers outside her store, a phone to 
      her ear.  Script pages are close to hand.  

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Daisy my love, where are you?

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    I'm right here, Mom.

      Sydney, as Daisy, comes down the busy street, looking like a 
      million dollars.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Wow, look at you.  You look, good.

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    Thank you.  What were you calling 
                    me about?

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    Just making sure you were coming.

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    Why is it so important I be here?

      Felicica/Rose takes a beat. 

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    I did a naughty thing.  Rowan's 
                    coming here to meet you.  I called 
                    and pretended I was you.

                                  SYDNEY/DAISY
                    Oh no.  You didn't.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    I did.  I'm sorry, bunny.

      Sydney's speaking for herself now.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Why would you do that?  Why play 
                    games with me?  You already seduced 
                    him away from me.  

      That's not the line.  But Felicia runs with it. (NB Rowan is 
      waiting for his cue and becomes ever more confused as the 
      scene progresses.) 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     49.

                                  FELICIA/ROSE
                    I did not!  How can you say that?

                                  SYDNEY
                    Stop acting.  It's over.  I know 
                    what you did.  I know who you are.  
                    You've always hated me.  You 
                    seduced Brandon and lied to him and 
                    made him kill my father.

      Horrified, Felicia drops the acting.  The Crew and the Extras 
      are all frozen, staring. 

                                    FELICIA
                    You're mad!  Gabe really, what 
                    the...

      Felicia tries to walk away, but Sydney takes her by the wrist 
      and won't let go.  She's full of fire.

                                  SYDNEY
                          (growling)
                    You're not going anywhere!

                                    FELICIA
                    Gabe!  Cut!  She's gone mad.  

      On Jane, Lisbon and Gabriel and all in the Video Village, 
      transfixed, still.

                                  SYDNEY
                    I'll let you go.  After you tell me 
                    it's not true.  Tell me I'm wrong.  
                    Tell them.     

      Felicia looks around at a sea of faces all staring at her, 
      waiting. 

                                    FELICIA
                    She's mad.  It's not, it's not 
                    true.

      Sydney lets her go.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Liar!

      Felicia's in her natural element, and as Jane expected, the 
      presence of LIGHTS and an audience compels her to stay and 
      defend herself... 






                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     50.

                    This is ridiculous.  I have no idea 
                    what Brandon's been saying, but 
                    whatever it is, it's nonsense.  
                    And it's upsetting.  And unfair.

      Jane walks onto the set.

                                  JANE
                    Sydney, you were fabulous, but 
                    you...
                          (pointing to Felicia)
                    I'm sorry, I don't buy it.  You're 
                    wooden and high-pitched.  Believe 
                    it, Felicia.  Believe it.  Then we 
                    will.  Okay?

                                    FELICIA
                          (thrown)
                    Uh...

                                  JANE
                    Let's try one more.  Take it from 
                    "this is ridiculous"...

      Felicia begins to suspect she's having a nightmare.

                                    FELICIA 
                    I, this, I'm not, what?  I don't 
                      understand... 

                                  JANE
                    It's easy to understand.  You told 
                    Brandon that Felix was abusing you.  
                    Persuaded Brandon to kill Felix.  
                    And when you feared he'd confess to 
                    the police, you lured him to your 
                    house, planning to kill him as 
                    well.  But now Sydney sees the 
                    truth, and she knows you're a 
                    conniving murderous bitch.  

      Felicia tries to slap him.  But he catches her wrist.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Too melodramatic.  Your whole world 
                    is about to fall apart.  You're 
                    done.  Unless you can make us 
                    believe you're telling the truth 
                    now.  

                                    FELICIA
                    My work is always truthful.

                                    FELICIA
                    That's a terrible thing to say.

                                  JANE
                    Tell us the truth, Felicia.  Make 
                    it real. 

      Felicia breaks down.

      FLASHBACK


      Brandon leads Felix off the boulevard and down the alley.  

                                    BRANDON
                    She's in the car...

                                    FELICIA (V.O.)
                    He told Felix that Sydney was in 
                    trouble.  And Felix came right 
                    along.

      Brandon takes the gun out then takes several steps before 
      summoning the nerve to turn and shoot Hanson three times.  
      Then he runs off. 

      END FLASHBACK
