  FADE IN:


  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  The sun hangs low. BATIATUS and LUCRETIA stand proud atop 
  the balcony, which brims with ROMAN ELITE. DOMITIA, 
  NUMERIUS, AEMILIA and her husband SEXTUS among them. 
  ILITHYIA is at Lucretia's side, a forced smile gracing her 
  lips. ASHUR hovers near Batiatus, ever the loyal dog. MIRA 
  and AURELIA serve wine and food in the background.

  SPARTACUS, AGRON, DURO, CRIXUS, and the other Gladiators are 
  on display in the training square. All are in CHAINS, under 
  the watchful eye of DOCTORE. GUARDS and several of GLABER'S 
  MEN, led by IOVIS, are stationed to keep the gladiators in 
  check. Spartacus is fixed on Batiatus as he addresses the 
  crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The noble House of Batiatus stands 
                        deeply humbled! Humbled by the 
                        blessings the gods have seen fit to 
                        shower upon us. And by the presence 
                      of the most revered citizens in all 
                      of Capua, come to join in 
                        celebrating the patronage of 
                        Legatus Claudius Glaber!

  Polite applause. Spartacus steals a concerned glance at 
  Crixus. Crixus does not return it with his usual blistering 
  scorn. He simply averts his eyes, lost in his own thoughts.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The man himself regrets duties of 
                        the senate prevent attendance. Yet 
                      he would see you properly 
                        addressed, his words delivered by 
                        pleasing tongue of trusted wife.

  He indicates Ilithyia. She steps forward, reading from a 
  small scroll.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Good citizens of Rome's favored 
                        sister. It is with great pleasure 
                        that I, Legatus Claudius Glaber, 
                        bestow upon Quintus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus my patronage, and all 
                        encompassing benefits. No man in 
                        all of Capua is more deserving of 
                        such esteemed privilege.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.
  CONTINUED:

  The hint of displeasure lurks behind Ilithyia's practiced 
  smile as she glances at Lucretia. Lucretia returns it with a 
  satisfied one of her own.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        Good Batiatus should be held as 
                        example to a city mired in shadows 
                        and treachery.

  Agron fidgets, his eyes flicking to the Guards.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        The guiding light of his virtuous 
                        heart providing illumination in 
                        these dark and troubling times. For 
                        this reason and too many others to 
                        give voice, I lend Batiatus full 
                        and unconditional support towards 
                        the honored position of Aedile.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  soft, to Agron)(
                        Still yourself.

  The crowd TITTERS. Sextus eyes Batiatus in surprise.

                                        SEXTUS
                        Aemilia failed to mention you had 
                        mind towards office.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I admit to none, good Sextus. Until 
                        the Legatus broached the subject.

                                        SEXTUS
                        Aedile is but a breath below 
                        Magistrate. We should dine, and 
                        discuss the matter further.

  Batiatus shares a smile with Lucretia. Everything is going 
  according to plan. He turns back to the crowd, beaming.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My heart to Legatus Glaber and his 
                        support. In hopes that you will 
                        share it in the days to come, I 
                        present a gift of blood! Two 
                        legends of the arena, to face each 
                        other sine missione! No quarter 
                        given! No mercy shown! Behold, 
                        Crixus! The savage Gaul!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.
  CONTINUED:

  There's more than a little contempt in that description. A 
  fleeting look of GUILT clouds Lucretia's eyes as Crixus 
  steps forward. The crowd applauds, excited as Crixus is 
  unchained and given sword and shield. Ashur eyes his hated 
  nemesis with a barely contained, KNOWING SMILE.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And who shall attempt to tame him? 
                        There could be but one! Spartacus! 
                        Slayer of the Shadow of Death!

  The crowd goes wild as Spartacus is unchained and given two 
  swords. Mira watches with fearful intensity.

                                          AEMILIA
                      He is of a form, is he not?

                                        NUMERIUS
                      He stands a god.

  Aurelia glances at him, uncertain, trying to unravel 
  something in her mind.

  SPARTACUS

  squares off against Crixus, but something is obviously 
  troubling him. He whispers, attempting to broach subject.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Crixus --

                                        CRIXUS
                        I have given you answer. Let us 
                        finish this.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  Crixus attacks. Spartacus hardens his resolve and counters, 
  trading thunderous blows. As their swords clash --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  (TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FIGHT.) PRACTICE SWORDS CLASH as 
  Spartacus spars with RHASKOS. Iovis and VESPER stalk the 
  training square, clubs at the ready. Gladiators that aren't 
  sparring are in chains.

  RHASKOS ATTACKS,

  moving in close to hiss at Spartacus, his voice a low growl.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.
  CONTINUED:

                                          RHASKOS
                        You speak of dangerous things.

  Spartacus counters, sending Rhaskos crashing to the ground.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      We live in dangerous times.

  He offers his hand to help Rhaskos up. Rhaskos hesitates. He 
  takes it, drawing close to give reply.

                                          RHASKOS
                        Many yet hold Crixus our true 
                        champion. As he draws breath, count 
                      me among them.

  Rhaskos moves off. Spartacus frowns, calls to Doctore.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Doctore. I would work the palus.

  Doctore looks to Iovis, not liking the new hierarchy of 
  command.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Permission for Spartacus.

  Iovis absently waves his approval. Doctore nods to 
  Spartacus. Spartacus works the palus beside Agron. Duro 
  trains nearby.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Have you traded words with 
                        Hamilcar?

                                        AGRON
                      He is with us. But Liscus and the 
                        Gauls refuse to grab cock without 
                        Crixus holding their balls. Where 
                        does Rhaskos stand?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The same. Our numbers are yet 
                        shallow. We must gain Crixus' 
                        support and see them rise.

                                        DURO
                        The fucking mad man is still under 
                        lock and key. How will you turn him 
                      to cause if you cannot break words 
                        with him?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                        Being champion yet affords 
                        privilege. A way shall present 
                        itself.

  GRUNTS OF PAIN pull their attention to Iovis and Vesper as 
  they beat a GLADIATOR on the ground. Iovis grins at Doctore. 
  Doctore glares, but turns away, having no recourse.

                                        AGRON
                      It had best "present" fucking soon.

  OFF SPARTACUS, feeling the truth of that as he returns to 
  training, the blow of his sword WIPING US TO --


  INT. HOLDING CELL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  CRIXUS sits chained to the wall, his back mostly healed from 
  the lashing he received (ep. 112). The cell door opens. A 
  GUARD brings in his meal of gruel and water, exits, locking 
  the door behind him. A beat. Crixus eats with his hands. 
  Slowly. Without interest or pleasure. Feeling only the 
  crushing loss of Naevia.

  REVEAL LUCRETIA

  watching unseen from the grate in the door. She takes him in 
  for a tortured beat, the sight of him a knife in her heart. 
  OFF Lucretia's pain as she turns away...


  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  Batiatus enters with Ashur, passing more of GLABER'S MEN 
  stationed at the huge DOUBLE DOORS of the entrance.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  beaming)(
                        Glaber falls to patronage, and the 
                        men of influence greet me as 
                        fucking brother!

                                        ASHUR
                        A day of shining glory.

  Ashur spots a dour Doctore waiting for Batiatus, Iovis 
  standing escort.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Marred by darkening cloud.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                                  glaring at Ashur)(
                      In private.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Spill sour thoughts, and see them 
                        sweetened.

  Batiatus motions for Doctore to follow him. Iovis and Ashur 
  remain behind, watching them as they exit.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Glaber's mercenaries punish absent 
                        cause. The men suffer at their 
                        hand.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It is a burden that must be 
                        endured. I have no time for such 
                        petty concerns.

                                          DOCTORE
                        With respect, every ludus requires 
                        the attention of its lanista.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I seek loftier title, far removed 
                        from the arena.

  Batiatus moves into the TROPHY ROOM. Doctore follows, 
  shocked.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You would see your family's 
                        heritage a thing of memory?

                                        BATIATUS
                        No. Yet I tire of the drudgery, and 
                        would have my interests in blood 
                        and sand overseen by more attentive 
                        eyes. Those of someone who has 
                        forever proven himself loyal to the 
                        House of Batiatus...

  Doctore is stunned, realizing Batiatus is referring to him.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You would entrust the ludus to a 
                        slave?

                      No longer shall you be my doctore. 
                        You will assume mantle of lanista, 
                        and be warmly greeted by your name, 
                        Oenomaus.

  Far from elated, Doctore slips into a troubled frown.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I thought the news to please you.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Apologies, I... I have heard rumor. 
                        One that has vexed sleep.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Give voice, and dream again.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Barca was not granted freedom. 
                        Instead he met his end, at your 
                        hands.

  A tense beat. Batiatus locks eyes with Doctore.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The rumor is true. Yet reasoning 
                        absent from it. Barca was 
                        dispatched to deliver simple 
                        message to Ovidius. Instead he 
                        slaughtered the man and his entire 
                        fucking house, against command. I 
                        had no choice but to take his life, 
                        before the Magistrate discovered 
                        the deed and pulled us to ruin.

                                          DOCTORE
                        And Ashur? Did he aid you in this 
                        "choice"?

  Batiatus considers Doctore for a moment.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

                      of consequence. And know your

  Batiatus exits. OFF DOCTORE, absorbing his words...


  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - SUNSET (FLASHBACK)

  Mira and Aurelia pour wine and lay out food. Lucretia 
  ignores them, absently watching Spartacus and the men train 
  as the sun sets. Her mind drifts towards Crixus, her hand 
  absently dropping to caress her belly. Batiatus' hand slips 
  over hers as he appears behind her, nuzzling her neck.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Can you yet feel him move, eager to 
                        make entrance into the world?

                        Glaber's patronage, access to the 
                        upper strata of Capua, the promise 
                      of political office. Everything we 
                        have bled for, finally within 
                        grasp.

                      We are truly blessed.

  Lucretia forces a sad smile, thoughts of Crixus lingering. 
  Batiatus flares in frustration.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I but deliver glorious news this

                        mind towards celebration. Glaber's 
                        patronage may have paved road to 
                        the elite, but they are of ravenous 
                        appetites.

                        death.

                        Virilis, where Varro fell to 
                        Spartacus' sword.

  Aurelia tenses in the background, the words a knife in her 
  heart. Mira catches that, can't help but feel pity.

                        Varro was never match for the

                        crowd what was denied that night. 
                        What all of Capua longs to see, yet 
                        only the privileged few under our 
                        roof will bear witness to.

                        defeated him.

                        Gaul be granted fucking opportunity 
                      to regain position?

  INT. OFFICE - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  Spartacus, hands shackled, is led into Batiatus' office by 
  Iovis and Vesper. Batiatus waves them out.

  Spartacus falls into FRAME with Mira, naked, kissing and

  He can barely speak the words, tears welling in his eyes. 
  Mira takes him in, her own heart breaking.

  Mira kisses him, soft and gentle. Spartacus stops her. Mira 
  locks eyes with him, her own filled with longing.

                        the love you felt for her...

  She kisses him. He hesitates, then responds, not with love 
  but with compassion for a woman who has never known a gentle 
  touch. As they roll over, SMASH TO --

  SLAM BACK TO THE PRESENT. Spartacus CRASHES to the ground, 
  bleeding. Crixus charges, attempting to sever head from 
  neck. Spartacus narrowly intercepts the blow, managing to 
  kick Crixus back and regain his footing. Crixus hammers him 
  with sword and shield. Spartacus shoots a look to

  glances at Lucretia, trying to muster her nerve.

  Batiatus shares a look with Lucretia. Ashur suppresses a

  courage.

  Mira glances down to Spartacus, gives a subtle shake of her 
  head. She's trapped.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus grits his teeth, refocusing his attention on 
  deflecting Crixus' deadly assault. Agron shares a concerned 
  look with Duro. The plan is falling apart.

  CRIXUS

  redoubles his attack. Spartacus counters, drawing in close 
  to hiss at him.

  Crixus snarls, answering with his sword and drawing blood.

  bloodlust as Crixus pounds Spartacus. ANGLE ON Doctore, 
  proudly watching his protege as WE SMASH TO --

  Crixus eyes him in surprise.

  SHOUTS and CHEERS erupt. Agron and Duro turn to gawk as 
  Crixus steps out into the square with Doctore. Iovis glares 
  as Rhaskos and a crush of other loyal men cheer and thump 
  swords against shields.

                        cause.

                        the sun, and restore the world to 
                        its proper place.

  OFF ILITHYIA'S "WARM" SMILE, the hatred behind it pulsating 
  to be freed...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/MESS HALL - LUDUS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  Spartacus eyes Crixus as he trains with a GLADIATOR. Crixus 
  is intense and focused, a killing machine waiting to be 
  unleashed. He slams the Gladiator with his shield, sending 
  him crashing to the sand. Rhaskos and other followers of 
  Crixus grin and laugh. Doctore cracks his whip.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        Rest and eat. We resume when midday 
                        sun has past.

  Doctore nods to Crixus as he moves off, pleased by his 
    performance. Crixus gives his shield and sword to a SLAVE.

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        You move well.

  Crixus glances at Spartacus, who hands ANOTHER SLAVE his own 
  swords.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      As if lash had never been struck.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Pain is erased, when inflicted upon 
                        others. I hear gratitude is 
                        deserved for my release to 
                        training.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would have you at your best when 
                      we face each other.

                                        CRIXUS
                      Is that all you would have from me?

  Crixus shifts his eyes to Rhaskos as he passes. Spartacus 
  shoots him a troubled frown. Crixus snorts.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        What fever grips brain, that 
                        Spartacus would think me to band 
                        with him? To risk the life of my 
                        men? My life?

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Is there one? Without the woman you 
                        love within it?

                                        CRIXUS
                        I have never had stronger reason to 
                        live.

  He heads for the Mess Hall across the square. Spartacus 
  follows, his voice low.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I know your heart, Crixus. I felt 
                        the beating of it within my chest 
                        once.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                        survive. And see Naevia returned to 
                        me.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      As my wife was returned? Batiatus 
                        ordered her death.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  shocked)(
                        How do you come to this?

                                          SPARTACUS
                      By tongue of his man Aulus, before 
                        silencing it forever. I will see 
                        the House of Batiatus fall, and 
                        with it the villain's blood upon 
                        the earth.

  Crixus weighs that, the revelation striking a deep chord.

                                        CRIXUS
                      As would I, in your place. Yet I am 
                        far removed from it. My escape 
                        would not aid Naevia's. How would I 
                        purchase her freedom, or even find 
                        her, while being hunted like an 
                        animal by the Romans?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Join me, and we will find her. 
                        Together.

  Crixus considers Spartacus with newly minted eyes.

                                        CRIXUS
                      In another life, perhaps you and I 
                        would have been as brothers.
                                (a beat, with 
                                  regret)
                        But not in this one. I must win my 
                        freedom in the arena. Only then 
                        does hope of Naevia swell.

  Spartacus accepts that with begrudging respect.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then we stand in the way of each 
                        other's cause.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And both are just.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And I would have word that if you 
                        are victorious, one day you will 
                        have Batiatus' life.

  A beat. Crixus extends his arm. They grasp forearms, sealing 
  the bond among enemies.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Tomorrow, then. One of us dies.

                        Crixus! Come away! A dog eats in 
                        his cage!

  Crixus grins sadly at Spartacus.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I fear it was always fated so.

  OFF SPARTACUS as he watches Crixus being led away, no longer 
  nemesis, yet neither friend...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  Aurelia pours wine for Batiatus. He eats an apple, cutting 
  slices off with a SILVER KNIFE as Ashur enters.

                                        ASHUR
                        Dominus.

                        need for tomorrow?

                        Good Marcellus was ever helpful.

  He eyes Aurelia, not wanting to say more in front of her.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Leave us.

  Aurelia exits. Ashur appreciates her on the way out.

                        Varro possessed a fine eye.

  Ashur produces a small blue bottle from his robes.

                        end of that fucking Gaul.

  Batiatus sweeps out. OFF ASHUR, his eyes shining darkly at 
  the thought...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS' LUDUS - SUNSET

  SLAM BACK TO THE PRESENT. Spartacus and Crixus trade blows. 
  Both bloodied by the conflict. If Crixus has been drugged, 
  it sure as fuck isn't showing.

  THE BALCONY

  Numerius ROARS in excitement as Crixus lands a series of

  Aurelia tenses, her uncertainty towards Numerius shifting 
  towards thinly veiled hatred.

                        chance, did he?

  She shares a sly smile with Numerius. He barely contains

  attentions to the fight.

  He shoots Lucretia a look of concern.

  A faint, ambiguous smile graces her lips. Batiatus tenses. 
  Does she know more than she's letting on?

  rip his attention back to the fight. All eyes are transfixed 
  by the epic battle. Mira senses her moment. She steels her 
  nerves and quietly fades back into the villa.

  The sound of the crowd and swords clashing boom as Mira

  The Slaves finish with Batiatus' robes. Lucretia adjusts

  He places a hand on Lucretia's belly, beaming.

  Batiatus exits. OFF LUCRETIA, regret over betraying Crixus 
  gnawing at her despite her words...


  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  Aurelia knocks over a bowl of olives, quickly tries to herd 
  them. Ashur appears, lending hand.

                        These celebrations can cause hands 
                      to tremble. Even the most practiced 
                        ones.

  Ashur takes an ornate tray, begins building a meal on it.

                        See nerves calmed. You will do well 
                        here. I have a feeling of it.

  Ashur smiles warmly. Aurelia forces a polite, uncomfortable 
  smile, shifting attention to Ashur's food.

                        I would save prayer. I do not 
                        believe Spartacus will fall this 
                        day.

  Aurelia eyes him carefully.

                        I have heard Crixus bested him in 
                        the arena once, at the Vulcanalia. 
                        What leads you to certainty against 
                        similar outcome?

  Aurelia disengages from Ashur with an uncomfortable smile. 
  Ashur's eyes lick her as she exits with Mira before turning 
  back to Crixus' deadly meal. He fishes

  THE SMALL BLUE BOTTLE

  out from his robes and clandestinely pours a few drops into 
  an ornate cup. He plucks a FLOWER from the table arrangement 
  and lovingly places it on the tray as a final touch. OFF 
  ASHUR's dark smile...

  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

  Spartacus, Agron, Duro and the other men are sitting in the 
  training square in chains, eating as SLAVES decorate the 
  Mess Hall. Doctore passes, whip in hand. Agron waits, then 
  whispers to Duro.

                                        AGRON
                        Stay to my side. Do not stray from 
                        it, and I will see you beyond these 
                        walls.

                        you fucking cock!

  Doctore glances back with a glare, continues on.

                        wields it.

                        Doctore is an honorable man. I 
                        would not have him dead. Nor any 
                        slave.

                      to purpose without Crixus.

  Spartacus spots Aurelia as the Guard stationed inside the 
  pantry unlocks the gate with his KEY for her. She enters 
  with the basket of flowers.

  Doctore looks to Iovis for permission. Iovis absently waves 
  his approval. Spartacus heads to the rain barrel -- which is 
  right next to where Aurelia is placing flowers. He drinks, 
  keeping an eye on Iovis as he whispers to her.

                        For many things. But not this. It 
                        was the boy Numerius who demanded 
                        simple sport end in death.

  That stops Aurelia. She eyes Spartacus, then hardens.

                        would do anything to win?

  Spartacus glances at her, having no idea what she's talking 
  about. Aurelia snorts in disgust.

                        purchase from Marcellus. A shit 
                        well known in the market as peddler 
                      of flesh and deception. And now 
                        Ashur prepares meal for Crixus, and 
                        speaks of the certainty of your 
                        fucking victory.

  The shock of realization slams into Spartacus.

  CLOSE ON the tray of food Ashur prepared for Crixus as a 
  Guard sets it down. WIDEN as he exits. A chained Crixus eyes 
  the indulgent meal with surprise. He picks up the FLOWER on 
  the tray, considers it for a moment before crushing it. He 
  takes the ornate cup of water, but before he can drink --

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                        Child?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Seed has at last taken hold. The 
                        gods bless us.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You divine me as father? Not 
                        dominus?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I feel the blood of a champion, 
                        swelling within me. I feel you, 
                        Crixus.

  Crixus takes that in, softening with a faint, sad smile.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I have often dreamt, in quiet 
                        moments, of having children.
                                  a beat, hardening)(
                        With Naevia.

  Lucretia barely holds back the sting of the rejection.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Then there is truly nothing left 
                        between us.

  She turns to leave. Crixus picks up his cup. She pauses, her 
  conscience seizing her.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Crixus --

  Crixus pauses, the damned cup hovering close to lip. A 
  frozen moment. Lucretia wrestles with her conscience -- and 
  subdues it.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I did not wish it to end this way.

  She turns and goes, knowing that she is condemning him to 
  death. Crixus watches her for a moment, then brings the 
  tainted cup to his lips. As he drinks --

                                                                    SMASH BACK TO:                                                                                    32.


  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - SUNSET

  Crixus pounds Spartacus -- but begins to falter, the drug 
  finally taking effect. He blinks the sweat from his eyes, 
  confusion washing across his face as he stumbles back. 
  Spartacus seizes the moment, attacking. The crowd ROARS.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus grins in relief, whispers to Lucretia.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus begins to fade.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      As all memories do.

  Her eyes harden as she drains her wine. She holds her cup 
  out for Mira to refill it.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Mira --

  She turns, surprised to find her gone.

  PANTRY GATE

  TIGHT ON a bloodied HAND as it unlocks the gate. WIDEN TO 
  REVEAL Mira with a key taken from the Guard she killed.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus spots Mira standing in the now open gateway to the 
  pantry. She holds up her blood-stained palm as a signal.

  SPARTACUS SNARLS,

  attacking Crixus. Crixus struggles to counter, his vision 
  blurring from the drug. They lock swords, Spartacus leaning 
  in to hiss a warning.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You weaken because of something in 
                        your food! They wish you dead.

  Crixus shoves Spartacus back. He looks up at Lucretia in 
  shock. She averts her eyes, her guilt obvious. Crixus growls 
  in rage, knowing he has been undone as he attacks Spartacus. 
  Spartacus easily counters, hammering him.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

                        I would not have this. Join me, 
                        brother. And see the House of 
                        Batiatus fall.

  Crixus struggles with the choice as he continues to fight. 
  With his last ounce of strength he manages to knock one of 
  Spartacus' swords loose. It spins into the air, landing near 
  Agron.

  SPARTACUS UNLEASHES ON CRIXUS,

  landing a blow that sends him crashing back onto the sand. 
  The crowd CHEERS. Agron tenses. This is it.

  BLOOD DRIPS

  down Crixus' face, the world coming through in distorted 
  waves. He locks eyes with Spartacus -- and taps his shield, 
  signaling his acceptance of what must be done.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Spartacus...

  SPARTACUS BELLOWS

  and charges. Crixus raises his shield at the last moment. 
  Spartacus uses it as ramp, as he did against Theokoles. TIME 
  SLOWS as he SOARS THROUGH THE AIR towards the balcony, 
  framed by the golden light of the setting sun.

  BATIATUS

  constricts in horror as he sees Spartacus slamming towards 
  him. He grabs Sextus at the last moment, using him as a 
  shield as TIME RESUMES. Spartacus runs Sextus through the 
  head as he lands on the outside of the balcony.

  PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS

  as Sextus tumbles from the balcony, taking Ashur with him as 
  he clutches for purchase with his dying breath. TIME SLOWS 
  as Ashur crashes to the ground, Sextus' body breaking his 
  fall as he's knocked unconscious.

  SPARTACUS REARS BACK

  to split Batiatus' skull in two. Batiatus' eyes go wide. 
  CRACK! TIME RESUMES as Spartacus' hand is stopped by





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

  DOCTORE'S WHIP

  lashing around his wrist from below. Guests scream as they 
  rush back into the villa. Batiatus wades through them with 
  Lucretia and Ilithyia as Spartacus struggles against 
  Doctore's whip. He's about to tumble from the balcony when

  CRIXUS SEVERS THE WHIP

  with his sword. Doctore flies back, sliding to a stop 
  dangerously close to the edge of the cliff, dazed, face 
  bleeding. Crixus roars to the men.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Kill them! Kill them all!

  CHAOS as Rhaskos and the other men erupt into violence. 
  Agron grabs up Spartacus' fallen sword and attacks the 
  Guards. Duro swings his chain, smashing a Guard in the face.

  THE BALCONY

  Spartacus shakes the severed whip from his wrist and leaps 
  over the railing. Guards attack. Spartacus trades blows as 
  Batiatus SEALS THE DOORS to the villa.


  INT. TRICLINIUM/VILLA - BATIATUS' VILLA - SUNSET

  The Guests rush through the villa. Aemilia wanders in shock, 
  splattered in her husband's blood. Batiatus shoves past her 
  with Lucretia, Ilithyia, Domitia, Numerius and Aurelia.

                                        LUCRETIA

                        Gather your men!

  The glint of opportunity flashes in Ilithyia's eyes.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I shall see you properly attended.

  EXT. BALCONY/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - SUNSET

  Spartacus battles the Guards on the balcony. Down below, the 
  Gladiators use their chains as weapons to block swords and 
  clubs. BODIES fly and BLOOD splatters.

  CRIXUS

  struggles against the effects of the drug as he severs limbs 
  with his sword.

  IOVIS

  AGRON

  splits open a Guard with his sword. He grabs the man's keys,

                        Duro!

  He tosses the keys to Duro, who follows suit.

  ANGLE ON CRIXUS

  as he hacks a Guard open. He spots Ashur as he comes to from 
  his fall. Crixus flares with hatred.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Crixus!

  Crixus whirls to find Doctore coming at him from across the 
  square. Ashur seizes the moment, escaping into the ludus. A 
  GLADIATOR tries to intercept Doctore. Doctore tosses him, 
  gaining the man's sword without breaking stride.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)

                      My mind is clear. Spartacus shows 
                      us the way.

                        No. They have taken it from you. 
                        From all of us. They fill us with

                        fucking house.

  Doctore wavers, tears welling in his eyes. He screams, his 
  world shattering as he rears back and HURLS HIS SWORD. TIME 
  SLOWS as it rotates towards Crixus -- and narrowly misses 
  him, instead

  SLAMMING INTO IOVIS

  Crixus nods in gratitude. He turns and heads for the pantry

  the horizon behind him. His eyes climb to

  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Mira enters from the hall leading to the pantry. She watches 
  the panicked Guests swarm into the Atrium, her heart in her 
  throat. Batiatus attempts to calm them.

  SCREAMS cut him off as Crixus and his men surge past Mira 
  into the villa. BLOOD SPLATTERS as they attack. Some with 
  swords, some with the chains still binding them. Guests 
  scramble to escape this new horror. Mira looks on, unable to 
  process the depth of the violence.

  A frozen moment as Crixus locks eyes with Lucretia across 
  the room. Her heart seizes in her chest at the hatred 
  filling his eyes. A Guard attacks him, breaking the moment.

                        Come! Let us away!

  Batiatus hustles Numerius, Domitia, and Lucretia away. 
  Aurelia follows, terrified.

  Screams echo. Ilithyia strides with Vesper, joining Glaber's 
  Men stationed at the double doors of the main entrance.

                        the fucking doors!

  Vesper swallows his doubt, nods to his men. Ilithyia sweeps 
  through the doors just as Aemilia and a wave of panicked, 
  bloodied ROMANS wash into the entryway.

                                          AEMILIA

  Vesper and the Men follow Ilithyia. RAMP TO SLOW MOTION as 
  Ilithyia looks back, a cool SMILE OF VENGEANCE bending her 
  lips. The doors close. Aemilia and the Romans slam into 
  them, screaming and pounding to be let out.

  RHASKOS AND THREE GLADIATORS,

  all drenched in blood, rush the trapped Romans from behind 
  with their swords raised.


  EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

                                        ASHUR
                                (forcing an 
                                  innocent laugh)
                        Doctore --

                                          DOCTORE
                      Do not fucking speak. I have seen 
                        you ply tongue upon ear, whispering 
                        poison. Infecting the honor of this 
                        house.

                                        ASHUR
                        You would kill a defenseless man? 
                        Where is the fucking honor in that?

  Doctore considers that, tosses one of his swords to Ashur.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Let us see if you remember what I 
                        taught you. When you were yet a 
                        man.

  OFF ASHUR, his balls in his throat...

  INT. TROPHY ROOM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Batiatus hustles through the carnage with Lucretia, Domitia, 
  Numerius, and Aurelia. A DYING GUARD half collapses into 
  Batiatus' arms as they round the corner.

                                        GUARD

                                  coming apart)(
                        Why would she do such a thing --

  Domitia screams as a Gladiator rushes from the gloom. She 
  throws up an arm to protect herself and GETS IT HACKED OFF.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Mother!

  The Gladiator finishes her off. Batiatus grabs the dead 
  Guard's sword and runs the Gladiator through the side. 
  Rhaskos appears at the entrance, battling a Guard. Batiatus 
  rips his sword from the Gladiator, intent on fighting to 
  save his house.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Go!

                        GO!

  Lucretia half drags Numerius away, the boy's eyes fixed on 
  his dead mother. Aurelia follows as they move through

  THE VILLA,

  weaving through bodies and avoiding Gladiators. They pause, 
  holding breath as they spot Spartacus slaughtering a Guard. 
  He snarls as the man falls, stalking away in search of his 
  prey. Numerius watches the blood-drenched champion with 
  horror.

                                        NUMERIUS
                      We are all of us dead.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        No. We will regain this House.

                        Take Numerius and conceal yourself.

  Aurelia hesitates, something dark passing just beneath her 
  eyes before she takes Numerius' hand.

                                          AURELIA
                        Come. I know a place.

  Lucretia sweeps out, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  The remaining Guards battle Agron, Duro, HAMILCAR and a 
  clutch of other bloodied Gladiators. Hamilcar is fatally 
  wounded.

                                        DURO
                        Hamilcar!

  Duro flares, hacking and slashing. Agron cuts down a Guard, 
  but another blind-sides him. Agron smashes to the ground, 
  dazed. The Guard raises his sword for the death blow.

                                          DURO(cont'd)
                        No!

  Duro rushes in. The Guard whirls around. They trade quick 
  blows -- and DURO GETS RUN THROUGH THE STOMACH.

                                        AGRON
                        Duro!

  Agron surges to his feet and decapitates the Guard. Duro 
  crumbles. Agron cradles him. Duro locks eyes with him, 
  smiling through the agony.

                                        DURO
                        I save you this time, brother...

  The light fades from his eyes. A frozen beat, shattered by 
  Agron's scream as he rips the sword from Duro's body. He 
  attacks the remaining Guards in a frenzy of blood. OFF 
  AGRON's crimson rage...


  INT. BATHS - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Ashur crashes to the floor, his robes slashed and bleeding. 
  Doctore looms over him.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                                        ASHUR
                        You think this will cause 
                        difference? Even if life fades, my 
                        hand shall yet be felt. It plotted 
                        the death of Barca. Saw the 
                        Magistrate's end. Even helped force 
                        Glaber to patronage. Every beam, 
                        every stone of this fucking house 
                        bears the mark of Ashur!

                                          DOCTORE
                      It bears only your treachery.

                                        ASHUR
                      My treachery?

  Ashur rises, tears welling in his eyes.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                      My fucking treachery?! When did you 
                        stand forth for Ashur? When did any 
                      of you greet me short of mockery 
                        and scorn, you fucking cunts!

  Ashur attacks. Doctore counters.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You received... what was deserved!

  Doctore slashes Ashur. The sword tumbles from his hand. He 
  sags, knowing his end has come. He laughs sadly, his eyes 
  filled with regret.

                                        ASHUR
                        Would that this were the arena.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Your blood would dishonor the 
                        sands.

                                        ASHUR
                        Send me on my way, then.

  Ashur drops to his knees, tears in his eyes.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                      As you would a Gladiator. Please, 
                        Doctore. A parting kindness...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.
  CONTINUED:

  Doctore hesitates, then turns his sword to rear back to 
  plunge it into Ashur's breast. Ashur uses the moment to grab 
  a fallen OIL SCRAPER and STAB IT INTO DOCTORE'S LEG. Doctore 
  grunts in pain, his sword

  SLICING ASHUR DEEP ACROSS THE FACE

  as the villain scurries back and flees for his life. Doctore 
  grits his teeth, pulling the scraper from his leg in a gout 
  of blood. MURDER flashes in his eyes.


  INT. CORRIDORS - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Doctore stalks through the corridors, passing the bodies of 
  GUARDS and GLADIATORS.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Ashur!

  As he moves off, REVEAL ASHUR hiding beneath a pile of blood 
  soaked bodies. He watches Doctore go, his face twisting with 
  hatred. OFF the cowardly escape...

  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON A DEAD ROMAN WOMAN'S FACE, dress ripped open and 
  throat slit, half sprawled across the bed. WIDEN as Lucretia 
  enters. More BODIES litter the floor. Blood stains the 
  walls. Lucretia whispers into the gloom.

                                        LUCRETIA

                        You were right.

  Lucretia freezes as Crixus emerges from the shadows behind 
  her. Drenched in blood. Weak from poison. Sword in hand.

                                        CRIXUS
                        There is yet something between us.

                        villa... and I will tell you.

  Crixus searches her eyes, knowing her all too well.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  soft)(

  Crixus rams his sword into her stomach (below frame). She 
  stiffens in shock, blood trickling from her mouth.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I would rather it dead, than suckle 
                      at your breast.

  He rips the blade out and turns to go. OFF LUCRETIA as she 
  raises a trembling, blood-soaked hand to her eyes in 
  horror...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Aurelia enters with Numerius. He rushes past DEAD ROMANS, 
  his eyes desperately searching for a place to hide, tears 
  hot upon his young cheeks.

                                        NUMERIUS
                      We must conceal ourselves...

  He turns, frightened and confused.

                        That small, little voice. Did it 
                        form the words that robbed Varro of 
                        his life?

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Varro?! He deserved to die! He was 
                        nothing!

  Aurelia takes Numerius in, dissecting his contempt, knowing 
  now that Spartacus told her the truth.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                        sleeping in his arms? Or kiss the 
                        tears from my cheek, when I was of 
                        a mood? Did you know the father? 
                        The husband?

  She picks up the KNIFE Batiatus was using to eat his apple 
  in scene 13, tears cresting her cheeks. Numerius stiffens, 
  realizing who Aurelia is.

                                          AURELIA(cont'd)
                      He was not a perfect man. But he 
                        was mine.

  Numerius suddenly bolts for the door. She lunges and STABS 
  HIM IN THE NECK. He gurgles in shock, grabbing at the wound 
  as BLOOD sprays. Aurelia falls on him, repeatedly stabbing, 
  her tears mixing with the blood splattering her face.

                                          AURELIA(cont'd)

  She looks up to find Spartacus has entered. A specter of 
  death and blood.

                      It is done.

  She sees Numerius' body as if for the first time. She sobs, 
  lost and damaged. Spartacus holds his hand out to her.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Come.

  She hesitates, takes it. As she rises she suddenly stiffens 
  in terror, spotting something behind Spartacus. Spartacus 
  whirls just as a bloodied Guard attacks. Spartacus' arm is 
  sliced open, his weapon tumbling from his hand. The Guard 
  rears back for the death blow but

  A SWORD SHOOTS THROUGH HIS NECK,

  spraying Spartacus with blood. The Guard collapses, 
  revealing Doctore behind him. Spartacus nods his thanks, 
  retrieving his sword.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  He heads out. Doctore takes in Numerius and the dead Romans, 
  his soul churning.

                                          DOCTORE
                      Is this not enough? How many more 
                        must die?

                        I would see but one.

  OFF SPARTACUS, revenge flashing in his eyes...

  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  TRACK THROUGH the aftermath of the massacre. Romans and 
  Guards lay dead and dismembered. Mira comforts FRIGHTENED 
  HOUSE SLAVES, splattered with blood. Gladiators slit the 
  throats of those clinging to life.

  CRIXUS

  half collapses into a chair, still fighting the drug in his 
  system. He drinks from a cup of wine, his eyes finding

  AGRON

  entering from the ludus, bloodied and spent.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your brother?

  Agron shakes his head, unable to speak through his grief. A 
  solemn beat. Crixus hands him his cup of wine. A gesture of 
  respect. Agron drinks. A commotion pulls their attention to

  BATIATUS

  as he crashes in across the room, using his sword to fend 
  off Rhaskos and a few other Gladiators taunting him.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

                                        BATIATUS
                        I am your dominus! I will see your 
                        fucking hearts for this!

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        Quintus...

  Batiatus freezes. Lucretia drifts through the carnage, pale 
  and near death, her hand to her blood drenched stomach. 
  Crixus watches without passion as she collapses to the 
  floor.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Lucretia!

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        What would you do?

  Mira's heart catches as Spartacus appears, moving between 
  Batiatus and Lucretia. Rhaskos and the others respectfully 
  back away.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      To hold your wife again? To feel 
                        the warmth of her skin? The taste 
                      of her lips? How many men would you 
                        kill? A hundred? A thousand?
                                  a beat)(
                        There stands but one, between you 
                        and her.

  Batiatus screams, attacking. Spartacus counters.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                      Go to her. Tell her the gods 
                        themselves will not keep you apart. 
                        Lie. As you lied to me of my wife.

  The shock of what this is about slams into Batiatus. He 
  marshals his courage and attacks. Spartacus systematically 
  slices him to pieces, careful to avoid the killing blow. 
  Wishing to extend the moment.

  LUCRETIA

  watches from the floor as her husband cries out in pain, his 
  wounds weeping blood. Batiatus trembles, tears spilling 
  across his cheeks as he scans his men for mercy. His eyes 
  fall on Doctore, entering with a shell-shocked Aurelia.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Oenomaus...


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  A frozen beat. Doctore turns his eyes, unable to help -- or 
  bear witness to his end. Batiatus' fear turns to rage as he 
  screams at Spartacus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You were nothing before me! I gave 
                        you the fucking heavens! I gave you 
                        means to accept your fate!

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And now you are destroyed by it.

  Batiatus snarls as he attacks. Spartacus counters, spinning 
  around and

  HACKING OPEN BATIATUS' THROAT

  in a spray of blood. The sword falls from Batiatus' hand. He 
  turns, takes a few steps towards Lucretia before collapsing 
  to his knees. He locks eyes with her, face filled with 
  longing and regret. The life drains from his face as he 
  collapses at the foot of his statue, dead. Tears fall from 
  Lucretia's eyes, before they too are stilled.

  HIGH SHOT

  as Batiatus' blood spreads across the floor to merge with 
  Lucretia's. Husband and wife, forever bound in death.

  SPARTACUS

  turns from his revenge to survey the Gladiators and House 
  Slaves. The wounded and the frightened. His people.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        I have done this thing... because 
                      it was just. Because blood demands 
                        blood. We have lived...
                                to Crixus)(

                        have it so.
                                to Aurelia)(
                        I would not see the passing of a 
                        brother for reasons of sport. I 
                        would not bear another heart ripped 
                        from chest, nor breath forfeit 
                        without cause.
                                to Doctore)(
                        I know not all of you wished this. 
                        Yet it is done. It is done. Your

                        together we shall see Rome tremble!

  The Gladiators ERUPT in response, as do most of the Slaves. 
  Agron practically froths at the mouth. Doctore takes this 
  in, uncertain. Crixus rises, gaining strength as he adds his 
  own voice to the roar of freedom. PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS, his 
  eyes burning with violent determination...


  EXT. MAIN GATES - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  RAMP TO SLOW MOTION as the gates are smashed open. Spartacus 
  is first out, with Crixus, Doctore, and Agron close behind. 
  The Gladiators, Mira, Aurelia, and the other Slaves swarming 
  behind them.

  SPARTACUS

  charges the CAMERA. Sword raised. A battle cry twisting his 
  lips. As his vengeance fills the FRAME --

                                                                            BLACKOUT.
