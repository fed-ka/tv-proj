Two LONGSHOREMEN are talking while they unload a freighter.
LONGSHOREMEN
I'll tell ya. They don't look very
fuckin' good.
Down on the field, two KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS speak Korean as
they resod the outfield.
GROUNDSKEEPER
(in subtitles)
They're shitty.
We TILT UP from the field to a glass-enclosed area on the
third deck.
On a stretch of deserted Mexican highway. OVER we hear a
telephone RING.
This one's a dandy. The left field wall is a 20-foot high,
solid granite outcropping. A final out is made and the teams
change over.
TAYLOR
returning to the dugout at the end of the inning, wondering
what the hell he's doin' here.
MANAGER
Taylor, telephone for you.
Taylor goes to the phone in the clubhouse tunnel.
TAYLOR
Hello.
DONOVAN
Jake, Charlie Donovan again.
TAYLOR
Oh yeh, Charlie, look, I'm sorry
about this morning...
DONOVAN
No problem. Look, Jake, camp starts
on the first. Can you make it?
TAYLOR
Sure.
DONOVAN
You been stayin' in shape down there?
TAYLOR
Oh hell, yeh, I work out every day.
DONOVAN
I thought so. See ya in Arizona.
Donovan hangs up. Taylor shoots a fist in the air, and we...
CUT TO:
TAYLOR
approaching his MANAGER.
MANAGER
Let's go, Taylor. You're up.
TAYLOR
Luis, I'm not gonna be playin'
anymore. I got a tryout in the States.
MANAGER
Fine. Leave your uniform.
TAYLOR
But I changed at the motel.
MANAGER
Leave your uniform.
TAYLOR
coming out of the stadium, his bats and gloves over his
shoulder. He has on his spikes and a pair of boxer shorts.
Donovan, Brown and two of his coaches, PEPPER LEACH (pitching)
and DUKE TEMPLE (hitting) are on the field, witnessing the
arrival of their "troops." First to arrive is:
TAYLOR
He gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats
and luggage.
DONOVAN
This looks like Jake Taylor.
Brown turns around from a conversation with Temple.
BROWN
He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't
he?
DONOVAN
Yeh.
PEPPER
Wish we had him two years ago.
DONOVAN
We did.
PEPPER
Four years ago then.
Hayes' cot is sitting in the lot, just outside the fence,
his suitcase set down next to it. Hayes is still asleep, dew
on his forehead. Wakened by the noise of activity on the
field, he sits up with a start.
HAYES
Shit, I been cut already?
THE PRACTICE FIELD
We pick up Taylor sprinting his ass off in a 100-yard time
trial, staggering across the finish line 10 feet behind
Cerrano.
PEPPER
(checking stopwatch)
11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen
down.
As Taylor tries to catch his breath, Dorn and a relief pitcher
named Gant approach the starting line for the next trial.
HAYES
looking through the chain-link fence surrounding the field.
DORN AND GENTRY AGAIN
Temple brings them to their marks and blows his whistle.
Dorn and Gentry take off.
Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking
toward the starting line in hot pursuit. Dorn and Gentry a
good 10-yard lead, but Hayes is coming like a bullet. We go
to SLOW MOTION as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and
blasts on by to win by five. This kid is fast. Brown and
Pepper give each other the "Who was that Masked Man" look.
BROWN
Get him a uniform.
The players are spread out on the field doing calisthenics,
counting off in unison.
TAYLOR
struggling through a series of pushups. He glances over in
disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano, who are doing them like
pistons in competition with each other. Cerrano even starts
doing them one-handed.
Hayes isn't doing them at all; merely pulling his head up
and down while leaving his body on the ground.
HARRIS
C'mon, Hayes, let's do 'em right.
HAYES
Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no
pain.
Taylor is crouched behind the plate, warming up his arm.
Catching pitches and throwing them half-speed down to second.
Brown drifts over.
BROWN
How the knees holdin' up, Jake?
TAYLOR
Great. Never been better.
BROWN
Mobility's good? No problem gettin'
off the throw to second?
TAYLOR
No problem.
BROWN
I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who
can keep this team together on the
field. You were a helluva player
when you were sound, but around the
league they think you can't take the
pounding anymore.
TAYLOR
Around the league they're wrong.
BROWN
I'm gonna have to put you to the
test, ya know. So, I want the absolute
truth here. Are you 100 percent?
TAYLOR
Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin'
like that?
BROWN
(walking away)
You better if you wanna make this
team.
Taylor smiles and fires one full-speed down to second. It
bounces two feet in front of the bag.
Brown is watching batting practice.
Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual
worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching,
knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc. A real
slugger's routine.
BROWN
C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All
Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.
Hayes gets in and takes his stance. On the first pitch, he
takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher's mound.
We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches. Hayes takes
prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop-
ups, none out of the infield. Brown calls a halt.
BROWN
Well, you may run like Mays, but you
hit like shit.
HAYES
My stroke'll come back once I get
warmed up.
TEMPLE
(referring to some
stats)
Never did get warmed up last year.
Hit .211 at Maine. I looked him up.
BROWN
I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise.
His speed could be a big asset.
PEPPER
(aside)
For what? Running back to the dugout?
BROWN
You gotta stop swingin' for the fences
though, Hayes. All you're gonna do
is give yourself a hernia. With your
speed you should be hittin' the ball
on the ground, leggin' 'em out. Every
time I see you hit one in the air,
you owe me twenty pushups.
HAYES
Hey, no problem.
The next pitch comes in. Hayes swings and pops it up.
HAYES
Shit.
As he gets down to do his twenty, Brown turns to Temple.
BROWN
Sometimes you can teach a guy to
hit. You can't teach him to run.
BROWN AND PEPPER
coming over to where Vaughn is tossing some casual warm-up
pitches to Jake.
BROWN
All right, Vaughn, they tell us you're
a pitcher. Let's see what you got.
Brown and Pepper stand behind Taylor for a better view. Vaughn
goes into his wind-up and fires a screaming fast ball that
Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch. The
ball rockets an inch over Brown's head, and slams into the
backstop.
Brown stands frozen a second, contemplating his brush with
eternity, then turns to Pepper.
BROWN
Nice velocity.
PEPPER
Sounded like it.
TAYLOR
Sorry, Lou, I wasn't quite expectin'
that much octane.
Brown turns to the Clubhouse Man who's holding a speed gun.
BROWN
How much?
CLUBHOUSE MAN
96 miles an hour.
BROWN
(to Pepper)
Better teach him some control before
he kills somebody.
RODGER DORN
fielding grounders at third base. He plays them off to his
left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them.
BROWN
C'mon, Dorn, get in front of the
damn ball.
(making like a
bullfighter)
Don't give me this ole' bullshit.
DORN
I took one of these in the eye last
year. Nearly lost my sight.
BROWN
I'm deeply moved. Every time you
play it off your hip, you give me
forty sit-ups.
DORN
What! That's Little League shit.
BROWN
So is this.
Brown strikes an effeminate fielding position, like Betty
Grable shying from a mouse. Dorn burns.
PEDRO CERRANO
in the batting cage, knocking the cover off pitch after pitch
with his black bat.
BROWN
Jesus, this guy hits a ton. How come
nobody else picked up on him?
TEMPLE
(to the batting
practice pitcher)
Okay, Harris, that's enough fast
balls. Throw some curves.
Harris winds and throws a fair-to-middlin' curve ball. Cerrano
swings and misses it a foot.
BROWN
Oh.
Dorn approaches Brown at the cage.
DORN
Lou, I wanna have a word with you
here.
BROWN
Sure.
DORN
(whipping out his
contract)
Those penalty sit-ups you want me to
do? I got it right here in my contract
that I don't have to do any
calisthenics I don't feel are
necessary. What do ya think of that?
Everyone around the batting cage has stopped what they're
doing to see how Brown will react. Brown looks at the contract
a second, then drops it on the ground, unzips his fly, and
gives it a golden shower. On Dorn's stunned face, we...
CUT TO:
DORN
doing sit-ups in the infield. Vaughn walks by and smiles.
LONGSHOT - PRACTICE FIELD
Practically every member of the team is doing penalty
calisthenics somewhere on the field.
PEPPER
(to Temple)
We got anybody left playin' baseball
out there?
Players are filing off the team bus after the game. We PICK
UP Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn as they head toward the locker
room.
VAUGHN
This is final cut down day, right?
TAYLOR
Yeh, better get your snake ready,
Hayes.
HAYES
No, I'm goin' cold turkey today. My
hands are too screwed up to hold it
anyway.
Hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands.
TAYLOR
If you're gonna use that head first
slide, you better get yourself some
gloves or you're not gonna have any
skin left on your hands.
They've reached the locker room now.
VAUGHN
I don't wanna go in there.
TAYLOR
Whatever happens, keep it to yourself
until you're outta the locker room.
Don't celebrate in front of guys who
just died.
HAYES
What if we're one of the deceased?
Taylor goes into the locker room. Hayes and Vaughn hang back.
Cerrano is already at his locker. He's got two snakes this
time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. He sprays a patch
of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a
symbol door. No tag. He kisses the snake, leaving some white
paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk.
Taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers
inside. He's made it, too. Cerrano offers a hand. Taylor
shakes it and breaks a weary smile.
GENTRY
opens locker, slumps on stool. He's a goner.
HAYES AND VAUGHN
the two rookies, are still hanging back.
HAYES
C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts
here. If they cut us, we'll just
sign with the Yankees.
Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. This
doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes
closed. He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one
eye.
Seeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the
locker room, as if he had to get to the john.
He comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around
like a wild man.
VAUGHN
drawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker
and whips it open. There hanging from the top hook is the
"red death." Vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly
closes his locker.
CUT TO:
Such as it is. We MOVE DOWN to the same diner we saw during
the opening of the film.
The two Longshoremen again, looking at a paper.
LONGSHOREMAN
Who are these fuckin' guys?
The two Korean Groundskeepers again, dragging the infield.
GROUNDSKEEPER
(in subtitles)
They're shitty.
The stands are nearly empty. Of the fans who have showed up,
many wear doormats around their necks.
Bobby, Vic, Johnny and Thelma, our four fans from the diner,
sit alone in the vast expanse of the centerfield bleachers.
All four wear Indian head dresses and have war paint on their
faces. The three men each have tom-toms. Thelma works on her
needlepoint.
JOHNNY
You read the Plain Dealer today?
They said this is gonna be the worst
Indian team we've had in years.
THELMA
Everybody laughs at the Indians now,
but there were other times. Even won
the Series in '48. Then Willie Mays
made that catch on Vic Wertz in the
'54 Series and Cleveland's never
been the same since.
JOHNNY
As the Indians go so goes Cleveland,
huh?
THELMA
If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland
would die.
We see Taylor walking up the steps and through the massive
front door.
Taylor sits in his car, across the street from the employee
entrance of the library. He scrunches down a bit as Lynn
comes out of the building and heads for her car. She gets in
and we...
CUT TO:
SERIES OF SHOTS OF LYNN
driving through the city with Taylor following at a discrete
distance. Finally, Lynn pulls up outside an expensive-looking
townhouse. Taylor pulls up further down the street and watches
her go inside, debating whether to go in after her.
Taylor pulls up outside and walks up to the door. Suzanne,
Dorn's wife, answers.
SUZANNE
Oh hi, Jake, how are you?
TAYLOR
Fine, Suzanne, can I have a quick
word with Rodger?
SUZANNE
Sure, c'mon in, he's in the den.
I'll get some coffee.
We FOLLOW Taylor into the luxurious den, where we find Dorn
watching his wide screen TV in a smoking jacket.
DORN
Hey, Jake, old boy, what brings you
out here?
TAYLOR
I just wanta tell ya somethin', but
I didn't want to do it in front of
the whole team.
DORN
Sure, go ahead.
TAYLOR
(like nails)
I don't know what your problem is,
but...
(bending close to
Dorn)
...if I ever see you tank another
play like you did tonight, I'll cut
off your nuts and stuff 'em down
your fuckin' throat.
Dorn looks at Taylor for some sign that he's kidding. He
doesn't get one.
Taylor turns and walks on out, as we go to Dorn's stunned
face. Suzanne walks in with a tray.
SUZANNE
Coffee anybody?
The two Longshoremen again.
LONGSHOREMAN
Ya know, these guys aren't so fuckin'
bad.
The two Groundskeepers are repairing the pitcher's mound.
GROUNDSKEEPER
(in subtitles)
They're still shitty.

Brown storms out of the dugout, doing his best to look
incensed.
TAYLOR
Ah shit, here comes Lou. Gimme a
break, Mel. I gotta get outta here.
WINGO
All right, kick some dirt on me. The
Commissioner'll buy that.
TAYLOR
Right. Good idea.
Taylor begins kicking dirt on Wingo's shoes, ala Billy Martin.
Wingo takes a dramatic hop, skip and jump and gives Taylor
the heave-ho thumb just as Brown arrives. Wingo turns away.
BROWN
(to Wingo)
Hey, don't you go anywhere. I wanna
have a few words with you.
Brown grabs Taylor and pulls him aside.
BROWN
(under his breath)
What are we arguin' about here?
TAYLOR
(struggling as if he
wanted to get at
Wingo)
Fucker called that a ball.
BROWN
You mean the one that was a foot
outside?
TAYLOR
Yeh.
Taylor breaks away and starts back to the dugout. Playing it
to the hilt, he throws his glove and mask to the ground on
the way.
Meanwhile, Brown is going jaw to jaw with Wingo, outraged at
the call. Brown pulls a carrot out of his back pocket, and
offers it to Wingo, who immediately thumbs him out.
LYNN
leaving her seat and starting up the aisle.
Taylor comes up the stairs from the locker room, still in
full uniform. He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn
disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot.
LYNN
in the parking lot. As she goes to unlock her car, Taylor
looks around hurriedly for some kind of vehicle to follow
her in.
He bangs on the bullpen gates and is admitted by the guard.
Inside is the Bullpen car, a souped-up golf cart with a body
shaped like a batting helmet. Taylor hops in and roars out
after Lynn.
Lynn comes up the stairs, unlocks the apartment door and
steps inside. There's no particular urgency. She feels sure
she's shaken Taylor.
The apartment is full of packing boxes. Tired from the chase,
Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch.
It's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost Taylor.
She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some
sign of him.
Seeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed,
and starts back to the couch, when something stops her. It's
Taylor, standing in the doorway.
TAYLOR
Whose place are we at this time?
LYNN
(flustered)
Mine. You follow me again?
TAYLOR
Yeh. When I saw you at the game, I
figured you wanted to see me about
something.
LYNN
I just wanted to see you play.
TAYLOR
How was I?
LYNN
You looked good, but you oughta open
your stance a little. They're pitchin'
you inside.
TAYLOR
I'll try that.
Taylor gives a perfunctory nod. They look at each other a
second. There's still plenty there. Taylor begins to come
toward her. We hear his cleats on the floor. She backs off,
but not with real conviction.
LYNN
I think I oughta tell you that I'm
moving in with Tom.
TAYLOR
Goin' uptown, huh?
LYNN
I'm not goin' uptown, I just want to
lead a regular life. You know, like
an adult maybe. With a house and a
garden and normal hours.
TAYLOR
You think I can't lead a regular
life?
LYNN
You like the life you've had, Jake.
You like hangin' out with the boys,
livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at
midnight, having girls send you their
underwear in the mail. Remember the
surprise party I threw for you when
you made the All-Star team? You never
showed up, but the doorbell rang
once and we all got quiet and hid
behind the furniture. It was a guy
to serve you with a paternity suit.
TAYLOR
That was a hoax. The girl was just
trying to get some publicity.
LYNN
Yes, but you had obviously been with
her. And it happened in front of all
our friends.
TAYLOR
I was drownin', Lynn. The endorsements
were dryin' up, my knees were goin',
they were talkin' about sendin' me
down. I was just trying to hold on
to somethin', prove to myself I was
still an All-Star. I don't care about
that anymore. I know I don't have
much time left in baseball. I'm just
a guy trying to put his life back
together. Thinkin' about you was the
only thing that kept me goin' in
Mexico.
Lynn looks at him a long beat.
LYNN
I've come back to you too many times,
Jake. I can't afford to believe you
anymore.
Lynn is backed up against a desk now. She could move out but
doesn't.
TAYLOR
I guess this is our last hurrah then.
LYNN
I guess so. Did you really read "Moby
Dick?"
TAYLOR
Cover to cover.
Taylor comes forward to kiss her, tentatively at first. Their
conversation is interwoven with the slowly deepening intensity
of their kissing.
TAYLOR
When's the wedding?
LYNN
October third.
TAYLOR
Your mom and dad like this guy?
LYNN
You're still their favorite.
They're unbuttoning each other's shirts now.
TAYLOR
Gonna be a big wedding?
LYNN
Tom doesn't like big weddings. You
coulda read Plot Outlines of 101
Great Novels.
TAYLOR
Where?
LYNN
At any library.
TAYLOR
I mean the wedding.
LYNN
All Saints on Euclid.
TAYLOR
Nice church.
LYNN
Yeh. Who saved Ishmael at the end?
TAYLOR
Nobody. It was Queequeg's coffin. Am
I invited?
LYNN
Where?
TAYLOR
To the wedding.
LYNN
If you want. Maybe you really did
read it.
Their shirts are off now.
LYNN
This doesn't change anything, you
know. We were always good at this.
TAYLOR
Lynn?
LYNN
What?
TAYLOR
The zipper on your skirt is stuck.
LYNN
Use your imagination.
Taylor's spikes come down across her skirt, catching in the
material, ripping it from her body and pinning it to the
wood floor. Taylor steps out of the shoe and whisks Lynn OUT
OF FRAME. We hold on the skirt, nailed to the floor by the
cleats.
Taylor comes down the steps, gets in his car, and drives OUT
OF FRAME. We HOLD on the SHOT, and...
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SAME SHOT - THAT NIGHT
Taylor's car pulls INTO FRAME. He gets out and goes up the
steps. There's one light on in the apartment window. Taylor
comes up to the door and knocks. Getting no answer, he pushes
it open to find that the apartment is completely empty. Just
bare hardwood floor. Taylor stands forlorn in the center of
the room a beat, then walks on out, switching off the overhead
light as he goes.
We pick up a decrepit old Greyhound bus coming down the
highway, belching smoke like a diesel semi. On the side we
see the visage of Chief Wahoo and the words "Indian Express."
The Indian Express makes its way through the streets of New
York, enroute to the Indian's hotel.
Vaughn is on the mound warming up.
DOYLE (V.O.)
So, Ricky Vaughn, roughed up in his
only other appearance against the
Yankees, will see what he can do
with the Bronx Bombers this time.
Vaughn, after a slow start, has come
on lately and now leads the American
League in strikeouts with 221.
Vaughn finishes his warmups. As Taylor pumps the ball down
to second, Vaughn hears a voice from the Yankee dug-out.
VOICE
Hey, jailbird!
Vaughn glances over and sees that one of the Yankees is
dressed in a striped prison uniform. He also wears long
earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses. Vaughn tries
to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken.
Vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch. He winds
and fires. The Yankee LEADOFF HITTER rips a one-hopper to
the wall in right center. Hayes runs it down and guns it
back to the infield to hold the guy to a double. The convict
whoops it up.
Vaughn gets back up on the rubber. As he comes to the stretch,
he catches sight of the convict again. The guy is doing a
pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much
to the delight of his teammates. Vaughn throws his pitch in
the dirt and all the way to the backstop. The runner on second
goes to third.
TAYLOR
(throwing the ball
back)
C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.
Vaughn gets ready again. The convict finishes picking the
lock and then is suddenly arrested. He puts his hands against
the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking
up the whole bench. Vaughn is getting a little steamed. His
next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a
run.
THREE SHOTS OF VAUGHN
throwing pitches, followed by:
SHOTS
of the THIRD HITTER lining a double down the right field
line, the FOURTH HITTER a triple off the center field wall,
and the FIFTH HITTER a single to right. The scoreboard now
reads 4 to 0 Yankees. Taylor comes out to talk to Vaughn.
TAYLOR
What's the problem, Rick? You're
throwin' basketballs up there. That
guy in the dugout botherin' you?
VAUGHN
Naw, I'm all right.
TAYLOR
Forget him. Worry about the guys
carryin' bats. C'mon, Ricky, let's
get nasty.
Vaughn nods as Taylor trots back behind the plate.
Vaughn gets set again as his old nemesis, Haywood, steps
into the batter's box. Haywood has a sly smile on his face.
As Vaughn comes to his stretch, the convict goes back into
his act. He's in jail now, struggling against the bars.
Finally he bends over and grabs his ankles, while one of his
teammates humps up against him, pretending to bugger him.
This sends the Yankee bench into hysterics.
Vaughn has lost it now. He fires to the plate and Haywood
creams another tape measure job into the upper deck. Hayes
doesn't even bother to run back to the wall. He just watches
it go. 6-0 Yankees.
BROWN
I thought now that Vaughn had some
control, he was ready for the Yankees.
PEPPER
Not quite yet.
Brown makes his way to the mound to take Vaughn out.
DOYLE (V.O.)
So, Vaughn pitches in some tough
luck here as the Yankees put together
as few squib hits and take a 6-0
lead.
DOYLE
in the press box. The stadium below is empty, the grounds
crew covering the infield.
DOYLE
Well, the Indians made a gallant
comeback today, but fell one run
short as the Yankees held on for a 6-
5 victory, although they didn't do
squat after the first inning. Anyway,
if the bus makes it here from the
hotel we'll be on at 7:30 tomorrow
night. Till then, this is Harry Doyle,
saying so long, everybody, and Happy
Hunting.
Ross Farmer, microphone in hand, stands in front of a blazing
bonfire. A large crowd cheers as various people throw doormats
on the blaze.
FARMER
(to TV camera)
You remember bra burning in the '70's,
well, the newest thing in Cleveland
is doormat burning as Indian fans
are standing up and saying "We won't
be stepped on anymore".
THREE QUICK SHOTS OF VAUGHN
blowing fast balls by hitter.
RACHEL
with Donovan next to her, watching all this good play in
disgust.
AN ANGEL HITTER
lining a single to center. Cerrano charges it and fires to
the plate as a Runner tries to score from second. Just as
Taylor catches the ball, he's once again knocked flat by the
Runner. This time he lies still a beat, and then an arm comes
up holding the ball.
The Umpire thumbs the Runner out.
TAYLOR
late at night, sitting head-down in the outboard motor
whirlpool. He's hurting.
We PICK UP three Teenage Girls walking down the street wearing
T-shirts that say WILD THING--I THINK I LOVE YOU. A Black
Kid comes by wearing black gloves on each hand. As he passes,
he holds up one finger signifying Number One. The Girls return
the signal.
The Business Executive passes his secretary's desk, gives
her some instructions, and goes into his office. As soon as
he's out of sight, she opens her drawer and slips the earplug
from a portable radio into her ear. OVER, we hear the Indians'
BROADCAST.
THE EXECUTIVE
inside his office. He opens his desk drawer and pulls out an
earplug. He's also listening to the game.

The door opens and Darla comes out, fully clothed now. She
turns to say goodbye to Jake, who is still bare-chested.
DARLA
So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna
devote a whole chapter to you in my
book.
As Darla gives Jake a goodbye peck, the elevator door opens
across the hall, and out steps Lynn. She's obviously rattled
by the sight of Taylor and Darla together.
LYNN
Excuse me. I was in town for a
conference and thought I'd drop by,
but I can see you're busy...
With that she quickly steps back into the elevator and the
doors close.
TAYLOR
Lynn, wait...
Taylor leaps to the elevator door, but it's too late. He
then sprints to the end of the hall and down the stairs.
TAYLOR
running down the stairs and into the lobby. Seeing no sign
of Lynn, he races out the front door to see her pulling out
in a taxi. He can only stand and watch her disappear into
the night.
The Indian bus pulls up outside the Stadium, where a group
of several thousand fans wait. The players are showered with
cheers and applause as they file out.
The place is jammed. 75,000 screaming maniacs, most of them
decked out in war paint and head dresses. Some carry plastic
scalps with Yankee hats on them. Others have caps with the
European "No" insignia superimposed over a door mat.
DOYLE
In the press box.
COLORMAN
Here's your bourbon.
DOYLE
Won't need it tonight.
THE LOCKER ROOM
starkly quiet in contrast to the stadium outside. Each player
has retreated into his own world of concentration.
Dorn approaches Taylor, who's fitting heavy athletic braces
on both knees.
DORN
You know where Vaughn is?
TAYLOR
Nope. Haven't seen him.
DORN
Let me know if you do. I wanna have
a little talk with him.
Dorn moves off.
CERRANO
Where's my chicken?
TAYLOR
It's comin' in now.
We see a Bat Boy enter with a bucket of fried chicken. Cerrano
looks at it in bewilderment.
TAYLOR
One whole chicken, like you said.
CERRANO
But it no alive.
TAYLOR
Believe me, Jo-Buu will like this.
He's gotta be gettin' tired of raw
chicken.
As Cerrano hefts the bucket somewhat skeptically and takes
it to his altar, we...
CUT TO:
HARRIS
warming up in the bullpen. The tension of starting such an
important game shows in his face.
DOYLE
Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle bidding
you a Wahoo welcome from beautiful
Municipal Stadium, where tonight
before a capacity crowd of 75,000
screaming featherheads, the braves
of the Cuyahoga will leave their
teepees in search of Cleveland's
first League Championship in over 30
years. Standing in the way, their
long time nemesis, the New York
Yankees, the Big Boys of Broadway,
who have beaten the Indians like a
tom-tom all year long.
Down in the dugout, the players are lined up ready to take
the field. They exchange words of encouragement, hand slaps,
clenched fists, but all at a very low key level. This is
tension time.
BROWN
All right, guys, let's take it to
'em.
The Indians charge onto the field to a standing ovation.
In the center field bleachers Thelma's victory blanket
containing the scores of every Indian game for the season,
hangs from a railing. Bobby, Vic and Johnny pound the tom-
toms leading the stadium in a monster version of "In the
Land of Burning Waters." Even the groundskeepers join in.
Two down in the first. Harris looking sharp so far... Bouncing
ball to third. Dorn up with it.
HARRIS
Throwing the first pitch. The YANKEE HITTER grounds one to
Dorn who throws him out.
THE SCOREBOARD
0-0 in the 3rd.
CERRANO
striking out on a curve ball.
HAYES
robbing a Yankee of a home run by making a leaping catch
over the fence.
TAYLOR
picking a Yankee runner off first.
THE SCOREBOARD
0-0 in the 5th.
OMIT
Sequence omitted from original script.
CERRANO
striking out on a curve ball, trying to check his swing.
Umpire emphatically punches him out.
DOYLE
Looking past him to the field. Harris is on the mound. There's
a runner on second.
DOYLE
Still nothing -- nothing, top of the
seventh, two down. Harris has been
in trouble all night, but has battled
his way out with the help of some
great defensive plays.
Harris comes set and delivers. The Yankee hitter, BURTON,
(L) swings and gets all of it.
DOYLE (V.O.)
Uh oh, this one's tagged. Deep center
field. Way back. Way back.
Hayes climbs up on the wall, but it's long gone. Home run.
DOYLE (V.O.)
It's off the reservation, home run.
And the Yankees lead it 2-0.
RACHEL'S BOX (INSERT STORYBOARD # 209G)
RACHEL
Shit.
Donovan is a little confused by this.
Burton trots around the bases and is greeted by jubilant
teammates at the plate. A silent pall falls on the stadium.
As the "2" goes up on the scoreboard, we...
CUT TO:
HAYES
popping up and flinging his bat away in frustration. We take
CUTS of the worried fans, chewing fingernails, wadding up
programs, hanging their heads, etc.
TAYLOR
grounding out, obviously having trouble running. We take
CUTS of worried faces on the bench.
DORN
stepping into the batter's box. The crowd is practically
sitting on its hands now. Hope draining away.
DOYLE (V.O.)
Dorn up now, two down, bottom of the
seventh. The Indians running out of
chances.
Dorn swings at the first pitch and lines a sharp single to
left. The crowd and the Indian bench suddenly come alive.
Cerrano moves to the plate.
DOYLE (V.O.)
That'll bring on Cerrano, hitless
tonight. As a matter of fact, he
hasn't touched the ball yet.
The crowd and bleacher band begins to clap as Dorn takes his
lead. Cerrano swings at the first pitch and misses. An audible
groan goes through the crowd.
The Yankee pitcher gets set again, and throws Cerrano a big,
roundhouse curve. He misses it a foot. Strike two.
BROWN
Damn, havin' trouble with the curve
ball again.
HAYES
We should've gotten him a live
chicken.
Cerrano steps out and begins to talk to his bat, gesturing
and pointing as if arguing with his wife.
CERRANO
I pissed off now, Jo-Buu. I good to
you, I stand up for you. If you no
help me now, I say fuck you, Jo-Buu.
I do it myself.
Cerrano gets back in the box and digs in. The Yankee pitcher
comes to his stretch and delivers. Another big breaking curve
ball. Cerrano swings and knocks the crap out of it. Everyone
in the stands and on the bench jumps to their feet, rooting
for the ball to get out.
DOYLE (STORYBOARD #212EE)
DOYLE
Long drive, deep centerfield. Way
back. It might be. It could be. The
ball is... Downtown, welcome to the
Happy Hunting Ground. The game is
tied.
The fans go crazy as Cerrano circles the bases.
RACHEL'S BOX (STORYBOARD # 212GG)
Rachel jumps out of her seat, hands above her head. Donovan
hesitates a beat, then follows suit.
Cerrano carries his bat with him, holding it high above his
head. As Cerrano disappears into the dugout, we go to the
scoreboard as the 2 goes up.
DOYLE (STORYBOARD # 212NN)
DOYLE
Two down in the top of the ninth,
still tied at 2, Harris working on
an eight-hitter.
CUT TO:
YANKEE HITTER
lining a single to right field. Harris mops his brow,
obviously tiring.
ANOTHER YANKEE HITTER
smashing a double off the wall, the lead runner stopping at
third. Brown signals to the bullpen to get somebody warm.
HARRIS
on the mound, looking like he's out of gas.
DOYLE (V.O.)
Activity continues in the pen, as
Harris is really digging himself a
hole now. He got the first two
hitters, and then gave up a single
and a double and has now gone 3-0 to
Cheevers.
Harris comes set and fires to the plate. It's way high.
DOYLE (V.O.)
High, ball four and they're loaded
for Haywood, the biggest Indian killer
of them all.
Brown has seen enough. He makes his way to the mound.
BROWN
(taking the ball from
Harris)
You pitched a hell of a game, Steve.
Take a seat and we'll see if we can
get this guy for ya.
Brown signals to the bullpen with his left hand.
BROWN
Give me Vaughn.
TAYLOR
(surprised)
You want Vaughn?
BROWN
I know he hasn't done real well
against this guy, but I got a hunch
he's due.
VAUGHAN
striding in from the bullpen. He doesn't look relaxed. As he
nears the infield he purposely doesn't look at Dorn. Dorn
stares at him with undisguised venom.
As Vaughan gets to the mound, he sees Patton getting his
convict uniform on in the Yankee dugout. He looks away to
see Haywood in the on-deck circle smiling out at him.
Meanwhile, the CROWD has gone nuts at the sight of Vaughn.
Bobby, Vic and Johnny are blasting out "Wild Thing" on the
tom-toms and the whole stadium, 75,000 strong, is singing
it. Doyle just pushes the mic forward and lets the crowd do
it's work.
BROWN
Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard
stuff in. Curve him on the hands,
bust him away, and don't get up with
anything. You listenin' to me Rick?
Vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested
any of that.
BROWN
(Patting him on the
butt)
O.K., kid, you're my man. Let's go
get him.
TAYLOR
C'mon Ricky, this guy is the out you
been waitin' your whole life for.
Brown and Taylor leave Vaughn alone on the mound, the SINGING
of the crowd ringing in his ears.
DOYLE (INSERT STORYBOARD #216N)
DOYLE
O.K. Vaughn has finished his warmup
and we're ready to...
No sooner has Taylor settled in behind the plate, than Dorn
starts toward the mound. Vaughn watches him come with fear
and trepidation.
TAYLOR
(seeing it)
Oh, shit.
Dorn arrives at the mound, and holds out his hand for the
ball. Vaughn gives it to him. Dorn rubs it up, staring long
and hard into Vaughn's eyes. Vaughn is sweating bullets.
Finally Dorn speaks.
DORN
Let's cut through the crap. I only
got one thing to say to you. Just
rear back and strike this motherfucker
out.
He smiles and hands Vaughn the ball back. Vaughn returns the
smile and accepts the ball. While Dorn trots back to his
position, Vaughn turns his back to the plate for one last
moment of concentration. As he turns around to face us, we
see a new man as the wicked opening CHORDS of X's "Wild Thing"
are heard on the TRACK, only louder and more savage than
before.
Vaughn steps up on the rubber, his face hardened into fierce
resolve. There's nothing nervous about him now. This kid is
gonna make somebody pay.
DOYLE (V.O.)
Haywood steps in, the American League
triple crown winner. .341 average,
48 homers, 121 R.B.I.'s. He's homered
the only two times he's faced Vaughn.
Taylor sets down a sign. Two fingers for the curve ball.
Vaughn shakes it off. Taylor puts down another sign. Vaughn
shakes it off. Finally, Taylor puts down one finger -- the
fast ball. Vaughn nods with steely purpose.
TAYLOR
All right, Ricky, let's get nasty.
Vaughn winds and delivers a hissing blur toward the plate.
Haywood takes a ferocious swing and misses. Strike one.
We see the number 97 come up on the digital readout of the
SPEED GUN which a club employee holds behind the screen.
TAYLOR
(to Haywood)
All right, looks like the boy is
pumped. Sucker was movin', wasn't
it? Ever hit ya, it'd leave a two
foot hole comin' out.
Taylor gets ready to flash another sign. The convict jumps
up and down trying to distract Vaughn. No way.
TAYLOR
(for Haywood's ears)
Let's see, what should we call now.
Let's see how he feels about old
number one.
Taylor puts down one finger. Vaughn nods and then winds and
fires again, another blazing rocket. Haywood takes a wicked
rip, but doesn't get it. Strike two. 99 comes up on the gun.
The convict has stopped jumpin'.
TAYLOR
Nice swing, Haywood. Good follow-
through. Keep it up, I'll show you
the ball sometime.
The fans are going wild. They're all standing now, yelling
for a strikeout. Vaughn gets back up on the rubber with the
look of an animal sighting prey. Taylor gets down to give
the sign.
DUGOUT (INSERT STORYBOARD # 216R)
BROWN
Forget the curveball. Go with the
heater.
TAYLOR
Well, shit, all these pitches to
choose from. Maybe we'll try somethin'
different this time.
Taylor wiggles his fingers around and then puts down the big
No. 1. Vaughn gives him a quick nod.
TAYLOR
And if I don't see you again, Haywood,
have a nice winter. Okay, buddy?
Vaughn goes into his windup and unleashes a screaming bullet
toward the plate. Haywood pulls the trigger, but it's already
by him. Strike three. 101 on the gun. Taylor leaps up and
gives Vaughn the fist. The fans are going berserk. MUSIC
ends.
DOYLE (V.O.)
Oh, Lordy, three straight heaters
and the Yankees are blown down. No
runs, two hits, three left on, and,
are you ready, Cleveland? We go to
the bottom of the ninth, still tied
at two.
Doyle turns the mike off.
DOYLE
(to his color man)
Can you believe this, Monty?
Monty takes a big swig straight from the bourbon bottle.
OMIT
Sequence omitted from original script.
ANOTHER INDIAN HITTER
grounding out to short.
HAYES
walking up to the plate.
DOYLE (V.O.)
Two down in the ninth, Hayes steps
in hitting .291, trying to get
something going for the Tribe.
Taylor and the others yell encouragement to Hayes as he digs
in at the plate. The Yankee pitcher delivers and Hayes hits
a high bouncer toward short. The shortstop waits for it to
come down and then fires to first. Too late. Hayes streaks
across the bag, beating the throw by a hair. Once again the
CROWD comes to life.
The Yankee Manager comes to the mound and waves for a new
pitcher.
DOYLE (V.O.)
And Horton is wasting no time. He's
goin' to the Duke.
Out of the pen comes BILLY DUKE, a good facsimile of Goose
Gossage only Duke is bigger and meaner.
(INSERT STORYBOARD #219M)
DOYLE
Duke leads the league in saves,
strikeouts per inning and nose hairs.
The Duke finishes his warmups and stares over at Hayes. Hayes
smiles, snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket, and
carefully pulls them on over his hands.
The Duke does not care for this kind of showmanship.
Brown comes over to talk to Taylor, who's been watching Duke
from the on-deck circle.
BROWN
Ya know I'd be an ass not to pinch-
hit for you here. You're 0 for 18
against Duke. Plus you're beat to
shit you can hardly walk, there's no
way you can get around on this guy's
fast ball. So I want the absolute
truth here. Can you beat this guy?
TAYLOR
Yeh.
BROWN
Okay.
Taylor starts for the plate, as Duke finishes his warmups.
Brown comes down the dugout steps.
BROWN
(to Pepper)
Send Hayes the first pitch. I don't
want Taylor takin' too many strikes.
Pepper begins flashing signs out to Hayes. Duke gets up on
the rubber and takes his stretch. Hayes leads away, crouching
low. Duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman
slapping a hard tag on Hayes, but Hayes is back.
The crowd is on its feet again. The "GO" chant starts,
punctuated by thousands of black-gloved hands punching the
night air.
Duke comes set again. Hayes leads away. Duke watches him,
checks him again. We go to SLOW MOTION as Duke kicks and
comes to the plate.
Hayes takes off like a shot, head down, eating up ground.
Taylor swings and misses. The Yankee catcher comes up
throwing, rifling a clothesline dart to second base. Hayes
leaves his feet diving for the bag. The second baseman snaps
down the tag. Too late. Hayes is in there.
The stadium is really rockin' now. Duke prowls the mound.
Taylor steps out of the box and flashes a sign to Brown.
PEPPER
What's he doing?
BROWN
Flashing some signals. That's a hell
of an idea.
Brown flashes a sign out to Hayes. A hint of a smile comes
over Hayes' face as he dusts himself off.
Taylor steps back in as Duke gets up on the rubber. Taylor
digs in his back foot, then points to the left field bleachers
ala Babe Ruth.
DOYLE (V.O.)
What's this? Taylor is pointing to
the bleachers, calling his shot.
The crowd, electrified by Taylor's gesture, remains on its
feet. Duke stares in at Taylor, comes to his stretch and
then lets go a steaming fast ball right at Taylor's head.
Taylor goes down in a swirl of dust, the ball missing him by
inches. The stadium explodes with BOOS, but as soon as Taylor
picks himself up, the crowd begins to ROAR again.
Bobby, Vic and Johnny are pounding out a heavy beat on the
TOM-TOMS. Everyone in the stadium begins to CLAP in unison
with the DRUMS.
Taylor steps back in and once again points to the bleachers.
DOYLE (V.O.)
(Taylor points again)
Unbelievable. They're on their feet
here, stomping, clapping. C'mon,
join in wherever you are out there.
Let's hear you, Cleveland.
THE LONGSHOREMEN
and several of their friends at their bar, huddled around
the RADIO with the punks and heavy metal kids we saw before.
Slowly they begin to clap in time with the tom-toms which
are audible on the T.V.
THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE
at the opera with his wife, a radio earplug in his ear. His
hand taps on his leg in sync with the TOM-TOMS.
THE TWO KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS
(Sc 222 before scene 221) beating on their shovels in the
bullpen.
LARGE APARTMENT BUILDING
FRAMED against the Cleveland skyline. In several of the lit
windows we see people banging things or clapping.
THE STADIUM AGAIN
Duke gets back on the hill. Getting the sign he wants, he
comes to his stretch, checking Hayes at second.
As Duke starts his delivery to the plate, we go to SLOW
MOTION. The clapping in the stadium stops as everyone hushes
to watch the pitch. We...
CUT TO:
THE LONGSHOREMEN, THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE, THE GROUNDSKEEPERS
AND THE APARTMENT DWELLERS
They've all stopped too in anticipation of the pitch.
THE STADIUM
Everything from here on will continue to be in SLOW MOTION.
As Duke whips his arm toward the plate, Hayes takes off for
third. Taylor, instead of swinging away, shortens up on the
bat and bunts Duke's pitch down the third base line.
The Yankee third baseman, caught completely unaware, charges
the ball frantically.
TAYLOR
barreling down the line toward first on his sore legs, giving
it everything he's got.
THE THIRD BASEMAN
scooping up the ball barehanded and firing on the run to
first.
TAYLOR
pounding down the line. He strains for the bag as the Yankee
first baseman stretches to his limit for the throw. Taylor
and the ball arrive at almost the same time. Taylor hits the
bag and then sprawls in the dirt as his knees give out.
The umpire brings up his arms, and spreads them wide. Safe.
Taylor's beaten it.
The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes
fear into his heart across the field. It's...
HAYES
streaking for home, trying to score all the way from second
on a bunt.
The first baseman fires to the plate, as the catcher positions
himself for the throw. Hayes launches into a flying feet-
first slide. The catcher brings the tag down. Hayes hooks to
the outside, his trailing foot reaching for the plate.
DOYLE (V.O.)
Hayes is gonna try to score! Here
comes the throw. He slides. He is...
Hayes' foot catches the corner of the plate. The umpire puts
the palms down and whips them apart. It's all over, folks.
SLOW MOTION ENDS
DOYLE
...Safe. The Indians win it. The
Indians win. Oh my God, the Indians
win it!!
Pandemonium breaks loose in Municipal Stadium. Rachel hugs
Donovan, dances around, punches the air, then hugs Donovan
again. Everywhere people are hugging and kissing each other.
Bobby, Vic and Johnny are going berserk in the bleachers.
Thelma sits quietly, a tear rolling down her cheek.
QUICK CUTS
of our other fans. We see...
A) The Business Executive stand up and yell "Yes!" in the
middle of the opera. Several other men stand up and express
their excitement as well.
B) The Longshoremen whoop it up in their bar -- exchanging
fives and hugs with the punkers and heavy metal kids.
C) The various apartment dwellers dancing, clapping, yelling
out the windows.
D) The two Korean Groundskeepers just shaking their heads in
amazement.
E) Elsewhere in the stadium, the joyous exultation continues
unabated. The crowd pours onto the field as Hayes runs toward
Taylor and literally leaps into his arms.
F) The two spin around throwing their fists in the air.
G) Cerrano and Harris embrace. Dorn gives Vaughn a hug, then
steps back and decks him with a right hand.
H) Dorn pulls Vaughn back to his feet, and they hug again.
I) Up in the stands, Rachel watches all this with tears in
her eyes.
Taylor starts off the field when he sees something that
catches his eye. Standing by the field rail is Lynn. She
holds up her left hand and smiles. There's no ring on it.
Taylor races over to her as she jumps down from the rail and
hugs herself to him. We HOLD on the celebration as it swirls
all around them, and...
