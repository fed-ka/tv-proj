MR BEAN'S STREET.
DAY
Mr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world-
He walks up the street, tutting slightly at
a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes.
The street is totally car-free except for a
very visible lime green mini. A
policeman strolls by and glances down at a
pair of legs sticking out from
under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on,
satisfied that someone is mending
their car.
BEAN approaches the car
and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then
unlocks the big padlock
that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside,
fiddles with something
else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening
speed with a smug look
on his face.
The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits.
BEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if
it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound
fault.
BEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a
lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps
violently.
BEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the
problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player
strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune.
On he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious
familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful
traffic.
Heels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He
takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight-
line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S
satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a
perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls.
But at the end of
the alley, the traffic's just as bad.
BEAN
notices he's
outside Harrods.
There's a tail-coated Security Guard at
the
'front door.
BEAN watches him
stroll a bit down the street - and takes
his
chance. He
turns and drives
straight through the double doors, into
the
store.

KNIGHTSBRIDGE.
DAY.
Out in the street, BEAN is faced by an accident. There are flashing lights, a
crumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers. BEAN looks concerned.
CUT TO:
THE STRAND.
DAY.
An Ambulance roars through the traffic. It reaches its hospital, turns off,
and there, right smack behind it is the Mini. Cut in to see BEAN, smiling
broadly. He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending
pigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque
National Gallery. Of course, there's not another car there. Just the Gallery
and the mini.
CUT TO:
NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY
BEAN
gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and
takes
out a "Doctor on Call' sign. To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the
back
window and a skull of the front seat. Happy with the arrangement, he re-
locks
the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work.
As he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that
Board meeting was taking place.
CUT TO:
GRIERSON GALLERY.
AMERICA - DAY.
8.30 am California time. A modern building with plenty of glass. Large,
modern sculptures are spotted around its grounds, including a dramatic one of
two huge old cars, head down in the ground, backs protruding into the air.
THOMAS GRIERSON, owner of the gallery, wearing a slick expensive suit, walks
with DAVE LEARY and BERNIE, both in casual jackets and ties. GRIERSON is a
vain, slightly pedantic and pompous man - maybe short - always just trying to
show he's Boss. The three are strolling towards the main entrance. Huge
sign: 'THE GRIERSON GALLERY' with a silhouette of Whistler's Mother taken from
the painting, as an incorporated logo.
GRIERSON
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in
the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.
BERNIE
Great news.
BERNIE is smooth and smiley. DAVID LEARY, Vice President, is a very pleasant,
but slightly worried man, knocking on 40. Too nice for his own good. The
three pass a lone MIME ARTIST wearing a cheap vac-form PRESIDENT CLINTON face
mask. David can't help being just a little nice to him and finds himself left
behind. He scampers to catch up.
9
First, catching under the handle - then the couch, then
Four other chairs - and finally the deep freeze.
No-one's going to get in
through that door.
BACK IN THE
HALL BEAN pushes the string
back inside the
letter box and slaps
his hand in
satisfaction. He locks the
door's enormous
padlock, looks about
carefully to
make sure no one's around,
and then hides
the key under a garden
gnome on the
floor, standing amongst a
row of pathetic
pot plants.
MIX THROUGH TO:
THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY
7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into
the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing
BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a
bum-fluff moustache.
DAVID gets out of his car and approaches them.
DAVID
Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with
Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some
more.
The two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the
house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON,
has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are
laughing in the car as DAVID walks up.
15
He is slightly disturbed to see ALISON kiss CHARLES on the cheek before
getting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID.
CHARLES
Hello, David.
DAVID
Hi, Charles. (To Alison) Wow - late!
ALISON
(brightly)
I had to do some last minute stuff.
CHARLES
My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.
How about you,
gallery going well?
DAVID
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I
think it ....
ALISON
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Alison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better -
she's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams
out. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed
her and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out.
ALISON
Kevin!
You stop that right now!
CHARLES
Great kids.
Good looking too.
DAVID
You think so?
Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay,
looks-wise.
CHARLES
Take after their mother, huh?
DAVID
Ah ... absolutely.
DAVID is not very happy here.

Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya.
In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya,
with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener,
ya know that?
BEAN smiles politely. Taxi drives away. BEAN walks up to' the front porch,
checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell. No
answer. Presses again. Still no answer ... Now where have they hidden the
key. He inspects things carefully.
The camera sees what he sees ... the
doormat, the flowerpot, the window-ledge
... and then he spots a little stone
frog. BEAN smiles. Key hiding is
something he knows about - and people
are pathetically obvious about it. BEAN
picks up the FROG to reveal the front
door key. It glints in the porch-light.

DAVID and BEAN arrive at the car and get in.
DAVID heads out of the drive
at a reasonable speed.
BEAN suddenly yanks on the hand-brake. DAVID's head hits the windshield
with a sickening thud. BEAN reaches for and fastens his seat belt. He
looks to DAVID. DAVID gives BEAN a pained look. What planet does he come
from? He fastens his own seat belt while BEAN wonders why it's all taking
so long.
CUT TO:

CAR PARKING - DAY
It's a rather fancy building. Like a little Guggenheim DAVID parks by a
large, expensive, looking car. BEAN opens his door and it bangs-hard
against the pristine body work.
CUT TO:
THE GRIERSON GALLERY.
BY PARKING LOT - DAY
(About 5 p.m.) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot. On the way, BEAN's
interest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton mask,
performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture. BEAN lingers.
The MIME accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb
her hair etc. The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really. The woman
quickly moves on.
BEAN is intrigued. The MIME mimes climbing a ladder. BEAN goes up next to
him - and looks up. There's nothing there. He decides the MIME is a bit of
a tricky. This is confirmed when the MIME pretends he's locked behind a
pane of glass. BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass
wall, and hits the MIME's nose.
CUT TO: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off.
The MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last.
He
takes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand
the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the
slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from
where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves
off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a
mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed.
The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns ....
But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece
of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold
Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a
hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens
another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it.
The MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool
to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN
twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the
terrified MIME.
45
Finally, in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat, he
fires. 10 seconds delay, and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death, 50
yards away.
BEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID, arms folded,
leans against his car. DAVID gets into his car. BEAN opens the passenger
door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same
as this morning).
CUT TO:
SHOPPING MALL.
PARKING LOT - DAY
DAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible.
DAVID
Okay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak ... Wine - good.
Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right,
Bean, or ... (looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble, okay?
BEAN nods.
DAVID gets out and heads for the mall.
Nearby woman tramp (BAG
LADY) goes
through a trash can.
BEAN tries to control himself but weakens. He plays with all the buttons and
switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. Then he notices a
throbbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate.
BEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its
engine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of
someone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several
people returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to
them as if to say: "Are these yours?"
[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.]
Then suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall,
weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly
full of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight,
a PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask.
As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old
friend, the MIME.
ROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets
in - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his
pockets ...
46
BEAN leans into shot.
He holds out the keys, grinning.
ROBBER
Gimme the keys!
BEAN runs away with them. Or doesn't! He is in mime mode - And runs on the
spot, getting faster and faster. The ROBBER approaches this obvious madman.
He is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual.
ROBBER
I said, give me the keys!
BEAN turns and holds out two hands, just like the MIME did to him. The
perplexed ROBBER picks one hand. Wrong one. He then.... pulls a gun and puts
it hard to MR BEAN in BEAN's face. Passers-by scream and fall to the ground,
the bag lady amongst them. Sudden harsh reality.
But not to BEAN. He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the ROBBER's face,
ticking him off for breaking the rules.
ROBBER
OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!!
BEAN gestures the ROBBER to turn around. He does, sure this sicko is going
simply to shoot him in the head. But instead BEAN puts his back to the
ROBBER's back, and starts to count
BEAN
1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10
He turns and gestures to the ROBBER it's time to draw.
By this time a crowd
has gathered.
ROBBER
But I haven't got a f.....
BEAN
Ssssh!!!!
He points out a small child, watching from behind a trash can.

COFFEE SHOP ~ DAY
DAVID is hurrying back to the parking lot, with a bag of groceries, and a big
bunch of red roses.. He stops dead in his tracks as he spots something ...

ALISON and CHARLES are sitting up on stools, in the window of a coffee shop.
ALISON laughs at something that CHARLES says. Their body language suggests a
certain closeness. DAVID is saddened. He hurries away.
CUT TO:
SHOPPING MALL.
PARKING LOT ~ DAY
BEAN waves the gun at the ROBBER.
ROBBER
I haven't got a gun.
But BEAN is pushing him to draw.
Finally...
ROBBER
Okay, okay, I'11 do it!
He draws. BEAN draws too. They fire. And BEAN really fires. To his
amazement. Onlookers scream. BEAN throws the gun away in startlement.
The ROBBER lunges for it ~ BEAN kicks it away, trying to help him avoid such a
dangerous implement.
The ROBBER lunges at BEAN who throws the keys away over his shoulder. The
ROBBER has to scrabble under a car for them- BEAN thinks of final joke - and
niftly swaps the ROBBER's bag, for one of the Old BAG LADY's bags. A few
dollar notes spill out of it.
When the ROBBER emerges with the keys, BEAN 's waiting to escort him to his
car. He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around
the ROBBER and gets him to take a photograph of them. BEAN removes the
ROBBER's mask as the picture is taken. Forgetting himself, the ROBBER smiles
for the camera.
The ROBBER, jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police car
sirens, jumps in the car and drives away. BEAN waves goodbye to the
convertible as a couple of Police cars screech up. COPS jump out.
DAVID approaches the scene with groceries and roses. What kind of hell has
BEAN caused now? But instead of trouble, he sees the passers-by are getting
to their feet, applauding BEAN and whistling! They crowd round the COPS
explaining what a hero BEAN has been.
BEAN hands over the gun to a COP. He doesn't really understand what all the
fuss is about. He notices the BAG
48
LADY wandering away with her bags. Should he tell her that he has swapped one
of them for the ROBBER'S? No. He's getting too much attention to be bothered.
A COP comes up to BEAN. It is COP 1 from the airport scene.
COP 1
Excuse me.
Mr. er ... Cabbage?
Sudden mutual recognition.

DAVID is talking to BERNIE in the grounds.
We can see the side of the whole
gallery in shot as they talk.
BERNIE
I was hoping DU.
Bean might take a look at my computer project
today.
DAVID
Yes. I'11 mention it to him.
But ... he's kind of his own guy,
you know?
BERNIE
Howls he getting on with the family?
DAVID
Ah. Fine.
It's good.
It's great.
We will be slightly distracted by
the observation that Whistler's Mother,
America's most valuable painting,
is at this moment balanced on a very thin
ledge three floors up - where Bean
has put in, outside the Men's room
window. A bird and then a couple
more birds perch on it.
BERNIE
And howls Alison?
DAVID
She's ... well, she's good.
BERNIE
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.
Nice guy. Good looking.
DAVID
Yes, isn't he.
BERNIE
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
DAVID
Isn't it?
62
BERNIE
I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even
though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that
way, huh?
DAVID doesn't quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely.
Now we see BEAN's plan -
he has emerged at a nearby window. He
can't reach
the painting at first.
So he stretches further and further out
the window.
No good. Finally he has
to go out on the ledge. He shoos away
the birds, who
then decide to settle on
him instead. Finally he gets a hand on
the painting.
As he does so, he loses
hold. He just manages to grabs a window
before he
falls.
DAVID
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie -
always a subtle joy.
BERNIE
Thanks, David.
Always a pleasure.
Period.
BEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the
painting. It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. DAVID turns to go.
BERNIE
By the way. Don't
know what you think, Mr Vice President, but
I've been hinting
to the old man that someone's got to have the
balls to take some
sort of emergency measures around here - or
we're all in the
crap house. What
do you think?
DAVID
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
BERNIE
Not necessarily. That's where this ... ( POINTS TO HIS BRAIN )
comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll
hear soon enough.
BERNIE grins and walks away. Bean does one final swing, and ....

NIGHT.
The building is floodlit by ground spots.
BEAN arrives silently, with suitcase, on the skateboard. Soon his full plan
will be revealed. The Gallery is empty, apart from the one Security Guard,
BUCK, visible through the glass front of the building, drinking coffee,
watching his 12 security monitors. BEAN swallows at the sight of BUCK - he is
a massive gorilla of a man.

BUCK is looking for the body amongst the trees. He finds nothing. Because he

JENNIFER is heading down the path.
DAVID runs out of the house and catches up
with her.
DAVID
Jen, you have to help me here! I've got to go in to work, and
with your mom away ... I really need you.
A powerful motorbike turns into the drive at speed and skids round to face the
opposite direction. JENNIFER runs over to it. The bike's rider turns off his
engine and removes his helmet. It is STINGO, the white Rasta from the
airport, with the hair extensions and the sixty rings in his nose.
STINGO
(to DAVID)
You.
He hands JENNIFER a helmet.
JENNIFER
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll be home. Monday, after school.
BEAN and KEVIN arrive at DAVID's side to spectre.
KEVIN
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna
look just like its handsome driver.
DAVID
(angry now)
Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this
family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!
Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable.
JENNIFER has put on the helmet and is climbing onto the back of the bike.
JENNIFER
Great, Dad. You promised you'd get rid of him! (points at Bean)
And as for: "how we do things in this family. We don't have a
family till you get Mom back.

She slaps STINGO on the shoulder.
STINGO kicks the starter lever.
Nothing.
Again.
Nothing ...
JENNIFER
Come on Sting!
KEVIN
Sting?!
Sounds like something you put on a rash.
STINGO is still kicking the starter.
DAVID is desperate.
DAVID
Don't just stand there, Bean - do something.
BEAN instantly takes on the hero's mantle and runs to the bike. DAVID is not
far behind him. STINGO is still trying to kick start it. BEAN takes out a
small screwdriver and twiddles with something on the engine.
The bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the drive
and down the road. BEAN stands, hands on hips, looking very-pleased with
himself indeed.
DAVID
To BEAN )
Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin!

a good idea) Uh --- Right! Kevin. You get inside and
look after

they walk purposely
up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to
reveal that this is
BERNIE. It's a rehearsal. He is met with a hand shake by
GRIERSON at the main
entrance.
GRIERSON
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of

The red carpet unrolls all the way to the Rolls, rear door. Close on the
bottom of the driver's door. It opens and out step a pair of legs, wearing
army boots and khaki trousers.

The legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us. Camera pans up to
show us that GOVERNOR REYNOLDS is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of
medals and forage cap. He is a grand figure. In fact - he's exactly the same
grand figure Mr BEAN caused epic problems To on the plane over. He gives his
prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before
heading on.
BRUTUS and his SIDE-KICK COP fall into step behind him.
They are the Police
presence today.
GRIERSON and BERNIE greet REYNOLDS at the entrance.
GRIERSON is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit.
BERNIE is
frowning - not happy about that uniform.
GRIERSON
what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.
REYNOLDS
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.
Going on To my regiment/s
reunion after.
GRIERSON
Not at all, Governor.
Very striking.
REYNOLDS takes in GRIERSON's suit.
REYNOLDS
Interesting suit.
GRIERSON
(Beaming)
Why thank you sir.
REYNOLDS
off the peg?
GRIERSON
(crestfallen )
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
He gestures to BERNIE but REYNOLDS cuts in and hands BERNIE a set of car keys.
REYNOLDS
(To Bernie)
Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.
BERNIE's smile melts away. As they enter the gallery, BERNIE hopefully offers
the car keys to BRUTUS - who rewards him with a "don't be stupid" smile and
follows the Governor.
86
BEAN (wearing "Dr Bean" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door,
thus just missing REYNOLDS. BERNIE sees him and jumps on the chance to
delegate.
BERNIE
Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you.
BEAN assents happily. BRUTUS spies BEAN over his shoulder and frowns - its
that mad English guy again. BEAN gets to the door and sees the Governor's
car. Yummy!

BEAN has let himself into the car. It's one of the happiest moments of his
life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather
seat.
87
He starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park. He sweeps
dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact.
Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left.
BEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the
one he's used to.
He takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and
measures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't
large enough.
With a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in
between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process.
BEAN looks a tadge concerned.
CUT TO:
PARKING LOT - DAY.
BEAN sitting in the wedged car. He tries
the door - but it won't open a
centimetre. He's totally stuck. He looks
up at a small window in the roof.
If only he could get that open. He pushes
various buttons, which set of
windscreen wipers, squirters, radios. He
pushes the cigarette lighter.
Finally, he pulls a lever - and the bonnet
pops up an inch.
At which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat. BEAN is
still looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the
seat beside him. Not good news.
88
BEAN panics a bit, turns and half
climbs over into
the back
seat, when he
spies a drinks cabinet. He has a
very good idea -
he finds
a cut crystal
decanter of brown liquid, opens it
and uses it to
douse the
fire. Not a
wise move with brandy. Before the
cut, we see the
WHOOOSH!
of a major fire
in the front seat of the car.

pride and Joy. The three cars form a tall pyramid.
Close on REYNOLDS' face. GRIERSON approaches.

Looking in front outside, we see Alison sit down. We see, ,but do not hear
David start to talk. Within seconds her hands go up to her face in horror.
CUT TO:
THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY.
Half an hour later. Police cars draw up.
BERNIE is shoved in the back seat
of one. GRIERSON, BEAN & DAVID watch.
GRIERSON
(to uniformed cop)
I don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but I'd
also ask him a few questions about the destruction of the
Whistler copy.
BEAN nods his head firmly.
The car pulls away.
Then breaks and reverses.
The SIDE-KICK gets out.
SIDE~KICK
Oh, yeah - I forgot.
SIDE-KICK opens the back of the car.
He takes out a huge bunch of flowers.
The chief said I was to give you these.
BEAN is delighted. Then sniffs the flowers.
What a nasty stink.
Not his
sort of thing at all.
114
SIDE-KICK drives AWAY.
GRIERSON turns to DAVID.
GRIERSON
I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise
me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that
you do not.
DAVID
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
He looks sideways to Bean, who is frantically pointing to his spine.
DAVID
gets the message, and changes his tune..
Let me think about that, Thomas.
We'd have to talk quite a salary
hike.
GRIERSON
Of course.
DAVID
And a car.
GRIERSON
Mmmmm...
DAVID
Maybe two cars.
GRIERSON
A car sounds sensible.
DAVID
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.
Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of
time to make up.
DAVID heads off. BEAN wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky
flowers. He turns to ANNIE and gives them to her to be rid of them. She
beams with delight: after all, he DID love her.
BEAN heads off with DAVID to the parking lot.
As they go, DAVID puts an arm
round BEAN.
Who shoos him away instantly.
No sloppiness for him.
CUT TO:
115
THE LEARY HOUSE.
HALL - DAY.
The LEARY family in a group.
JENNIFER's arm in a sling.
ALISON
well, it's been... unusual. But thank you.
She goes to kiss BEAN - but he just sticks out his hand, and shakes it firmly.
Then moves on to JENNIFER.
JENNIFER
Good-bye Mr Bean.
Sorry I screamed that first time.
He shakes her broken arm firmly ... and she screams again.
DAVID
Come on
hurry or we'll be late.
CUT TO:
LEARY HOUSE.
DAY.
BEAN, KEVIN
& DAVID
get into the car. It pulls away, as they drive off, BEAN
sticks his
hand of
the window - and waves a last farewell to ALISON and
JENNIFER.
At last
a sentimental moment - romantic music swelling - like Liza
Minelli at
the end
of "Cabaret".
Until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as the
car squeezes past.
MIX THROUGH TO:
THE NATIONAL GALLERY.
LONDON - DAY
Shot from high up. BEAN's lime green mini approaches, coming around Trafalgar
Square, and drives up onto the pavement, in front of the gallery. It stops
and BEAN gets out. He looks up at the building, pleased to be back.
CUT TO:
THE NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY
BEAN pauses outside the revolving doors to clip his staff identity badge onto
his top pocket. He enters in high spirits.
CUT TO:
THE NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY
BEAN looks up at the building and gives a disgusted grunt ,before getting into
his car and drives off around Trafalgar Square. His brow is deeply furrowed.
What will he do now with his life?
CUT TO:
BEAN'S HOUSE
DAY.
Behind the credits, we see close-ups of BEAN hammering away at large planks of
wood on some wooden structure.
He walks
away from it - without us seeing what it is
and goes
to his Mini, where TEDDY sits on a pile of books in the front seat,
wearing a
seat belt. Bean gets into the car, which is laden with suitcases,
starts it
up and drives ....
.... straight into the huge crate he has built.
A rope tied to the back
bumper pulls the lid closed behind him.
CUT TO:
MOTORWAY.
DAY.
The crate sits on the back of a speeding truck.
CUT TO:
AIRPORT.
DAY.
The crate is now on the top of a forklift truck moving up the ramp on an
American airline cargo plane. Close up on a large sticker on the crate: it
reads: "DAVID LEARY, 23 WOODFORD AVENUE, CHESTERFIELD, CALIFORNIA. HANDLE
WITH CARE.
And cut to the plane flying through clear skies.
Though, for the Lear's of
course there are no clear skies ahead.
THE END
