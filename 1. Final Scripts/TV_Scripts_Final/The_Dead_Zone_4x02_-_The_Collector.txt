  11INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - DAY

            A grilled-cheese sandwich begins to smoke in a fry pan on
          the stove, REVEALING JOHNNY, who has his back to this
            impending culinary disaster.  At the moment, he's caught
          up in one of those mind-numbing, home shopping INFOMERCIALS
          on television.

          A way too happy MAN and WOMAN demonstrate their new miracle
          product.

                                        MAN (ON TV)
                        Folks, this truly is a miracle
                          product.  It cooks, grills, fries,
                        steams and smokes any meat, fish,
                        poultry and vegetable product you
                        can imagine.

          Johnny has a pen and pad in hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (impatiently waits)
                        Just give me the damn phone number.

                                        MAN (ON TV)
                        We're going to give you that phone
                        number in just a few minutes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Aw, come on!

                                        MAN (ON TV)
                        Right now, Rhonda, my lovely
                          assistant is going to demonstrate
                        the patented self-cleaning
                        mechanism.  Rhonda...

          Johnny suddenly smells smoke and turns to SEE THE SANDWICH
          BURNING.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Aw, geez!

          He hurries back to the stove and reaches for the handle
          of the pan -- OUCH! -- too hot.  The SMOKE BUILDS in the
          kitchen.

          The DOORBELL RINGS!


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - TEASER - 1/13/05 - WHITE-2   2.


    1CONTINUED:1

          Johnny shuts off the burner then grabs a dish towel and
          dumps the smoking pan into the sink.

          The DOORBELL RINGS again!

                                        JOHNNY
                          Terrific.  It's probably the fire
                          department.

          He tosses the dish towel in the sink and MOVES through
          the thick smoke towards the front door.


  22INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny OPENS the door to find SARAH.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah?  This is a surprise.

                                        SARAH
                        I was in the area.  Is everything
                        okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Terrific.  I was just fixing lunch.


  33INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny opens a window, fanning the smoke out with the
          dish towel.  Sarah checks the damage in the sink.

                                        SARAH
                        What was it supposed to be?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Grilled cheese.

                                        SARAH
                        You seem to have the 'grilled'
                        part figured out.  Ever think
                        about getting a housekeeper?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Every time I get hungry.

          They share a smile.







                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - TEASER - 1/11/05 - GREEN   3.


    3CONTINUED:3

                                        JOHNNY
                        So, what's up?

                                        SARAH
                        JJ mentioned something about an
                        old baseball glove you said he
                        could use.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My father gave it to me before he
                        died.  You didn't have to come
                        all the way over here.  I could
                        have dropped it by your place.

          Johnny can see there's something else on her mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Unless, there's something else on
                        your mind?

                                        SARAH
                                (caught)
                        Tough to fool a psychic.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or a friend.


  44INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          They step out from the kitchen...

                                        SARAH
                        I've been doing some volunteer
                        counseling down at the woman's
                          outreach center.  They have a
                        program for homeless women.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds terrific.

                                        SARAH
                        It is.  Truth is, I think I get
                        more out of it than the women in
                        the program do.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How do you mean?

    4CONTINUED:4

                                        SARAH
                                (begins to get
                                  emotional)
                        With Walt working late hours and
                        JJ becoming more and more
                          independent...  I have so much
                        more free time.  It feels good to
                        give back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But there's something else, right?

                                        SARAH
                                (beat)
                        There's a girl, her name is Erica. 
                        I've been helping her through the
                        job training program.  A few days
                        ago she just stopped showing up. 
                        I have this terrible feeling.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A feeling?

                                        SARAH
                        That she's out there somewhere...
                        in trouble.

          Off this moment of decision, we're...


  55INT. COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER - DAY

          A local under-funded social work operation.  Flat lighting. 
          Donated furniture, mismatched chairs, broken copy machine.

          YOUNG WOMEN being trained to do secretarial jobs.  Some
          have BABIES with them.  Sarah shows Johnny around.

                                        SARAH
                        The center operates almost
                          exclusively on private funding.

          It's both sad and encouraging.  She guides him to a cubicle
          with a COMPUTER.

                                        SARAH
                        This was Erica's work station.

          Johnny sets his jacket down and starts moving around the
          station, gently using his hands to touch things, the chair,
          the desk and then the keyboard as WHOOSH --


  66INT. A PRINCESS BEDROOM - DAY/NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny stands in a perfectly decorated room.  With a silk
          floral bedspread and matching pillows trimmed in delicate
          lace.  The matching curtains are also trimmed in lace. 
          It's like something built for a storybook princess.

          There's a small vanity table against one wall.  Johnny
          steps around to find a terrified young woman, ERICA (19). 
          She's on the floor against the door.

                                        ERICA
                                (crying)
                        Let me out of here!  You hear me! 

          She gives up and sinks against the door.


  77RESUME INT. COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER - DAY

          Johnny snaps out of the vision.  Sarah reads the bothered
          expression on his face.

                                        SARAH
                        Did you see something?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We need to talk to Walt.

          Off this disturbing moment...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  88INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

          We open on Sarah handing Walt a photograph of her and the
          missing girl, Erica.

                                        SARAH
                        This picture was taken a few weeks
                        ago at the community center.

          Walt passes it to Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the girl I saw in my vision.

                                        WALT
                        You have no idea where she was
                        being held?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It looked like a little girl's
                          bedroom.  Could be anywhere.

                                        WALT
                          I checked the emergency call
                        center.  No one named Erica Carlson
                        has been reported missing.  If
                        that's even her real name.

                                        SARAH
                        Why would she lie?

                                        WALT
                        Most of these women come from
                        abusive relationships.  Some of
                        them don't want to be found. 
                        Sarah, do you remember anything
                        this girl might have said? 
                          Somebody bothering her.  An old
                          boyfriend maybe.

                                        SARAH
                        She didn't really talk about her
                          personal life.  I should have
                        tried to get closer.

          She's clearly upset.

                                        WALT
                        I'll take the picture out on the
                          streets, see if anybody recognizes
                        her.

          Walt puts his hand on Sarah's shoulder.

                                        WALT
                        We'll do everything we can to
                        find her.


  99INT. PRINCESS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Erica's on the floor, hair askew.  Suddenly, the lighting
          in the room shifts, as several powerful wall mounted flood
          lights kick on, blasting a powerful white light directly
          into her face.  She HEARS the lock opening outside.  As
          the door swings slowly open we see the silhouette of a
          MAN.  Erica lifts her head, still unable to see much
          because of the lighting.

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                        Don't look at me.

          Erica does as she's told, looking down at the floor.

                                        ERICA
                        I want to go home.  I won't tell
                        anyone, I promise.

          A pair of SNAKE SKIN COWBOY BOOTS step silently into the
          room (of course, we don't see the person wearing them). 
          The boots step forward, passing just inches away from her
          as they move to a closet against the far wall.

                                        ERICA
                        I'm hungry.

          A MAN'S HAND wearing a coiled snake ring reaches for the
          closet door and opens it.

                                        ERICA
                                (she begins to cry)
                        Please, I just want to go home.

          The ringed hand traces across a row of neatly hung party
          dresses, finally selecting a yellow one with green flowers. 
          He pulls it off the hanger.

                                        ERICA
                        I'll do whatever you ask.  Just
                          don't...

          The man tosses the dress down on the floor in front of
          her.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT ONE - 1/11/05 - GOLD   8.


    9CONTINUED:9

          The unseen kidnapper steps back across to the open door
          and turns to face her.


          ERICA'S POV - SLOWLY FOCUSING

          Erica steals a look at her unseen abductor, the bright
          lights making it nearly impossible to see him clearly.

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                        Get dressed and fix your face. 
                        There's make-up on the table.

          He closes the door as the lighting shifts back to the
          warmer overhead configuration.  Erica looks at the dress,
          then rises to find a box full of expensive make-up on the
          vanity table.


  1010EXT. LOW RENT NEIGHBORHOOD - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

          The outskirts of Bangor.  A few prostitutes, johns and
          panhandlers linger along the sidewalk.  Walt and Johnny
          show Erica's picture around.  Walt stops a prostitute -
          TAMI, 25ish with long dark hair, a micro-mini skirt and
          boots.  She turns to walk away...

                                        WALT
                        Hold on!  I want to ask you some
                        questions.

                                        TAMI
                        Sorry, officer, I was just waiting
                        for my mother to pick me up.

                                        WALT
                        Your mother?

          Walt and Johnny share an amused look, then...

                                        TAMI
                        For cheerleading practice.

          She lights up as she recognizes Johnny.

                                        TAMI
                        Hey, I know you!

                                        WALT
                        You do? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think so.

                                        TAMI
                        I never forget a face.  You're
                        that mind-reading guy.  I saw
                        your picture in the newspaper. 
                        Wow, you're way hotter in person.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

                                        TAMI
                        Hey, y'wanna touch me and guess
                        your future?

          She playfully opens her fake fur jacket to REVEAL a lacy
          push-up bra.  Walt quietly enjoys Johnny's awkwardness --

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sheriff, you wanna help me out
                        here?

                                        WALT
                        Do you recognize this girl?

          He shows her the picture of Erica.

                                        TAMI
                                (reacts instantly)
                        My God --

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know her?

          Tami isn't sure she wants to get involved.

                                        TAMI
                        I can't remember.  No, I don't
                        think so.

          Walt needs to put a little pressure on her.

                                        WALT
                          Normally, it's too damn cold out
                        here to have my people roust you
                        and your friends on a nightly
                        basis.  You withhold information
                        in a criminal investigation and
                        I'll make it my top priority.

                                        TAMI

                        to crash at my place when the
                        weather got bad.

                                        JOHNNY

          Walt gives her a hard look ...

  1111EXT. RAINTREE MOTEL - NIGHT - (STOCK)

            Establishing.  It's the dive you'd expect.

                                        TAMI'S VOICE
                        Let me get this straight.


  1212INT. RAINTREE MOTEL - NIGHT

          Tami leads Johnny and Walt into the small, slightly
          disheveled room.  A few odd posters on the wall and a
          battered boom box on the dresser.

                                        TAMI (CONT'D)
                        You can predict the winning Lotto
                          numbers, but you don't?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's complicated.

                        It's crazy.  What's the point of
                        having super-powers unless there's
                        some cash in it?

                        job.

          Johnny moves around the room, trying to pick up something.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How long have you lived here?

                          Clearing House jackpot?

          Johnny is zeroing in on the dresser.

                                        WALT
                        One more question and I'll predict

          Johnny touches the top dresser drawer, as WHOOSH --


  1313INT. RAINTREE MOTEL - DAY/NIGHT - VISION

          He's THROWN into a sensual FAST REWIND VISION...

          Tami is all around Johnny in various states of (un)dress
          with other "clients" in this one little room.  It's an
          absolute BLUR.  But the vision slows down at just the
          right moment...

          Erica, the missing girl, walks into the room, pulls out
          the top dresser drawer and lifts the false bottom to find
          some cash.

          Johnny comes out of the vision.

          He finds the false bottom in the top drawer.  It's empty.

          He touches the false drawer and gets another quick HIT -


  1515EXT. YARD - DAY - VISION

          Johnny stands in front of a suburban house.  A perfectly
            manicured lawn.  Clouds FLASH QUICKLY across the blue sky
          above him.

          He notices a FLASH SERIES OF SCHOOL BUSES dropping and
          picking up students.  A bus stop.  He notices the number
          on the bus -- 226.

          A school bus waits for the kids to climb aboard.  AS THE
          CAMERA PANS the bus we see the number 226 printed on the
          back end.

          The CAMERA CONTINUES OFF the back of the bus and FINDS
          Walt and Johnny trailing it in Walt's cruiser.

                        Erica's disappearance.

          Walt can see that Johnny's getting pulled emotionally
          deeper into the case.

                          I appreciate you getting involved

                        a lot to Sarah.

          They start off again as the bus DRIVES towards it's next
          stop.  Johnny thinks back on his conversation with Sarah.

                        I'd imagine.

                        Right.  That's probably what it
                        was.

          Rich zones in on the television, using the remote to 
          channel surf.  Linda stands near him, but thousands of
          miles away.  Her eyes begin to scan a group of framed
          photographs sitting on a table.

          INSERT - FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS

          Photographs of her life with Rich.  There's one constant
          image in every picture, the expression of numb discontent
          in Linda's eyes.  It's like looking at the ghost of
          herself.  Behind her Rich continues watching television.

  4545INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - WALT'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

          Linda sits with her hands folded neatly in front of her. 
          Walt and Johnny sit opposite her.  She gazes out at Rich
          in the adjoining room.  He sits quiet, seemingly oblivious
          to the situation as he reads a thick, sci-fi paperback
          novel.

          She wears the same clothes, in the same chair, but the
          room is DARK behind her.  We are in a lucid VISION.  The
          song "Chances Are" FADES UP in the background.  Her breath
          is visible.  Johnny is also in the room with her, touching
          her hands.

                        You're doing great.  Just relax.

          Linda's whole appearance suddenly and magically CHANGES. 
            Perfectly placed makeup on her eyes, her hair no longer
          pulled back - but flows down to her shoulders (a wig). 
          She wears a powder blue dress with long sleeves.

                        He brought me pretty dresses and
                          expensive make-up.  He had a way
                        about him, gentle, but dangerous. 
                        There were times when I thought I
                        was the only woman left in the
                        world.  He punished me when I
                        made mistakes.

                          Mistakes?  What kind of mistakes?

          The faint sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE approaches.  Johnny
          scans the room.  Just a closed door.

                        "The dress must never be wrinkled. 
                          A neatly pressed dress makes for
                        a clean and presentable woman."

          There is a discomforting ease in the way she speaks.  The
          train whistle is coming closer...

                        "The makeup should be subtle. 
                        Too much makes a woman look cheap. 
                        Hair should be neatly combed and

          Johnny reaches into the box.  Picks up a few items, then
          a small TEDDY BEAR.  We CLOSE in on the teddy bear's button

  5252INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT - VISION

          There's a small table in the center of the room and two
          wooden dining chairs.  The song "Chances Are..." by Johnny
          Mathis plays on a small record player.

          POV through the clear mask's eyes - think the opening of
          the film 'Halloween'.  We hear heavy BREATHS.

          Erica sits wearing the yellow dress.  Two candles are lit
          on the table. 

          Continue POV: The Masked Man uncovers a tray revealing
          plates of steak, potatoes, vegetables.  

          Erica reaches for the food, but the Man slams his hand
          down on the table.

          RRRIP!

          Johnny is now in the room with them.  Observing.  The Man
            carefully cuts his meat, his eyes continually watching
          her through the mask.

                        Eat. 

          Erica awkwardly picks up her fork.  There's a BEAT as she
          notices the steak the knife across the table from her. 
          Could she use it as a weapon?  Could she attack him from
          here and get away?  She contemplates her move, then decides
          to eat.  The Man suddenly FIXATES on the corner of her
          mouth.  Her lipstick seems to be a little off.

                                        MASKED MAN

                        What? 

          His tone suddenly dark and angry as he sets down his knife
          and fork.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Why is it so hard for you to
                          understand?  Why can't you see

          He picks up her plate and SMASHES it against the wall. 
          She cowers from the debris coming off the wall.

          She notices the steak knife clatter down on to the floor
          a few feet away.  She isn't sure if, in his rage, her
          masked captor is aware of just how close she is to it.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Look at yourself! 

          He forces her to look into a small hand-held mirror. 
          She's crying and trembling as she stares back at herself
          in the reflection.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Does that look pretty?  Do you

                        you?!  Answer me!

          She's trying not to lose it completely, as she eyeballs
          the knife beneath her.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        You're just like the others. 
                        Imperfect.  Flawed.  Disgusting.  

 But she still has an eye on that knife.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Stop your blubbering.

          She seizes the opportunity and grabs the knife off the
          floor, spins and LASHES out at him, ripping the mask off!

          But to our surprise it's JOHNNY SMITH underneath the mask.

          There's a DESPERATE STRUGGLE as he fights the knife out
          of her hand and forces her back into the seat.

                                        ERICA
                        I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.

                                        JOHNNY/MASKED MAN
                        I show you kindness and this is
                        how you repay me.

                                        ERICA
                          I didn't see anything... I would
                        never say anything to anybody. 
                        Ever.

          He considers her for a moment.

          He steps around behind her, out of her sight.

          When he is REVEALED again, he's wearing the mask and Johnny
          appears again as an OBSERVER. 

                                        ERICA

                        this time.  I promise.

          He picks up the plastic bag filled with cosmetics and
          dumps the contents on the table in front of her.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        I'm afraid our lessons are over. 

          He gently touched her face from behind, the suddenly,
          he slips the PLASTIC BAG quickly over her head.  The
          CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY OFF HER as we HEAR her MUFFLED

          Walt and Johnny talk just outside of Walt's office.

                        And you have no idea if what you
                        saw is Erica's future or her past?

                        No, but either way we can't stop

                        There's nothing about this guy
                        that feels remotely familiar.  He
                        takes his victims and then lets
                        them go.  He dresses them up and
                        tears them down.  It's crazy.

                        And now you tell me he's crossed
                        the line.  That he's killed this
                        girl.  Or he's going to, if we
                        don't stop him.  Hell, I'm not
                        even sure where to begin.

          Johnny stares through the window into Walt's office at
          Linda and gets an idea.

                        My name is Sarah Bannerman.  I
                        got your address from the Sheriff's
                        department -

          The woman's cold detachment suddenly becomes apprehensive
          concern.

                        Phone's out of order and I've

                                (beat, warmer)
                        I know what this is.  I told the
                        man my car's been in the shop.

                                        SARAH

                        It's hard to hunt for a job without
                        one.  I only need another few
                        days to make things right.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sorry, are we talking about
                        the same thing?

                        I'm here about Erica.

          The woman's demeanor shifts again -- hard and cold.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sorry to be the one to tell

          The woman moves to close the front door.  Sarah puts her
          hand up to stop it.

                                        SARAH

                          daughter is in trouble.

          The woman holds herself still for a moment, then looking
          Sarah straight in the eyes...

                        I got no daughter.  Not for nearly

          She shuts the door, leaving Sarah quietly stunned and
            confused.


  6161EXT. "GAS CITY" TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

              A gas/food/lodging/weigh station.  Walt, Johnny and Linda
          step out of the car and smell something bad. 

                                        WALT
                        What's that smell?

                        Not the blue plate special, I
                        hope.

          Linda has a specific, but subtle reaction to it.

                                        WALT
                        Take my coat inside.  I'm gonna
                        show the picture around... see if
                        anybody recognizes her.

          Linda watches intensely as Walt drops his car keys into
          his jacket pocket and hands it to Johnny.


  6262INT. RUSTIC DINER - NIGHT

          Johnny and Linda sit at a booth drinking coffee.  Linda
          has a sandwich she hasn't touched.  The diner is filled
          with late-night truckers and night owls.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not eating.

                        Mind if I ask you a personal
                          question?

                        Why did you change your mind and

                        Do you have any idea what it's
                        like to have your life torn in
                        half?  To measure every second of

                          Surprisingly, I do.  Why take
                          yourself back there again? 

          She considers the question...

                        I want to see the look in his

                        or ever will happen to you from
                        that point forward.  In some ways
                        you could say that my life began
                        and ended while I was with him.

                        Lye.  To make the soap.  The
                        factory is 'bout 10 miles up the
                          mountain.  It's been closed for
                        nearly three years, but you can
                        still smell the lye when the wind
                        kicks up.

          Linda suddenly spills her coffee breaking the moment.

                                        LINDA
                        I'm such a klutz.  Is there a
                          bathroom?

                        hub cap.

          Linda gets up as Johnny uses napkins to clean up the spill. 
          She hesitates and looks him in the eyes.

                                        LINDA
                        I'm very sorry.

                        It was just an accident.

          She considers him a beat, then moves away.  Johnny has a
          strange feeling about the moment, but shakes it off and
            continues to help wipe up the spilled coffee.          DEAD ZONE: "THE COLLECTOR" - ACT THREE - 1/11/05 - GOLD   38.

          Dinner table.  Erica.  It's exactly the way Johnny saw it
          before.  Mascara runs down her cheeks.

          QUICK FLASHES that take us through the DINNER SPILLING,
          the PLATE FLUNG AGAINST THE WALL, the ATTACK WITH THE
          KNIFE and to the end, where he DUMPS OUT THE CONTENTS OF
          THE PLASTIC BAG, the items FROZEN IN MID AIR.  These are
          the very moments leading up to her murder.

                        That's what everybody calls him. 
                        Don't know his real name.  He's
                        caretaker.  Personally, I don't
                        know why anybody'd want to live
                        up there cut off from civilization.

                        I saw this guy, this Mister Sudz. 
                        He was here picking up food.  The
                        same food I saw on the table when
                        Erica was killed.

          The SOUND of a heavy CLUTCH draws Walt's attention to an
          18-wheeler about to pull out of the parking lot.

          Walt rushes out of the diner and blocks the path of the

  7373EXT. SOAP FACTORY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

          Metal gates closed, but not locked.  KEEP OUT -- NO
          TRESPASSING signs all around.  Across a weed strewn parking
          lot stands the silent behemoth, the massive soap factory. 
          250,000 plus square feet of production, packaging, business
          offices and assorted rooms and chambers.  The ideal place
          to keep another human being captive.

          Walt and Johnny jump down out of the cab of the big rig,
          as the truck powers away up the dark mountain road.

          They come around the corner to FIND Walt's cruiser, the
          driver side door is open.  Walt quickly checks the car.

          Johnny and Walt ease into the darkness of the building. 
          There's just enough moonlight filtering in through a set
          of giant skylights to allow them to see, but not enough
          to allow them to see everything.  They both carry
            flashlights.

                        me.  I'm not going to stand here
                        and do nothing.

          Walt can tell he's serious.

                                        WALT
                          Alright, but I want you to take

          Walt pulls his gun out of his holster.

                        I don't do guns.  Besides, I might
                        shoot you by mistake.  How would
                          I explain that to Sarah and JJ?

          It's dark.  Creepy.  Johnny sweeps on the flashlight beam
          across some old, rusted machinery.  There're numerous
          vats and canisters marked FLAMMABLE and EXPLOSIVE.  He
          steps up to a large metal vat and shines the light down
          into it.  It's an old lye filter used to manufacture soap. 
          It's now crusty and stinks badly.  A fire hazard.

          He notices another door with light coming from underneath
          it.  He shuts off the flashlight, instead holding it like
          a weapon and reaches for the door knob.

          Before he can react, Linda introduces the butt of the

                        this.  I don't completely
                        understand it myself.

          She steps forward into the light, as Johnny's senses clear. 
          She looks different.  Her hair down (she's wearing the
          wig).  Her face made up.  She looks surprisingly glamorous. 
          Just like in his previous visions (Scene 46).

                        When this is over, I want you to
                        tell them it was you who came to
                        me.

          There's a weird look in her eyes, like she's found some
          strange sense of inner peace.

                        You opened the door to feelings
                        I'd forgotten.  Emotions I'd pushed
                        out of my memory.

          She turns on a portable cassette player.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Linda, listen to me.  What you're
                        going through, it's not your fault. 
                        It's called Stockholm Syndrome.

          She begins to become agitated.

                        You don't understand...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It happens to people who've been
                        kidnapped.  They begin to
                        sympathize with their abductor.

                        It happened to Patty Hearst.  To
                          prisoners of war.

          She MOVES QUICKLY towards him with the shotgun leveled at
          him, her hands trembling and her eyes burning.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's going to hurt you.  Maybe
                        worse.

          Linda turns as we see the Man in the Mask standing behind
          her.

          Linda steps towards the Masked Man, dropping to her knees
          as he reaches down and slips his hand around her throat.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        Why did you come here?

          She looks up at him, her breath visible in the cold air. 

                                        LINDA
                        For you.  I came for you.

          It's exactly like the vision Johnny had replaying itself
          in the present - with a whole new meaning.  Linda hands
          him the shotgun.

                                        LINDA
                        Please.  Give me another chance. 
                        I'll be what you want.  I can be
                        exactly what you want.

          A TRAIN WHISTLE is heard blasting in the b.g.

                        This can't be what you want.

          She looks away, as the Masked Man begins to get more
          aggressive.

                        You have no idea what she wants.

          Johnny notices dinner on the table - a tray of food, two
          lit candles.  He realizes that Erica's last meal hasn't
          been served yet, meaning she's still alive.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about Erica?  Is this what
                        she wants?  To be killed by some
                        lunatic so afraid of the world
                        that he lives his life hiding
                        behind a cheap plastic mask.

                        I know you.  I know your mother
                        was never good enough.  I know
                        your father demanded perfection. 
                          Something she could never give
                        him.  Neither could his little
                        boy.

          The eyes behind the mask widen slightly...

                                        MASKED MAN
                        How could you know...

                        Now you search for that perfection
                        in the faces of these women you
                        take.
                                (eyeing Linda)
                        Then you throw them away like
                          garbage.

          The Masked Man cocks the shotgun.

                        Get down on your knees.

          Johnny hesitates.  Linda seems suddenly concerned.  Johnny
          eyes the tray full of food, the candles burning.

                                        MASKED MAN
                        I won't tell you again!

          Johnny knows it's now or never, as he suddenly grabs a
          glass of wine and flings it into the guy's face.  He rushes
          him, driving him back against the wall.  They fight as
          they smash into the propane tank, knocking it off the
          counter onto the floor.

          Johnny and the Masked Man struggle, as the mask is ripped

          feels the cold metal of the shotgun pressed against his

                        let this one go.  I've seen it
                          before...

          Walt looks at Johnny and knows that he's up to something.

                                        WALT
                          Alright, everybody just relax.

          Walt slowly lowers his gun down.  Johnny sees the flames
          reach the propane tank.  Linda is about to notice it like
          she did before, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is it worth it, Linda?

          And instead of seeing the impending explosion, she looks
          over at Johnny.

                                        LINDA
                        You don't understand.

          In that instant, she notices the broken propane tank
          EXPLODE.  Only this time, she can't push the guy away and
          he takes a full frontal blast from the tank.

          He SCREAMS as he reaches up and covers his face.  Walt
          tries to get to them, but the FLAMES ARE TOO INTENSE.
          Linda and the Unmasked Man quickly vanish through the
          flames into the darkness of the factory.  Walt tries again,
          but Johnny grabs him by the arm --

          The fire now consumes most of the apartment.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let them go.  The factory is full
                        of chemicals.  We have to get to
                        Erica before the whole place comes
                        down.

                                        WALT
                        I spoke to her.  She's locked up
                          somewhere underneath us.

          And they quickly exit the burning room.

  9797EXT. SOAP FACTORY - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

          OUTSIDE.  Walt, Johnny and Eric duck behind Walt's cruiser
          just as there's a HUGE EXPLOSION and the structure begins
          to implode. 

          Johnny looks around, but Linda and the Unmasked Man are
          nowhere to be found.

          The SHOT PUSHES TIGHT on Johnny's silent anguish, his
          eyes lit by the burning factory.

          The photograph of Erica.  The SHOT PANS OFF the screen as
          the real Erica sits in the Sheriff's office with a blanket
          around her shoulders.  Sarah is with her.  She gets up
          and walks out to join Walt and Johnny.

                                        WALT
                        She alright?

                                        SARAH
                        She doesn't want to go to the
                          hospital and she can't go home.

          Sarah is clearly upset by the situation.  Johnny shoots
          him a look, as --

                        Ya know, we've got that spare
                        room.  I could drag that day bed
                        in from the garage.  The mattress
                        is practically new.

                                        SARAH
                        We could do that.  She'll need
                          somebody to take care of her for
                        awhile.

                                        SARAH
                        A week -- ten days tops.  I still
                        think she can turn her life around,
                          I really do.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How could she miss with somebody
                        like you?

                                        WALT
                        I just hope there's enough of you
                        to go around.

          Sarah can't help but smile as she moves back in to where
          Erica is sitting.

                                        WALT
                        What about Linda?  What could
                        drive somebody to want to go back
                        to something like that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe for her the alternative was
                        worse.  We all need to feel like
                        we matter.  Even if it's just the
                        pain.

                        I've got people up there sifting
                        through the debris.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's the chance of anybody
                          surviving that kind of explosion.

                                        WALT
                        Not very likely.

          Walt walks away as Johnny turns to look in at Sarah as
          she comforts Erica.

          An old truck is the only vehicle on a dark, lonely highway.


  100100INT. TRUCK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Linda drives, the Unmasked Man sits in the passenger seat. 
          His face bandaged and bloodied.  She reaches across to
          touch his hand, as the taillights vanish out of sight.
