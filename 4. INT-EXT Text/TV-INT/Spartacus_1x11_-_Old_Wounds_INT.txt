  VARRO'S DEAD BODY lies on a table. Splattered with dried 
  blood. His FATAL WOUND an angry accusation. REVERSE TO FIND

  SPARTACUS

  standing at the foot of the table. The pain and guilt over 
  his part in ending Varro's life cloud his eyes. Sleep has 
  obviously evaded him. His knuckles are raw and cracked, and 
  he bears the scrapes and shallow cuts from his "exhibition" 
  match in episode 110. PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS as he flashes to 
  snippets of

  HIS FIGHT WITH VARRO (ALREADY SHOT)

  at the party for the Magistrate's son Numerius from episode 
  110. Blows are exchanged. Varro inflicts a shallow cut 
  across Spartacus' lower right side. Spartacus counters, 
  defeating Varro. NUMERIUS gives the thumbs down. Spartacus 
  plunges his sword down into Varro's chest, wrenching 
  Spartacus back to the present.

                                          DOCTORE (O.S.)
                      It is never an easy thing.

  DOCTORE appears. Spartacus' eyes remain fixed on Varro.

                                          DOCTORE
                      To see a friend once loved, now 
                        absent breath.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He should yet walk. With that 
                        foolish grin, and dreams of a life 
                        beyond these walls.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Every night breaks. And we must all 
                        wake.

  Spartacus grimaces, his hand dropping to the shallow wound 
  on his lower right side, inflicted by Varro.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would the gods turn back the 
                        sun... and set me in his place.

  Batiatus stands by the pool, considering the statue of

  Batiatus sees the storm brewing within Spartacus. He nods in 
  agreement, seeking to abate it.

  OFF BATIATUS, ever the master manipulator...



  Hector escorts Spartacus back to the ludus. A silent beat, 
  broken by Hector.

                                        HECTOR
                      It is regretful, what happened to 
                        Varro. I saw in your eyes how you 
                        craved to defy order of his death.

  Spartacus doesn't respond. Hector's eyes flash with hatred.

                                          HECTOR(cont'd)
                        A shame you did not attempt it.

  Spartacus darkens, but as they round a corner his attention 
  is drawn to

  A CHAMBER

  where a naked Aulus is being plied with oils by two SLAVE 
  GIRLS. RAMP UP TO SLOW MOTION AS WE PASS. Slave Girl #1 is 
  topless, standing behind Aulus, her hands sensually 
  caressing the villain's flesh. SLAVE GIRL #2 (clothed) sinks 
  to her knees in front of Aulus, her hand stroking

  THE SMOOTH, UNBROKEN SKIN

  OF HIS RIGHT SIDE (NO SCARS). She glances up as Spartacus 
  passes -- it's MIRA. Her eyes flash with shame. Spartacus 
  takes in the sight, numb to it as his passing WIPES US TO --



  BEDLAM ensues as the Gladiators fight to get a look at the 
  list of matchups for the upcoming games (similar to scene 13 
  in Episode 103). Duro grabs the parchment from a man's hand. 
  Disgusted by what he reads.

                                        DURO
                        Goat-fuck! I knew it!

  Agron snatches it from him, scans it, grins.

                                        AGRON
                        Why do you fucking bleat? You fight 
                      at my side, brother!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        Like a suckling babe. I would prove 
                        myself alone.

  Crixus snatches the list from Agron.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And die the same.

  Duro glares, moving off with Agron. Crixus eyes the list. 
  His face falls as he realizes he isn't on it. He angrily 
  thrusts the list at Rhaskos. Rhaskos scans it with a frown, 
  showing it to Hamilcar.

                                          RHASKOS
                        What do the markings say?

                        That you are fucked.

  They pass Spartacus, who is looking very much the worse for 
  wear. Sweat beads his skin as a SLAVE scrapes him down.

  AGRON

  eyes him as he begins oiling and scraping (being a lower 
  man, no slaves attend him).

                                        AGRON
                        Our Champion does not look to form.

                                        DURO
                        The gods punish him.

                                        AGRON
                        For what offense?

                                        DURO
                        You fucking jest. Varro's blood, 
                        still wet upon his hands?

                        His hands were removed from choice. 
                      If he had not done as commanded --

                        And who would see to your brother's 
                        family?

  Spartacus' voice booms as he rises, sweat coursing down his 
  pale skin. The bath goes quiet as he gets in Duro's face, 
  pissed and wild-eyed. Crixus watches with fixed interest.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        What answer do you give, Duro? With 
                        both of you dead, who would see to 
                        his wife?! His fucking child?!

  Duro stammers, confused.

                                        DURO
                      My brother has no wife or child.

  But Spartacus isn't listening anymore. His heart seizes in 
  his chest as he spots

  DEAD VARRO

  gazing at him sadly from the bath's entrance. Splattered in 
  blood. His fatal wound still fresh and weeping. He turns and 
  exits.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Wait... Wait!

  Spartacus starts after him, shoving others out of the way as 
  he exits. Crixus laughs, calling out to the men.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Fucking Thracians.

  Muted chuckles. OFF CRIXUS, wondering if Spartacus' 
  instability offers opportunity...



  Spartacus moves through the corridors in SLOW MOTION. He 
  catches maddening glimpses of Dead Varro as he pushes his 
  way past men gambling and laughing. He rushes after him, 
  bursting outside into --                                                                                    12.



  TIGHT ON A SACK, as it is lifted from MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS' 
  head. He blinks, face battered, eyes adjusting to the light. 
  Batiatus looms over him. Aulus and ASHUR lurk in the 
  background.

  Batiatus glares, removes his foot from the Magistrate's 
  neck. He gestures to Ashur and Aulus to right the chair. The 
  Magistrate coughs and sputters. He locks eyes with Batiatus, 
  defiance flaring.

                        Will he be able to fight against 
                        Pompeii?

                      He burns with fever. Miracle if he 
                        lives to the games.

  Batiatus constricts, the Magistrate's words of warning 
  echoing in his mind.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Provide a list of what is needed. 
                        Ashur heads to market, and will see 
                      it filled. Let not a moment pass 
                        with Spartacus unattended. Fetch 
                        Mira from the Villa if you need 
                        assistance. He has some feelings 
                        towards the girl. Her touch may aid 
                      in his recovery. Our champion 
                        cannot fall.

  Batiatus sweeps out into --



  Doctore follows Batiatus.

                        The crowd will turn upon me when 
                        they learn Spartacus does not

                        Perhaps they will be appeased by 
                        suitable replacement.

  OFF the proclamation...



  TIGHT ON NAEVIA, half hidden by the shadows, reacting in 
  surprise.

                                        NAEVIA
                        The primus?

  WIDEN TO REVEAL Crixus in the pantry with her, flush with 
  excitement.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                        Mine! Batiatus at last remembers my 
                        worth. I shall take the sand again. 
                        And see it turn red with the blood 
                      of Pericles!

  Naevia glances out beyond the gate, worried Crixus will be 
  heard.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You must soften your words. We will 
                      be discovered.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Let them discover us. Tonight, I am 
                        a god! And I will reclaim my title 
                      as Champion of Capua...

  He pulls her into a kiss. He breaks off, sensing something 
  is wrong.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)

                      It fills my heart with joy, to see 
                        you so alive.

                        The Primus is a fight to the death. 
                        You have been absent the arena for 
                        many months. If Pericles --

                                        CRIXUS
                      He will not.

                        How can you be certain?

  He takes her in with a reassuring smile, filled with love 
  and desire.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Because I will never leave your 
                        side. Death itself will tremble if 
                      it attempts to part us.

                        Tomorrow when I claim victory, I 
                        will look to you in the pulvinus. 
                        The moment shall be ours alone.

  Crixus pulls Naevia into a kiss. She responds, melting into 
  him. He slips off her dress, the fall of the fabric WIPING 
  US TO --



  Spartacus violently convulses, unconscious, the fever 
  consuming him. Medicus tries to force a cup of LIQUID down 
  his throat, but Spartacus is thrashing too much.

                                          MEDICUS
                        Fucking hold him down!

  Mira drops a compress, rushes over to assist. Medicus pours 
  his concoction into Spartacus' mouth. Spartacus sputters and 
  chokes, begins to calm. SLOW PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS' FACE. His 
  eyes suddenly SNAP OPEN. PULL BACK to reveal we are now --



  A DOZEN or so GLADIATORS scrape down after a long day of 
  training. Crixus sneers at Spartacus in contempt.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Lick my hole. The pig-fucker's 
                        still alive.

  Duro, Agron and the other men chuckle. An ATTENDING SLAVE 
  oils Spartacus and begins to scrape him. The Slave brushes 
  Spartacus' wound. Spartacus grimaces, glancing down to see






                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

  THE SKIN SURROUNDING HIS WOUND

  curling up at the edges. He gingerly peels the inflamed 
  flesh back, revealing a glimmer of GOLD within the wound. 
  SPARTACUS'

  eyes widen in dawning horror as he opens the wound further 
  and GOLD COINS drop from within it. The coins strike the 
  ground, the sound huge in the stone room. The men LAUGH. 
  Spartacus looks up, shocked to see

  CRIXUS

  as a Slave scrapes his chest, the skin peeling back to 
  reveal SOLID GOLD below its surface. Crixus flashes a manic 
  grin.

  SPARTACUS

  stares in horror, tears his eyes from Crixus to see Agron, 
  Duro, and the rest of the men also being scraped down to the 
  GOLD beneath their flesh. SHEETS OF SKIN drift to the 
  flagstones at their feet like strips of curled parchment.

                                        DEAD VARRO (O.S.)
                        This is what you are to him.

  Spartacus looks to the Attending Slave, is stunned to see 
  him replaced by Dead Varro.

                                        DEAD VARRO
                        Gold, mined from blood and meat.

                                        DIANA (O.S.)
                        All hail Spartacus.

  Spartacus turns to find a WOMAN approaching, dressed like 
  Ilithyia from their sexual rendezvous in episode 109. THE 
  MASK OF DIANA stares at him, cold and impassive.

                                        DIANA
                        Slayer of the Shadow. Bringer of 
                        Rain.

                                  chest)
                        Champion of the Romans...

  BLOOD leaks from the corner of her mouth, staining the 
  pristine mask. Spartacus reaches for it with a trembling 
  hand. He pulls it away, screams as the BLOOD SPLATTERED FACE 
  OF DEAD SURA is revealed (Note: Sura's blood and injuries 
  should match the end of episode 106).


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

  Spartacus SCREAMS, back arching in a rigid convulsion as he 
  thrashes. Mira and the Medicus struggle to lash his arms and 
  legs with LEATHER STRAPS. His HOWLS OF AGONY echo as we 
  SMASH TO --



  Ashur moves down a corridor by the flickering light of an 
  OIL LAMP. He enters into --



  Ashur stops short. Aulus sleeps against the wall. The 
  Magistrate sits slumped in his chair, his head covered with 
  the burlap sack.

                                        ASHUR

                        cunts.

  Aulus stirs, irritated.

                        Place foot on me again, and find 
                        yourself once more a cripple.

                                        ASHUR
                        You know the stakes we deal. If 
                        Calavius were to escape --

  Aulus rises.

                                        AULUS
                        Fuck your mouth closed. The man has 
                        not stirred.

  Ashur holds the lantern up, peers at the Magistrate. Slumped 
  over. Lifeless. Ashur tenses, his heart catching in his 
  chest.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

                        Shit...

  Aulus pulls the sack from the Magistrate's head. His eyes 
  are closed, SPITTLE snaking from his mouth. Aulus leans 
  down, ear close to the Magistrate's face to catch signs of 
  breath.

                                        ASHUR
                        This is on you. I will share no

  A beat as Aulus listens. He breaks into a relieved smile, 
  glancing back to Ashur.

                                          AULUS(cont'd)
                      He breathes. I told you the man was 
                        still alive --

  The Magistrate's eyes suddenly slam open as he attacks with 
  a snarl, SINKING HIS TEETH INTO AULUS' NECK. Aulus shrieks.

                                        ASHUR
                        Aulus!

  Ashur rushes forward, tries to pull Aulus away. For a 
  moment, it's a tug-of-war. Finally, with a SICKENING RIP, he 
  tears Aulus free. Aulus screams, clutching his bleeding 
  neck.

  THE MAGISTRATE

  spits out a hunk of BLOODY FLESH, eyes alight, BLOOD running 
  down his chin, laughing.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

  Aulus snarls, unleashes his fists on the Magistrate. Blood 
  and teeth fly.

                        Aulus, enough! Aulus!

  Ashur pulls him back. The Magistrate groans, barely 
  conscious. Aulus breathes hard, his hand going to his neck.

  Ashur holds the lamp up, inspects the wound. It isn't 
  pretty.

                        Two of them. Very large. Go.

  Aulus exits. Ashur turns to the Magistrate, troubled. His 
  eyes fall to a BLOOD STAINED SIGNET RING on the Magistrate's 
  finger. OFF ASHUR, weighing the consequences of what he's 
  been commanded to do...



  Crixus paces like a caged animal. Doctore stands at the 
  gate, looking out at the empty arena.

  CLOSE ON CRIXUS, stone-faced but unable to mask his hurt 
  pride from the crowd's reaction. Doctore glowers.

                        who their true champion is.

  A proud look from teacher to student. Crixus gathers 
  himself, pulling on his helmet as he steps out into --



  TIGHT ON A BLEEDING WOUND. WIDEN TO REVEAL Medicus applying 
  a bandage to Aulus' neck.

                                          MEDICUS
                        What was the fucking cause?

                        A dog, soon to be put down.

  Medicus grunts, pinches some POWDER into a cup of wine.

  Aulus knocks it back with a grimace, stretches out on the 
  table. Medicus stifles a yawn, barks to Mira tending to 
  Spartacus across the room.

                                          MEDICUS(cont'd)
                        I need food and a few hours sleep. 
                        Come for me if his condition 
                        changes.

  Mira nods and Medicus exits. Mira wrings out a wet cloth, 
  gingerly places it across Spartacus' fevered brow. OFF her 
  concern...



  Aulus lies on a table, pale and unconscious. BLOOD seeps 
  through the bandage on his neck. Mira frowns at him as she 
  passes with a basin of fresh water, not caring for the 
  memory of his hands on her. She kneels beside

  SPARTACUS,

  gently wipes his fevered brow with a cool compress. As she 
  moves to wring it out his eyes flicker and slowly open. He 
  blinks, painfully adjusting to consciousness. POP WIDE to 
  REVEAL we are now in --



  Dark. Empty. No sign of Mira or Aulus. Spartacus sits up, 
    disoriented. FILTERED MOONLIGHT falls through the barred 
  windows. A LIGHT WIND blows DEAD LEAVES through the doorway. 
  The Infirmary appears LONG-ABANDONED, shelves of scrolls and 
  clay jars shrouded with DUSTY COBWEBS.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  weakly)(
                        Medicus...?

  He is answered only by the WIND. He coughs, starts to rise, 
  freezes. He's no longer alone. Someone now lies on the 
  center table (where Varro's body rested in scene 1), covered 
  by a


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

  PRISTINE WHITE SHROUD

  that rises and falls with each breath. Spartacus stares in 
  mute dread. His hand reaches out to pull the shroud back, 
  but before he can the figure beneath STOPS BREATHING.

  SPOTS OF BLOOD BLOSSOM

  on the fabric, SOAKING THROUGH AND GROWING. Spartacus steels 
  himself and yanks the shroud back, revealing

  DEAD THRACIAN SPARTACUS,

  his throat hacked open from the killing wound Spartacus 
  inflicted in the arena (in Episode 107). Spartacus stares in 
  horror and confusion.

                                        DEAD SURA (O.S.)
                      He was so beautiful...

  Spartacus whips his eyes over to the doorway, shocked to see 
  Dead Sura. Though pale, she is no longer the blood-drenched 
  horror show from his last nightmare. She wears her Thracian 
  dress from episode 101.

                                        DEAD SURA
                        Why did you kill him?

                                  welling with tears)(
                        I had no choice. A man must accept 
                        his fate --

  Spartacus turns back to Thracian Spartacus, only to discover 
  that it's now DEAD VARRO on the table. Dead Sura is suddenly 
  right beside Spartacus.

                                        DEAD SURA
                      Or be destroyed by it.

  Spartacus begins to break down, wracked by guilt.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Is this my path? Blood and death?

                                        DEAD SURA
                        You have always been destined for 
                        unfortunate things...

  She gently kisses him. He slowly responds, the tears 
  staining his cheeks as he loses himself in the kiss -- until 
  BLOOD BEGINS LEAKING FROM BETWEEN THEIR PRESSED LIPS. He 
  pulls back, horrified to discover he's now in --                                                                                    40.



  Dead Varro dressed as Hector escorts Spartacus (now in his 
  subligaria) back to the ludus (replaying scene 6). 
  Spartacus' attention is drawn to

  A CHAMBER

  where a naked Aulus is being plied with oils by two SLAVE 
  GIRLS. Slave Girl #1 is topless, standing behind Aulus, her

  THE SMOOTH, UNBROKEN SKIN

  OF HIS RIGHT SIDE (NO SCARS). She glances up as Spartacus 
  passes -- only now it is DEAD SURA (no blood) dressed as 
  Mira from before. Her eyes flash with pain and regret.

                                        DEAD SURA
                        Tend to the wound.

  Spartacus stares in confusion -- then finally understands, 
  his eyes locking onto Aulus' side where he was supposed to 
  have been cut open protecting Sura. There is no scar, no 
  blemish, no trace of the injury. The wound was a lie.

  SPARTACUS SCREAMS

  as Aulus (now dressed as he was at the end of 106) suddenly 
  stabs Dead Sura (also dressed from 106) in the chest. As the 
  blade sinks into her flesh, SMASH TO --



  Spartacus bursts awake, the scream lingering on his lips. 
  Mira, startled, tries to calm him.

                                        MIRA
                        I am here. Be still...

  Spartacus tries to get his bearings, eyes wild, the leather 
  straps restraining him.

                        The fever has broken. The gods have 
                        blessed you...

  Spartacus' eyes fall on Aulus, still asleep in his Henbane-
  induced haze. A grim smile bends Spartacus' parched, cracked 
  lips.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Yes. They have.

                        I will fetch Medicus.

                        Wait. Release the straps.

                        I would speak to this man. Alone.

  Mira eyes Aulus, not understanding -- nor liking the tone in 
  Spartacus' voice.

  ON MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS, slumped in his chair, unconscious, 
  sack over his head. A beat. DIM LIGHT floods the chamber as 
  we adjust to find Ashur appear with a torch, Solonius at his 
  side in the mouth of the chamber.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Calavius --

  He starts forward, but Ashur stops him, hearing the sound of 
  MEN approaching.

                                        ASHUR
                        Wait. They approach!

                        No, it is too late.

  Ashur panics, turns to flee. Solonius grabs his arm.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Steel your fucking nerve!

                        and Capua the world he left behind!

  He wrenches free, dropping his torch as he scurries off into 
  the darkness.

                        Ashur!

  He is gone. Batiatus' approach echoes in the distance. 
  Solonius hustles over to Calavius, whipping out his dagger.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)

  As he begins cutting the Magistrate's blood-soaked ropes...

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  RAMP TO SLOW MOTION as Numerius leads the way through the 
  dank cisterns. Behind him Batiatus subtly nods to Hector and 
  his Guards. They unsheathe their swords, unnoticed by 
  Numerius.



  Solonius finishes cutting the Magistrate loose (still in 
  SLOW MOTION). The Magistrate tumbles from the chair, the 
  sack over his head dislodging as he hits the ground. 
  Solonius' eyes widen with horror as he sees

  THE MAGISTRATE IS ALREADY DEAD,

  eyes open but unseeing, his THROAT SLIT.

                                        NUMERIUS (O.S.)
                        Solonius!

  Solonius spins, RAMPING US BACK TO NORMAL SPEED. Numerius 
  stands in the entrance with Batiatus and his armed Guards. 
  Solonius glances down at the knife in his hand, slick from 
  the blood on the ropes. He is officially fucked.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

  Batiatus' men rush forward. Solonius makes a break for it, 
  slashing at the Guards with his knife. Hector catches him 
  hard across the face with the pommel of his sword. Solonius 
  smashes to the ground, dazed, spitting blood.

  NUMERIUS

  rushes to his dead father, the tears flowing as he cradles 
  his gory remains.

                                        NUMERIUS

                      We shall see him avenged. Solonius 
                        will suffer for what he has done.

  Solonius spots Ashur emerging from the shadows behind 
  Batiatus' men, a smile bending his lips. As if he had always 
  been there.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And all of Capua will know him for 
                        the shit that he is.

  Solonius looks up at Batiatus through the blood and pain as 
  the realization slams into him that his enemy just set him 
  up. WHAM! Batiatus brings his foot down on Solonius' face, 
  directly at CAMERA, SMASHING US TO BLACK.



  TIGHT ON AULUS' ROBES as they are roughly torn open. WIDEN 
  TO REVEAL an unsteady Spartacus standing over the 
  unconscious man, searching his torso for the injury received 
    "protecting" Sura. There is NO SIGN OF A SCAR, the skin 
  smooth and unbroken. Aulus' hand suddenly shoots out, 
  grabbing Spartacus' wrist.

                                        AULUS
                        What are you doing?!

  Spartacus locks eyes with the groggy Aulus.

  A tense beat. Aulus knows he's in trouble. He suddenly 
  surges up.

  But Spartacus is on him, his arm constricting around Aulus'

                        Who spoke the words that took her 
                        life? Who?!

  Tears stain Spartacus' face. Aulus gasps, blood from his 
  injured neck flowing.

                                        AULUS
                                  a harsh whisper)(
                        Batiatus... It was Batiatus...

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

  Spartacus' eyes blacken with pure, primordial rage as he 
  tightens his grip. Blood pours from Aulus' mouth. He 
  convulses, lies mercifully still.

  SPARTACUS RISES,

  drained and shattered by the revelation that his life has 
  been a lie, perpetrated by a man he had come to trust. He 
  barely registers Mira, now standing horrified in the 
  doorway.

                                        MIRA
                        What have you done?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Help me restore him upon the table.

  She hesitates, moves to comply.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        You will secure my straps again... 
                        and never speak of this.

  They heave Aulus' body onto the table. As it crashes down --

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:
