Over a DARK SCREEN we see the caption:
"This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space,
which nevertheless was real" - Colin Clark.
Then, FADE UP ON:
Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH
arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited
crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop
to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER:
COMMENTATOR
"Returning to England are
Britain's acting royalty Sir
Laurence Olivier and Lady
Olivier, better known as stunning
Gone With The Wind star Vivien
Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a
new string to his bow with the
announcement that he is to direct
and star in a screen version of
Terence Rattigan's stage play The
Sleeping Prince with none other
than Hollywood siren Marilyn
Monroe. When the world's greatest
actor romances the most famous
woman alive, we can be sure that
sparks will fly. Now, now Lady
Olivier, don't worry - any
romance is strictly for the
camera!"
As OLIVIER and VIVIEN smile for the photographers, we -
CUT TO:
It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark
family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting
sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,
complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling
of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something
profoundly English.
We are a very long way from Hollywood.
CUT TO:
COLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he
is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a
beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak
doors.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2.
The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle.
COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in
the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but
racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her
attention fully to him for the first time.
JANE
Now go and have a lovely time,
darling. We're always here when
you're ready to talk your future.
COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out
JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house
with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.
JANE
Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook
and ask her how many pork chops we
need for tonight. Then bring the
car round. I must get to the
village before the shop shuts...
She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an
afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes.
COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house.
We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly
his need to get away.
He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of
the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun,
the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for
the road ahead.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 3.
CUT TO CREDITS OVER A MONTAGE OF SCENES OF LONDON
IN THE 1950s FROM COLIN'S POINT OF VIEW. AS HE
MAKES HIS WAY INTO THE CITY WE SEE THE STATUE OF
EROS AGAINST THE LIGHTS OF PICCADILLY CIRCUS,
CROWDS MILLING AROUND TRAFALGAR SQUARE, YOUNG
PEOPLE SPILLING OUT OF CLUBS AND COFFEE BARS IN
SOHO, UNTIL, WE FADE TO:
A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside.
It is early morning in the heart of London's West End. The
streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and
raincoats stream from the tube stations.
COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in
Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home
here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes
by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in
measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave.
COLIN waves back.
CUT TO:
Checking his watch he runs the last few yards then stops
outside the imposing facade of 144 Piccadilly. A plaque
outside the door announces: LAURENCE OLIVIER PRODUCTIONS.
Colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure
everything is correctly in place, then goes to the door and
rings the bell.
CUT TO:
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 4.
COLIN arrives early, ready for another day.
COLIN has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol
sports car. He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring
around its circumference. He taps his pencil thoughtfully
as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that
Olivier gave him. He inhales deeply, thinking, then
grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his
foot.
CUT TO:
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 13.
COLIN pulls into the drive of Tibbs Farm, a charming
English cottage.
CUT TO:
COTES-PREEDY, the owner, clearly has a very high opinion of
Tibbs Farm. Aloof and snobbish, he stands by the front
door, looking down his nose at COLIN.
COTES-PREEDY
Out of the question. I can't have
a lot of awful film people
tramping through the house in
dirty boots.
COLIN
We'd pay a hundred pounds per
week for 18 weeks.
COTES-PREEDY
My wife would never agree.
COLIN
That's a pity. I'll have to tell
Miss Monroe to look elsewhere,
then.
COTES-PREEDY double takes.
COTES-PREEDY
Marilyn Monroe?
COLIN
(NODS)
She's making a film with Sir
Laurence Olivier. The Sleeping
Prince. From the play by Terence
Rattigan.
COTES-PREEDY
I saw it in the West End a couple
of years ago. Vivien Leigh was
marvellous.
COLIN
It's Marilyn Monroe in the film.
COTES-PREEDY smiles transparently.

COTES-PREEDY

I suppose I'd have to be
introduced..?

ARTHUR JACOBS, Marilyn's publicist, is a close-cropped,
pugnacious figure in his mid-forties. He waits impatiently
outside Olivier's office, a stack of newspapers under his
arm. COLIN comes hurrying up, smiling brightly.
COLIN
Good morning, Mr. Jacobs. I hope
you had a pleasant flight.
JACOBS
Where's the fucking car?
CUT TO:
JACOBS sits in the passenger seat of Colin's Bristol sports
car reading his stack of newspapers. After a moment he
grunts in disgust.
JACOBS
Jeez, do you Brits actually read
this stuff?
He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot
out into the lane. The pages billow out in a great cloud
behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows
and on neat front lawns.
COLIN gapes in astonishment. Welcome to Hollywood.
CUT TO:
JACOBS slouches out of the house, magnificently
unimpressed. COTES-PREEDY follows him proudly with COLIN at
his side. JACOBS takes a long, unimpressed look at the
property.
JACOBS
What is this place? A brothel?
COTES-PREEDY's face falls.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 14A.
COTES-PREEDY
It's one of the best houses in
the area.
JACOBS
Jesus. And I thought you Brits
had taste.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 15.
He glances at COLIN.
JACOBS (CONT'D)
Is this the best you can do?
COLIN
It's very near Pinewood.
JACOBS
All right. We'll take it. (Pause)
But ditch the wallpaper. It's
given me a migraine.
CUT TO:
Pinewood studios is the glamorous heart of the British film
industry. COLIN drives up to the gate and smiles at the
SECURITY MAN.
COLIN
Colin Clark. Sir Laurence Olivier
Productions.
CUT TO:
ACTORS in full costume walk past, TECHNICIANS move lights
and cameras, EXTRAS are herded to their scenes by harried
ASSISTANT DIRECTORS. COLIN takes it all in with wondering
eyes. To him the studio is a magical place.
CUT TO:
ORTON and COLIN hurry through Pinewood.
ORTON
Where are you staying?
COLIN
My father's place in the Albany.
ORTON
You can forget that. Lesson Three.
The Third always stays nearby, not
in some bloody palace in London.
(Pause) Book a room at the Dog And
Duck down the road. It's a bit
rough but you'll get used to it.
He grins, enjoying himself.
ORTON (CONT'D)
Now make yourself useful. Marilyn
needs a bodyguard. Sort something
out.

MARILYN MONROE walks down the steps of a TWA jet on a rainy
London day. She clutches a bouquet of flowers and wears
DARK GLASSES;

her raincoat is slung loosely over her shoulders. Her new
husband ARTHUR MILLER walks a step or two behind her,
wearing a light summer jacket.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 22.
MARILYN and MILLER walks across the tarmac towards the
terminal and the crowd of PRESS waiting for them.
REPORTER
There she is! Marilyn!
The REPORTERS surge forward. COLIN follows their collective
gaze. She looks exactly as she should. The radiant smile, the
platinum blonde hair, the sexy wiggle. The most famous film
star in the world, so much herself it is almost unreal.
Walking through the crowd MARILYN smiles easily, whereas
MILLER looks stern and a little dazed by the sudden flurry of
attention. Flashbulbs pop as the POLICE struggle to contain
the crowd. MARILYN puts her arm around MILLER, who grins
blankly. The flashbulbs burst in front of them, a solid wall
of dazzling light.
REPORTER (CONT'D)
Marilyn! Over here, Marilyn!
REPORTER 2
Marilyn, this way..!
ARTHUR JACOBS observes the chaotic scenes with obvious
relish, grinning towards ROGER and COLIN.
JACOBS
Beautiful. You're looking at
tomorrow's front page, boys.
ROGER looks at COLIN.
ROGER
We have to get them to the hall.
COLIN barges his way through the scrum behind ROGER and
briefly finds himself directly in front of MARILYN. For a
moment he is transfixed by her beauty and charisma but she
doesn't even see him as she follows the commanding ROGER
obediently, tugging Miller along behind her, leaving Colin in
her wake.
CUT TO:
39 DELETED 39
A convoy of cars pass through the throng of JOURNALISTS
waiting at the gate. Marilyn's "secret" hideaway is no
longer much of a secret. The classical old house is elegant
and luxurious.
Outside the front door MARILYN, MILLER, OLIVIER and VIVIEN
have their picture taken by the official PHOTOGRAPHER.
ROGER watches unobtrusively.
VIVIEN
Are all your press conferences
like that, darling?
MARILYN
Well, that was quieter than some.
Vivien smiles at the wry joke. ARTHUR JACOBS watches the
proceedings with an eagle eye.
JACOBS
Okay, let's get a snap of the
newlyweds. Smile, Arthur. It's
not a firing squad.
As the group breaks up, MILTON GREENE, handsome and dark-
haired, now approaches OLIVIER and COLIN.
MILTON
This is some place you found.
He glances at the house. Olivier smiles generously.
OLIVIER
You have my new assistant Colin
to thank for that. (Pause, he
shepherds COLIN over) This is
Milton Greene. You must be very
nice to him. He owns half of
Marilyn Monroe Productions.
MILTON
Forty nine per cent, Larry.
GREENE (34) offers them a tired smile.
OLIVIER produces one of his branded packets and offers a
cigarette to Milton.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 25A.
OLIVIER
Have a cigarette.
MILTON
I don't smoke.
If he notices the "Olivier" name he doesn't show it.
OLIVIER looks mildly put out.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 26.
OLIVIER
Milton - Marilyn and rehearsals.
Let's talk.
MILTON
Sure. And the studio wants a new
title.
OLIVIER escorts Milton away.
MILLER and MARILYN are now being photographed on their own.
ROGER moves over to JACOBS and murmurs discreetly in his
ear. JACOBS nods and moves in to end the session.
JACOBS
The boys at the gate are getting
restless.
MILLER
Let's give them two minutes and
then we're done.
ROGER waves to the POLICEMEN, who open the gates. The PRESS
come pouring in like a mob of revolutionaries storming the
Bastille.
CUT TO:
COLIN notices Marilyn grip Miller's hand tightly as the
flashbulbs pop all around her. A moment later he is
surprised to find VIVIEN at his elbow.
VIVIEN
Marvellous, isn't she? I suppose
you're quite smitten.
COLIN looks at her shrewdly, sensing he is being tested.
COLIN
She's all right. A bit common.
VIVIEN
(LAUGHS)
Larry fell desperately in love
with her in New York. He's
determined to seduce her.
COLIN
But she's only been married three
weeks.
VIVIEN
Oh, Colin, I thought you were a man
of the world.
She gives him an arch smile and leans in intimately.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27.
VIVIEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Of course, Larry would never leave
me. (Pause) But, if anything were
to happen, you would let me know,
wouldn't you?
COLIN
I'm sure he loves you very much.
There is a flash of sudden anger in her expression.
VIVIEN
Oh, don't be such a boy!
COLIN looks shaken and she touches his hand in contrition.
VIVIEN (CONT'D)
At least you still adore me,
don't you?
COLIN
Of course. Everyone does.
There is a wintry bleakness in her face for a second.
VIVIEN
I'm 43, darling. No one will love
me for much longer. Not even you.
He goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his
lips, her smile quickly restored.
CUT TO:
The Dog and Duck is a rundown pub in an out of the way lane
near the studios. It is a rough, local place utterly devoid
of glamour or comfort. COLIN stands outside, staring at it
grimly, his bag in his hand.
CUT TO:
First light over Pinewood Studios. Although it is August it
is chilly so early in the morning. COLIN stands by the gate
wearing only his thin summer jacket. He blows on his hands
to keep warm. A black car appears. The window winds down
and DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE pops her head out.
SYBIL THORNDIKE
How kind of you to meet us. Dear
me, you do look cold.
COLIN
They're ready for you in make-up
Dame Sybil.
SYBIL THORNDIKE
How exciting! Don't you love the
first day of a new production?
COLIN
I don't know, Dame Sybil. I've
never had one before.
DAME SYBIL gazes at him with wistful sadness.
SYBIL THORNDIKE
Oh, to be young again!
She blows him a kiss and the car rolls in through the gate.
Almost immediately OLIVIER's chauffeur driven Bentley
appears.
OLIVIER
Marilyn here yet?
COLIN
Not yet.
CUT TO:
COLIN looks anxiously down the empty road. DAVID ORTON
strides towards him angrily.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 35.
ORTON
What the fuck's going on? I
thought you had a contact in her
house.
COLIN
I do...
ORTON
Well bloody use him, then.
CUT TO:
ROGER greets COLIN on the doorstep with a grin.
ROGER
She hasn't come down yet. Neither
has Miller. They're playing
trains.
COLIN stares at him blankly.
CUT TO:
Colin's Bristol is drawn up in a quiet suburban road lined
with pleasant semi-detached houses. Lucy's house has a neat
patch of front lawn, a stolid family car in the drive and
net curtains in the windows. It is very little different
from any of its neighbours.
CUT TO:
As he walks down the path, COLIN pauses. He looks around at
the uniform semi-detached houses all around him. He is
uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his
parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he
and Lucy are from very different worlds, and walks to his car
with an uneasy sense of relief to be getting away.
CUT TO:
COLIN is back on the early morning watch. A black car draws
up and SYBIL THORNDIKE leans out.
SYBIL THORNDIKE
Colin, dear, I thought you looked
cold so I bought you this.
She hands him a bright red woollen scarf. COLIN is touched.
COLIN
Thank you, Dame Sybil.
SYBIL THORNDIKE
Film sets and rehearsal rooms are
the coldest places on earth.
He smiles as her car drives away. He wraps the scarf around
his neck and looks up and down the road again.
CUT TO:
It is very quiet in the normally busy West End. Shops have
begun shutting after lunch and the city is rapidly
emptying. SHOPPERS wander past, taking little notice of
MARILYN who has her hair covered in a scarf and wears dark
glasses. MILLER walks at her side, holding her hand. She
glances at MILTON with an awkward laugh.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 52.
MARILYN
Gee, it's quiet.
COLIN
It's Saturday. Early closing. But
they're expecting us.
She stops to window shop. MILTON lowers his voice to COLIN.
MILTON
No one's recognised her.
COLIN
At least she can shop in peace.
MILTON
Marilyn's a star. Stars don't
even pee alone.
He looks around anxiously. But then a PASSER-BY suddenly
narrows his eyes and takes a second look. His face lights
up and he shouts -
PASSER-BY
It's Marilyn Monroe!
MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is
surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A
feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come
running to look, pushing and shoving to see.
MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin
with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the
cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press
towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it
becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream
Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face.
A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back
against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on
her face.
ROGER
My God, she'll be torn apart...
MILLER
Get her out of here.
COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what
they can to keep the excited fans at bay.
They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open
and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is
pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around
her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the
front, with Milton running alongside the moving car to dive
in beside Marilyn.
People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in
violent hysteria.
MILTON does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 53.
MILTON
Jeez, Marilyn, they really
fucking love you.
As COLIN looks in the rear-view mirror he sees MILLER shaking
his head in dazed horror as MARILYN slumps half-collapsed
into the seat beside him.
MILLER
Madness. Someone's going to get
hurt.
COLIN shifts his gaze to her in the mirror and his eyes
meet Marilyn's. He sees - or imagines - a terrible sadness
before she quickly replaces her dark glasses.
CUT TO:
COLIN draws up outside Marilyn's house. The place is dark
and quiet.
CUT TO:
COLIN, muffled in his scarf, looks up as Marilyn's car
cruises to a halt at the gate.
COLIN
Good morning, Miss Monroe.
She is hunched in the back, her hair in a scarf, her face
protected by her large sunglasses with PAULA by her side.
She doesn't look up.
CUT TO:
As COLIN walks down through the studio he meets RICHARD
WATTIS with PAUL HARDWICK, on their way to wardrobe. WATTIS
winks at him.
WATTIS
Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.
Larry will get jealous.
HARDWICK
You can say that again.
He gives a camp laugh. COLIN tries to shrug it off with a
lightness he doesn't feel.
COLIN
Nothing happened.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63A.
WATTIS
You were in there for ten minutes
at least. Plenty of time for a
kiss and a cuddle.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 64.
COLIN
Paula was with us the whole time.
WATTIS
The mind boggles, dear.
COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to
see LUCY nearby. She has heard every word of the exchange.
CUT TO:
Early morning. COLIN sees Olivier's black Bentley cruising
towards the gate. VIVIEN LEIGH sits in the back seat.
VIVIEN
Hello, Colin darling. You look
like Horatio defending the
bridge. Are you going to let me
in?
CUT TO:
There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks.
MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the
path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical
closeness.
MARILYN
I didn't know it was so pretty
out here.
COLIN
You should get out more. See the
sights.
MARILYN
I am the sights.
She giggles again, her mood lighter.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
Look at us. We're just like
Elsie and the young King. What
would Sir Laurence say if he
could see us now?
COLIN
I don't think he'd mind.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76.
MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a
friendly way as they walk.
MARILYN
I wanted to be an artist. To
grow as an actor. I was so proud
to be working with the great
Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks
I'm the enemy.
She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.
COLIN
He doesn't understand your kind
of actor. He's hated the method
ever since Vivien worked with
Elia Kazan. It's all too new and
strange. You're the future, and
it frightens him.
MARILYN
Every time I walk into the studio
I feel this sense of doom come
over me. He looks at me like
he's smelling a pile of rotten
fish. And the crew hate me.
Paula is the only person I can
trust. (Pause) Except for you
now, maybe.
She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses
swim as he stares into them...
... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.
ROGER
Phone call for you, Miss Monroe.
It's Mr. Miller.
MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing
back briefly at Colin.
MARILYN
Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for
telling me the truth.
COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises
that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.
ROGER
You'll be leaving now, I expect.
CUT TO:
MILTON turns bitterly on Colin as soon as they are outside
the studio door.
MILTON
Listen, kid, I've known Marilyn
for seven years. I fell in love
with her, just like you've done.
COLIN is about to protest but MILTON ignores him.
MILTON (CONT'D)
We had ten days together and that
was it. She picked me up, she put
me down. That's what she does.
She breaks hearts. She'll break
yours. My advice to you is to
quit before you get burned.
COLIN
I don't need your advice. And I'm
not in love with her.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 80.
MILTON
Okay, have it your way. (Pause)
You don't see Marilyn again, you
don't even talk to her. She is
completely off-limits to you. Got
it?
CUT TO:
The studio is quiet at the weekend. COLIN walks along,
snatching a moment for a cigarette. As he reaches the doors
to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside
him. ROGER SMITH is at the wheel.
ROGER
Get in.
COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and
MILTON emerges. He glances darkly at COLIN and ROGER.
MILTON
Any problem, Roger?
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 82.
ROGER
Just dropped by to take Colin out
to lunch.
COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his
cigarette and hurries to the passenger door.
MILTON
You're not taking him to Marilyn?
That would drop us all in a whole
ocean of shit.
ROGER
Oh, no, sir.
MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat.
MILTON
What do you have in there?
ROGER
Just a picnic. We've been looking
forward to it, haven't we, Colin?
COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON
frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave.
MILTON
Okay, well, have a nice time boys.
Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER.
COLIN
Is she okay?
In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the
blanket in the back.
MARILYN
SURPRISE!
COLIN
Oh, Jesus -
She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty.
MARILYN
Roger and I decided to take you out
for an adventure. Didn't we Roger?
ROGER
(PAINED)
Indeed we did.
COLIN
Oh, God. If Milton sees me with
you... I'll be sacked...
He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back
gleefully.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 83.
MARILYN
No one can sack you, Colin. (Pause)
Except me, of course.
She pats the seat next to her.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
I don't like being on my own in the
back.
Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running
back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.
MILTON
What the hell?
He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries
herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over
into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and
the car roars off.
MILTON (CONT'D)
(SHOUTS)
Colin! Get back here, you little
bastard! You're fired! Do you hear
me? Fired!
COLIN winces. ROGER looks at him sympathetically. MARILYN
emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing.
MARILYN
Do you think he saw me?
COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back
seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away. She scoots up to
make room for him.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
Snuggle up. This is fun.
She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands
meshed together.
ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his
eyes.
In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches
the car speed away.

COLIN and MARILYN walk barefoot in the grass of Windsor
Great Park while ROGER leans on the bonnet of the parked
Wolsey, holding shoes, socks, and sandals.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 84.
There is no one else around. The wind sighs and the grass
is pleasantly warm underfoot. MARILYN turns her face up to
the sun.
MARILYN
This is how I ought to feel every
day.
COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
Let's run away together.
He turns ashen.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
(LAUGHS)
Just kidding.
She looks around happily. COLIN smiles at her.
COLIN
We have today, anyway. One day to
do whatever we like. We can go
back to real life tomorrow.
MARILYN
Only one day?
COLIN
Well, maybe the weekend.
MARILYN
Or a week?
He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his
side.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
What shall we do?
COLIN
We could go to Windsor Castle, if
you like.
MARILYN's face breaks into a smile of pure delight.
CUT TO:
The car makes its stately progress down the magnificent
drive towards the castle.
CUT TO:
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 85.
ROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to
the castle. There are two uniformed POLICEMEN on duty.
ROGER nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of
their own.
ROGER
Detective Chief Superintendant
Smith. I'm escorting this lady
and gentleman for the day. They'd
like to look around the castle.
As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen.
POLICEMAN
Christ, is that..?
He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles.
ROGER
Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors,
is it?
POLICEMAN
(After a second)
Does she know anyone here, sir?
We need to write down a contact
name in the book.
ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn.
ROGER
You don't know Her Majesty, by
any chance?
MARILYN
We met at a movie premiere. She
said my dress was pretty.
POLICEMAN
I'm not sure that quite...
COLIN
(INTERRUPTING)
My Godfather works here. He's the
Royal librarian, Sir Owen
Morshead.
The POLICEMAN looks sceptically at Colin's casual clothes.
POLICEMAN
Name?
COLIN
Clark. Colin Clark.
The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on
the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 86.
COLIN (CONT'D)
My father knows everybody.
A moment later the policeman returns, looking surprised.
POLICEMAN
He says to go straight up the
hill, sir. You'll be met at the
door.
CUT TO:
COLIN and MARILYN emerge. A small crowd of POLICEMEN,
SERVANTS and CASTLE WORKERS has gathered. There are cheers
as they see her. COLIN looks nervously at MARILYN but she
smiles and winks at him, mocking herself gently.
MARILYN
Shall I be "her"?
She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out,
shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn
"look". The delighted crowd bursts into cheers. COLIN
stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a
star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be
leaving with him. One of the spectators turns to him.
SPECTATOR
Are you somebody, mate?
COLIN
(SMILES)
I'm no one.
COLIN stares at MARILYN. She catches his eye and smiles,
just for him. He feels like he's tumbling into the abyss,
but no longer cares.
Roger's car pulls up outside Eton College.
CUT TO:
COLIN and an astonished MARILYN walk through the school
buildings with ROGER a discreet distance behind them.
MARILYN
This isn't a school, it's a
palace!
COLIN smiles.
COLIN
Eton is 500 years old. It was
founded by King Henry VI.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 89A.
MARILYN
It's like walking through history.
COLIN
Take that room up there.
They stop as COLIN points up at a window.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90.
COLIN
That's where the boys were sent
if they didn't work hard enough.
Where we were whipped.
MARILYN looks at him in shock.
MARILYN
Whipped?
COLIN
Beaten.
She looks appalled.
MARILYN
I'd never send my kids away.
(pause) How long were you here?
COLIN
Five years. But I was sent to
boarding school when I was eight.
MARILYN
Why?
COLIN
That's what we do in my family.
She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly.
MARILYN
It seems to me that you've had most
things pretty easy.
COLIN
In one way, yes. But when you're
brought up in a house of over-
achievers, it's hard to make your
own mark.
She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.
MARILYN
So how are you going to do it?
COLIN
Maybe it will be in films, but if
not, there are so many
possibilities out there.
MARILYN
Sounds pretty good to me.
She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness.
We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different
and deeper level.
But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns
the corner in his Eton uniform.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90A.
He looks up at MARILYN, his mouth hanging open in shock. Then
he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice.
SCHOOLBOY
Marilyn! It's Marilyn Monroe!
CUT TO:
MARILYN and COLIN are swamped in a joyous mass of Eton
students. MARILYN smiles, waves, pouts, even kisses one boy
on the cheek. Cheering BOYS hang out of every window.
MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into
the crowd to rescue her. COLIN follows after them with
difficulty. MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave
goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys.
MARILYN
Work hard, boys! I don't want
anyone whipping you!
A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily.
BOY
You can whip me anytime, Marilyn!
MARILYN laughs in delight. There are cheers as COLIN
escorts her away.
CUT TO:
ROGER leans back against the car, smoking calmly.
CUT TO:
After the riotous excitement of the Eton schoolyard the
peace and quiet of the river. MARILYN rushes along the
sandy bank. The water glitters magically.
MARILYN
Hurry up, slow poke.
COLIN
But we haven't got any...
He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her
blouse and throwing it off carelessly.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 91.
He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her
clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed
behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and
MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water.
MARILYN
Oh my gosh! It's freezing!
CUT TO:
MARILYN swims in the water, humming softly to herself.
COLIN wades in, wincing at the cold. She laughs.
MARILYN
This is great.
COLIN
What if a boat goes past? We
could be arrested.
MARILYN
Don't worry. Roger will fix it.
Oh, darn it...
She holds her head and he looks at her with concern.
COLIN
What's wrong?
MARILYN
I have something in my eye.
He swims across to her, very aware of her naked body under
the water. She holds her head up to him.
COLIN
I can't see anything.
MARILYN
Get closer.
She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and
suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before
he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
That's the first time I've kissed
anyone younger than me. There's a
lot of older guys in Hollywood.
She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self-
conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats.
Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the
shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances
away, embarrassed.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 92.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
Don't be shy, Colin. It's nothing
you haven't seen before.
COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his
erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
Oh, Colin! And you an old
Etonian!
He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering
as she tries to dry herself. COLIN goes to take her in his
arms.
COLIN
Let me warm you up.
She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He
rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only
barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes
more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than
rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her
CLOSER -
MARILYN
Don't spoil it.
She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
I want this to be the perfect
date.
He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently,
her expression wistful.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
I haven't had a real date since I
was 13 years old.
She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo
of a lost childhood.
He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.
As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans
forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as
sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.
The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching
gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine
behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him
with a radiant smile.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
That was nice. I don't get kissed
much.
She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 93.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
Okay, what do we do now?
COLIN looks at her, knowing it is time to return to the
real world but reluctant to face it. There is a discreet
cough and ROGER appears.
ROGER
Time to go home, I think, Miss
Monroe.
She smiles, a little sadly, then gets up, walking past him
as she puts on the rest of her clothes. ROGER averts his
eyes respectfully and waits for COLIN. The two men look at
each other for a second.
ROGER (CONT'D)
Be careful not to get in too
deep, son.
COLIN knows he isn't talking about the river.
CUT TO:
A seething MILTON is waiting on the steps as ROGER parks
the car. COLIN looks at him nervously. MARILYN looks at him
then gets out, glancing at Milton indifferently.
MARILYN
Hi Milton.
She smiles sweetly.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
Next time I come on set, you
better make sure Colin is there.
He looks at her in shock then bitterly at COLIN.
MARILYN (CONT'D)
(TO ROGER)
Take him home.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 94.
She waves briefly to Colin, nothing more than a flutter of
her fingers. COLIN watches her all the way up the steps
until she disappears inside.
CUT TO:
MILTON is waiting for COLIN at the door.
MILTON
Marilyn's not well.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 95.
COLIN
But she was wonderful yesterday.
MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his
hostility in barbed politeness.
MILTON
I don't know what you did to her,
kid, but she got nervous. I had
to give her some pills to calm
her down.
COLIN
She doesn't need pills! She just
needs someone to care for her.
MILTON
Someone like you?
COLIN reddens. MILTON shakes his head patronisingly.
COLIN
I told you, I'm not in love with
her!
MILTON
You kissed her.
COLIN
She said that?
MILTON
Spare me the bullshit. I know
everything.
COLIN stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth.
MILTON (CONT'D)
You messed her up, kid. Confused
her.
He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded.
MILTON (CONT'D)
I've got every penny I ever made
tied up in Marilyn. She owes me.
If it wasn't for me she'd still
be on contracts that make slave
wages look good. I gave her back
her freedom, and now Miller's
turning her against me. That's
what you get for trying to help
Marilyn Monroe.
He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking
more in sorrow than anger.
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 96.
MILTON (CONT'D)
If you want to play with the
grown-ups, Colin, start learning
the rules.
CUT TO:
ROGER and COLIN drive up. MILTON, waits on the steps. He
looks resentfully at COLIN but doesn't say anything.
CUT TO:
ROGER and COLIN carry a ladder across the moonlit gravel
and prop it up against the wall.
ROGER
That's her window.
He points with his torch. The window is open. COLIN shins
up the ladder while ROGER holds it.
COLIN
I'll open the door once I'm
inside.
CUT TO:
COLIN races up the road and arrives panting at the gate a
few seconds before OLIVIER's car swings into the entrance.
The great man leans out of the back window.
OLIVIER
Morning, boy. (Pause) Christ, you
look rough.
He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs.
OLIVIER (CONT'D)
Let me know when Marilyn arrives.
If she ever does.
COLIN
Oh, I'm pretty sure she'll be in
this morning.
OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look.
CUT TO:
COLIN walks CONNELL to his car, their feet crunching on the
gravel.
CONNELL
Well, goodnight then.
COLIN holds the door open as he gets in.
COLIN
Was she really pregnant?
CONNELL
I think that's a private matter
between Mr and Mrs. Miller.
He looks at COLIN with cool disapproval, then closes the
door and drives off. COLIN stands watching, shivering in
his shirtsleeves.
CUT TO:
The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens
the car door for MARILYN.
MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles
and says lightly:
COLIN
What's that for?
MARILYN
That's for being on my side; and
remember, when you see me wink,
that's for you.
ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.
ROGER
(glancing at COLIN)
Looking a couple of inches taller
than when I first saw you.
ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well
done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he
watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.
BARRY
Was that really Marilyn Monroe?
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117B.
COLIN
No - just a good friend of mine.
BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring
at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it
drives into the English countryside.
FADE TO:
COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat
dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is
little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and
down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.
We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.
155A
ESTABLISH the luxurious exterior of Marilyn's comfortable
Brentwood house.
