      ANNE JUERGENS is cleaning up the kitchen, putting a few things
      into generic plastic containers, when her daughter, AMY,*
      enters the back door, wearing the jacket to her band uniform,
      jeans, and carrying her French horn in the case.*

                                  ANNE
                    I'm happy you're home, I was worried
                    that you had marched over a cliff*
                    or something. Your dad went back to*
                    the office, he dropped your sister
                    off at a friend's house to do
                    homework.

                                  AMY
                    We had to go over a new formation
                    for halftime.*

                                  ANNE*
                    How many formations can you do in*
                    one halftime show? If that band*
                    director wants to do all those fancy*
                    precision drills that go on for*
                    hours and hours, he should go to*
                    North Korea. What is he, a communist?*

                                  AMY*
                    I don't know. But the band is getting*
                    a lot better.*

                                  ANNE*
                    Great, great. It's just that...it's*
                    a lot of hours...To be marching. I*
                    love the music, I don't get the*
                      marching.*

      Amy exits, with French horn case, into the bathroom.

                                  ANNE
                          (calls after her)
                    I made pot roast. Your favorite.*

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                          2.




      Amy opens the French horn case. Inside is a small crumpled
      brown paper bag.

                                  ANNE (O.S.)
                    You know, I could call that Kim*
                    Jong-il wannabe and complain if you*
                    want. By the time you get home, you
                    hardly have time to eat and do your
                    homework, much less have any fun.
                    You're only young once, you should
                    have a little fun.

      We see what's in the brown paper bag -- it's an early
      pregnancy test.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Anne watches the plate in the microwave spin, and spin, and*
      spin, as the anticipation builds... The microwave signals
      with a "ping."

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Standing in front of the mirror, Amy holds up the test stick.
      From her reaction, we know it's positive.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      DAY TWO

      MUSIC CUE: "GIRLFRIEND" AVRIL LAVIGNE


      UNDER CREDITS: We see our wholesome but pregnant Amy walking
      down the hallway alone in a crowd of students.

      In contrast, a sexy sixteen-year-old, ADRIAN LEE, passes by*
      her, holding onto a guy who is equally gorgeous and sexy,
      RICKY UNDERWOOD, the first percussionist in the high school*
      band, better known as "the drummer." She's got two batons in
      her right hand, she's a majorette. Amy looks over her shoulder
      at them. Adrian's arm is around Ricky's waist, okay, lower
      than his waist, her thumb is parked in the left hip pocket
      of his blue jeans, which is holding two drum sticks.

      Amy stops at her locker, as we focus on three fifteen-year-
      old students walking together past her -- two guys and a
      gal, BEN BOYKEWICH, HENRY MILLER, and ALICE VALKO. The three*
      have a freshman look about them. Alice and Henry are holding
      hands. They stop, lining up at three lockers. Henry nods to
      Ben. Ben looks down the hall.

      A bouncy, beautiful blonde fifteen-year-old cheerleader,
      GRACE BOWMAN, passes by them going in the other direction.*
      She is walking with a guy in a football jacket, JACK PAPPAS --*
      tall, dark and very handsome for sixteen. Grace waves goodbye
      and blows Jack a kiss as he turns down another hallway. Ben
      and Henry have almost lost consciousness watching her until
      they feel Alice staring at them.

      Amy is shuffling through her locker when her two best friends,
      LAUREN TREACY and MADISON COOPERSTEIN walk to either side of*
      her and lean against the lockers. Lauren is fifteen, tall*
      and sophisticated, very poised, she studies dance. Her hair
      is slicked back in a ponytail. Madison is shorter than the
      other two, cute, freckled face. END CREDITS.

      END MUSIC

      The noise of the hallway rises to a comfortable level.

                                    MADISON
                          (to Amy)
                    We saw him.

                                  AMY
                    Who?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                          4.

                                  LAUREN
                    Who?

      Amy draws a blank. Lauren looks at her.

                                  LAUREN
                    Marc Molina.

      Amy looks at them, still doesn't know.

                                    MADISON
                    The new counselor. The new, single,*
                      delicious, counselor.

                                  AMY
                    Oh.

      Madison and Lauren exchange a look.

                                    MADISON
                    Oh? That's it? You've got something
                    more exciting than Marc Molina?

      Amy looks at them.

                                  AMY
                    I had sex.

      They both gasp, then like runners out of a gate, the words
      fly:

                                  LAUREN
                    No you didn't!

                                    MADISON
                    With who?

                                  LAUREN
                    You couldn't have!

                                    MADISON
                    How was it?

                                  LAUREN
                      Impossible.

                                    MADISON
                    Back to who.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      ANOTHER ANGLE:

      Adrian is leaning up against a locker while Ricky, leaning
      on his right hand, is right in her face.

5CONTINUED: (2)5

                                  RICKY
                    So when are you going to quit teasing
                    me, Adrian, I'm hurting here. The
                    past two nights have almost killed
                    me. I can't take the stop and go,
                      especially the stop.

      She looks at him.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Aw, that's too bad.

                                  RICKY
                    No kidding, that's not good for a
                    guy. It's unhealthy. Dangerous even.
                    I heard of a guy who had to go to
                    the hospital for that. Permanently
                    damaged him, he's like sterile or
                    something now.

                                  ADRIAN
                    I told you I don't do it on the
                    first date. Or the second.

                                  RICKY
                    We've been out on more than a couple
                    of dates.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Just dropping by my house when my
                    mother's not home is not a date.

                                  RICKY
                    I'll take you somewhere, tonight's
                    the third date.

      She smiles.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Fine then. Tonight.

                                  RICKY
                    What time tonight?

                                  ADRIAN
                    Any time you like.

                                  GRACE (O.S.)*
                          (very close to them, and
                            perky)
                    Hi.

      They turn, it's Grace, the cheerleader. Adrian rolls her
      eyes.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                          6.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Hi Grace.

      Ricky is suddenly not leaning toward or even looking at
      Adrian, he's looking at the cheerleader.

                                  RICKY
                    That's a really nice name. Grace.

                                  GRACE
                    Thank you.

      She sees Adrian glare at Ricky, then Adrian turns to her.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Can we help you with something?

                                  GRACE
                    I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
                      interrupted, I just saw the two of
                    you over here and thought maybe
                    you're going to the game together,
                    and I wanted to invite you both
                    over to the Youth Fellowship Hall
                    at our church for a postgame
                      celebration.

      Adrian stares at her, is she kidding? Grace continues.

                                  GRACE
                    With the gym being repaired, you
                    know there's nothing at school, so
                    we thought we'd try to invite
                    everyone to our church. We have a
                    gym. In the Youth Fellowship hall.

      She sees the look on their faces.

                                  GRACE
                          (smiles)
                    There won't be a sermon, I promise.
                    Just music and dancing and we always
                    have really good food. And it's
                    free. To everyone.

                                  ADRIAN
                    We'd love to, but we can't. My mom's
                    out of town, so we're going to my
                    house and drink beer and have sex.

      Adrian walks away. Grace looks at Ricky, he smiles.

                                  GRACE
                          (laughs)
                    She's so funny, isn't she?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                          7.*

                                  RICKY
                    Funny?

                                  GRACE
                    Well, I'm sure she didn't mean that,
                    she was just trying to shock me.
                    And it worked. But really, could
                    you come? You and Adrian can bring
                    anyone you want, as many people as
                    you want, everyone's welcome.

      Ricky looks directly into her eyes.

                                  RICKY
                    Will you be there, Grace?

      She smiles and exits. Ricky reaches out to a passing student,*
      JOE.*

                                  RICKY*

      he nods walking past her.

      He stops.

                    Yeah.

      He puts out his hand for a hand shake.

                    I'm Mr. Molina.

      She takes his hand, holds onto it, while she looks at him.

                    Mister?

      He doesn't understand.

                    call you Mr. Molina, do you?

      He pulls his hand away.

                                  MARC
                    Yes, I do.

      Marc reacts, what?*

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      ANOTHER ANGLE:

      Ben is watching Ricky chatting up Grace, as Henry is helping
      Alice stack her books in her rolling book bag.

                                  BEN
                          (referring to Ricky)
                    I hate that guy. I hate him. Look
                    at him. Now he's hitting on her.

      Alice stands up.

                                  ALICE
                    Why are you so obsessed with Grace
                    Bowman?

      Ben looks at Henry. Alice looks at Henry.

                                  ALICE
                    Okay. Why are you so obsessed with
                    Grace Bowman?

      Ben and Henry look at her.

                                  BEN
                    Because she's Grace Bowman. She's a
                    goddess.

                                  ALICE
                    She's not a goddess, she's a
                      Christian. You are not a Christian.

                                  BEN
                    I would become a Christian if I
                    could have Grace Bowman.

                                  ALICE
                    If by "have" you mean, "have sex
                    with," that would be impossible.
                    She doesn't have sex. She's not
                    going to have sex until she's
                    married. Especially with you.

      She turns to Henry.

                                  ALICE
                    Or you.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        10.

5CONTINUED: (7)5

      She turns back to Ben.

                                  ALICE
                    Even if you became a Christian.

                                  BEN
                    Why wouldn't she have sex with me
                    if I became a Christian?

                                  ALICE
                    Because you're you. And...*
                          (mimicking him)
                    "She's Grace Bowman, she's a
                    goddess."

                                  BEN
                    What are my chances of getting laid
                    with someone who's not going to
                    wait until they're married?

                                  ALICE
                      Twenty-five percent of guys your
                    age are having sex.*

                                  HENRY
                    Guys?

                                  ALICE
                    He's a guy, isn't he?

                                  HENRY
                    Well, he's not looking for a guy.
                    What do you know about fifteen-year-
                    old... gals?

                                  ALICE
                    Twenty percent. And I appreciate*
                    your obvious avoidance of the word
                    "girls."

                                  BEN
                      Encouraging.

                                  ALICE
                    Maybe not. Twenty-nine percent of
                    sexually active fifteen to seventeen-
                    year-old girls have partners three-*
                    to-five years older.*

                                  BEN
                    Alright, well, I've got to start
                      somewhere. Where do you think I
                    should start?

      She looks around the hall.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        11.

                    Maybe there.

      She indicates Amy.

                                  BEN
                          (nods)
                    Who's that? She's kind of cute.

                                  ALICE
                    Her name is Amy, she plays French
                    horn, she's in the band, she's smart,
                    she's nice and she might be desperate*
                    enough to go out with you.

                                  HENRY
                    No one's that desperate.

      Ben looks at him.

                                  BEN
                    You want to bet?

                                  ALICE
                          (to Henry)
                    Why does it have to be a bet?

                                  HENRY
                    Why not?

                                  ALICE
                    Because one, you always lose, and
                    two, it objectifies Amy who is a
                    person and not a horse, and three,
                    because winning is an obsession
                    with Ben and he will stop at nothing.

      Ben looks at Henry, smiles. Henry nods. The guys shake hands.

                                  HENRY/BEN
                    It's a bet.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      Madison and Lauren are looking at Amy.

                    You have to give us more than, "one

                                  AMY
                    It was nothing.

                                  AMY
                    It was... not that great.

      Madison and Lauren look at each other.

                                    MADISON
                    And by not that great, you mean?

                                  AMY
                    I wasn't even sure it was sex, okay?

                                  LAUREN
                    Why not?

                                  AMY
                    I didn't exactly realize what was
                      happening, and then, it was like
                    over in two seconds. And it wasn't
                    fun, and it certainly wasn't like
                    you see in the movies, all romantic
                    and stuff.

                                  LAUREN
                    Maybe it wasn't sex, maybe you had
                    like a really bad dream and you
                    just think you had sex.

                                    MADISON
                    Yeah, or maybe it was a really bad
                    guy that you had really bad sex
                    with. Come on, who was it?

                                  AMY
                    He doesn't go to this school, it
                    was a guy I met at band camp.

      A quick glance toward Ricky makes us think she's lying, but
      Lauren and Madison don't notice.

                                  LAUREN
                    I can't believe you didn't tell us.

                                  AMY
                    I'm telling you now.

                                    MADISON
                    Why are you telling us now?

      Amy looks at one, then the other, then at the floor. Lauren
      and Madison don't get it at first and then it slowly sinks
      in as we see their eyes widen.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        13.

                    You're not...?

      Amy shrugs, she doesn't know. Again, they gasp. The bell*
      RINGS.*

                                  AMY
                    That's the second bell, I have to
                    go.

                                    MADISON
                    We can't just go to school now.

                                  LAUREN
                    I have to.

                                  AMY
                    Me too. I think I'm in enough trouble
                    without skipping class. I have to
                    go.

      She walks away, leaving them in shock. They drift away
      together.

      As Amy heads down the hall looking at Ricky still talking to
      Grace, she fails to see Ben approaching. Ben stops.

                                  BEN
                    Hi. I was watching you--

                          (mumbles)
                    Hi.

      She keeps walking. As she gets closer to Ricky, she hears
      Grace talking to him.

                                  GRACE
                          (to Ricky)
                    I'm happy you're so interested in
                    the Youth Fellowship projects, but
                    I'm afraid you've made me late for
                    class. So you owe me. I'm going to
                    expect to see you and Adrian both
                    there tomorrow night, with all your
                    friends.

      She walks away. He watches her go as Amy walks closer.

      Ben is still in the same place we left him, figuring out
      where he went wrong in approaching Amy.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        14.

                    Hi. I'm Grace.

                                  BEN
                          (squeaks out)
                    Hi.

                                  GRACE
                    I was wondering if you were going
                    to the game because my church is
                    having a party afterwards at our
                    Youth Fellowship Hall and...

      He is mesmerized for a few seconds, but can't help but look
      Amy's way.

      Amy reaches Ricky but seeing he's still looking at Grace,
      she turns to go the other way. He sees her, smiles.

                                  RICKY
                    Hey you.

      She turns, her heart starts pounding -- he's actually speaking
      to her. She crosses back to him, of course, he wouldn't cross
      to her. She gets to him.

                                  RICKY
                    It's Amy, right?

      Her heart breaks -- he's not even sure who she is?

                                  RICKY
                    I'm just messing with you, kid.

      He tussles her hair, then leans in.

                                  RICKY
                    You don't think I could ever forget
                    the night we spent together at band
                    camp, do you?

      She looks at him, he smiles and walks away, and Amy is once
      again alone in the hallway filled with students now rushing
      to get to class.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Madison runs into the restroom.

                                    MADISON
                          (screams)
                    Get out! I'm going to puke!

      The three girls who are in the restroom exit quickly. Madison
      opens the door to the handicapped stall where Amy and Lauren
      are waiting. Lauren hands her a piece of paper that has tape*
      on it. Madison hands her the plastic bag and races back to*
      the door, slapping the piece of paper on it. The paper is a*
        hand-written sign that reads: OUT OF ORDER! POOP CITY! Madison*
      is talking the entire time.*

                                    MADISON
                          (breathlessly)
                    I think I broke the school record
                    for the mile. I ran all the way to
                    the grocery store and back in fifteen*
                    minutes and that's counting the
                    long weird stare I got from the old
                    lady that rang that stuff up.*

      Lauren takes three early pregnancy tests out of the bag and *
      hands one to Amy. Misunderstanding, Amy looks at her.*

                                  AMY
                    Why are you two taking a test?

                                    MADISON
                    They're for you. So I hope you drank
                    a lot of water and don't use it all
                    on the first one. We want to make
                      absolutely sure.

      Amy reacts.

                                  LAUREN
                    I think the only way to be absolutely
                    sure is if you go to a doctor.

                                  AMY
                    I don't have that kind of doctor,
                    all I have is a pediatrician.

      She opens one of the EPT boxes, looks at her two friends.

                                  AMY
                    Do you mind?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        16.

      They exit. Lauren looks at Madison and puts out her hand,
      Madison hands her a couple of bucks and some change.

                                  AMY (O.S.)
                          (from behind the door)
                    Thanks.

                                    MADISON/LAUREN
                    You're welcome.

      Madison shows Lauren that she's crossing her fingers, Lauren
      reluctantly crosses her fingers too, not counting on this
      gesture making the least bit of difference.


      Carrying their sack lunches and two cartons of milk, Jack
      joins Grace at one of the lunch tables. He immediately notices
      her hand when she reaches for her lunch.

                                  GRACE
                          (sincerely)
                    Thanks, hon'.

                                  JACK
                    What's that ring? I never noticed
                    you had a ring like that.

                                  GRACE
                          (smiles)
                    It's a promise ring.

      He stares at her.

                                  GRACE
                    My parents gave it to me when I
                    promised them I wouldn't have sex
                    until I get married.

                                  JACK
                    I know what a promise ring is, I
                    just didn't know you had one.

                                  GRACE
                    Last night. My parents and I had a
                    long talk about you and me.

                                  JACK
                    But I thought they were happy we're
                    dating. I thought they trusted me.
                    I'm a Christian. I'm as committed
                    to abstinence as you are.

                    Besides, sexual purity in or out of
                    marriage is not a one-time vow,
                    it's a daily recommitment to seek
                    God and His plan for us.

                                  GRACE
                          (smiles)
                    I know that. And my parents know
                    that, and they're happy we're dating,
                    and I'm happy we're dating because
                    you are a Christian and we do share
                      a commitment to our faith, that's
                    why I had no problem making a promise
                    to them.

      She unwraps her sandwich and takes a couple of bites, while
      he considers something.

                                  JACK
                    When do you think we'll get married,
                    if we do get married, and someday I
                    hope to marry you, in case I never
                    said that, I do hope to marry you,
                    you know, someday.

                                  GRACE
                          (laughs)
                    I'm fifteen, you're sixteen. I think
                    it's going to be a while. I've got
                    high school, college and I hope
                    medical school.

      He's counting in his head and the numbers are frightening.

                                  JACK
                    How long is medical school exactly?

                                  GRACE
                          (smiles)
                    What difference does it make? True
                    love waits.

      He nods, but we know what he's thinking as he's silently
      counting on his fingers. It's a long, long wait.

                                  JACK
                    But you don't have to be out of
                    medical school before you get
                    married, right? You could get married
                    before medical school, maybe before
                    college even.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        18.

                                  GRACE
                    Jack, we've talked about this before.
                    Lots of times. I want to be out of
                    medical school before I get married,
                    my dad waited until he was out of
                    medical school. And my mom waited
                    with him.

                                  JACK
                          (nods)
                    Okay, okay, I know.

      She looks at him.

                                  GRACE
                    Are you okay?

                                  JACK
                    Yeah, I'm fine.

      She goes back to eating, he's still thinking. He looks at
      her, leans in.

                                  JACK
                      Hypothetically speaking, not that I
                    would ever be interested, I don't
                    even know if it's a sin after
                    marriage, but I've heard that some
                    people have found that... excuse
                    me, if this sounds vulgar, but we
                    have the kind of relationship where
                    I respect you and you respect me
                    and we can talk about anything,
                    right?

                                  GRACE
                    Right. So just say whatever you
                    want to say.

                                  JACK
                          (nods, then)
                    Is oral sex allowed before marriage,
                    you know, if two people are in love
                    and committed to each other?

      She thinks about it.

                                  GRACE
                    I don't know. I'll ask my mother.

      He drops his milk carton, milk going all over him. She smiles.

                                  GRACE
                    Kidding. But you deserved that.

                    Of course it's sex. And you need to
                    keep your mind away from those kind
                    of thoughts, Jack. What is wrong
                    with you today?

                                  JACK
                    I don't know. That ring just... I
                    don't know, it made me start thinking
                    about things. You know how if you
                    tell yourself not to think about
                    something and then you can't not
                    think about that something?

      She looks at him.

                                  GRACE
                    It's called willpower.

                                  JACK
                    Pray I get some, pray I get lots of
                    it. I mean, Grace, you're a beautiful
                    girl and I'm in love with you and
                    I'm not saying I want to do anything
                    now, but... wait until after you're
                    out of medical school?

      She looks at him, smiles, squeezes his hand with both of
      hers and looks right into his eyes.

                                  GRACE
                    You're going to be fine. We're going
                    to be fine. We're going to save
                    what is meant for marriage, for
                    marriage. And it's not going to be
                    easy, but we have the love and
                    support of our families, and the
                    love and support of our friends and
                    other teens who are going through*
                    the same challenges, and with the
                    help of our Lord and savior, Jesus
                    Christ, we will make it Jack, through
                    high school, through college and
                    through medical school.

      She clutches his hand to her breast, holding his hand in
      both of hers.

                                  GRACE
                    I love you.

      She kisses his hand, looks in his face. Despite everything
      she's said, with his hand this close to her breasts, the
      blood has drained from his ears and he can't hear a darn
      thing, even Adrian saying...

                                  GRACE
                    Sure. Please. Sit down. We were
                    just leaving.

                                  JACK
                      I...uh...think I'll just sit here
                    for a minute.

                                  GRACE
                    Okay. But talk Adrian into coming
                    to our church party after the game.
                    It's Adrian, right?

                                  ADRIAN
                    Yeah.

      Grace bounces away. Adrian looks at Jack. He looks a little
      uncomfortable. Adrian smiles.

                                  ADRIAN
                      I overheard a little of that. So
                    you two, you don't...?

      He shakes his head no.

                                  ADRIAN
                      Interesting.

      She looks at him. He looks at her.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Ben is sitting at Marc Molina's desk.

                                  BEN
                            (enthusiastically
                            explaining)
                    I just want in the band. I love
                    music. I've always wanted to play
                    an instrument... and the uniforms
                    are insane -- the epaulettes, who
                    came up with those?

      Marc looks at him, smiles.

                                  MARC
                    You're not trying to get out of
                    gym, are you?

      Ben is shocked, or pretending to be.

                                  BEN
                    Gym? I would get out of gym if I
                    joined the band? What does one have
                    to do with the other?

                                  MARC
                    Both are considered physical
                    activity.

                                  BEN
                    Well, I know some students in the
                    band are engaging in a lot of
                    physical activity, the drummer,
                    others not so much.

      Marc looks at him.

                                  BEN
                    Never mind, just sign me up.

      Marc thinks about it.

                                  MARC
                    It's very admirable that you'd like
                    to learn to play an instrument,
                    however, I think you might be lying
                    about your motive. You want in the
                    band for some reason other than
                    your love of music.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        22.

                                  BEN
                          (mock aghast)
                    What! Lying? Marc, we've got to
                    talk. You're the counselor. You're
                    new here. And obviously you're new
                    at the job. Am I right?

                                  MARC
                    According to my records, you're new
                    here too, you're a freshman, right?

                                  BEN
                    Good research, you're absolutely
                    correct. Not that it makes any
                      difference, even a freshman shouldn't
                    be accused of lying. So what business
                    were you in before this?

                                  MARC
                          (clears his throat)
                    I was on Wall Street.

                                  BEN
                          (smiles)
                    So you're used to dealing with money.*
                    But not people. Especially young,
                      vulnerable, sensitive, narcissistic
                    people. You can't come into a high
                    school and tell a student you think
                    he's lying. It's bad for business.
                    You have to trust us, we have to
                    trust you, that's how this counseling
                    thing works.

                                  MARC
                    Just tell me why you want in the
                    band.

                                  BEN
                    I've been rejected by the French
                    horn player, a certain Amy something
                    or other. Therefore I've now decided
                    I'm in love with her and cannot
                    live without her. Ergo I must take
                    up an instrument and get in the
                    band. So how 'bout it? Not that I
                    don't relish the opportunity to
                    climb the ropes and jump over the
                    horses in gym, but love calls and I
                    must answer.

      Marc sits back.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        23.

                                  MARC
                    So this is all motivated by
                      rejection?

                                  BEN
                    To be perfectly honest, Marc, it's
                    all motivated by the fact that I'm
                    fifteen, I'm a virgin and if I ever
                    want to have a sex life, I have to
                    start somewhere, and my advisors
                    have advised me to start with this
                    band chick.

      Marc looks at him.

                                  MARC
                    First year band students, beginner's
                    band, is a different class, it's
                    not even the same period as the
                    marching band, so if Amy, the French
                    horn player, is in the band already,
                    a change in schedule won't help you
                    out.

      Ben is disturbed, this isn't good, he thinks about it.

                                  BEN
                    How long does it take to learn to
                    play the cymbal?

      Marc shakes his head.

                                  MARC
                    I don't know, but I think it's
                    cymbals, and as easy as it looks, I
                    would think you'd still have to
                    learn to read music so you'd know
                    when to smack them together.

      Ben considers.

                                  BEN
                    Alright, I'll do it.

                                  MARC
                    It's not up to you, or me, you have
                    to meet with the band director and
                    he'll decide whether you have any
                    potential for cymbal playing.

                                  BEN
                    I thought you said cymbals. So it
                    would be cymbals playing, correct?

      Marc looks at him.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        24.

                                  BEN
                    Fine, I'll learn to read music, how
                    hard can it be? If Blind Lemon
                    Jefferson can do it, I can do it.
                    Let's get that meeting scheduled as
                    soon as possible.

      Marc, annoyed, makes a little note, then looks up.

                                  MARC
                    Why do you have to be in the band,
                    why can't you just call this woman
                    and ask her out?

                                  BEN
                          (smiles)
                    Because as you pointed out earlier,
                    this way I kill two birds with one
                    stone. I get a shot at the chick
                    and I get out of p.e. And if you
                    can take a compliment, I think you're
                    making progress. I like the
                      suggestion just to call her. I'm
                    not a phone guy, but I like that
                    you'd suggest something personal
                    and practical. You might just do
                    well here. What happened to the
                    Wall Street gig?

                                  MARC
                    None of your business.

                                  BEN
                    You're the one who brought it up.

                                  MARC
                    No I didn't.

                                  BEN
                    Oh, that's right. It was me. But if
                    you ever need someone to talk to--
                    Oh wait, that's supposed to be your
                    line, counselor.

                                  MARC
                    Please tell me you are not typical

                    Gladly. I am not typical of the
                    students here. Will that help get

                    pregnant, she always said "we're
                      pregnant," you know, 'cause it was
                    the two of them, and even though we
                    don't know who the two of you are,
                    you know who the two of you are and
                    maybe you should tell him, whoever
                    he is.

                                  LAUREN
                    Okay, I'm just going to say this
                    one more time and then I'll shut
                    up. I think you should see a doctor
                    because that's what it says on all
                    three tests, to see a doctor.

                                    MADISON
                    Maybe doctors made them put that on*
                    there so they'd still get paid for
                    an office visit.

                                  LAUREN
                    Or maybe they put that in there so*
                    you could come in early enough so
                    that you have options.

                                  AMY
                    Options?*

                                  LAUREN
                    If you don't want to have a baby*
                    right now at fifteen...

                                    MADISON
                    You better not be suggesting an*
                    abortion.

                                  LAUREN
                    I'm not suggesting anything. I'm
                    just telling her to go to the doctor.*

                          (then to Amy)
                    And I would go to the doctor before
                    you go to whoever this guy is. Maybe
                    there's something else wrong with
                    you that would make you test positive
                    for pregnancy even though you're
                    not pregnant.

                                    MADISON
                    Yeah. Maybe you have monkey pox or
                      something, or a flesh eating virus.
                    That would be a relief.

      Lauren looks at her, stop.

                                  AMY
                    No, it would. She's right. I'm
                    calling my doctor.

                                  LAUREN
                    You're calling your doctor? Don't
                    you think your mother should call
                    her?

                                  AMY
                    You don't think I'm telling my
                    mother, do you?

                                  LAUREN
                          (arguing)
                    You have to. Either you're sick or
                    you're pregnant, and either way,
                    she's going to know sooner or later.

                                    MADISON
                    Why?

                                  LAUREN
                    Because she'll either die or have a
                    baby. And I hate to point this out,
                    but someone is going to be billed
                    for the doctor visit.

                                  AMY
                    They'll just bill it to the
                      insurance.

                                  LAUREN
                    Your parents will see it on the
                      insurance.

                                    MADISON

                    Tell your mother it's for school.
                    Tell her you're doing a report on a
                    woman you admire. Tell her you
                    couldn't think of anyone other than
                    your pediatrician, so you went in
                    to see her and since you hadn't
                    been in so long, she gave you a
                    check up while you talked.

      Lauren looks at Madison.

                                  LAUREN
                    That's pretty good.

                    It's a woman doctor. She'll
                      understand. She'll help her.

                                  AMY
                    Yeah. Maybe.

                                    MADISON
                    I'll go with you. Right after school.
                    No, right after the Yearbook staff
                    meeting. Did I tell you I got on
                    the Yearbook staff?

                                  AMY
                    No, but congratulations.

      She looks at Lauren.

                                  LAUREN
                    I could go after ballet.

                                  AMY
                    The office will be closed by then.
                    I'll just go alone. I should go
                    alone anyway.

      They gather their things, and slowly file out of the bathroom.

      Mothers and babies and toddlers and young children take up

      looks around, walks over and signs in. She turns, all the

      FADE IN:


      Amy's dad, GEORGE JUERGENS, and her mother, Anne, and her*
      sister, thirteen-year-old ASHLEY, who is dressed like Avril
      Lavigne, are seated around the dinner table. It's a nice
      table, a nice dinner. Food is politely passed to the left.

                                  ASHLEY
                          (yammering on)
                    Why do these people think there's
                    something wrong with a belly button?
                    It's not like everyone doesn't have
                    one. They have one. I have one. I
                    don't know why it's such a big deal
                    if it shows, it's not like anyone
                    else is covering their buttons.

                                  ANNE
                    They're supposed to, it's in the
                    dress code.

                                  ASHLEY
                    No one pays attention to the dress
                    code. No one until today. Then I
                    get hauled into the principal's
                    office and asked to put on a
                      sweatshirt. Why do I have to go by
                    the rules if no one else does?

      George cuts a bite of steak, and then waves the bite of steak
      on his fork.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'll tell you why.

      He pops in the bite of steak, chews. They wait. We see Anne*
      focusing on George with a slight look of disgust.*

                                  GEORGE
                    Because I don't want to get a call
                    from the principal's office again,
                    and neither does your mother.

                    We don't like being embarrassed by
                    our thirteen-year-old daughter who
                    insists on dressing like a street
                    walker when we take our hard earned
                    money and buy you decent clothes to
                    wear that meet the dress code
                      requirements. But forget the school
                    dress code, we have our own dress
                    code, and you didn't just break the
                    school's rules, you broke our rules,
                    the rules of good taste. What are
                    you trying to prove? That you're
                    not thirteen? You're thirteen. That
                    you're sexy? You're not sexy. You
                    even know what sexy means? It means
                    you're ready to have sex, and you
                    are not ready to have sex, neither
                    of my daughters are ready to have
                    sex, and you two are not going to
                    be ready to have sex for a long
                    time, a long, long time.

      He smiles.

                                  GEORGE
                    Maybe after you've been married a
                    couple of years. I want to make
                    sure it's going to last first.

                                  ASHLEY

      She looks at her mom.

                          (to Anne)
                    Am I right?

      Anne looks at Ashley.

                                  ANNE
                    He's right, although I doubt you'll
                    get your father's permission even
                    after you're married.

      Ashley looks at Amy who has now lost the will to live much
      less to eat. The parents wait for her response, so does
      Ashley. She finally manages a response.

                    Right about what? Showing my belly
                    button means I want to have sex?
                    Why do you have to be such a geek
                    and ruin everything for me?

                                  GEORGE
                    Hey. Your sister is not a geek,
                    she's a nice girl, and you know
                    what? Boys like nice girls, so why
                    don't you try looking a little nicer
                    and being a little nicer.

      Ashley rolls her eyes. Anne looks at Amy.

                                  ANNE
                    Amy, are you okay? You don't look

                    I'm fine, I'm just a little tired.

      They continue eating.

      and MARSHALL BOWMAN, and her brother, TOM. Grace is saying*
      the blessing.

                                  GRACE
                    And bless this time we have together*
                    as a family and know that we are
                    grateful for each other and for
                    this food we share with each other.

                                  ALL
                    Amen.

      They break hands.

                          (to Kathleen)
                    Thank you for dinner.

                                  KATHLEEN*
                    You're welcome.

                                  MARSHALL
                          (to Grace)
                    So how'd you make out at school
                    today with the Youth Fellowship
                    Party? Get any takers?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        33.

                                  GRACE
                    No one really said that they would
                      definitely come, but I think they
                    will.

      Grace's mother, Kathleen, looks at her. Grace's brother looks*
      over at her.

                                  TOM
                    Am I going to the party?

                                  MARSHALL
                    Your mother and me, we're not even
                    invited, Tom. So why don't we plan
                    to go to the game, then rent a movie
                    and just hang out tomorrow night?

                                  KATHLEEN
                    I'll make some popcorn, maybe even
                    some brownies, how's that?

                                  TOM
                    That's okay, I want to go to the
                    party.

      Grace interrupts before her dad can speak again.

                                  GRACE
                    Tom, I think you should go. The
                    party's for everyone. You can ride
                    over with Jack and me, Jack won't
                    mind.

      Her mom and dad look at each other.

                                  MARSHALL
                    He might. And besides, I don't think
                    we'd be displaying the trust we
                    have in you Grace, if we made your
                    big brother your chaperone for the
                    evening.*

                                  TOM*
                    I'd make a good chaperone.*

                                  MARSHALL*
                    She doesn't need a chaperone. Grace*
                    made us a promise and we know she'll*
                    keep that promise.*

                                  TOM*
                    Then why does she need a ring?*

                                  MARSHALL*
                    To remind others she made a promise.*


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        34.

14CONTINUED: (2)14

                                  TOM*
                    Like Jack?*

                                  KATHLEEN*
                    This is not about Jack.*

      Kathleen looks at Marshall.*

                                  MARSHALL
                    Right. This is about all boys.*
                    Including Jack.*
                          (then)*
                    Why don't we do this, Tom, you go*
                    for a while, then your mom and I
                    will come by and pick you up.

                                  TOM
                    Better than nothing.

      They smile and continue eating.

                                  GRACE
                          (to Kathleen)
                    I really appreciate all the trouble
                    you're going to for my Youth
                      Fellowship. It seems that when I
                    accepted the responsibility for
                    party planning, you got stuck with
                    all the work.

                                  KATHLEEN
                    I don't mind at all, it's fun.
                    Besides, it'll give some of the
                    students at your school the
                      opportunity to see that not all
                      Christians are bad.

      They all get a little chuckle out of that.


      We don't see who the forty-something male psychiatrist, DR.
      KEN FIELDS, is talking to. We just see him, and we don't yet*
      know he's a shrink.

                                  KEN
                    Sooner or later, I think you're
                    going to tell me why these sexual
                    conquests make you feel like a man,
                    because I know you know why you do
                    this and I know you know it's not
                    going to help.

                    We go down this road every week and
                    then we hit a brick wall.

      We spin the camera around to see Ricky, who looks down.

                                  KEN
                    Having sex with as many women as
                    you can is not going to make you
                    feel any better, and I think it's
                    making you feel worse.

      Ricky looks up.

                                  RICKY
                    Aren't I supposed to tell you how I
                    feel?

      Ken smiles.

                                  KEN
                    I think you've been coming here
                    enough years to know, I'm not that
                    kind of shrink.*
                          (then)
                    Come on, tell me how you feel.

      Ricky leans forward to speak.

                                  RICKY
                    I feel like my freaking father stole*
                    my childhood then dumped me on
                    another family and said, "You take
                    him. I don't want him. He's damaged
                    goods."

                                  KEN
                    I like how you started out, although
                    I'd love to hear a little more anger
                    in your voice because you have a
                    right to be angry, your father did
                    steal your childhood by sexually
                    abusing you. But he didn't dump you
                    anywhere, the gigantic hand of social
                    services reached down and plucked
                    you out of a deplorable situation
                    and placed you in a family that
                    doesn't see the damage, they just
                    see the potential, and they love
                    you, and I know you love them, but
                    it's loving yourself that I'm trying
                    to get you to come around to.

                    to come around to not having sex
                    with every girl I meet.

      Ken nods.

                                  KEN
                    Can you see how those two things
                    are related? Can you see how you
                    are constantly fighting to prove
                    your masculinity all because your
                    father was some sick bastard? Can
                    you see that you have it within
                    your power to not let what he did
                    have anything to do with who you
                    are at this point in your life?

                    I'm not sure I want to see it. How

                    I feel you don't want to see it
                    because you think if you do, then
                    you'll lose your motivation for
                    having sex and without constant,
                      indiscriminate sex, you'll be a new
                    person, a better person, a person
                    you actually like, even love.

                                  RICKY
                    I got some bad news, I love myself*
                      constantly and indiscriminately
                    too.

      Ricky looks over at the clock.

                                  RICKY
                    And worse news, our time is up and...
                    I got a date.

                    No, you were late, and we have ten
                    more minutes and I intend to make
                    the most of it.

      Ricky reacts, great.

                    It's a ring promising she won't

                                    ADRIAN*

                    You really think it's going to be
                    so difficult to get Amy to go out
                    with you that you have to join the
                    band?

      Ben shrugs.

                                  BEN
                    One, she would more than likely go
                    out with me anyway but this way, I
                    look like I'm the kind of guy who
                    would do anything for a dame. And
                    two, it gets me out of gym.

                                  ALICE
                    And three, she may think you're
                    just stalking her. Which may seem
                    romantic to you, terrifying to her.
                    And four, don't use "dame" outside
                    your close circle of friends which
                    would be us.

                                  HENRY
                    Come on, call her.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        39.

                                  BEN
                    I'll call her, it's too early, I
                    don't want to look too anxious,
                    dames don't like that.

      Alice rolls her eyes.


      Amy and Ashley are clearing the table while her parents have*
      coffee.

                    That's good, I won't have to leave

                                  AMY
                    You don't have to go.

                                  ANNE
                    Of course we're going, we're not
                    going to miss seeing you march in

                    But I thought you didn't even like*
                    marching bands. And you hate*
                      football.*

                                  ANNE*

                    Could I talk to the two of you alone?

      Ashley gives her a look.

                                  ASHLEY
                    You have things to talk to them*
                    alone about? Like what? Finally
                    decide to wear a bra?

      The phone RINGS.*

                    Why don't you get that Ashley since
                    it's probably for you.

      Ashley exits to the kitchen. Amy sits down in her chair.
      George looks at Anne and smiles.

                                  GEORGE
                    Must be serious. She's sitting down.

      He looks at her.

                                  GEORGE
                    What's with the long face,
                      sweetheart?

      Ashley reenters with the phone, hands it to Amy.

                                  ASHLEY
                    It's for you. It's a guy.

      Amy freezes. George smiles.

                                  GEORGE
                    You have a boyfriend, that's what

                                  ANNE
                    Let's give her some privacy.

      They exit the dining room, dragging Ashley with them.

                          (to Ashley)

                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:

      DAY THREE*


      The camera looks up on the team, huddled together, all looking
      down as Jack prays.

                                  JACK
                    Father forgive us our many sins,
                    for failing to be strong when
                      temptation leads us astray...

      There are glances all around, except for Jack who has his
      eyes closed and earnestly prays.

                                  JACK
                    Give us the strength to do Thy will,
                      especially when it's so much easier
                    to give in to the pleasures of the
                    flesh...

      The coach quietly slips over for a listen, as Jack continues.

                                  JACK
                    Let us not be distracted by the
                    women who are here not to lure us
                    into situations that would destroy
                    our souls and lead us into hell,
                    but to cheer us on to victory...
                    with their short skirts and tight
                    sweaters and beautiful bodies...

      By this time, all the football players are standing and
      looking at Jack, the coach leans in.

                                  COACH
                    Say something about winning and
                    make it snappy.

                                  JACK
                    Help us focus on our game, though
                    difficult that may be, and lead us
                    to victory--

      The coach snaps.

                                  COACH
                    Amen.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        42.

23CONTINUED:23

      The guys cheer and exit the locker room, the coach casting a
      suspicious eye toward Jack as he walks away.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      The football players, same guys who exited, now enter the
      Fellowship Hall, led by Jack. Grace, in her cheerleading*
      uniform, joins the other cheerleaders and everyone else in a*
      cheer welcoming the team, obviously from a victorious game.

                                  GRACE LEADING ALL
                    One, we are the Lancers!*
                    Two, a little bit louder!*
                    Three, I still can't hear you!*
                        More...more...more...more...*

      Grace jumps on Jack, wrapping her legs around his waist and
      giving him a big hug.

                                  GRACE
                    Way to go. You were great.

      She gives him a kiss.

                                  JACK
                    So were you.

      She pops back off him, leaving him senseless. The DJ puts on
      "Stronger" by Kanye West. Grace drags Jack out for a dance,*
      other cheerleaders and players and students joining them.

      ANOTHER ANGLE:*

      Henry and Alice, they're looking at Ben and Amy waiting at
      the food table. They are looking at each other. Amy looks
      away nervously. Ben lets his hand kind of bump into Amy's
      hand, then he takes her hand. Alice reacts, looks at Henry.

                                  ALICE*
                    I think all bets are off.

                          (what are you talking
                            about?)
                    He's holding her hand. He's made
                    the first move.

                                  ALICE*
                    I don't think so. I think it's a
                    different kind of move.

                                  HENRY*
                    What kind of move is it?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        43.

                                  ALICE*
                    A gentle, caring move. As in, I
                    think he might actually care for
                    this woman.

      They both look at Ben and Amy. Ben has now offered Amy a*
      plate. She takes it. Ben takes a plate. He now awkwardly
      drops Amy's hand as they begin down the food line. Alice
      turns to Henry.

                                  ALICE*
                    I think we just lost a friend.

                                  HENRY*
                    What?

                                  ALICE*
                    That idiot's gone and fallen in
                    love.

                                  HENRY*

                                  ALICE*
                    Yes, Ben.

                                  HENRY*
                    On the first date?

                                  ALICE*
                    Yes. On the first date.

                                  HENRY*
                    Wow. How often does that happen?

                                  ALICE*
                    I think the technical term is "once
                    in a blue moon."

      They look back at the table, at Ben and Amy.*

      At the food table, Ben is filling up a plate with hot dogs
      and beans and coleslaw and brownies and chips. Amy is looking
      a little nauseous.

                    Thanks for coming out with me
                    tonight. My dad's quite the driver,
                    huh? I've been training him to keep
                    his eyes off the rear-view mirror
                    so we could have a little privacy.

      She doesn't know what to say.

                                  BEN
                    This is kind of my first date.

                                  BEN
                    I think so too.

      She looks at him, what?

                    You're okay, Amy Juergens, even
                    more than okay. You're good looking
                    and you got to be smart to play
                    that French horn. How long you been

                    I don't know, I was too small to
                    carry a tuba.

      He looks at her, then laughs, she can't help but smile.

                                  BEN
                    And you're funny too. What a dame.

                                  AMY
                    Dame?

      He looks over, sees Marc Molina heading for them.

                                  BEN
                    Would you excuse me for just one
                    second?

      He hurries off to steer Marc in the other direction. Amy
      turns back to the food table, helps herself to a soda as
      Madison and Lauren scurry over.

                                    MADISON
                    How's it going?

                                  AMY
                    What are you doing here?

      Madison shrugs.

                                    MADISON
                    What are we doing here? We're spying
                    on you, what do you think we're
                    doing here?

                                  LAUREN
                    So?

                                  AMY
                    So this was a really stupid idea.

                                  LAUREN
                    Why?

                                  AMY
                    Because I'm pregnant.

                                    MADISON
                    Ssshh, not in a church... gym.

      They drag her away from the table.

                                  LAUREN
                    Are you going to go out with him
                    again?

                                  AMY
                    Just until he finds out I'm pregnant.
                    Or my parents find out I'm pregnant.
                    Then he won't want to take me out
                    again and I probably won't be allowed
                    to date again.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        46.

24CONTINUED: (4)24

                                  LAUREN
                    Here's what we were thinking.

                                  AMY
                    You and Madison were thinking the
                    same thing?

                                    MADISON
                    Yeah, can you believe it? It's*
                    because it's a perfect plan. You
                    date Ben. You get Ben to fall in
                    love with you. Then you have sex
                    with Ben. Then you tell Ben you're
                    pregnant. Then you marry Ben. Problem
                    solved.

      Amy stares at Madison, Madison moves closer to Lauren.

                                  LAUREN
                    It's possible. I mean, you said he
                    joined the band just to be with
                    you, right? So he obviously likes
                    you already. And I checked him out.
                    He's an only child and his family
                    has money.

                                  AMY
                    So?

                                  LAUREN
                    So what are your other choices?

      Amy sadly looks around the room, her eyes settle on Ricky,
      waiting for someone. He smiles and nods toward her. This
      time, Madison and Lauren notice. It takes them a few seconds
      before they can look back from Ricky to Amy, Amy to Ricky,
      Ricky to Amy.

                                  LAUREN
                    Why are you staring at the drummer?

      Madison puts it together.

                                    MADISON
                    The drummer is in the band, anyone*
                    in the band can go to...

      Madison looks at Amy.

                                    MADISON
                    Band camp?

                                  LAUREN
                    No. Not him. Please not him. Amy.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        47.

      Amy considers, should she tell them?

      ANOTHER ANGLE:

      Marc Molina is standing with Ben.

                                  MARC
                    You better watch out, I think the
                    drummer is looking at your French
                    horn player.

                                  BEN
                    Hey, he's the one who better watch
                    out. I'm taking over his territory.

      Marc looks at him.

                                  MARC
                    The majorette?

                                  BEN
                    The percussion section. I'm taking
                    to the cymbals like a duck to water.

      Marc smiles.

                                  MARC
                    And you think that's going to impress
                    Amy enough to...

      Ben plays him.

                                  BEN
                    Enough to...?

      Marc looks at him.

                                  BEN
                    Fall in love with me.

                                  MARC
                    Oh, it's love you're after now?

                                  BEN
                    Yeah, I'm kind of surprised myself.

      Marc nods.

                                  MARC
                    Should I take this to mean you won't
                    be needing the condom?

                                  BEN
                    Hey, save that talk for your office.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        48.

24CONTINUED: (6)24

      Ben looks at Ricky swaggering over to talk to Amy. Ben hands*
      Marc his plate of food and starts to head in her direction.*
      Marc quickly grabs his arm and pulls him back.

                                  MARC
                    No, no, no, no, it's a first date,
                    be cool.

                                  BEN
                    Be cool? I am cool. And I hate that
                    guy.

      ANOTHER ANGLE:

      Amy looks at Madison and Lauren.

                                  AMY
                    Oh no. He saw you staring at him
                    and now he's coming over here.

                                    MADISON
                    Good. 'Cause I'm going to kill him.

                                  AMY
                    Don't. Please don't say anything.

                                  LAUREN
                          (to Amy)
                    Don't you say anything either. Don't
                    tell him. Just stick to the plan.
                    Ben's more likely to marry you than
                    he is.

      And with that, Ricky reaches them.

                                  RICKY
                    Hello, ladies.

      Madison and Lauren look at him, then walk away. He watches
      them walk away then looks at Amy.

                                  RICKY
                    What's with them?

      Amy shrugs.

                                  RICKY
                    So Amy, was that your date I saw
                    you with?

      Amy nods.

                                  RICKY
                    You like that guy?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        49.

      She shrugs.

                                  RICKY
                    He's not your type.

      Amy waits. Ricky looks out on the dance floor, sees Grace
      dancing with her brother, he smiles, she sees him and waves.
      He looks around, no Jack, he looks at Amy.

                                  RICKY*
                    Do me a favor. Dance with Grace's
                    brother so I can dance with her,
                    huh?

      From behind them, they hear Ben.

                                  BEN (O.S.)
                    The only guy Amy's dancing with is
                    me.

      She turns and smiles. Ricky nods.

                                  RICKY
                    I'm surprised you dance. What with
                    your having no sense of rhythm and
                    all.

      Ricky looks at Amy.

                                  RICKY
                    See you at band practice.

      He crosses to the dance floor.

                                  BEN
                    I think someone feels threatened.
                    So, you dance?

                                  AMY
                    Not really.

                                  BEN
                    Me neither. But how hard can it be?

      He puts out his hand, Amy takes it, they walk toward the
      dance floor.

                    Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.

                    No, statistically speaking, it's

                    Who, Ricky?

                                  JACK
                    Yes, Ricky. What'd you tell him?

      She shrugs.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Nothing. I told him I got tired of
                    waiting for him to call and went
                    out to get something to eat.

                                  JACK
                    So you didn't tell him... about us?

                                  ADRIAN
                    Did you want me to?

                                  JACK
                    No. Look, it was a mistake. I don't
                    know what I was thinking. It was a
                    sin.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Oh please, you're not going to go
                    all Christian on me now, are you?

                                  JACK
                    I am a Christian. And I'm a man.*
                    And I don't quite know how to be
                    the two things right now, I'm lost.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                        52.

                                  ADRIAN
                    You didn't look lost last night.

                                  JACK
                    I'm so sorry, Adrian. I took
                    advantage of you.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Stop it. No one takes advantage of
                    me and no one does anything they
                    don't want to do.

                                  JACK
                    Pray with me. Pray that God forgives
                    us because God does forgive us when
                    we do something wrong, even something
                    as wrong as we did.

                                  ADRIAN
                    I don't think we did anything wrong.

      She tries to walk past him, he stops her.

                                  JACK
                    Please. God loves you, even if you're
                    not a Christian, God loves you.
                    Pray with me.

      She allows him to take her hands.

                                  ADRIAN
                    Are you sure that's what you really
                    want, Jack? You want God to love
                    you. Are you sure you don't want me
                    to love you?

      And with that, she kisses him like he's never been kissed
      before, except for maybe last night. We hear a loud scream
      and we turn with Jack and Adrian to see Tom, who is still*
      screaming. Grace runs into the hallway, followed by Ricky,*
      followed by just about everyone else. Silence and stares.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Amy is slow dancing with Ben in an empty fellowship hall.
      He's got a smile on his face, she's got a tear in her eye.
      And we:

                                                                              FADE OUT.
