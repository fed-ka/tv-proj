                    Ohhh. Jess. Look at that. That goes 
                    with... nothing. 

                                  JESS
                    Can you believe I found this on the 
                    street this morning? Who could have 
                    thrown this away?

                    suddenly recovered his sight?

                    I m going to fix it up! I need a 
                    place to show off all the amazing 
                    artwork Toby makes me. 


      Jess sits at her desk, covered in odd art projects. TOBY, an  
      off-kilter student, offers her a large painted branch. 

                                  JESS
                    Toby... another painted tree 
                    branch. This is your best yet.

      She puts the branch in a large pile of painted branches and 
      logs on the floor, about the equivalent of a small tree. 

                                  TOBY
                    I have a lifetime of branches for 
                    you if you accept my offer.
