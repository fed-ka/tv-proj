                                            TEASER

      FADE IN:

      CLOSE ON a COMPUTER MONITOR as a MARSHALL FROST rants from
      behind a desk.  Frost is in his late 30's, rumpled with wild
      hair and a decisively 'fuck you' attitude.

                                      FROST
                    I have documentation confirming Eric
                    Danbury's involvement in not one,
                    but two multinational companies that
                    profited from the current 'conflict'
                    in the Middle East.


11INT. PIRATE WEB-CAST STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

      Frost's eyes burn with intensity as he rants in front of a
      video camera.  His engineer, PHIL, checks the camera, then
      steps back into the adjoining room which is separated by a
      large picture window.

                                      FROST
                    You're monitoring the Evening Frost,
                    the first truly independent political
                    webcast of the people, by the people,
                    and for the people.  I'm Marshall
                    Frost and we're talking about my
                    favorite subject, the raping of the
                    American ideal.

      Frost wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                      FROST
                    It's not too late to take this country
                    back from the power hungry, right
                    wing conservatives who stole it. 
                    Fight back.  Make the ultimate
                      sacrifice.  Blood for blood.  Life
                    for life.  Let's take an email.

      Frost checks his monitor.

      INSERT COMPUTER MONITOR

      Phil has typed in; CAROL FROM BRIDGEWATER.





                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - TEASER - 8/9/05 - PINK 2.

1CONTINUED:1

                                      FROST
                    Carol from Bridgewater asks, 'What
                    kind of American are you?'
                          (laughs)
                    Uh-oh.  I'm in trouble now. 
                          (reading)
                    'If you don't like livin' in this
                    country, why don't you get the hell
                    out!  Go to Iraq!  You make me sick!'
                          (beat)
                    Ouch. 

      ON MONITOR IN NEXT ROOM

      We see Frost as he appears on the computer screen on Phil's
      desk.

                                      FROST
                          (amused)
                    Is she still online, Phil?  She's
                    gone?  Did she post her picture on
                    the website?  No?  Too bad, she sounds
                    kind'a hot. 
                          (Wolf howl sound-effect)
                    Hear that, Carol, honey-baby-sweetie? 
                    That's the wolf.  And you, my
                      misinformed little love slave, are
                    one of the sheep!

      RESUME STUDIO

      As Frost gets revved up.

                                      FROST
                    When are we gonna kick this 'love it
                    or leave it' mind set and realize
                    the answer is self sacrifice?  I'm
                    talkin' blood and guts.  Takin' one
                    or givin' one for the cause.  Which
                    brings me back to my good friend,
                    Vice President Danbury. 
                          (Booing sound cart)
                    Seems old Danny boy is also under
                      investigation for embezzlement,
                    bribery and forgery.  I've been pretty
                    tough on this guy the past few months 
                    and I intend to keep it up.  Eric
                    Danbury is exactly the enemy our
                    founding fathers were trying to
                    protect us from... a tyrant driven
                    by arrogance, ego and greed.

      Phil begins to gesture at him through the window that he has
      a phone call.  He gets on his computer and begins typing.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - TEASER - 8/15/05 - GREEN 3.

1CONTINUED: (2)1

                                      FROST
                          (continues his rant)
                    I'm tellin' ya somethin', if this
                    was a Third World country, this
                    criminal would be takin' out and
                    shot!  And I'd be first in line to
                    pull the trigger.
                          (GUN SHOT sound effect)
                    God, if it were only that easy.

      Frost notices something on his monitor.

      INSERT MONITOR

      'The Wolf is on line three.'

                                      FROST (CONT'D)
                          (back to camera)
                    Let's take one last break.  This is
                    the Evening Frost.

      Frost is quickly up and out of his chair as he lights a smoke
      and grabs the phone.

                                      FROST
                    Marshall Frost.


22INT. ND LOCATION - PHONE - NIGHT

      All we SEE is a COMPUTER MONITOR, and TIGHT SHOTS of the
      MAN'S MOUTH, his HANDS, the BACK OF HIS HEAD, stuff that
      doesn't give away his identity.  THE CONVERSATION IS INTER-
      CUT.

                                    WOLF
                    A wisp of knowledge can be an
                      infinitely slippery slope.

                                      FROST
                    Mister Wolf.  It's been almost a
                    week.  You said you'd have more dirt
                    on Danbury.

                                    WOLF
                    This will be the last time we speak*
                    for awhile.*

                                      FROST
                    Why?  I've honored our agreement.  I
                    never mentioned you as my source.

                                    WOLF
                    Powerful feathers have been ruffled. *
                    It's no longer safe.

2CONTINUED:2

                                      FROST
                    Safe?  I'm the guy with his neck
                    stuck out!  Look, I'm trying to help
                    you here, but I can't do it alone. 
                          (silence)
                    Hello?

                                    WOLF
                    Danbury is the tip of the iceberg. 
                    I'll contact you when it's safe.*

                                      FROST
                    Wait.  What should I...

      CLICK.

                                      FROST
                            (frustrated)
                      Sonofabitch.

      Frost snubs out his smoke and opens the door leading into
      the other room.


33INT. ENGINEERING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

      The room is empty.  Scarce lighting casts deep shadow pockets.

      INSERT - CONTROL MONITOR

      It's off-line.

      RESUME ON FROST

      Even more upset.

                                      FROST
                    Goddamn it, Phil.

      Taking a mindless step backwards, he stumbles over something
      and goes down.

      NEW ANGLE - FROST ON THE GROUND

      gathering himself, he raises a palm into view and realizes
      it's covered in blood.  His eyes dart left...

      REVEALING - PHIL

      Dead.  His eyes wide, a single bullet wound in the center of
      his forehead.

      Frost can barely breath, when a SOUND steals his focus; he
      looks back, just as the butt of a pistol swings through FRAME;



                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - TEASER - 8/9/05 - PINK 5.

      connecting with a sickening THUD.  Frost collapses;
        unconscious.

      As the UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANT steps to the computer and logs
      in, then sends an email message.  He writes, THE FIRST STONE
      HAS BEEN CAST.  WELCOME TO THE REVOLUTION.

      A GLOVED HAND hits SEND.

      REFLECTION IN MIRROR

      Even though it's dark, we get the faintest glimpse of a FIGURE
      WEARING A DARK SKI MASK.

                                      BRUCE (V.O.)
                    Hand me the modem cable.


44INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOVING ACROSS

      a debris field of computer packing material; Styrofoam,
      plastic wrap, wire ties, empty cardboard boxes.  We FIND
      JOHNNY holding up a tangle of peripheral cables.  Finally,
      Bruce reaches over and takes the correct cable from him...

      Crossing to a fancy desktop system taking shape on the table.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're just mad because I got a brand
                    new computer.  For free!

                                      BRUCE
                    What's that all about anyway?  You
                    win the grand prize in a magazine
                      sweepstakes you don't even remember
                    entering?

                                      JOHNNY
                    What can I say, I'm a lucky guy.

                                      BRUCE
                    You're lucky I was still here to
                    help put it together.  Because I
                    catch a plane out in one hour.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Mom must be excited to have her little
                    boy home for her birthday.

                                      BRUCE
                    She'd be even more excited if you
                    came with me.





                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - TEASER - 8/9/05 - PINK 6.

                    I've got that thing with J.J., besides
                    I want to hang out and surf the net
                    on my free computer.  Did I mention
                    that this thing was... free?

                                      BRUCE
                    On second thought, I'm glad you're
                    not coming.  Okay, let's fire it up.

      He hits the power button, as the computer whirs to life,
      then it suddenly emits an audible warning; the cost effective
      equivalent to You've got mail! 

                                      BRUCE
                    That's strange.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What?

                                      BRUCE
                    You've got an email message, but we
                    haven't set up your address yet.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's probably some come on from the
                      company...

      Johnny double clicks as the message appears...

      ON SCREEN - THE CRYPTIC MESSAGE

      THE FIRST STONE HAS BEEN CAST.  WELCOME TO THE REVOLUTION. 

      Johnny touches the mouse again,  WHOOSH! 


55VISION - CONTINUOUS

      We are sucked into the modem line, transformed into electrical
      current; pure energy zooming at breakneck speed across an
      endless maze of circuitry.  FLASH!  


66INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

      Another computer terminal.  ON SCREEN the final words of the
      cryptic message are typed out.  The pointer moves; MAIL SENT.

      REVEAL THE SENDER

      Observer Johnny watches as the ASSAILANT, dressed all in
      black; gloved and wearing a ski mask steps silently out of
      the darkness, as PHIL sits at his monitor.

      Frost is visible through the portal on the phone...

                    What are you doing here?

      Thwack!  One precision shot fired into the forehead, as Phil
      tumbles forward out of his chair.  The Shooter sits at the
      terminal and types, THE FIRST STONE HAS BEEN CAST.  WELCOME
      TO THE REVOLUTION.  Then hits SEND.  WHOOSH!

      Johnny jolts out of the vision.  Bruce sees it.

                    What's wrong?

99EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - EVENING

      A desolate landscape of identical concrete structures;
      virtually abandoned at this hour.  A powerful beam of light
      dances across the facades...

                    According to the license, the web-

1010INT. WALT'S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

      Walt drives, using his free hand to operate the spotlight. 
      Johnny rides shotgun.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What else do you know about him?

                                    WALT
                    Fancies himself some kind of a gonzo
                      journalist.  Drugs and guns.  Lately
                    he's been in the papers for his one-
                    man crusade against Vice President
                    Danbury.

      SPOTLIGHT POV - DARK FIGURE

      The light suddenly finds a FIGURE walking in the shadows. 
      He looks back and we see it's Marshall Frost.  He seems
      confused and terrified.

                                    WALT
                    Speak of the devil.

                                      JOHNNY
                    And the devil appears.

                                    WALT
                          (through a loud speaker)
                    This is Sheriff Bannerman!  Stay
                    where you are!

      Frost hesitates, then takes off up a small passage between
      two buildings.      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT ONE - 8/9/05 - PINK 9.



1111INT. CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

      Walt drops the hand mic.

                                    WALT
                            (frustrated)
                    Don't run.  Hang on.

      He punches the gas as the cruiser tears around the corner
      and roars towards the far side of the complex.

      FAR SIDE OF COMPLEX

      Walt's car fishtails around the far end of the building, as
      Frost dashes out from between buildings.

      WALT/JOHNNY'S POV - FROST

      As he runs, glancing back over his shoulder.  He's obviously
      in a panic.

      WIDER SHOT

      As Walt uses the car to cut Frost off, then he jumps out of
      the car and backs him into a corner, his flash light in
      Frost's eyes.

                                      FROST
                    Don't kill me!  I didn't see anything!

      Walt lowers the light as Frost finally sees who they are.

                                      FROST
                          (beat, emotional)
                    Phil.  They killed my engineer.

      Walt, Johnny and Frost as they approach the outer door.

                                      FROST
                    I tripped over something and that's
                    when I found his body.  He'd been
                    shot through the head.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's the way I saw it.

                                      FROST
                          (confused)
                    You saw it?  Who the hell are you?

                                    WALT
                      Nevermind.  Both of you just stay
                    behind me.

      Walt draws his gun and ENTERS the building.


1313INT. ENGINEERING BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

      Walt flips on the lights.  The floor is spotless.  No Phil. 
      No blood.  No sign of anything.

                                    WALT
                    You sure this is where he was?

                                      FROST
                    Yeah, I'm sure.  The body was right
                    here.  There was blood.  It was all
                    over my hand.

      He shows his open palms; clean.

                                      FROST
                          (realizes)
                    They must have cleaned it off.  After
                    I was knocked out.

      Walt and Johnny exchange a look, as...

                                      FROST
                          (defensive)
                    I'm not crazy.

                                    WALT
                    Relax.  We believe you.

                                      FROST
                    I can take a Goddamn lie detect...
                          (taken aback)
                    You believe me?

                                      JOHNNY
                    The shooter came in through here. 
                    He was dressed in dark fatigues and
                    wore a black ski mask.  It was quick,
                      professional.

                                      FROST
                    Who the hell are you?

                                    WALT
                    His name is John Smith.

                    Smith.  The psychic who was stalking
                    Greg Stillson?

      Johnny ignores the comment.

                                      JOHNNY
                    The killer could have shot you, but
                    he didn't.  Any idea why?

                                      FROST
                    No.

                                    WALT
                    What was your engineer's last name. 
                    I need to talk to his family.

                                      FROST
                    He didn't have any family.  No friends
                    I know of.  He was a fan, just showed
                    up one day about a year ago and never
                    left.  He was a good guy. 

                                    WALT
                    I'll get CSU to sweep the place.  If
                    there's anything here, we'll find
                    it.

                                      FROST
                    What about me?

                                    WALT
                    Go home.  I'll be in touch.

                                      FROST
                    Sure.

      Frost stumbles slightly.  He's too drunk and too woozy to
      drive.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'll drive him home.

                                      FROST
                    No offense, but I'd prefer the guy
                    with the big gun.

                                    WALT
                          (pointed)
                    Wait in the car.

      Frost drops his car keys in Walt's hand and walks away.

                                    WALT
                    I can have a deputy take him.

                    see what I can pick up, then catch a
                    cab home.

      Johnny walks away, as Walt looks around...


1414EXT. TRAILER PARK - EVENING

      A dilapidated double-wide trailer.  Johnny and Frost step up
      to the front door.

                                      FROST
                    Listen, why don't you go in first.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I doubt they'd let you live, just to
                    kill you again a few hours later.

                                      FROST
                    That makes sense.
                          (beat)
                    Go first anyway.

      Johnny shakes his head and ENTERS the trailer.

1515INT. FROST'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

      The inside is as unsavory as the exterior.  Endless stacks
      of books and papers occupy the cramped space.  A spattering
      of spent liquor bottles and beer cans.

                                      JOHNNY
                    All clear.  Can you think of

                    Shhh!  They might be listening.

      He switches on the stereo and blasts MUSIC.  He digs into a
      stack of papers and looks back.

                                      FROST
                    You can go now!

      Johnny turns the MUSIC OFF.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Tell me about Mister Wolf?

                                      FROST
                    How do you know...?  You're psychic.

      Frost relents, making himself a drink.

                    He first called the show about four
                    months ago.  Said he had sensitive
                      information concerning Vice President
                    Danbury.  I thought he was just
                    another whack job.

                    Next day, I found a package on the
                    front seat of my car.  Danbury's CIA
                    file.  Names, dates, the whole
                      enchilada.  Documentation linking
                    him to a half dozen illegal or, at
                    the very least, unethical situations. 
                    I was going to have copies made and
                    sent to every major newspaper.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You didn't?

                                      FROST
                    The file vanished.  I had it long
                    enough to read and then it was gone.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's when you went after the Vice
                    President on your show?

                                      FROST
                    Wolf started calling me once a week. 
                    Dropping information about Danbury's
                    personal and political life.  I have
                    an obligation to my audience.  People
                    need to know they have a criminal in
                    the White House.

                                      JOHNNY
                    How can you be sure it's all true?

                                      FROST
                    Because of the silence.

                                      JOHNNY
                    The silence?

                                      FROST
                    Four months I've been pounding Danbury
                    on the web, in all that time do you
                    know how many denials have been
                    issued?  Zero!  Nada!  Zilch!

                                      JOHNNY
                    Maybe he just doesn't want to give
                    you any credibility?

                                      FROST
                    Yeah, maybe.  Or maybe I'm right on
                    the money.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Who do you think he is?  Wolf.

                                      FROST
                    I've narrowed it down to two
                      possibilities... State Department or
                    NSA.  Wherever he is, he's got his
                    nose in deep.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    How am I supposed to sleep with all
                    this noise?

      Johnny and Frost both TURN towards the bedroom door,
        REVEALING... 

      KENDRA CROWE (35)

        a statuesque blonde in nothing but an open silk robe, bra
      and panties.  She's in tremendous physical condition.  She
      takes a deep drag off her cigarette, pursing lips painted in
      cherry red lipstick.

                                      FROST
                    What are you doing here?

                                      KENDRA
                    My neighbors are having a party and
                    I needed someplace quiet to crash. 
                          (re: Johnny)
                    Who's your friend?

                                      FROST
                    John Smith.  Kendra Crowe.  Kendra
                    was just leaving.

                                      KENDRA
                    Hello.

                                      JOHNNY
                            (uncomfortable)
                    Hi.

      She slides up to Frost and runs her hand across his chest.




                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT ONE - 8/9/05 - PINK 15.

                                      KENDRA
                    Baby, you seem wired.  Did you take
                    your medicine?

                                      FROST
                    I'm in no mood.  I need to think.
                          (to Johnny)
                    That means both of you.

      Kendra snuffs out her cigarette in a nearby ashtray.

                                      KENDRA
                    Fine.

      She disappears into the bedroom.

                                      FROST
                    The front door!

                                      KENDRA (O.S.)
                    I'm getting my stuff!

      Johnny pulls out his cell phone and dials.  Frost reacts,
      horrified; knocking it away.

                                      FROST
                    What the hell do you think you're
                    doing?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Calling a cab.

                                      FROST
                    Not from here you aren't.  Microwaves
                    are traceable.  Don't you know
                    anything?

      Before Johnny can respond, a partially dressed Kendra
      reappears looking for her shoes.

                                      KENDRA
                    I need to have my head examined.  I 
                    come all the way out to this dump
                    and for what?  To get the cold
                    shoulder from a computer geek.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I hate to bother you, but would you
                    mind...

      She reads his question.

                                      KENDRA
                    Come on.

      Frost grabs her and kisses her.

                                      FROST
                    I ever tell you how sexy you are
                    when you're angry?

                                      KENDRA
                    Screw you!

      She blows out the front door.  Johnny exits.


1616INT. KENDRA'S CAR - LATER

      Kendra drives.  Johnny tries to inconspicuously study her.

                                      KENDRA
                    Go ahead and ask.  What's a girl
                    that looks like me doing with a guy
                    like Marshall Frost?

                                      JOHNNY
                    It is a little curious.

                                      KENDRA
                    We have a... business arrangement.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Oh.
                          (suddenly gets it)
                    Oh!

                                      KENDRA
                    It's not like that.  I mean, I don't
                    sleep with him or anything.  Mitch
                    hates being alone, especially since
                    his wife left him. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    When was that?

                                      KENDRA
                    Almost a year.  Took his little girl. 
                    Nearly destroyed him.  Mostly I listen
                    to him rant about the world.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Do you think he's dangerous?

      She seems taken aback by the question,

                                      KENDRA
                    I think Mitch Frost believes
                      everything he says.

                                      JOHNNY
                    This is me on the corner.

      She pulls over.  Johnny opens his door and steps out.

                                      KENDRA
                    Yes.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Excuse me?

                                      KENDRA
                    You asked me if I thought Frost is
                      dangerous.  The answer is yes.

      The late model sports car tears away up the street.

1717INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOVING WITH JOHNNY

      He walks in and clicks the television ON.  WHOOSH! 

      As the NATIONAL NEWS is on.

                                    NEWS ANCHOR
                    Tonight, a nation mourns, as the
                    White House has now confirmed reports
                    that Vice President Eric Danbury is
                    dead. 

      Johnny freezes; stunned.

                                    NEWS ANCHOR
                    As reported, it appears that a lone
                    gunman was able to breach security
                    and shoot the Vice President once in
                    the head.  Details remain extremely
                    sketchy.

                    Once again, Vice President Eric

2020INT. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - OUTER OFFICE - MOVING WITH WALT

      as he weaves through, heading for his office...

                                    WALT
                    I made a call to the Secret Service
                    and they took the information.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That's it?  A phone call?

                                    WALT
                    Do you have any idea how many death
                    threats the White House gets every
                    year?

                                      JOHNNY
                    It isn't a threat.  The Vice President
                    is going to be assassinated some
                    time in the next 48 hours.

                                    WALT
                    Where?  How?  By who?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I don't know.

                                    WALT
                    That's the problem.  Truth is, I'm
                    not exactly high on the FBI's
                      credibility list.  Not after what
                    happened out at that commune.

                                      JOHNNY
                    That wasn't your fault.

      ROSCOE approaches, presenting Walt with a manila folder.

                                      ROSCOE
                    Forensics report from the Webcast
                    studio.

      Walt takes the folder, scanning the contents.

                                    WALT
                    CSU didn't find anything.  Not a
                    hair, not a trace of blood.

      Johnny just stares at him.



                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT TWO - 8/9/05 - PINK 19.

                                    WALT
                    John, I believe you.  But if we want
                    anybody else to take it seriously,
                    we're going to need something solid
                    to give them.

      Johnny considers the challenge, then heads for the door.

                                    WALT
                    Where are you going?

                                      JOHNNY
                    To find Frost.

                                    WALT
                    John, there's something you should
                    know about him before you go.

      Johnny stops at the door and looks back,


2121INT. FROST'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

      Frost is asleep on the couch, as someone grabs the blanket
      and yanks it, spilling him hard onto the floor.

                                      FROST
                    What the fu....

      He looks up to FIND Johnny staring down at him.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (angry)
                    Why didn't you tell me you were
                    stalking Eric Danbury?

      Frost struggles to his feet.

                                      FROST
                    What are you talking about?

                                      JOHNNY
                    Don't play stupid with me, I saw
                    copies of the police reports.  You
                    crashed your car through the front
                    gate of his house.  The police found
                      a 38-caliber pistol under the front
                    seat of your car.  Shall I continue? 

                                      FROST
                    Whatever floats your boat.

                    You spent 6 months in a psychiatric
                    hospital.  2 months in isolation
                    under a suicide watch.

                                      FROST
                    I had issues and I dealt with them. 
                    Why does all this matter so much to
                    you anyway?

                                      JOHNNY
                          (blurts it out)
                    It matters because in the next 36
                    hours someone is going to kill Vice
                    President Danbury!

      Frost seems stunned, then begins to laugh.

                                      FROST
                    And they think I'm crazy!
                          (off Johnny's look)
                    You're serious? 
                          (beat)
                    What?  You think it's me?

      Frost begins searching for a cigarette.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You've got the resum .

                                      FROST
                    Look, I've made some mistakes and I
                    paid for them.  I lost my wife and
                    my daughter, both of which I'm trying
                    to get back.  If you think I'd do
                    anything to jeopardize that, you
                    need to take another look into your
                    crystal ball or whatever it is you
                    do.

      Johnny can tell he's sincere.  Frost fingers an empty pack
      of cigarettes. 

                                      FROST
                    You don't have a cigarette, do you?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I don't smoke.

      He continues searching, as Johnny notices the partially smoked
      cigarette that Kendra snuffed out the night before.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Here.

      right past Observer Johnny as she flashes her credentials to
      a GUARD.

      Cleared, she continues on, drawing the leering stares of a

      Something continues to gnaw at Johnny.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Do you know where she lives?


2828INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

      Frost leads Johnny past numbered apartment doors.

                                      FROST
                    No offense, Smith, but your radar's
                    on the fritz.  Kendra may not be the
                    sharpest tool in the shed, but she
                    isn't a liar.

                                      JOHNNY
                    She dates strange men for money.  I
                    think she's whoever she needs to be. 

      They WALK PAST an open utility closet where an elderly looking
      MAINTENANCE MAN is working.  There's a huge key ring full of
      keys sticking out of the door knob of the open closet door.

                                      FROST
                    This is it.

      Frost KNOCKS... he KNOCKS again.

      Johnny steps quietly up to the open closet door, retrieves
      the key ring and steps back to where Frost is standing.  He
      finds the labeled key and unlocks the apartment door.      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT TWO - 8/9/05 - PINK 23.



2929INT. KENDRA'S APARTMENT - DAY

      Johnny and Frost ENTER.  The apartment is fully furnished;
      casual country.  Dirty plates in the sink, fresh cut flowers,
      and open newspapers give it a comfy, lived-in feel.

                                      FROST
                    What are we looking for anyway?

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'm not sure.

      Johnny begins touching things, then he picks up a half glass
      of water off the breakfast table, WHOOSH! 


3030MOVE, MATCH, MORPH

      Someone fills the glass with water, but it's not Kendra. 
      Instead it's a MAN (#1) in a dark blue phone jumpsuit; a
      partially concealed earpiece visible.  He sets the glass on
      the table.  Observer Johnny watches curiously...

      Another, almost identical MAN (#2), passes by with a stack
      of newspapers; spreading them out to appear read.  A third 
      MAN (#3) carries a box through FRAME; Johnny follows...


3131BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The man unloads the box under Johnny's gaze; a worn toothbrush
      goes on the counter, prescription bottles into the medicine
      cabinet, a depleted shampoo bottle into the shower and even
      a few loose strands of hair in the drain.  No detail
      overlooked in this elaborate set dressing.  WHOOSH!


3232RESUME - INT. KENDRA'S APARTMENT

      Johnny flashes out of the vision, surveying his faux
        surroundings with a fresh perspective.

                                      JOHNNY
                    It's a set-up.

                                      FROST

                    That's crazy.  I know this girl.

                    He was injured in Vietnam.  A great
                    guy.

      Johnny takes the frame, WHOOSH!

                                      JOHNNY
                    You've met him?

                                      FROST
                    Uh, no, not in person.

      Johnny turns the frame over and opens it from the back.  He
      slips out the picture, which we now realize is actually a
      page cut out of a magazine.  He unfolds the page as we see
      that the picture is actually part of a national advertisement
      for electric wheelchairs.  The man is simply an
        actor/spokesman for the product.

                                      FROST
                          (stunned)
                    I don't understand.

      Frost grabs a few other pictures and tears them out of their
      frames.  They're all fake.  Magazine ads meant to fool.

      The phone suddenly RINGS.  They share a look.  Frost slowly
      lifts the receiver to his ear...

                                      FROST
                    Hello? -- Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Okay.

      He offers the phone to Johnny.

                    It's for you.

      He hands the phone to over to Johnny...

                    If you consider formulating foreign

                    What about the Vice President?  What's
                    his role?

                                    WOLF
                    Every crusade needs a martyr.

                                      FROST
                    We talking about the Bible now?

                                    WOLF
                    Only in terms of scope and
                      consequence.  These people believe
                    that out of chaos comes order,
                      catastrophe is salvation and only
                    through annihilation can there be
                    rebirth.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (hushed disbelief)
                      Armageddon.

                                    WOLF
                    Now you understand.

                                      JOHNNY
                    How do we stop it?

                                    WOLF
                    I'm not here to stop it.  I'm here
                    to put it on the record.  To place
                    it in proper historical context. 
                    Nobody can stop it. 

      His attention suddenly shifts...

      WOLF'S P.O.V. - WALT AND ROSCOE

      Approaching from the far side of the park.

      WOLF

      backing away from the bench.

                                    WOLF
                    The first stone has been cast.  The
                      revolution is underway.

      He takes off.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Wait!      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT TWO - 8/9/05 - PINK 29.



3838WE TRACK THE FOOT CHASE

      Through the crowded park, as Wolf is suddenly blind-sided by
      a dark-haired WOMAN; the impact jarring both of them.

      Wolf shakes it off and sprints away, as the Woman vanishes
      into the crowd.  Wolf suddenly slows, his gait growing
      strained, until he STOPS, TURNS to face Johnny and COLLAPSES.

      Johnny rushes to where he's lying and kneels.  Wolf's eyes
      are slightly open as he struggles to breath.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Who did this?  Please, before it's
                    too late.

      Wolf, clearly dying, grabs Johnny by the arm.  WHOOSH! 


3939VISION - SCENE REWIND

      A portion of the chase replayed from FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE. 
      Johnny is Wolf as he COLLIDES WITH THE DARK-HAIRED WOMAN,
      everything slows.  Johnny/Wolf looks down, and WINCES as...

      E.C.U. - SLOW MOTION - THE WOMAN'S HAND

      covertly jabbing a pressurized syringe into his side.

      JOHNNY/WOLF

      As he looks back up at the woman and realizes it's actually
      Kendra Crowe wearing a dark wig.  She MOVES AWAY through the
      crowd of people... WHOOSH!


4040RESUME JOHNNY AND WOLF

      Johnny flashes out of the vision as Walt, Roscoe and Frost
      arrive.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (looks up)
                    He's dead.  They killed him.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


4141INT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE - MORGUE - SEVERAL HOURS
      LATER

      Walt and Johnny talk with the medical examiner, DR. WENTZ.

                                      WENTZ
                      Preliminary tests indicate the victim
                    had a high concentration of serotonin
                    in the brain stem.

                                      JOHNNY
                    From the injection?

                                      WENTZ
                    Normally, I'd say it could be a
                      combination of serotonergic
                      medications... but not in this case. 
                    The initial ToxScreen came back
                    negative across the board.

                                    WALT
                    So how did he die?

                                      WENTZ
                    Off the record.  I'd say his brain
                    was turned off.
                          (beat)
                    The only problem is there's nothing
                    I'm aware of that could do that to a
                    human being in such a short period
                    of time.  At least nothing anyone is
                    supposed to know about.

                                    WALT
                    Meaning?

                                      WENTZ
                          (uneasy)
                    I've read about tests conducted by
                    the military.  Experimental chemical
                    agents meant for use on the
                      battlefield.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You think that's what killed this
                    man?

                                      WENTZ
                    Let me show you something...



                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT THREE - 8/9/05 - PINK 31.

41CONTINUED:41

      The Medical Examiner pulls open a particular drawer... Empty! 
      Wolf's body is gone.


4242MAIN OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE

      Walt, Johnny and the Medical Examiner stand over the desk of
      a young, female LAB TECH.

                                    LAB TECH
                          (nervous)
                    There were two men.  They said they
                    were from the FBI and that they were
                    supposed to pick up the body.

                                    WALT
                    They showed you proper ID?

                                    LAB TECH
                    Yes sir. 

      She presents the paperwork.  Walt scans the document.

                                      JOHNNY
                    These guys really clean up after
                      themselves.

                                    WALT
                    And we've got nothing again.

                                      WENTZ
                    That's not completely true.

      He retrieves an envelope and hands it to Walt.

                                      WENTZ
                    I always do a set of polaroids, just
                    in case.  I'll be in my office when
                    you're finished.

      Wentz and his Assistant exit, leaving Johnny and Walt alone
      to go over the pictures.  Walt flips through the photos.

                                      JOHNNY
                    First they kill Frost's engineer and
                    now Wolf, and they do it right in
                    front of us.  Why? 

                                    WALT
                    I've seen this before.

      Walt hands him one particular picture.





                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT THREE - 8/9/05 - PINK 32.

                                    WALT
                    That tattoo.  I've seen that design
                    before.

      INSERT PHOTO

      A CLOSE-UP of an elaborate tattoo covering the inside of
      Wolf's forearm; an ornate dragon, wrapped around a sword.

                                    WALT
                    I think it's military.  I'll make a
                    few calls. 
                          (beat)
                    John, if this Wolf character was
                    telling the truth, we could all be
                    in danger.

                                      JOHNNY
                    They could have killed me anytime
                    they wanted, but they haven't.  I
                    know this sounds crazy, but I think
                    they want us to know.  It's like
                    they're daring us to stop them. 

      As Walt considers the thought... 


4343EXT. MORGUE - MOMENTS LATER

      Frost paces, clearly on edge.  Johnny steps outside.

                                      FROST
                    Where the hell have you been?

                                      JOHNNY
                    There were... complications.

                                      FROST
                      Complications?  What does... Forget
                    it.  I don't even want to know.  In
                    fact, I don't want to know anything.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Giving up?

                                      FROST
                    You saw what they did to Phil.  To
                    that poor sonofabitch in the park. 
                    What are we supposed to do?

                                      JOHNNY
                    We're supposed to fight back.  Isn't
                    that what you're always telling
                    people?

                    The little guy can make a difference. 
                    Our voices will be heard.  Was that
                    real, or was it just part of the
                    show?

                                      FROST
                    There was a time... 
                          (beat)
                    It's every man for himself.  See ya'
                    in the history books.

      He walks away, leaving Johnny on his own.


4444INT. FROST'S TRAILER - LATER

      The door flies open.  A clearly intoxicated Frost, half bottle
      of booze in hand, and another tucked under his arm as he
      stumbles in.

                                      FROST
                    Honey, I'm home!
                          (beat)
                    That's right, they're all gone.

      Off balance, he barely makes it to the kitchen as he flips
      on the light and heads for the refrigerator.

                                      FROST
                    Ice cubes.  I need many, many ice
                    cubes.

      He grabs a bag of ice from the freezer, TURNS and FREEZES.

                                      FROST
                    Hello.

      He awkwardly dumps the bottles and the ice into the sink and
      MOVES to the far counter, REVEALING...

      RIFLE ON THE COUNTER

      A high-powered M-24 SNIPER RIFLE.

      Frost curiously studies the weapon, then picks it up.  A
      beat of uncertainty before raising the scope to his eye...

      FROST'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE SCOPE

      moving across the trailer's furnishings; the crosshairs
      dancing over the refrigerator, the television, the couch...
      then everything goes DARK.




                                                                (CONTINUED)      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT THREE - 8/9/05 - PINK 34.

      RESUME SCENE

      Frost lifts his eye from the scope and SEES...

      A MASKED COMMANDO

      A SOLDIER, cloaked in black commando gear and a black ski
      mask standing directly in front of him.

                                      FROST
                          (even drunk he knows
                            this is bad, low)
                    Damn.

      As ANOTHER SOLDIER, grabs Frost around the neck from behind
      and quickly chokes him unconscious.  The Soldier in front
      takes the weapon from him as he drops to the floor.

      A THIRD SOLDIER helps lift and carry Frost's body away.

      Soldier 1, wearing gloves, carefully bags the sniper rifle
      leaving no prints and not disturbing the ones left by Frost. 
      And then he's gone. 


4545INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - SAME TIME

      Johnny ENTERS, as Walt meets him.  Walt seems edgier than
      usual.

                                      JOHNNY
                    What was so important we couldn't
                    talk on the phone?

                                    WALT
                    Let's go in my office.

      Walt locks the door behind him and lowers the shade.

                                    WALT
                    I talked to a friend of mine.  We
                    were in the Marines together, then
                    he went to work in Washington for
                    the Army.

                                      JOHNNY

                    I sent him a picture of the tattoo.

                    I only got it because I saved this
                    guy's ass once, and I swore that I'd
                    burn it after I was done. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    What is it?

      Walt slides a b/w, 8x10 photograph across the desk.

                                    WALT
                    Turns out I was right.  The tattoo
                    was the symbol for a low profile
                    Ranger unit.  The team officially
                    disbanded in 1997 after some secret

      Walt is clearly uneasy.

                    If Wolf was just a soldier, how could
                    he know the things he told Frost? 
                    He had to be getting information
                    from....

      Suddenly Johnny's expression shifts as he stops speaking.

      Johnny lays the photo between them on the desk.

      Johnny turns away to gather his thoughts,

                                    WALT
                    Stillson?  You don't think he's
                    involved in this thing, do you?

      Johnny suddenly grabs his jacket off the couch and heads for
      the door.

                    I'll call you later.

      Johnny exits.  Walt picks up the photo, lights a match and
      sets the photograph on fire.  Once it's burning, he drops it
      into the waste can.

                    Lady, I don't have time for this.

      Johnny reaches over and activates the door release buzzer. 
      He blows through the inner office door...

5050INT. BOARD ROOM - SAME TIME

      Johnny bursts into the empty conference room.  He quickly
      closes the door and locks it.

      Johnny MOVES CAUTIOUSLY around the conference table, trailing
      his hand along the backs of the lush leather chairs, ending
      at the head position.  As he touches the back of the chair, 
      WHOOSH! 


5151MATCH, MOVE, MORPH

      Bodies materialize around him, filling the empty chairs; 4
      or 5 older MEN in suits.  Distinguished.  Severe.  This is
      the BOARD MEETING that's not on anyone's day planner.

      Across the expanse of the table, GREG STILLSON occupies the
      chair directly in front of Johnny.

                                      STILLSON
                    I'm not sure I'm comfortable with
                    this idea.  

      The chair at the far end of the table swivels slowly around
      to REVEAL MALCOLM JANUS.  He carries no knife, but he's just
      seems just as deadly...

                                      JANUS
                    Not comfortable?  We've invested a
                    great deal of money and effort into
                    you Congressman.  Tremendous

                          (with politician ease)
                      I appreciate everything you've done.

                                      JANUS
                    You're appreciation is neither
                    expected or required.  Your commitment
                    is all we ask, all we've ever

                    that will lead us from the darkness
                    into the light?  Are you?  Can you
                    be?  Can you? 

      An eerie silence hangs over the room; tension palpable. 
      Everything Stillson has ever dreamed about is at his feet
      for the taking.  The door opens and the secretary enters... 

                                      SECRETARY

                    It's time, Congressman.  What will
                    it be?

      Stillson seems slightly uneasy under the scrutiny of those
      gathered, as he finally rises from his chair. 

                                      STILLSON

      Stillson follows the woman to the door. 

                                      JANUS
                    Happy hunting, sir.

      Janus watches as Stillson walks out.   WHOOSH!

                    They found the guy to fit the crime
                    and then built the conspiracy around
                    him.  They knew Frost had already

      He replaces the handset and looks over at Johnny in the
      passenger seat, staring off; preoccupied.

      Johnny and Walt snake their way (in the cruiser) through a

                    They airlifted him out a few minutes

                    Stillson.  They say he got shot and
                    then killed the bad guy.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Any idea who the shooter was?

                    Beats me.  This place is about to
                    become a zoo.

      The guy takes off, as Walt looks at Johnny.  They both know
      in their hearts who the alleged killer is.

                                    WALT
                    We should go back.  Contact the FBI

                    I'm staying here.  I need to know.

      Johnny quickly OPENS the car door.

                    John, wait!

      It's too late.  He's already disappeared into the crowd.


7070EXT. STAGING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

      An ambulance sits unattended.  Johnny emerges from the rear,
      now wearing an EMT jump suit and a baseball cap; carrying a
      silver tank of oxygen.  He keeps his head down as he
      approaches a young National Guardsman, the last line of
      defense between him and the truth.

                                      GUARDSMAN

                    They just radioed up that they need
                    another tank of oxygen for Congressman
                    Stillson.

                                      GUARDSMAN
                    I have orders.

                    I don't know what your name is, but
                    if a United States Congressman dies
                    because you didn't let me do my job,
                    I promise you that everybody in the
                    world will know it by dinner tonight. 

      The young Guardsman folds under the pressure.

                                      GUARDSMAN
                    Okay, go.

      Johnny heads inside the crime scene perimeter.  Investigators
      everywhere.  Dogs.  Secret Service.  FBI.  Utter chaos.

      NEW ANGLE

      A team of PARAMEDICS appear, guiding an occupied gurney
      towards Johnny... it's Stillson; bloodied and bandaged, an
      IV in his arm.

                                      JOHNNY
                    They said you guys might need another
                    tank.

                                      PARAMEDIC
                    What we need is two more hands.

                                      JOHNNY
                    I'm your man.

      Johnny falls in line, taking hold of one of the guide rails. 
      Stillson, barely conscious, suddenly recognizes Johnny. 
      He's been given morphine for pain and is a bit out of it.

                                      STILLSON
                          (groggy)
                    I got him, Smith.  I shot the bastard.

      Johnny touches his arm... WHOOSH!


7171VISION - EXT. WOODS - DAY

      An entourage of men dressed in plaid gear, all carrying
      hunting rifles, navigate the lush vegetation.  Danbury is up
      front, flanked by two SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  They are dressed
      to fit in, but their dark sunglasses and earpieces give them
      away.  Stillson brings up the rear.

      Observer Johnny paces the group. Danbury looks back...

                    the action if you're not on the front
                    line.

      Stillson obliges, falling in next to him.

                                      STILLSON
                    Thank you, sir.

                                      DANBURY
                    Call me Doc.

                                      STILLSON
                    Yes, sir.  I mean, Doc.

      We can read Stillson's nervousness.

                                      DANBURY
                    First time in the big woods? 

                                      STILLSON
                    No, sir.  I used to hunt with my
                    father when I was a boy.

                                      DANBURY
                    Bear?  Elk?

                      Squirrels. 

      Danbury hesitates then begins to laugh.

                                      DANBURY
                      Squirrels.  You boys hear that?  We
                    got us an honest-to-God squirrel
                    hunter!  

      The other men laugh, as Stillson musters a smile, clearly
      uncomfortable and nervous.  If Stillson had any reservations
      about this man dying, it all went away when he was laughed
      at.

                                      STILLSON
                    Shame about Senator Jennings missing
                    the trip.  

                                      DANBURY
                    That'll teach the old coot to order
                    his steaks rare.  Besides, if he
                    hadn't got sick, you wouldn't be
                    here, right? 

                                      STILLSON
                    Right.

      A sudden STIRRING in the bushes draws their attention.

                                      DANBURY
                    Look alive, boys.

      The assembled level their rifles, aiming at the roost.

      STILLSON

      raises the sight to his eye.  A glint of light assaults his
      peripheral, drawing his gaze hard right...  

      WHOOSH PAN to reveal a lone FIGURE one hundred yards off,
      standing in a clearing pointing a sniper rifle our way.

      Stillson, as scripted, reacts.

                                      STILLSON
                    Mr. Vice President! 

      SLOW MOTION 

      BANG!  A high velocity projectile tears through the neck of
      a secret service agent, traveling straight through him...
      striking Danbury in the head, splattering Stillson with a
      hailstorm of blood.

      BANG!  A 2nd SHOT grazes Stillson's left shoulder.  He
      recoils, but doesn't go down.

      NEW ANGLE - STILLSON

      Using his remaining strength, he shifts his rifle into
      position, aims at the assailant and fires!  WHOOSH! 


7272BACK TO REALITY - JOHNNY

      Releases his grip as Stillson closes his eyes.  Johnny steps
      away from the gurney as Stillson is loaded into the ambulance. 
      Rattled, Johnny TURNS and notices another gurney; this one
      occupied by a full body bag.

      BACK TO JOHNNY

      stepping over the body.  Reaching out, slowly unzipping the
      bag to REVEAL... Marshall Frost!

      Johnny reacts, wounded; stung by his failure to protect.

      CLOSE ON HIS TREMBLING HAND

      moving to Frost's chest.  WHOOSH!       DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT FOUR - 8/15/05 - GREEN 51.



7373VISION - SNIPER'S POV - THROUGH A SCOPE

      The hunting party preparing to ambush the wild turkeys.  The
      crosshairs dance across faces... Stillson, then Danbury; a
      clean head shot obscured by a Secret Service Agent.  The
      solution, shoot through him.  BANG! 

      THE SNIPER

      It's Johnny, wearing military camouflage and his face painted
      in black streaks.  He shifts the rifle, aims, and fires again. 
      BANG! 

      SNIPER JOHNNY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE SCOPE

      Stillson, wounded, his rifle pointed our way.  BANG! 

      SLOW MOTION - CLOSE ON THE ROUND

      mid-flight, displacing air... the SHOT sails high and wide,
      missing completely.

      RESUME ON SNIPER JOHNNY

      dropping to the ground.  He crawls quickly behind some cover
      and throws back some branches to REVEAL MARSHALL FROST. 
      He's already dead from what appears to be a gaping chest
      wound.  

      Johnny, wearing gloves, quickly slips the rifle into Frost's
      hand, then...

      He straddles the body, a beat to review his handiwork; perhaps
      something more.  He slowly leans in and kisses Frost on the
      forehead as he pulls back, we now SEE the sniper's true
      identity is KENDRA CROWE. 

      Observer Johnny now watches helplessly as she scrambles away
      into the thick forest, leaving Frost behind as the perfect
      patsy. An army of Secret Service Men descend on the area, as
      FRANTIC VOICES echo through the tree tops.  WHOOSH! 


7474BACK TO REALITY

      Johnny stares down at Frost's lifeless body; verging on an
      emotional break as he FLASHES BACK on...


7575MEMORY FLASH!

      Frost looks back at Johnny.

                                      FROST
                    It's every man for himself.  See you
                    in the history books.*      DEAD ZONE: "The Hunting Party" - ACT FOUR - 8/15/05 - GREEN 52.



7676RESUME JOHNNY

      He zips up the bag, and walks away, blending into the residual
      madness of the crime scene.


7777INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING

      Johnny enters; exhausted.  Defeated.  He eases himself onto
      the couch, remotely turning on the television...

      A MALE/FEMALE NEWS TEAM delivers the tragic news...

                                    MALE NEWS ANCHOR
                    The White House has now confirmed
                    that surgeons were unable to revive
                    Vice President Danbury.  The official
                    time of death 3:47PM.

      A photo of STILLSON comes up...

                                      FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR
                    The condition of Maine Congressman
                    Greg Stillson, wounded in the attack,*
                    has now been raised to stable.  The
                    President is calling Stillson an
                    American hero as the charismatic
                    young leader returned fire in defense
                    of the Vice President, killing the
                    lone gunman with a single shot.  The
                    assassin has been officially*
                      identified as controversial media
                      personality, Marshall Frost.  Frost,
                    who had a history of mental health
                    problems, often attacked the Vice*
                    President on his weekly webcast. 
                    It's too early to speculate, but
                    early word out of Washington pegs
                    Stillson as a likely candidate to
                    fill the now vacant Vice Presidency.

      Johnny can hardly believe what he's hearing.

                                    MALE NEWS ANCHOR
                    Like you said, Julie, it's too early
                    to know which way the political winds
                    may blow, but if there was an election
                    held tomorrow, I do believe Greg
                    Stillson might be elected President.

7979JOHNNY

      His face wrought with emotion.  He closes his eyes...

                                      JANUS'S VOICE
                    From his lips to God's ear.

      Janus steps out of the darkness like a phantom.

                                      JOHNNY
                    You did this.  You murdered the Vice
                      President.

                                      JANUS
                    I prefer to see it as a liberation. 
                    The freedom to usher in new*
                      perspectives of leadership.*

                                      JOHNNY
                    You're insane.

                                      JANUS
                    Again, I believe we'll have to agree
                    to disagree. 

                                      JOHNNY
                    Why let me in on it?  You knew I'd*
                    see the truth.  *

                                      JANUS
                    I thought I made that clear in our
                    last conversation.

                                      JOHNNY
                          (remembering)
                    The third ruler in the Kingdom.

                                      JANUS
                      Technically, you'd be number two,
                    but everything's negotiable.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Those people that you killed, they
                    were your soldiers.  Did you offer
                    them a chance to negotiate their*
                    lives?

      The question seems to strike a nerve with Janus.

                                      JANUS
                    Their mission was to serve the greater
                    good of the unit.

                                      JANUS (CONT'D)
                    In that respect, they died heroes. 
                    We should all be thankful to pass
                    with such dignity.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Dignity?  Is that what it took to
                    poison Miranda Ellis on her wedding
                    day?  Or was she just more collateral
                    damage on your way to the White House?

                                      JANUS
                    We have philosophical differences, I
                    accept that, but at the core we both
                    desire the same things.  A safe and
                    powerful land in which to raise our
                    children and build our future.  You've
                    seen what we can accomplish without
                    you, imagine the things we could do
                    together.

                                      JOHNNY
                    Are you suggesting this was all some
                    kind of audition for my benefit?

                                      JANUS
                    Not an audition.  A preview.  The
                    opening act of the greatest drama
                    ever conceived by a man.  An epic
                    tale born of victory and penned in
                    blood.  You simply need to decide on
                    which side of the curtain you'll
                    stand.

                                      JOHNNY
                    And if I turn away?

                                      JANUS
                          (cold)
                    You won't need psychic powers to see
                    that future.  There won't be one.  
                          (stepping to the door)
                    Think it over, John, it's almost
                    show time.

      Janus vanishes into the darkness.  As Johnny is left to ponder*
      the implication of his threat.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
