      Worn-out running shoes pad over a dusty trail on the 
      outskirts of Las Vegas.  The shoes belong to EMMA BECKER, 
      17, a natural beauty whose auburn ponytail bounces with 
      each confident stride.  

      Emma veers into a neighborhood of depressingly small 
      houses, turns down a driveway to her sagging home.


      ... Emma smashes a tennis ball against a blistered garage 
      door.  She s so focused on her shots, she doesn t see 
      Travis sitting down on a stoop to watch her.  

                                        TRAVIS
                      Kind of a waste of time, isn t it?

      Emma doesn t look back.  

                                        TRAVIS (CONT D)
                      Your school doesn t even have a tennis 
                      team.  And even if it did...

      Emma misses a shot, the ball bouncing to Travis.  He 
      catches it in his fist, proffers it to Emma. 

                                        TRAVIS (CONT D)
                      What s the idea -- bash it hard enough, 
                      you escape your messed up life?

      Emma grabs for the ball, but Travis seizes her wrist with 
      his free hand.  He yanks her closer, hoping to kiss her...  
      Emma pushes him back with such ferocity even Travis is 
      surprised.  

                                        EMMA
                      Don t touch me.  

                                        TRAVIS
                      Why not?  Emma, you need to, like, 
                      accept your situation here.  In my 
                      mind...

      Travis starts to advance.  Emma explodes --

                                        EMMA
                      You don t have a mind, okay?  There s 
                        five-and-a-half inches between your 
                      ears and it s basically empty...  So 
                      just stay the hell away from me, okay?

      From inside the house --

                                        CLARICE (O.S.)
                      Emma!  Travis!  Get in here!  

      SLAM TO --                                                                                      6.



      Sutton and Luke cross to Luke s Mustang, parked just inside 
      the ornate gates.  Luke suddenly sweeps her into a steamy 
      kiss.  When they come up for air --

                                        LUKE
                      I missed you.

                                        SUTTON
                      Me, too.

                                        LUKE
                      Really?  I barely heard from you.

                                        SUTTON
                      Sorry.  We were crazy busy, and I got 
                      distracted.

                                        LUKE
                      But even before you left... you were 
                      acting weird.

      Sutton stares at Luke a moment, then looks away --

                                        SUTTON
                      Look, it s something I ve got to work 
                      out on my own.  You get that, right?

                                        LUKE
                      Guess I have to. 

                                        SUTTON
                      Thanks.  

      Sutton leans in, tenderly kisses him.  

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      So if it s okay -- right now, I need a 
                      girlfriend fix.  See you tomorrow?

      Sutton is already hurrying off toward her BMW, leaving Luke 
      a bit unsettled.


      ... Sutton is hugging CHARLOTTE  CHAR  CHAMBERLIN, 17.  No 
      one is as cheery and perky as Char unless they re hiding 
      deep pain somewhere.  It s certainly not in this palatial 
      back yard.  Sweeping lawn.  Pool.  Glowing fire pit.   

                                        CHAR
                      ... Love it!  The dress, the hair...  
                      Good old Sutton.  We barely survived 
                      without you, right, Mads?

      MADELINE  MADS  VEGA, 17, is approaching.  Mads carries a 
      definite  anti  air about her.  Nearly-retro.  Too cool to 
      gush about anything.

                                        MADS
                      Somehow we managed...

                                        CHAR
                      We just missed having our -- what did 
                      you call it, Mads?

                                        MADS
                      Our  oracle. 

                                        SUTTON
                      I m sure you guys did great without me.  
                      How s your mom, Char?

                                        CHAR
                      Oh, great.  Out of rehab.  Getting lots 
                      of sleep.

      Sutton sees right through Char s perky, upbeat smile --

                                        SUTTON
                      No change, in other words.  

                                        CHAR
                      See for yourself.  

      Char indicates a window high up in the mansion -- where 
      PHYLLIS CHAMBERLIN, 50, stands, looking down on them.  A 
      wisp of a silhouette and not much more.                                                                                    11.


                                        CHAR (CONT D)
                      She s not really looking at us.  She 
                      just stares.  I have no idea at what...
                                (quickly)
                      But hey, I am not going to let it get 
                      me down.  School s about to start, 
                      Sutton s back, all s right with the 
                      world.

                                        SUTTON
                              (to Mads)
                      How s Thayer doing?  You talk to him, 
                      right?  

                                        MADS
                        Occasionally.  What about you?

                                        SUTTON
                      Same.  He seems to like L.A.

                                        MADS
                      Yeah.  Time with our mom...  Weird 
                      being the only kid now... I mean, with 
                      my dad...

                                        CHAR
                      Well, freaks me out Thayer would just 
                      leave like that.  I mean, I get that he 
                      wants to be with your mom.  But you and 
                      your brother were so close, Mads.  And 
                      Sutton... you three were like the 
                        Mouseketeers.  

                                        SUTTON
                      I think you mean  Musketeers. 

                                        MADS
                      No.  She means  Mouseketeers. 

      A VOICE calls to Char from inside.  It could be her mother 
      or someone else...  

                                        CHAR
                      Great.  Be right back.

      Char hurries off toward the house.  Mads has pulled a PHOTO 
      STRIP out of her jeans pocket.  

                                        MADS
                      Thayer left this in a drawer.

      It s a succession of FRAMES taken several months ago -- 
      THAYER VEGA, 18, with Mads and Sutton mugging in one of                                                                                     12.


      those photo booths.  The girls are laughing it up, but 
      there s a sadness in Thayer s eyes.

                                        MADS (CONT D)
                      So I gotta ask... you and Thayer were 
                      never more than just friends, right?

                                        SUTTON
                      Please.  He s your brother.  He s like 
                      my brother.

                                        MADS
                      Sorry.  Just curious.  Hey... I m 
                      really glad you re back, Sutton.  
                      Char s right -- summer sucked without 
                      you.

      Sutton returns her warm smile.  WIPE TO --


      ... HEADLIGHTS sweep into the front driveway.  A Vegas 
      Police Cruiser is arriving.  A  Juvenile Division  decal is 
      just below the county seal.  Clarice trundles out to the 
      OFFICERS.  

                                        CLARICE
                      Thank you for coming, officers...  
                      Whatever I gotta sign, I ll sign...  
                      I m pressing charges.


      ... Emma, backpack in hand, flies out through the back 
      slider, vaulting the gate, racing down a back alley.  She 
      can see FLASHLIGHTS and HEAR the cops trying to chase... 

      STAY WITH Emma as she jumps a wall, landing in a vacant 
      lot.  She weaves through tumbleweeds, finds a dumpster to 
      hide behind -- just as red-and-blue POLICE FLASHERS light 
      up the alley.  

      A SPOTLIGHT narrowly misses Emma.  She waits until its 
      clear, then runs off... enveloped in inky darkness.

                                        MADS (O.S.)
                                (PRE-LAP)
                      ... You just ditched him?


      Mads, Char and Sutton are kicked back around a fire pit.  

                                        SUTTON
                      Luke can wait.  I wanted to see my best 
                      friends.

                                        CHAR
                      But God, Luke s your boyfriend...

                                        SUTTON
                      I think I know that.

                                        MADS
                      So do you want to break up with him, 
                      are you cheating, or both?                                                                                      14.


                                        SUTTON
                      None of the above.  

                                        CHAR
                      So what is it?  Come on, share.    

                                        SUTTON
                      It s complicated... and... maybe the 
                      first thing I can t share with you 
                      guys.

      Meanwhile, Sutton s PHONE has TONED.  She checks it.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      Better take this.

      Sutton slips off across the back lawn.  Char looks at Mads.

                                        CHAR
                      Sounds like family stuff.

      Mads is thinking of her own life --

                      It s always family stuff.  

      ACROSS LAWN, NEAR POOLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Sutton s just answered the phone.  She keeps her voice low. 

                                        SUTTON
                              (into phone)
                      Emma?  What s up?

      INTERCUT TWO-WAY with Emma outside a Vegas bus station.

                                        EMMA
                      I m coming to Phoenix.  Tonight.  
                      There s an all-night bus.  

                                        SUTTON
                      Whoa.  Back up.

                                        EMMA
                      My pervy foster brother set me up.  He 
                      said I was stealing and... look, I m in 
                      a really bad situation here...  

      Sutton glances around, then slips into --


      ... BRIGHT SUNLIGHT in Emma s eyes, waking her.  She 
      squints at a passing highway sign:  NOW ENTERING PHOENIX, 
      ARIZONA.  


      The Greyhound pulls into a slot.  Emma is one of the first 
      off the bus.  No sign of Sutton.  Emma crosses toward the 
      depot.  She d go inside, but SEES a TRANSIT COP inside the 
      door.  She subtly eases off in the other direction (just in 
      case the guy is looking for her -- which he isn t).  
      Suddenly, a mysterious hand grabs her and pulls her into --

      PUBLIC RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Emma realizes it was Sutton who grabbed her.  They stand 
      for a moment, looking at each other in amazement. 

                                        EMMA
                      It s you.                                                                                    16.

                      It s me.  In the flesh.  

                                        EMMA
                      On the computer, it never felt... real, 
                      you know?

                                        SUTTON
                      Yeah.  If I hadn t always had that 
                      feeling... someone else was out there.

                                        EMMA
                      God, everything about us... it s the 
                      same.  Hair, eyes...

                      And sizes, looks like.  

      Sutton suddenly wedges a mop under the restroom s door 
      handle, jamming it closed.

                      What do you mean -- for what?

                                        SUTTON
                      I can t go into detail.  But last 
                      night, after you called, I got a lead -- 
                      on our real parents.

                                        EMMA
                      You found them?

                                        SUTTON
                      I don t know.  There ve been a lot of 
                      dead-ends till now.  But here s the 
                      problem -- this lead, it leads to Los 
                      Angeles.  

                                        EMMA
                      I don t get it.  You want me to go to 
                      L.A.?

                                        SUTTON
                      No.  I m going to L.A.  You re going to 
                      stay here.  

      Sutton strips off her jacket, slips off her t-shirt.                                                                                    17.


                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      We ll change clothes.  And I m prepared 
                      for the hair.  Yours is longer, it 
                      looks like.  

                                        EMMA
                      You want me to take your place?

      Sutton now helps Emma off with her jacket, t-shirt.

                                        SUTTON
                      Two days.  Just hang out, kick back and 
                      enjoy.  You said you envy everything 
                      I ve got...

                                        EMMA
                      I never really said  envy... 

                                        SUTTON
                      You didn t have to.

      Sutton slips her t-shirt over Emma s head.  

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      It s going to be easy.  Like I told you 
                      this summer -- my sister s totally 
                      annoying and my parents lied to me.  
                      Anything else you need to know about me 
                      is on Facebook.  Oh, and take this...
                                (hands over her 
                                iphone)
                      The key to  me  -- my phone.  

                                        EMMA
                      I have so wanted one of these.  Okay -- 
                      that was envy.

      Sutton, meanwhile, has pulled out some scissors.

                                        SUTTON
                      I m thinking about three inches off the 
                      ponytail.  Oh, and I do this flip 
                      thing...  

      Sutton demonstrates, flipping her hair back.  Then she 
      begins to shore away at Emma s locks...

                                        EMMA
                      I don t even know your address...

                                        SUTTON
                      My BMW s in the parking lot.  Nav 
                      system has my address.  Push pre-set 
                       one,  she ll take you right home.                                                                                      18.


      Emma and Sutton s eyes meet in the mirror.

                                        EMMA
                      So I just... be you.

                                        SUTTON
                      And don t say anything to anyone.

      Sudden BANGING on the door -- someone wants to get in!

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                                (toward door)
                      One second!
                                (then, to Emma)
                      What better place to hide out?  You re 
                      a smart girl, you ll do great.  

      Sutton tosses her the BMW key.  

                                        EMMA
                      If I had even a day with you... to 
                      study up... practice...

                                        SUTTON
                      This L.A. thing can t wait.  Oh!  The 
                      boyfriend sitch.  It s a little 
                        complicated...  

      BANG, BANG, BANG!  

                                        TRANSIT COP (O.C.)
                      Transit Authority!  Open this door!

      The mop against the handle begins to give way...

                                        EMMA
                      Oh crap.  Cops.

      Sutton has interlocked her fingers, creating a step... so 
      Emma can reach a window.  As Emma starts to climb up...

                                        SUTTON
                      I ll be back in two days with amazing 
                      news.  We ll meet at the lake house.
                              (to her confusion)
                      Pre-set  four  on the nav system.  Ten 
                      PM.  Two days only.  I promise.

      Door CRASHES open!  But Emma is already out the window.  
      The transit cop fills the doorway.  Sutton puts her hands 
      on her hips.

                                        SUTTON (CONT D)
                      Dude... a little privacy?                                                                                    19.



      Emma gulps at the full lot of cars.  She hits the remote.  
      A silver convertible BMW s alarm SQUEAKS, headlights FLASH, 
      signaling its location.  Emma looks back at the bus 
      station, mulls for only a moment, then jumps over the door 
      and into the driver s seat.

      Wheels SQUEAL and the BMW rockets off toward Emma s new 
      life... as Sutton.  

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

                                        ACT TWO


      Emma is loving Sutton s wheels and the sights, as 
      Scottsdale, in all its opulence, whizzes past.  Truly a 
      place untouched by the recession.    

                                        NAV SYSTEM VOICE
                      In six hundred feet, turn right...

      Emma, hair blowing, cranks the wheel...


      Emma eases the convertible to a stop in the circular drive.

                                        NAV SYSTEM VOICE
                      ... You have arrived.

      Emma, gulping, takes in the sprawling house and grounds.

                                        EMMA
                      Oh my God.


      Emma s finger pauses over the doorbell.  She quickly 
      withdraws it.  Instead, she gingerly reaches for the brass 
      door handle.


      Laurel and Emma are heading to the car.

                                        LAUREL
                      ... So I just heard I made cheer team.  
                      Char and I are  flyers.   I know she s 
                      like one of your best friends, so 
                      you re going to be pissed... Get it 
                      out, go ahead, chew me a new one...                                                                                    24.


      Emma suddenly tosses Laurel the keys.

                                        EMMA
                      You drive.

                                        LAUREL
                      I m sorry -- what did you say?

                                        EMMA
                      You ve got your permit, right?  And you 
                      know the way to Char s house...

      Because obviously Emma doesn t. 

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      I know I probably said I d never let 
                      you drive my car...

      Laurel holds up a hand before Emma can say anything.

                                        LAUREL
                      Actually, you said  never sit in it.   
                      But not arguing.  Not saying a word.  


      SPLASH!  Luke, Sutton s boyfriend, dives into the pool, 
      swims underwater, breaking the surface with great finesse.  
      He sees Laurel s just arrived.

                                        LUKE
                      Laurel...  Where s Sutton?

      Mads is in a lounge chair next to Char.

                                        MADS
                      Right over there.

      Emma is coming outside, a cover-up over her bikini.  She 
      can t hide a tad of embarrassment.  

                                        CHAR
                      Come on, let s see it.  Show us the 
                      money.

                                        MADS
                      No time for  modesty. 

      Emma lets the cover-up drop as Luke hops out of the pool.

                                        CHAR
                      Whoa, girl.  I was expecting a Bora 
                      Bora tan?                                                                                    25.


                                        LUKE
                      Leave her alone...
                              (to Sutton)
                      You look great.

      Luke takes hold of Emma, dragging her, SCREAMING, into the 
      pool!  

      When they come up for air, Emma gets her first real look at 
      Luke.  It s nearly love at first sight.  Her knees go weak, 
      but at least they re underwater.  Until this moment, Emma 
      has only dreamed about guys like this.

                                        LUKE (CONT D)
                      Seriously.  You look amazing.  

                                        EMMA
                      I really missed you while I was away...  
                      You had a good summer?

                                        LUKE
                      We kind of went over this last night...

                                        EMMA
                      Right.  Last night.

                                        LUKE
                      I ve been  a little worried, actually.  
                      You kind of left me standing there.

                                        EMMA
                      Well... I ve been a little distracted.

                                        LUKE
                      I know.  That s what you said last 
                      night.  

                                        EMMA
                      See that?  I m so distracted -- I 
                      forgot I said that.  

      Luke smiles, kisses her, then whispers in her ear --

                                        LUKE
                      You need sunscreen.  

      Luke dips below the surface, swims away.  Meanwhile, from 
      the lounge chairs --

                          MADSCHAR
        What was that?What did he say?

                                        EMMA
                      He said I need sunscreen.                                                                                      26.

                      C mon, Sutton, we need to know the 
                       state of the union. 

                                        EMMA

                       Boyfriend sitches... always a little 
                        complicated. 

      Emma drops below the surface.

      UNDERWATER

      Emma SCREAMS a frustrated SCREAM she knows no one can hear.  
      JUMP TO --

      VEGA BACK PATIO - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

      ... as -- from Emma s POV -- NISHA RANDALL, 18, makes an 
      entrance.  She s in tennis togs, has a hard body and icy 
      personality to match.

                      from now.  It s mostly seniors, but you 
                      guys can come.

      She seems to be zeroing in on Emma, who is aside with Luke.

                                        NISHA
                      How s the knee, Sutton?

                                        MADS
                      Actually, that doesn t, either...                                                                                    27.


      Nisha, ignoring Mads, stands right over Emma.

                                        LUKE
                      Good as new, looks like.

                                        MADS
                      Ready to take you down, Nisha.  

                                        NISHA
                      Wow.  Shaking in my Nikes.  Is that a 
                      challenge, Sutton?

                                        EMMA
                      Guess it is.

                                        NISHA
                      Well you sure went down easily last 
                      year.  You know, people re still saying 
                      you faked the knee to avoid the 
                        humiliation.

                                        EMMA
                      We ll see what happens...

                                        NISHA
                      How about tomorrow -- first day of 
                      practice?  You against me.

                                        EMMA
                      You re on.

      Nisha heads off.  Luke turns to Sutton.

                                        LUKE
                      Nice.  About time someone stood up to 
                      her.

      Emma, reeling, turns to Mads with a what-have-I-gotten-
      myself-into look.

                                        MADS
                      What?

                                        EMMA
                      ... Really need to use the bathroom.

                                        MADS
                      Right where it s always been.  


      Ted Mercer is SHINING his FLASHLIGHT around the Mercer 
      backyard.  Emma watches nervously from just behind him.  

                                        EMMA
                      Anyone there?

                                        TED
                      Doesn t look like it.  You re sure you 
                      saw someone?

                                        EMMA
                      A... a guy, I think...

                                        TED
                      But you didn t get a look at his face.

                                        EMMA
                      No...  It was so fast.

      OTHER SIDE OF MERCER WALL

      Garrett Mathews, the obvious intruder, has dropped into 
      some bushes on the street-side of the wall.  He leans his 
      head back against the stucco.


      THUNK!  A pillow hits Emma.  She rolls over, the FACE in 
      front of her COMING INTO FOCUS -- it s Laurel in her 
      cheerleader outfit.  

                                        LAUREL
                      First day of school -- I ve got to wear 
                      this, but the whole school s going to 
                      be dying to see what Sutton Mercer is 
                      wearing.   Little curious, myself.  
                      Better hurry.

      Laurel bolts out of the room.  Emma jumps up, throws open 
      the closet, gazes on rack upon rack of trendy threads.    

                                        EMMA
                      You said this would be fun, Sutton...
                                (slowly smiles)
                      And it finally is.

      She dives into the closet...


      ... Emma and Laurel have parked the BMW, heading toward the 
      modern, desert-themed high school.

                                        EMMA
                      ... All the time.

                                        LAUREL
                      Think about it, you could be living... 
                      wow, just about anywhere.

                                        EMMA
                      I think I did okay... considering the 
                        alternative.
                              (off Laurel s look)
                      I mean, if no one adopted me.

      Laurel nods, pensive a moment.

                                        LAUREL
                      Really?  Are there still orphanages?

                                        EMMA
                      No... I mean, probably not...  They ve 
                      been replaced by foster families.  I m 
                      guessing most are pretty awful... 
                                (then)
                       Least that s what I ve heard.

      Emma is looking off.  A police car is pulling up.  Garrett 
      Mathews is getting out, leaning back in to say goodbye to                                                                                     37.


      the cop driving the car, his father, DAN MATHEWS, 47, a 
      sergeant with the Scottsdale P.D.  Garrett steps away from 
      the car and his eyes catch Sutton s.  He looks away and 
      walks off toward campus.  Laurel has seen the look.  

                                        LAUREL
                      Garrett Mathews.  Most likely guy in 
                      high school to get in serous trouble... 
                      and most unlikely guy to have a father 
                      who s a cop.  
                                (looks off)
                      Later, sis.  If I don t see you -- good 
                      luck against Nisha.  

      Laurel veers off.  Emma, alone, continues on, past the 
      patrol car.  She feels Garrett s father, Dan, watching her. 
      Dan slowly drives the car along next to her, unnerving her.  

      Emma quickly turns a corner.  Out of sight of the patrol 
      car, she leans against a wall to catch her breath.  She s 
      definitely creeped by the encounter with the cop.  

      Meanwhile,  a parade  of KIDS is passing Emma. Hi, Sutton.  
      Hey, Sutton.  Looking good, Sutton!  The AD-LIBBED 
      greetings RING in Emma s head, though she still manages to 
      meet each salutation with a beatific smile.  JUMP TO --

      NEAR THE SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER

      Mads and Char have sidled in on either side of Emma as she 
      heads into the picturesque quad area of the high school.

                                        CHAR
                      ... So out of the blue, my mom has like 
                      a  lurid  moment and starts going on 
                      and on about you...

                                        MADS
                      I think you mean  lucid... 

                                        EMMA
                      Your mom was talking about me?

                                        CHAR
                      Bunch of questions.  It was weird.  I 
                      still can t get over that they all went 
                      to high school together... our 
                      parents...

                                        MADS
                      Too bad they don t still get along.                                                                                    38.


                                        CHAR
                      Not like us.  Friends for life, right, 
                      Sutton?

                                        EMMA
                      For life.  

      SCHOOL LOCKER AREA (OUTSIDE) - NEARLY CONTINUOUS

      ... Emma is absorbing everything Char and Mads are saying.

                                        MADS
                      The key is not to get stuck... stuck 
                      here, stuck in a rut... like our 
                      parents...  Like Thayer, when I go, I 
                      go...

      Mads and Char stop, but Emma keeps going.  When Emma 
      realizes they ve stopped, she turns back.

                                        EMMA
                      What s wrong?

                                        CHAR
                      Like, you just walked past your locker.

      Emma shrugs it off, returns to the locker between them.

                                        EMMA
                      Oh.  Wasn t thinking.  

                                        MADS
                      And in case you forgot your combination 
                      again... it s on the inside back flap 
                      of your backpack.

                                        CHAR
                      I ve got to pick up my class schedule.  
                      See you guys later.

      Char continues off.  Mads and Emma spin the tumblers on 
      their locks.  Emma has to check her backpack flap.

                                        MADS
                      Do you believe it?  They ve got Char in 
                      Special Ed English.  That s got to be 
                      so embarrassing.

      Emma opens Sutton s locker.  The inside is plastered with 
      PHOTOS OF LUKE.  One is crooked, pulling on the yellowing 
      tape holding it in place.  Emma starts to refasten it.  It 
      falls off, REVEALING a PHOTO OF THAYER underneath.  He s 
      sitting in an Adirondack chair in front of a glistening 
      lake, a shack-like house behind him.                                                                                      39.


                                        MADS (CONT D)
                      Thayer...

      Mads has looked over and seen the photo.

                                        EMMA
                      Where was this taken?

                                        MADS
                      I don t know.  Some house by the lake.  
                      Since you have the picture, I figured 
                      you d know.  

                                        EMMA
                                (quickly)
                      Guess someone stuffed it in my locker.

      Mads regards Emma for a moment, then moves off.  

      ON A NEARBY WALL

      Garrett is sitting on a wall.  Emma looks over and finds 
      him staring at her.  Even though the BELL RINGS, neither 
      looks away.  Emma finds herself very unsettled.  JUMP TO --


      Emma s about to sit down at a lunch table.  Luke swoops in, 
      takes her arm.

                                        LUKE
                      What -- we re going to give up our 
                      table?

                                        EMMA
                      No... I...

      He takes her by the hand, leads her to a small, shady, 
      special table.  He rips into a sandwich.  Emma is intently 
      staring at him.  He s easily the handsomest guy she s ever 
      seen.  She looks away.    

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      Am I nuts -- or are people actually 
                      staring at us?

      Luke looks over, kind of shrugs...

                                        LUKE
                      I guess...  

      Luke is quiet a moment.                                                                                      40.


                                        LUKE (CONT D)
                      Everyone s wondering if we re still a 
                      couple. 

      Emma looks around.

                                        EMMA
                      How do you know that?

                                        LUKE
                      Just... stuff I ve heard.  So... are 
                      we, still a couple?  Because sometimes 
                      I think I kind of take it for 
                      granted...

      Emma stares at him.  Then --

                                        EMMA
                      Luke... I really appreciate you... and 
                      this.  I d be crazy to take it for 
                      granted.

      She drifts off before she reveals too much of Emma...  Luke 
      rescues her with a smile.

                                        LUKE
                      Come on!

      Luke suddenly grabs her and pulls her away.  JUMP TO --


      ... as a tennis ball spins in SLOW MOTION against a dark 
      blue sky, DESCENDING to the taut strings of a racket -- 
      THUNK -- a puff of dust and the ball rockets away...

      REAL MOTION -- as we realize the ball was off Nisha s 
      racket.  It blasts past Emma, who is dressed the part, but 
      very nervous.  Can she really play at this level? 

      A female COACH is off to the side.  All the courts are 
      filled with practice rounds.

                                        COACH LEE
                      Nisha!  I said, easy.  We re working 
                      our way back, ladies.  I want nice long 
                      rallies...  Sutton!  Ready position...

      Nisha punches a slow serve to Emma, who hits it back.  
      Nisha plays with an ease and confidence that Emma meets 
      with streetwise hustle.  The rally goes on and on, Nisha 
      running Emma around the court with perfectly placed shots.

      IN THE BLEACHERS -- Luke, just coming off his own court 
      (boy s tennis practice), is impressed with Sutton s 
      determination.

      ON A DISTANT WALL -- Mysterious Garrett Mathews watches.

      ON THE TENNIS COURT -- Nisha and Emma s marathon rally is 
      drawing some attention.  A few of the players have come to 
      the fence to watch.  Nisha s barely broken a sweat, but 
      Emma is near-collapse, though far from giving up.                                                                                     42.


      Nisha draws Emma to the net with a pair of wicked drop 
      shots, then attempts to finish her off with a cross-court.  
      Emma dives for the volley, edge of the racket just tipping 
      the ball.  

      THE BALL --  in SLOW MOTION again -- dances along the edge 
      of the tape, finally falling onto Nisha s side.  Not 
      playable for Nisha, and the victory goes to Emma.

      Emma watches from the ground, exhausted, knee scraped, but 
      mustering a victorious smile as a CHEER rises from the 
      gallery.

                                        COACH
                      Well.  Looks like Sutton s back.

      Luke is clapping and WHISTLING wildly.  And Nisha, with a 
      scathing look to Luke, storms off the court.


      As Emma heads to her car, she spots Garrett perched on a 
      wall a short distance away.  Emma suddenly stops, spins, 
      and marches right over to Garrett. 

                                        EMMA
                      Who re you -- Humpty-Dumpty or 
                      something?  Every time I see you, 
                      you re sitting on a wall.

      Garrett regards her curiously.  

                                        EMMA (CONT D)
                      You know, if I tell Luke you re 
                      stalking me, he s going to be really 
                      pissed.

                                        GARRETT
                      Stalking you...

                                        EMMA
                      What else would you call it?

                                        GARRETT
                      I guess just about anything else.

      Garrett starts to stroll off.  Emma calls to his back --

                                        EMMA
                      That was you outside my window last 
                      night, wasn t it?

                                        GARRETT
                      Of course it was.                                                                                      43.


      This sends a shiver down Emma s back.  Garrett s subsequent 
      smile is even more unnerving.  He continues off, as Emma, 
      flustered, stomps back toward her car, rummaging in her 
      purse for her keys.  She doesn t see Laurel approaching --

                                        LAUREL
                      Probably left them in your gym locker.
                              (when Emma looks up)
                      That was like every day last year...  


      Alone, Emma is walking back toward the gym to fetch her 
      keys.  She rounds a corner, passing bleachers.  Suddenly, 
      she stops dead.

      HER P.O.V. -- Luke is back in the shadows of the bleachers 
      in a wildly passionate kiss with Nisha!  

      Emma turns away... blown away...

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    44.


                                        ACT FOUR


      A chic sidewalk establishment.  The sun is low in the sky.  
      Three chairs at Kristin and Emma s table; one has all the 
      shopping bags on it.

                                        KRISTIN
                      That s horrible.  Actually kissing...?

      Kristin is just as surprised that  Sutton  is sharing this 
      with her.

                                        EMMA
                      I know you really like Luke... and so 
                      did I...  I m just not sure...  I mean, 
                      do I confront him?

                                        KRISTIN
                      Do you want to?

                                        EMMA
                      Well... I... I think I like being his 
                      girlfriend.

                                        KRISTIN
                      That s interesting, because last year I 
                      wasn t always sure...   

                                        EMMA
                      But you think I should...

                                        KRISTIN
                      Confront him?  Heck, yes.  You can t 
                      let a guy do that to you...  The 
                      alternative would be to pretend you 
                      didn t see anything...

                                        EMMA
                      And... leaving something out... isn t a 
                      lie.  

      Kristin seems a little uncomfortable with this. 

                                        KRISTIN
                      People say that.

                                        EMMA
                      I think a lie s a lie.  But if the 
                      reasons are... reasonable... then maybe 
                      you can forgive the lie.                                                                                    45.


      Kristin blinks, looks off.  Emma waits -- hoping she ll get 
      some answers from Kristin.  

                                        KRISTIN
                      Sometimes things have nothing to do 
                      with reason.  

      A silence.

                                        KRISTIN (CONT D)
                      Your father and I love you very much.
                      We chose you, Sutton.  We picked you.  
                      And we d do anything for you.  Those 
                      are the only  circumstances  that 
                      should matter.

      Another silence.

                                        EMMA
                      I... I m sorry.

      Kristin nods, then looks away.  Emma realizes she pushed 
      too fast, too hard -- and she s angry at herself.



      Our four girls -- Char, Mads, Emma and Laurel -- make a 
       Charlie s Angels  entrance into this raging party.  Emma 
      is in the middle, and -- in the amazing dress -- has come 
      full circle, looking remarkably like Sutton... and feeling 
      like her, too.  She flips her hair back -- pure Sutton.

      Nisha s backyard is all lit up like daytime.  Shakira s 
       Give It Up To Me  THUMPS over rock speakers.

      Emma takes a long drink from a plastic cup of punch, reacts 
      to the obvious-alcohol in it.  She s checking the time when 
      Luke slides in next to her.                                                                                      47.


                                        LUKE
                      Thought we were coming together to 
                      this.  

                                        EMMA
                      I came with my friends.

      Emma s cool to him because of the kiss with Nisha.

                                        LUKE
                      Okay...  you want to explain this?

                                        EMMA
                      What?

                                        LUKE
                      ... The cold shoulder?  

                                        EMMA
                      Sorry, Luke.  Guess I m just having a 
                      little trouble trusting you right now.  

      ASIDE -- Nisha watches Luke and Emma closely.  

      MINUTES LATER - OFF TO THE SIDE

      Mads, alone, is off to the side.  Emma moves up to her.  

                                        EMMA
                      You okay?

                                        MADS
                      No...  I miss Thayer... I m jealous... 
                      that he got to go and I didn t...  And 
                      a little pissed, too.  

      Mads runs a hand through her hair.  Emma notices bruise 
      marks on her arm.  Emma catches her wrist.

                                        EMMA
                      What happened?

                                        MADS
                      I dunno.  Banged it in field hockey.  

      Emma, unlike Sutton, is well-versed in signs of abuse.

                                        EMMA
                      Okay...

                                        MADS
                      I m telling the truth.                                                                                    48.


                                        EMMA
                      Right.  Like everyone is.  Luke.  My 
                      mother.

                                        MADS
                      I just don t want to talk about it -- 
                      is that okay?

      Emma calms down, looks at her.  

                                        EMMA
                      I get it.  Even best friends don t tell 
                      each other everything.

                                        MADS
                      Close, but never too close.

                                        EMMA
                      Guess that s why you haven t noticed.

                                        MADS
                      Noticed what?

      Emma would love to say,  That I m not Sutton.   Instead --

                                        EMMA
                      How much I really care about you.

      LATER - BY THE POOL

      Emma s iphone displays  9:30 PM.   Emma starts to secretly 
      look for a graceful exit.  Sutton s going to be waiting.  

                                        LUKE
                      You keep disappearing...    

      He s obviously tipsy as he moves in for a kiss.  Emma 
      shoves him back.  She s all Emma now, no Sutton.

                                        EMMA
                      You know what -- you can forget this.  
                      I saw you with Nisha, okay?  The 
                      bleachers?  So how long s it been going 
                      on?

                                        LUKE
                      Sutton...

                                        EMMA
                                (overlapping)
                      ... All summer?  Or just since I got 
                      back?  I vote  all summer.                                                                                       49.


                                        LUKE
                      You were avoiding me -- you were 
                      distracted.

                                        EMMA
                      So what was that today -- your lips 
                      just accidentally ran into Nisha s?

                                        LUKE
                      She kissed me!

                                        EMMA
                      Oh, please...

                                        LUKE
                      ... I told her it s over, and it was a 
                      summer thing, and that you and I had 
                      talked...  Remember?  The auditorium?  

      Nisha is suddenly there, in Emma s face.  

                                        NISHA
                      He doesn t give a crap about you.

                                        LUKE
                      That s not true...

                                        NISHA
                              (to Emma)
                      You won nothing today.  You got lucky.  
                      You ve never been in my league and you 
                      never will be...

                                        EMMA
                      You know what, Nisha?  I ve known 
                      people like you my whole life.  Even 
                      wanted to be like you at one point...  
                      But all you do is put people down... 
                      like somehow that makes you better...  

                                        NISHA
                      At least it doesn t make me a poser.  

                                        EMMA
                      What?

                                        NISHA
                      Truth is, you were abandoned, Sutton...  
                      Even your real mother didn t want you. 

      Emma snaps, hauling off and slapping Nisha as hard as she 
      possibly can!  The blow rocks Nisha off her feet.  Mads 
      grabs Emma s arm before she can pounce.                                                                                      50.


                                        NISHA (CONT D)
                      Get her out of here!  Now... or, swear 
                      to God, I call the cops...


      Mads is coming out with Emma.  Mads is laughing...

                                        MADS
                      That was beautiful...  Stomped Nisha 
                      twice in one day.  Hey, where're you 
                      going?  I ll come with.

                                        EMMA
                      No.  I m good.  Just... going home.

      Emma heads up the street.  Mads goes the other way.  

      FEET begin to shadow Emma from an adjacent lawn.  Closing.

      AT EMMA S CAR

      ... Emma sits into the driver s seat.  She hits  four  on 
      the navigation preset.  DIRECTIONS to the Lake House 
      APPEAR.  Suddenly, Garrett jumps into the passenger seat.  

                                        GARRETT
                      I m really tired of this game.

                                        EMMA
                      Get out... get out of this car.  I...
                      I didn t even know you were here...

                                        GARRETT
                      You didn t look up.   Humpty  was on 
                      the wall. 

      When Emma doesn t say anything, Garrett suddenly leans in 
      and kisses her.  Serious liplock.  When they finally part --

                                        GARRETT (CONT D)
                      I knew it.  You re not Sutton. 

      Off a flummoxed Emma... caught...

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.

                                        ACT FIVE


      Emma has gotten out of the car, pacing in a circle as 
      Garrett jumps out as well.

                                        GARRETT
                      I m right, aren t I?  You re not 
                      Sutton.  You re someone else.

                                        EMMA
                      And you re a pain in my ass... 

                                        GARRETT
                      See, Sutton wouldn t say that...

                                        EMMA
                      Shut up!  Go away!

                                        GARRETT
                      Or that.  Or that.

                                        EMMA
                      I m Sutton, okay?  See?
                                (flips hair)
                      Sutton.  S-u-t-t...  Oh, forget it.

      Garrett gets in Emma s way.

                                        GARRETT
                      Prove it.  Prove you re Sutton.  Answer 
                      one question -- who s your boyfriend?

                                        EMMA
                      Luke.  Luke Coburn is my boyfriend.  Or 
                      was.

                                        GARRETT
                      Or never was.  I m your boyfriend, 
                      Sutton.

      Emma stops, agape, turns to him.

                                        GARRETT (CONT D)
                      Luke was for appearances.  Your parents 
                      don t like my parents... and never 
                      would have approved of me.  Luke was 
                      easy.  He liked you, your parents love 
                      him... on the surface, it was perfect.  
                      But you and I have been seeing each 
                      other for nearly a year.  We texted the 
                      entire time you were in the South 
                      Pacific.  And skyped.  And talked.                                                                                    52.


      Emma just stands there.

                                        GARRETT (CONT D)
                      I got suspicious when I saw you on the 
                      court with Nisha.  More suspicious when 
                      you accused me of being a stalker.  And 
                      that kiss just now -- final 
                        confirmation...

                                        EMMA
                      You done?

                                        GARRETT
                      When you tell me where the real Sutton 
                      is.

                                        EMMA
                      Okay.  I will.  She s right behind you.

      When Garrett instinctively turns, Emma suddenly bolts for 
      the BMW, jumping in and locking the door before Garrett -- 
      who s chasing her -- can jump in.  Emma nearly runs him 
      over as she peels away!


      Emma pulls up in the BMW, stops in a cloud of dust.  The 
      deserted lake house is just ahead.  The placid reservoir 
      reflects a full moon.

                                        NAV SYSTEM VOICE
                      You have arrived...

      Emma checks the dashboard clock.  10:00 PM.


      Emma and Garrett walking out onto the back dock.  Emma is 
      staring at Sutton s necklace while Garrett holds the 
       Thayer on the dock  photo.  

                                        GARRETT
                      ... So you re running from the law... 
                      in Nevada.  That explains why you re 
                      here.

                                        EMMA
                      I told Sutton I wouldn t say anything 
                      to anybody...

                                        GARRETT
                      This has to do with her search for her 
                      real parents, doesn t it?  

                                        EMMA
                      She told you?

                                        GARRETT
                      I know Sutton s been looking into it.  
                      And I m guessing, except for you, I m 
                      the only other person who knows.

                                        EMMA
                      Do you know what s in L.A.?

                                        GARRETT
                      Besides Disneyland, no idea.  

                                        EMMA
                      It s where she went.  And she was 
                      supposed to get back tonight... and 
                      meet me here.

      Garrett looks off, thinking.  Finally --

                                        GARRETT
                      It s weird.  The night before you got 
                      here, Sutton and I had this strange 
                        conversation in Mads s poolhouse.  She 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                    55.

                                        GARRETT (CONT'D)
                      said she had to go -- something 
                      important -- and just ran out. 

                                        EMMA
                      Maybe she came here...

      Emma dangles the necklace on a finger...  He studies it in 
      the moonlight for a moment.

                                        GARRETT
                      So, what s it like -- being Sutton?  

                                        EMMA
                      Garrett -- I m serious -- it s only 
                      been two days and  I think I ve screwed 
                      up her whole life.


      Emma is a wreck, unloading to Garrett in a cathartic aria --

                                        EMMA
                      ... I broke up with her fake boyfriend.  
                      Accused her real boyfriend, you, of 
                      being a stalker.  And with her 
                      parents...  I tried to help, but only 
                      made it worse...  At least with her 
                      sister Laurel, I might actually have 
                      fixed something.
                                (then)
                      Maybe I should just tell them.  Go back 
                      to that house and confess the whole 
                      thing.

      Garrett is gazing off, turns back to her.

                                        GARRETT
                      You can t tell them.  You promised 
                      Sutton you wouldn t say anything.
                                (then)
                      It s weird.  I don t like any of this.  
                      She didn t tell me.  She could have 
                      picked up the phone...

                                        EMMA
                      Yeah, and she could have told me that 
                      we... I mean, the two of you were 
                      involved...                                                                                    57.


      Garrett looks at her.  

                                        GARRETT
                      Sutton is everything to me.   

                                        EMMA
                      To me, too.  It s why I ve done 
                      everything I can to make this work.

                                        GARRETT
                      Then you have to keep doing it... keep 
                      up the... deception.  We both do.  

      Emma nods, looks at Garrett -- in this moment, she sees 
      what Sutton sees in him.  Someone who feels intensely -- 
      someone of extreme loyalty.  She looks away from his 
      intense stare.

                                        EMMA
                      She promised she d be here right at 
                      ten.  Why wouldn t she call if she got 
                      delayed?  I have her phone, but...  

      Emma realizes she can t find the iphone.  Garrett flashes a 
      warm smile --

                                        GARRETT
                      Sutton was always losing it, too.

      JUMP TO --


      Emma lifts the phone off the car seat, checks the screen.

                                        EMMA
                      Seven missed calls.

      As Emma scrolls them --

                                        GARRETT
                      Sutton in there?

                                        EMMA
                      Everyone but.  

      STRANGER S P.O.V. -- FROM A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY

      ... SOMEONE is hiding in some brush, watching as Emma says 
      something to Garrett, jumps into the BMW, and drives off. 
      As the P.O.V. focuses on Garrett watching after her...                                                                                    58.



      P.O.V. SHOT -- arms rowing out into the middle of the 
      lake... a gloved hand reaching down... taking Sutton s 
      laptop out from under oily rags... tossing it into the 
      water with a SPLASH.

      UNDERWATER

      ... as the laptop sinks into the murky blackness...  the 
      reflection of the full moon rippling on the surface...

                                                                  SLAM TO BLACK.
