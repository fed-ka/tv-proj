      Zack and his father, DAN GREENBURG (38), eat Chinese take-
      out in their kitchen.

                                    ZACK
                    ...I was thinking.

                                    DAN
                          (kidding)
                    Uh oh.

                                    ZACK
                    Maybe I'm ready to go to concerts. 
                    On my own.

                                    DAN
                    Zack, you may be ready but I'm not.

                                    ZACK
                    You trust me...

                                    DAN
                    Yes but concerts can be dangerous. 
                    All the crowds.  The merchandising.
                          (shudders, beat)
                    You thinking about any concert in
                      particular?

                                    ZACK
                          (carefully)
                    This is all hypothetical.

                                    DAN
                          (sharper than he looks)
                    Okay.  Because I read that Scrap
                    Heap is in town.  They're pretty
                    hot.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        3.


                                    ZACK
                          (hopes rising)
                    Yeah.

                                    DAN
                    Tell you what.  We'll see Scrap Heap
                    together on their next farewell tour.

                                    ZACK
                          (subdued)
                    Sure, Dad.

      Dan adds his plate to the pile of crusty dishes in the sink:

                                    DAN
                    Your turn, Zack.  Don't forget the
                    dishes and your room and the laundry
                    and especially...your fortune cookie.

      Dan tosses Zack a fortune cookie and leaves.  After he goes:

                                    ZACK
                          (to camera, frustrated)
                    He thinks he can buy me off with a
                    fortune cookie.  I want my freedom. 
                    Just for once I wish I didn t have
                    to do dishes.  Or clean the kitchen. 
                    Or put away laundry.  I wish I could
                    just do what I want!

      Zack cracks the cookie open.  His fortune reads:

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                          (reading)
                    "One day all your best wishes will
                    be granted."  Yeah right.

      The legend mysteriously dissolves away before Zack's eyes.
      (CGI ASSISTED EFFECT).

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                    What the...? Huh?

      Zack looks around.  The sink is completely clean.

      Zack opens the cupboard.  All the dishes are neatly stacked. 
      The kitchen sparkles.

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                    Whoa.  This could be good. Really good.

      FADE IN:


      Dan enters, stuffing papers into his satchel.  Dan's on the
      move, preparing for a big day.

                                    DAN
                          (calls out)
                    Zack!  Get a move on!

      Zack enters from the corridor, still in his pyjamas.

                                    ZACK
                    Dad, the most amazing thing happened
                    last night.

                                    DAN
                    I know.  I saw.

                                    ZACK
                    You did?

                                    DAN
                          (proud)
                    Yeah, the kitchen's never looked
                    better.  You are really pulling your
                    weight.

                                    ZACK
                    Thanks. 

                                    DAN
                    Now, Zack remember I'm flying to New
                    York today for that interview.  I'll
                    be back around nine...

                                    ZACK
                          (knows the drill)
                    And you want me to stay close to
                    home.

                                    DAN
                    Well, I thought about our talk.

                                    ZACK
                          (surprised)
                    You did?

                                    DAN
                    Yeah.  And you taking care of the
                    kitchen shows real responsibility.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                        5.


                                    ZACK
                          (hopes rising again)
                      Soooo....?

                                    DAN
                    Soooo tonight...you're on your own. 
                    We won't get a baby sitter because
                    you are no baby.  You're my main
                    man.

      Dan high fives Zack.  A lame attempt at cool.

      Dan turns away from Zack to move Zack's bike out of the way.

                                    ZACK
                          (to camera)
                    I don't know why he insists on
                    torturing me like this -- but he
                    does.  I just wish I was out of here
                    and at school already.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


      A locker SLAMS shut.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL Zack and Cam.

                    What's with you?  Vernon just got totally
                      humiliated and you just walk away.

                                    ZACK
                    Go ahead.  Sell my ticket to Vernon. 
                    I can't go.  My Dad wants me to stick
                    close to home.

                                    CAM
                    Oh man that does suck.

      The two boys consider the tragic turn of events.

                          (sees the loophole)
                    That is pretty close.

                                    CAM
                    It won't even be dark out.

      Zack and Cam run out of the elevator.

                                      ZACK/CAM
                    Scrap Heap rules!  Scrap Heap rules! 

                                    CAM
                    Grab the pass and let's go.

                                    ZACK
                    Just one thing.  And this is really
                      important.  I have to get home tonight
                    before my Dad does.  That's nine
                    o'clock.

                                    CAM
                    Zack, you've got your wishing power
                    for any emergency.  You've got to
                    use this to your advantage, buddy. 
                    Oh...

      Just then Cam's CELL PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.

                                    CAM (CONT'D)
                    Dunleavy Enterprises, a division of
                    Dunleavy International.  Oh hey. 
                    Yeah.  Hang on.

      Cam hands Zack the phone.

                                    ZACK
                    Hey Dad.  How's New York?

                    Right.  Fun.  Tons of fun.  Bye.

      Zack closes the cell phone and hands it back to Cam.

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                    He did this on purpose.  With all
                    these chores, I'll never make the
                    concert.  Sometimes I wish this I
                    never had to see this apartment again.

      THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance.  The lights in the hallway
      DIM AND GO UP AGAIN.

      Zack and Cam exchange a worried look.

      Zack opens his front door.

      The door leads to an empty rooftop.  The apartment is gone.
      (CGI ASSISTED GREEN SCREEN EFFECT).

      Zack closes the front door.  Opens it again.  The apartment
      is still gone.  (CGI ASSISTED GREEN SCREEN EFFECT)

      FADE IN:


      Zack's front door is closed.  He opens it a crack.  Closes
      it again.  Cam and Zack consider their options.

                                    CAM
                    Still not there, huh?

                                    ZACK
                    We can't go to the concert now.

                                    CAM
                    Why not?

                                    ZACK
                    Cam, I dematerialized three floors
                    of a rent controlled building.  Don't
                    you think we should do something
                    about that?

                                    CAM
                    Yes, we should.  Right after the

                    Wait.  I'll wish it back.

                    Okay.  I wish there was an apartment
                    behind this door.

      THUNDER RUMBLES.  The hall lights FLICKER AND RISE AGAIN. 
      Zack gingerly opens the door.

      Cam and Zack step inside to discover...


      ...that the foyer is decorated with old lady stuff: umbrellas
      in a hat stand, two chairs covered with doilies and a large
        freestanding birdcage with a parrot.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       14.

                    Not bad.  But where's my bike? 

                                    CAM
                    And what's with all this old lady
                    stuff?

      Cam examines the bird cage.

                    Oh no, Cam, we're in 202, Mrs
                      Salinger's...

      From the living room.

                                    MRS SALINGER (O.S.)
                    Do I hear visitors?  Just in time. 
                    The cabbage is just starting to boil. 
                    And later we can all go down to the

      OFF Zack and Cam's terror --

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


      Cam and Zack slam the door behind them.

                                    ZACK
                    Okay.  I got an apartment, just not
                    the right one.

                                    CAM
                    No kidding.

                                    ZACK
                    I just have to be more specific.
                          (thinks)
                    Okay.  I wish I had my old apartment
                    back just the way it originally was --
                    except with the shower grouted and
                    caulked.
                          (off Cam's look)
                    Might as well get something done.

      They open the door and walk into...      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       15.



      The apartment is empty, pristine.  (Production note: we only
      see the foyer, corridor and half the living room empty).

                                    ZACK
                    This isn't what I wished for.

      Cam examines the only thing left: a 1940's rotary telephone.

                                    CAM
                    Hey, look, the phone doesn't even
                    have buttons.  Wait a minute.  You
                    said "old apartment".

                                    ZACK
                    Oh no.  My apartment rematerialized
                    the way it was built -- seventy years
                    ago.

                                    CAM
                    Zack, listen, you can keep wishing
                    for an apartment all night long or
                    you could just...

                                    ZACK
                    Cam, go.  Go to the show.

                                    CAM
                    It won't be fun without you.

                                    ZACK
                    They won't let me in.  I mean, I
                    wish I had my backstage pass but...

      A CRACK OF THUNDER.  The lights DIM AND RISE AGAIN. 

      There is a FORCEFUL KNOCK on the door.  BAM...BAM...BAM.

                                    CAM
                          (scared)
                    Zack.

                                    ZACK
                    Yeah?

      He makes no move to the door.

                                    CAM
                    You live here.  I don't.

      Zack opens the door to find A BIKE COURIER, snapping gum.

      The Courier thrusts a clipboard into Zack's face. Zack signs.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       16.


      The Courier slaps a envelope into Zack's arms.  The Courier
      takes off.

                                    ZACK
                    Thank you.

      Zack rips the envelope open.

                                    ZACK (CONT'D)
                    It is a backstage pass...for the Ice
                    Capades.  Let me try one more time. 
                    I wish I --

                                    CAM
                    Stop.  All your wishes backfire.

                                    ZACK
                    Getting a new power is like getting
                    a guitar.  You've got to practice.

                                    CAM
                    Where you read that?  The Superhero
                      Guidebook?

                                    ZACK
                    I'll be careful.  And clear.  I wish we
                    were in our front row seats with our
                    backstage passes to see Scrap Heap.

                                    CAM
                    Scrap Heap forever!

      CLOSE ON CAM AND ZACK

      WHOMP!  They are seated in two plush velvet theatre seats.

                                    CAM (CONT'D)
                    Good one, Zack.  I'm going to kill
                    you.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL


      Gwen and Spence watch the concert from the wings.

                                    GWEN
                      Riiiiiicky!  Ricky, I love you! 
                    Ricky!  Ricky!

                                    GWEN
                      Riiiiicky!


      Gwen sways to the treacly ballad "You're My Girl".

                                      SPENCER
                    Gwen, we have to do something.

                                    GWEN
                    There's nothing to do.  He's perfect.

                                      SPENCER
                    No, I'm talking about Cam and Zack. 
                    We have to leave here and find them.

                                    GWEN
                    We're staying.

                                      SPENCER
                    Gwen...

                    Listen up, Science Boy.  Everyone
                    knows when you get free wishes they
                    turn around and bite you.  It's in
                    every single fairy tale and every
                      Gilligan's Island.  If Zack stepped
                    over the line, that's really his
                    problem.


      Spence and Gwen again.

                                      SPENCER
                    But all Zack wanted was to see this
                    concert.

                                    GWEN
                    Well, maybe he felt like he didn't
                    deserve it.  Maybe he felt bad for
                      disobeying his Dad.  So, subconsciously,
                    he sabotaged himself.  It's classic.

                                      SPENCER
                    What do you mean?

                                    GWEN
                    Okay, here's an example.  Say that I
                    wish Little Ricky was my boyfriend. 
                    Well, not really my boyfriend but
                    like a boy friend.  Now if I were
                    Zack, I'd do something really stupid
                    and destroy all my chances.
                          (screams)
                    Ricky I LOVE YOU!  You are so hot!


      The sun is setting on Zack and Cam.

                                    ZACK
                    It's 8:30.  I have to get home.  Now.

                                    CAM
                    Don't wish.      The Zack Files - Misfortune Cookie                       20.


                                    ZACK
                    Okay.  My Dad's at the airport.  In
                    half an hour he's at the apartment
                    and I'm finished.  Grounded for life
                    at thirteen.  If I can just get home
                    before he does.

      THUNDER RUMBLES.  The Beamer's headlights BRIGHTEN AND DIM

                                    ZACK
                    But I didn't make a wish.  Did I say
                    "I wish?"

                                    CAM
                    You made a wish.

                                    ZACK
                    But I didn't say it out loud.  This
                    is so tricky.  Okay, we're still
                    here.  So that means in order to get
                    home before my Dad does...he must be
                    trapped somewhere else. 


      Zack discovers that he is back in his home.  It's yesterday. 
      Zack and Dan finish their Chinese take-out dinner.

                                    ZACK
                    Whoa.

                                    DAN
                    Yes, but concerts can be dangerous. 
                    All the crowds.  The merchandising. 
                    You thinking about any concert in
                      particular?

      Zack pauses.  He carefully rethinks his answer.

                                    ZACK
                    Yeah.  I was thinking about seeing
                    Scrap Heap.

                                    DAN
                    Wow.  Their farewell tour.  Can you
                    get tickets?

                    Yeah.  Cam's got backstage passes.

                    you're going to New York tomorrow. 
                    If you were here we could go together.

                    of what I want.  No, no, wait, I'll
                    get this.  Ahhhh.

                    I think I would wish that Science
                    would finally be taken seriously. 
                    Or...


                                    DAN
                    Oh...I got it.  A really, really,
                    good pretzel.  Yeah, that'd be good. 
                    With mustard.  Honey mustard.  Oh
                    that would be good.  That's what I'd
                    wish for.
