THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . .
A beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.
Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..
SELENA
Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view.
George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake.
GEORGE
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks
too pretty to eat.
SELENA
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's
all covered with ants.
She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg.
GEORGE
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled
down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle
down with than you.
SELENA
Why George, are you proposing?
GEORGE
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring
in much now, but...
SELENA
George---I thought you'd never ask.
A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.
GEORGE
What the heck is that?
They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.
SELENA
A squirrel Frisbee?
Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.
Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.
SELENA
That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is,
but I've never seen it before.
She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.
GEORGE
Hey, where you going?
SELENA
(calling over her shoulder)
I've got things to do.
GEORGE
What about my proposal?
SELENA
(dismissively)
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
She gets in the pickup and. drives away.
GEORGE
Hey! My truck!
DISSOLVE TO:
KARA' S FACE
She is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen.
ALURA
(voice over)
But Kara, you are too young to go.
ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED
They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her.
KARA
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
ZOR-EL
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to
Earth. The journey is dangerous.
KARA
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
ZOR-EL
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
KARA
I allowed it to escape the City.
ALURA
Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman
was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do
was visit this place.
KARA
Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our
scanning shows the Power Source has finally
reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless
someone brings it back.
ZOR-EL
Superman will return it.
KARA
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should
have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He
may be dead.
ZOR-EL
But what can you, a mere girl-
KARA
I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait.
Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a
child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.
Zor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl.
ALURA
What do your teachers think?
Zor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks.
TEACHER
It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones
to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much
longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's
fighting for, Zor-El.
ZOR-EL
Very well, let it be done.
Alura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.
KARA
Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied
the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.
Kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.
ALURA
But they are such strange, unstable people.
KARA
Then I will learn to act strange like them.
Kara holds up a small handbag. Inside we glimpse red and blue material.
KARA
I have made clothing and copies of their money, I
will be fine.
Her father puts his hand on her shoulder .
ZOR-EL
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
KARA
As brave as my father. As wise.
They embrace, briefly. Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.
Instantly transparent bubble forms around her.
Her parents watch as she floats away.
She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space.
MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE "HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.
Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman.
She lands on a nearby beach.
BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE
She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world.
Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she
crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath.
She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward.
DAY
Kara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight.
HORSES.
DAY
Kara swoops down at a herd of horses. The herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away.
CUT TO:
DAY
Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.
INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.
BACK TO SCENE.
DAY
Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again.
DAY
She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.
A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.
SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear .
BIANCA
Be careful. Nigel is going to try something.
SELENA
Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him.
He's just a sore loser.
An ELDERLY MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow.
ELDERLY MAN
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
SELENA
What do you want?
ELDERLY MAN
Western Europe.
SELENA
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could
have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
ELDERLY MAN
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette.
SELENA
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
NIGEL
It may well be. I know how you won that election
Selena. You can't fool me.
SELENA
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me...
I'm going places.
NIGEL
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville.
You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all
these people have served years and years of apprenticeship.
Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations.
You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
Selena smirks at him, self-confidently.
SELENA
I just did. Because I have the Power.
NIGEL
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow
is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Nigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case.
SELENA
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as
long as I don't go too far.
NIGEL
Cigarette?
He holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection.
INSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS.
BACK TO SCENE.
Quick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared.
NIGEL
Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.
Nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently.
SELENA
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering
back.
Nigel shakes his head.
NIGEL
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save
you from a terrible fate.
SELENA
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now
burn rubber.
Nigel locks eyes with her.
NIGEL
Make me.
He takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass.
Nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him.
NIGEL
Balefire on you, Selena!
SELENA
(grinning)
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
All quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them.
NIGEL
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone
coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
SELENA
Throw him out.
Two burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking.
NIGEL
You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie!
The crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation.
Bianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent.
BIANCA
Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you
the first woman in eight hundred years to head
the Circle: Selena!
Applause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture.
SELENA
Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a
great honor you have given me, and I will try to be
worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed --
you will learn that we are on the threshold of
power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was
our leader.
More applause. One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue.
SELENA
And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit
of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the
coming year...
A woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames.
Panic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house.
A bus stops in front of the school. Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE.) Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase.
In front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building.
MR. Danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus.
MR DANVERS
...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11
start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin,
French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology
and Computing. Later on, you can add some electives.
I think we'll put you in "G" dorm.
He opens the door and ushers her into the dorm.
Girls in their adorable school gym outfits run around playing field hockey. Linda hangs back on the outskirts of the mob. She sees Myra put her stick between Lucy's legs and trip her. Linda stops to help Lucy up.
LINDA
She did that deliberately.
LUCY
She's a beast.
The pack turns and heads back toward them, the lead. Myra slaps the puck directly at. steps in front of it to protect Lucy. The and shatters. .Play stops. The girls mill confusion, picking up the little pieces of with Myra in Lucy. Linda puck hits Linda around in puck.
LUCY
How'd you do that?
LINDA
Must've been a defective puck.
A cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds. The nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings, but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab the baby birds when he gets there.
Slowly the cat inches along the branch. Suddenly a beam of light hits the branch. It bursts into flame, and falls down to the ground, saving the birds from any future danger. The cat turns around like a felon caught in the act, runs down the tree trunk, and scampers away.
Selena's Cadillac drives past the school. softball in front. Girls are playing softball in front.
The girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the Cadillac.
Linda is standing at the bathroom' window of her dorm room, looking outside with a melancholy expression. She slides the curtain across the window, so no one can see in.
Linda sits by herself reading on a stone bench: She is wearing the school uniform now. All around her girls are running out of the dorm with overnight cases and climbing into cars driven by middle-aged couples. There is a frantic bustle of activity.
CUT TO:
The campus is deserted. Linda still pretends to read, but her sense of loneliness is palpable. Suddenly Mr. Danvers is beside her, looking down.
MR. DANVERS
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
LINDA
No, MR. Danvers.
MR. DANVERS
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't
you come home with us for dinner?
LINDA
I'd love to.
DISSOLVE TO:
Mr. & Mrs. Danvers and Linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food. ,The dog begs for scraps. As the scene progresses (MOS) the Danvers bring Linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food, jokes and happiness. A. dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyone's childhood.
Ethan is sketching the house, adding new trees and shrubs in his drawing. He sees Selena waving, and walks over to her.
Nigel in a skin-tight vinyl jumpsuit with multidirectional chrome zippers is leaning on the bell. Behind him his Porsche is parked in the driveway, and beyond at the curb is a truck with ETHAN'S NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING painted on it. Selena opens the door, sees Nigel, and tries to close it. But Nigel puts his foot in and keeps it open.
SELENA
Nigel, get lost.
NIGEL
I have to talk to you.
SELENA
You're wasting your breath.
NIGEL
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to
teach you something of the Craft.
SELENA
I could teach you a thing or two now.
Selena is listening impatiently to Nigel, and staring oddly at him.
NIGEL
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great
Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me
like that?
SELENA
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a
good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Nigel is rather vain about his smooth olive complexion, so he is completely thrown off his stride.
NIGEL
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
SELENA
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of
yourself.
Selena closes the door while he's off his guard. Nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection. His face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches.
NIGEL
Nasty bitch!
Ethan staggers across the lawn, still clutching his head, obviously very ill. As he disappears through the shrubbery on the far side of the lawn, he mutters drunkenly to himself.
ETHAN
Rhododendron.. . .honeysuckle. . .
Lucy is in front of the local hamburger drive-in in her Thunderbird convertible, talking to the foxiest dude at Rindge Tech. Other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive-in. Lucy catches sight of Linda walking along the side of the road.
LUCY
Hey, Linda!
(to the boy)
It's my roommate. You'll love her. She's really off
the wall!
Lucy jumps out of her car, runs over to Linda, and whispers urgently in her ear.
LUCY
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's...
his folks are away...
LINDA
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out
for an overnight.
LUCY
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom
window. McCloskey's always zonked out:
she'll never hear you.
LINDA
It doesn't seem right.
LUCY
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't
be the only girl?
Linda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre, white line of the highway. Cars honk and zoom past him.
LINDA
Look at that guy!
Lucy whirls around and looks.
LUCY
What a space cadet.
(yelling and waving)
Hey, you dingleberry! Get outta the street!
Ethan ignores them, and continues to teeter deliriously.
INSERT.
ETHAN'S P.O.V.
He sees the night as a fairyland of dancing, blurred lights: the neon of the hamburger stand; the garish pumps of the gas station across the street, the streaking head and taillights of the cars on either side. All sound is similarly distorted and far away.
BACK TO SCENE
LINDA
Why is he acting so strangely?
LUCY
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
There is a construction site next to the Hamburger Place.
A giant BULLDOZER suddenly ROARS TO LIFE and bursts through the chain link fence surrounding the construction site. With no one at the controls, the bulldozer drives out onto the street. Ethan sees its GAPING JAWS and runs clumsily away. They snap at him with the clash of steel. He stumbles and the bulldozer scoops him up. It wheels around and starts to carry him away, with one of his legs protruding through the teeth of its giant mouth. The onlookers are stunned and horrified.
LUCY
Omigod, it's a runaway!
Lucy sprints out into the street, running after the driverless bulldozer.
LINDA
Lucy; come back!
LUCY
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Lucy dodges through the cars and alongside the bulldozer. She climbs bravely up into the driver's seat and tries to tug at the controls. They are frozen. In desperation Lucy yanks on the steering wheel. The bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station.
A TOURIST is filling his station wagon at one of the self-service pumps. His WIFE is bringing their TODDLER back from the rest rooms. The bulldozer suddenly smashes into the gas pumps and through the gas station. The tourist dives out of its path. The bulldozer circles behind the gas station toward a small motel next door, leaving in its wake a totaled station wagon, and gasoline leaking on the ground from the smashed pumps.
Linda watches with mounting horror. And yet she remembers the warning from Alura, and stands frozen, unable to intervene.
Lucy fights the wheel in vain. The bulldozer circles through the motel, smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks. The bulldozer drives under the MOTEL SIGN which HITS LUCY ON THE HEAD, KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS. Finally, the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station. The utility pole leans at a crazy angle. Its ELECTRIC WIRES break and dangle down, flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement. The RIVER OF GASOLINE from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines. The mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires, his arms held out eagerly.
MOTHER
My baby!!!!!
Instead of helping, the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire.
Linda can't take it any longer. She ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant. An instant later, she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as SUPERGIRL! She stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd. Supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs:. The toddler is blown safely 1nto his mother's arms.
MOTHER
My baby.
She grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and BURSTS INTO FLAMES .
The bulldozer, with Lucy Lane unconscious at the controls and Ethan imprisoned in the scoop, is surrounded by an IMPENETRABLE RING OF FIRE .
Supergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who weren't running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and blue streak.
Supergirl takes the unconscious Lucy from the driver's seat and carries her in her arms to the front of the bulldozer.
Supergirl pulls open the massive metal jaws with one hand like they were sheet rubber.
SUPERGIRL
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
ETHAN
Wait...don't leave me in here...
SUPERGIRL
It's for your own protection.
She pulls the massive steel jaws shut and tears the scoop off the bulldozer with a sound of rending metal. Immediately afterwards, the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a FIERY EXPLOSION.
The entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky. A fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene, sirens screaming. The tourist family watch from a safe distance, their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle.
Supergirl flies out of the column of black smoke, carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with Ethan and Lucy safely inside.
ETHAN
(calling from inside)
What's happening?
SUPERGIRL
(shouting over the wind)
I'm taking you to the hospital.
ETHAN
(within)
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
SUPERGIRL
Later.
The firemen have smothered the fire with a blanket of foam. The blackened bulldozer minus its front scoop stands next to the smashed station wagon. A bewildered policeman is searching for victims.
POLICEMAN
Where's the casualties? You can't tell me there's
no casualties.
Supergirl lands with the bulldozer scoop in front of the emergency entrance. There is no one around. Supergirl rips open the sealed scoop with a loud noise of rending metal.
Linda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. ,
The dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing.
Far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake.
HUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda.
Supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice.
SUPERGIRL
Leave this place and do no harm.
Something picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken.
She launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades.
Supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her.
Again and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below.
Suddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue.
She turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm.
CUT TO:
MR. Danvers drives up the long driveway toward Linda's dorm. He parks his car behind the flattened remains of Lucy's car, and gets out, staring with amazement at the destruction wrought by the titanic struggle.
He walks toward the dorm, fear and confusion on his face.
Linda gets off a bus and enters the hospital.
Bianca drives Selena's Cadillac up to the emergency entrance and parks in the ambulance zone. Selena get out of the back seat in a dramatic opera cape of raw silk with opal trim.
SELENA
(to Bianca)
This won't take long. Keep the motor running.
Ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze.
SELENA
Give up?
Ethan
takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator.
ETHAN
Never!
He starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney.
SELENA
What goes up must come down.
Jimmy opens the door of his car for Linda. It's parked in the ambulance zone, right behind
Selena's Cadillac.
JIMMY
I probably would've got a ticket without this press pass
on the windshield. Does Clark get many tickets?
Linda pauses, looking up at the sky.
LINDA
(distractedly)
I wouldn't know. Look. Up in the sky.
Jimmy follows the direction of her gaze.
INSERT. THEIR P. O . V. OF THE ROOF
Ethan clings to the iron ladder on the side of the chimney, his robe fluttering in the wind.
BACK TO SCENE
JIMMY
An escaped wacko! What a picture!
Jimmy opens the trunk of his car, takes out his camera bag, removes his Nikon, and starts fumbling around trying to change his 50mm lens for a telephoto. Linda watches Ethan with an expression of growing concern on her face.
SELENA
Come down from there, you foo1...
Although she is forty feet below him, Ethan hears her voice as though it were inches away from his ear.
SELENA
(continuing)
...before you get blown off and kill yourself.
Ethan is so surprised at hearing her voice so close that he looks around with a start, misses his footing, and nearly falls off the ladder.
JIMMY'S CAR
Jimmy gasps with anguish, as he struggles to mount his telephoto lens, dropping lens caps, film boxes, and filters all over the place.
LINDA
Someone's chasing him.
JIMMY
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the
accident with Lucy?
LINDA
Yes.
JIMMY
The scoop of the year!
He starts shooting film. His motor drive whirrs.
SELENA
It'll be dark soon. And cold. Come down while you've
got the chance.
Ethan reaches the top of the chimney. He climbs over the lip of the brickwork and stands up, half hidden in the thick white smoke belching from the chimney.
ETHAN
No. She'll come for me. Like she did the last time.
My angel.
He starts to cough from the smoke and nearly loses his balance.
SELENA
She's not coming for you. I killed her. She's dead.
Ethan is staggered by this news. He reacts as though he had been punched in the gut.
ETHAN
No. I don't believe you. It's not true. She's alive
somewhere. My angel. My love--
He falls off the chimney, and catches himself on the lip of the brickwork. He hangs there by
one hand.
SELENA'S VOICE
You idiot!
Jimmy runs out of film. He frantically rips off the magazine and tries to load a fresh one, while Ethan dangles.
JIMMY
There goes my Pulitzer Prize.
Linda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below.
A red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof.
Ethan's grip fails and he falls.
Supergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above.
Selena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment.
Jimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs.
JIMMY
Darn!
He turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac.
JIMMY
Hey lady, did you see that?
Bianca gives him a glance of contempt.
BIANCA
See what?
JIMMY
The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in
mid-air.
BIANCA
Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and
have your head examined.
Supergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love.
ETHAN
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
SUPERGIRL
Who didn't?
ETHAN
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because
she knows I love you.
SUPERGIRL
You love me?
ETHAN
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my
life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking
at you, holding you in my arms...
SUPERGIRL
We have to have a long talk about all this.
ETHAN
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
Selena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her
aura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera.
BIANCA
Home?
SELENA
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a
monkey out of me.
BIANCA
(shrewdly)
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
Selena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity.
SELENA
I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit
whenever I want.
She gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image.
INSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER.
CUT TO:
The park is deserted, in darkness. One by one the lights come on, outlining a1l the structures in jewel-like, fairyland colours. It looks strangely familiar. On some deep level there is a resemblance to Argo City.
THE CAMERA PANS over to reveal Ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes, turning on the lights. Supergirl stands beside him.
ETHAN
This is my favourite place in the city.
SUPERGIRL
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
ETHAN
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a
shopping centre.
He flips the last switch, which starts the Ferris wheel revolving slowly, like a great spiral galaxy in space. Soft music plays.
ETHAN
Like it?
SUPERGIRL
Yes. It reminds me of home.
ETHAN
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
SUPERGIRL
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of
Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
ETHAN
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
SUPERGIRL
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to
find something and I think you can he1p me.
ETHAN
Come on, let's ride.
They walk to the slowly revolving Ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars.
ETHAN
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
SUPERGIRL
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
ETHAN
Let's talk about us, not her.
SUPERGIRL
Tell me where I can find her.
ETHAN
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
Ethan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal.
SUPERGIRL
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her
she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
ETHAN
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of
our lives.
SUPERGIRL
We can't do that.
ETHAN
Why not ?
SUPERGIRL
We're from different worlds.
ETHAN
Just give me a chance to show how much I love
you. Love changes everything. Love makes
everything possib1e.
Selena gets out of her Cadillac and walks to the chained and locked gate. A big sign says KEEP OUT. CONDEMMED PROPERTY. FUTURE SITE OF FUNFAIR MALL SHOPPING PLAZA. She mutters something under her breath and the chains fall away, the locks click open, and the gate glides noiselessly ajar. Se1ena strides in imperiously.
SUPERGIRL
All this talk about love, it's silly.
ETHAN
You don't like me? You hate me?
There is such a look of tragedy on Ethan's face, that Supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes.
SUPERGIRL
Of Course I don't hate you. I
don't hate anyone.
ETHAN
What do you feel about me?
SUPERGIRL
I...I don't know. This is all so sudden.
THE CAMERA RACKS FOCUS FOR A MOMENT TO DISCOVER :
Selena, lurking.be1ow them in the shadows of the Spine Snapper Ride.
ETHAN
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
SUPERGIRL
What's that?
ETHAN
Let me kiss you.
SUPERGIRL
No.
ETHAN
You're not afraid are you?
SUPERGIRL
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
ETHAN
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead.
Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from
years in school.
SUPERGIRL
Well...I guess one is all right.
She closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward.
SUPERGIRL
Is this how?
ETHAN
Terrific.
Their lips meet. Zowie.
SELENA
What a touching scene!
Her voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. Ethan and Supergirl pull apart. The Ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. Selena is standing beside them. Supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her.
SUPERGIRL
Who are you ?
SELENA
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both
be sorry.
SUPERGIRL
I don't scare that easily.
Selena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box.
SELENA
All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him,
nobody can.
She holds the gargoyle box out toward the Ferris wheel.
SELENA
Coffer of Shadow, show your Power!
INSERT C.U. OF THE BOLTS HOLDING ETHAN'S GONDOLA TO THE FERRIS WHEEL: THE BOLTS UNSCREW AND FALL OUT.
BACK TO SCENE
Ethan yells as his gondola falls off the Ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the DODGEM CARS.
Supergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain.
Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena.
Selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her.
SUPERGIRL
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
SELENA
A cheap trick.
SUPERGIRL
Cheap but effective.
Selena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. One by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. Nothing works.
SELENA
Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope.
Ka-ma-hoochie!
Bianca appears out of the shadows. Selena looks up, embarrassed.
BIANCA
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
SELENA
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
Bianca pauses uncertainly.
BIANCA
Why don't you use the Coffer of Shadow?
SELENA
(evasively)
I don't feel like it right now.
BIANCA
She didn't take it from you, did she?
SELENA
That little girl? Ha.
Now go on, get me some tools.
BIANCA
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Bianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it.
BIANCA
Sycoraka f'kah s'koo...
The bars fall down like boiled spaghetti. Selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity.
SELENA
Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of
the seven.
Bianca bows.
BIANCA
Yes, mistress.
Bianca hurries off toward the parking lot. Selena watches her until she turns the corner of the Haunted House. Then Selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the GARGOYLE BOX.
SELENA
There you are. Come to mama.
She takes out the box, s1ips it inside her cloak, and stands up. She casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat, and strides off after Bianca.
CUT TO:
Supergirl lands Ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. Palm trees wave over a white sand beach. The blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. Gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. Ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene.
SUPERGIRL
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
ETHAN
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
SUPERGIRL
But I have to go back. I brought you here so
you'd be safe. From her.
ETHAN
You can't just abandon me.
Alone.
His words strike a sensitive nerve in her. She relents.
SUPERGIRL
I'll stay for a while.
Ethan is filled with enthusiasm.
ETHAN
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with
a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a
garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes---
anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon,
and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
SUPERGIRL
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Ethan's face falls. He looks at her beseechingly.
SUPERGIRL
Well, maybe a little longer than that.
She smiles and takes his hand. Together they walk along the beach.
CUT TO:
Rolls Royces, limos, and Maserattis parked in the driveway. It looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. A helicopter lands on the front lawn. The ELDERLY MAN from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane. Behind him the helicopter takes off again. Selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily.
SELENA
You're late.
ELD ERL Y MAN
The President was giving a speech. I couldn't just
walk out.
SELENA
You're more afraid of the President than me???
ELDERLY MAN
No, of course not.
Ethan wanders along the beach with Supergirl, holding hands. She stops to pick up a seashell. Ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. Supergirl kneels beside him.
SUPERGIRL
Ethan, what IS wrong?
Ethan opens his eyes and looks at her. He speaks in a voice of bleak despair.
ETHAN
She said it wouldn't last.
SUPERGIRL
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Ethan sits up, wincing like someone with a bad hangover.
ETHAN
I don't love you any more.
SUPERGIRL
Just like that?
ETHAN
Like turning off a light.
He struggles to his feet and stands there unsteadily.
ETHAN
I feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All that
mushy talk.
He lurches off into the undergrowth, toward the interior of the island. She plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him.
SUPERGIRL
Where are you going?
ETHAN
Away. From you.
SUPERGIRL
But why?
ETHAN
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
SUPERGIRL
I sort of like what you said.
ETHAN
That makes it worse.
SUPERGIRL
But I don't understand.
He stops and stares at her for a moment.
ETHAN
Of course you don't. We're from two different
worlds, remember?
He stalks off into the jungle, leaving her behind, hurt and bewildered.
CUT TO:
Ethan is sitting beside a stream on a gravelly bank idly tossing pebbles into the water. Supergirl steps out of the jungle and watches for a moment. Then she comes and sits down beside him.
ETHAN
Hi.
SUPERGIRL
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
ETHAN
I'm not mad at you.
SUPERGIRL
It seemed that way to me.
ETHAN
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
SUPERGIRL
Miss what?
ETHAN
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I
woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more:
something that made me feel really alive and aware of
things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything
fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world
around us--like we were a wonderful song...
He falls silent, and tosses a few pebbles into the stream.
SUPERGIRL
And now?
ETHAN
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words
don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
SUPERGIRL
Well...I don It know much about these things, but maybe
if you had that feeling once...it can, come back.
He turns to her hopefully.
ETHAN
You think so?
SUPERGIRL
I don't see why not.
ETHAN
But what if---it wasn't real?
SUPERGIRL
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours
forever.
Ethan's face lights up. The future begins to exist for him again.
ETHAN
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we
could get together every now and then and see each
other. And maybe something might. happen again.
What do you think?
SUPERGIRL
Are you asking me for a "date"?
ETHAN
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm---
available.
SUPERGIRL
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
ETHAN
She'll forget about us eventually.
CUT TO:
Supergirl becomes very excited.
SUPERGIRL
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo
City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
ETHAN
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better
stay away from there.
SUPERGIRL
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only
thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't
see the Power Source at the amusement park.
She stands up.
ETHAN
Wait. Don't leave me.
SUPERGIRL
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have
the Power Source.
He stands up and takes her hand.
ETHAN
Before you go...
SUPERGIRL
What?
ETHAN
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
SUPERGIRL
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
ETHAN
Yes.
She closes her eyes and parts her lips. Slowly their lips come together and touch. Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. A cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. Selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away.
SUPERGIRL
Ethan!
Supergirl flies into the air.
Supergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed, searching for Ethan and Selena. She hovers like an eagle for a moment, then speeds straight upwards.
Supergirl flies back to North America, faster than she has ever flown before.
Supergirl zeros in on Selena's house like an exocet.
Supergirl lands and walks cautiously up to the front door, ready for anything but what she finds: the front door is ajar. She pushes it open with a creak of its massive hinges. She walks slowly inside.
CONSERVATORY
Ethan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. Behind him he hears Selena's laughter. He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.
INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.
The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr.
SELENA
I told you I'd win.
BACK TO SCENE
Ethan is held by the spell of her magic. And yet there is part of him that still resists. You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand. A zap of energy passes between them at her touch.
SELENA
Kiss me.
He embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. She rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure.
Supergirl flies over the Rockies toward Selena's house.
DISSOLVE TO:
Supergirl flies over Selena's new house. For the first time we can see the enormousness of it:
a grotesque, towering monstrosity, that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape.
Supergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right.
The flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears.
Another kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY.
She hops a few more times, with no more success.
She picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected.
Suddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away.
ALURA'S VOICE
Kara, where are you?
KARA
Mother? I can hardly hear you.
ALURA. S VOICE
Kara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared
from the scanners...
KARA
I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore.
And I'm weak.
ALURA'S VOICE
Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the
Power Source. The City is dying.
KARA
Then send someone else. I failed.
ALURA'S VOICE
We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no
longer have the power to push through.
KARA
But Mother, I'm lost.
ALURA' S VOICE
You must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . .
The rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost.
KARA
Mother---I tried. I really tried.
Kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly.
CUT TO:
Establishing shot.
Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off.
She hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres.
Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar.
SUPERGIRL
Zaltar.
Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground.
ZALTAR
Kara? Is it you?
Supergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body.
SUPERGIRL
What is this place?
ZALTAR
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you
come here from Argo City?
SUPERGIRL
I was on Earth...
ZALTAR
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
SUPERGIRL
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
ZALTAR
Shouldnt've done that.
SUPERGIRL
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me
to the Phantom Zone.
ZALTAR
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can
unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
SUPERGIRL
I know.
ZALTAR
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house.
You can stay with me, until I build you your own
place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others--
not our type of people.
He helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of Argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City.
SUPERGIRL
Others?
ZALTAR
Criminals.
Zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right.
ZALTAR
A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid
them. And you should too.
Zaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures. She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his "tree" in Argo City.
SUPERGIRL
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
ZALTAR
What? Palace? Hardly.
SUPERGIRL
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
ZALTAR
Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style.
Must try something new.
DAY
The financial district. Bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large, imposing banks. Passersby ignore the bonanza, and trudge dejectedly on.
DAY
People are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. The store manager shakes his head and sends them away. The only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a Rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock.
DAY
The CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE ROOF TO:
They walk out onto the balcony. The crowds scream her name. She waves smiling. Ethan stands a step behind her with a moody expression on his face.
SELENA
Smile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more,
you're Prince Ethan now.
Ethan lifts his hand and waves half-heartedly.
BENEATH THE BALCONY
The crowd is enormous, held back behind police barricades. Guards in the special livery of Selena's service hold back the surging tide of humanity: people .praying, chanting, walking on their knees, cripples on crutches, the ailing on stretchers carried by relatives. And in front a disciplined youth group in a distinctive costume perform chants and fanatic cheers. Huge banners display Selena's portrait. Images of her are everywhere.
The roadside complex where Lucy's traffic accident occurred. The Hamburger Place is boarded up. The area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street. All of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of Selena. The only writing is in mystic symbols. A lone figure walks furtively along the street. It is LUCY LANE, her face disguised with dark glasses. She goes to the rear of the abandoned Hamburger Place and knocks four times. The door opens quickly and she ducks inside.
They emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone. Zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings, then strikes out with long energetic strides. Supergirl hurries to keep up with him.
SUPERGIRL
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a
man with such a selfish heart create beauty?"
She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous
heart.
ZALTAR
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place,
that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling
at you. Boring!
Supergirl scampers along beside him, smiling. Zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house, but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead.
MR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan.
SELENA
Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the
serpents will drop them one by one.
Selena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool.
INSERT: REFLECTING POOL
The empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples.
BACK TO SCENE
ETHAN
Why the empty cage?
SELENA
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and
see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd
hate to lose you, Ethan.
Selena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees.
INSERT: REFLECTING POOL
Behind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections.
BACK TO SCENE
Selena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight.
ETHAN
What...?
SELENA
You don't get this far without paying...a
certain price.
She turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan.
MR. DANVERS
If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her.
MRS . DANVERS
I'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you.
She stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her.
JIMMY
(shyly)
I've been in love with you for years. Remember
how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom?
And put your fingerprints on my lens.
LUCY
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're
attention.
JIMMY
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what...
all this time?
LUCY
You bet your ass.
JIMMY
Why didn't you tell me?
LUCY
You're supposed to guess.
She reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers.
Supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her.
SUPERGIRL
Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart.
She looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her.
SUPERGIRL
Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you.
She stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet.
Supergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof.
SUNSET
Selena and Supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun.
SELENA
Where is inner space?
SUPERGIRL
It's everywhere. But water is always
the door.
They plunge down into the sun's reflection on the sea surface.
