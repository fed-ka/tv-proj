	Lois and Clark exit her house, walk down the driveway.

		Poor woman.  Her husband's

		she thinks he's turned invisible.

				CLARK
		How do you know he isn't?

				LOIS
		Clark, are you serious?  We're
		talking about a figment of
		somebody's overactive
		imagination.

				CLARK
		Does everything in life have to
		have a perfectly reasonable
		explanation?

				LOIS
		Everything.

				CLARK
		All grounded in clear, scientific
		reality?

				LOIS
		Of course.

				CLARK
		No magic left in the universe?

				LOIS
		No werewolves or vampires loose
		in the city, either.

		What about Superman?

				LOIS
		Huh?

				CLARK
		Superman.  There's a guy living

	Lois glances up in the sky, shakes her head in disgust.

				LOIS
		Oh, no. Not him again.

				CLARK
		Who?

	Clark looks up.

				LOIS
		Unbelievable! The nerve of that
		guy!

				CLARK
		He's persistent.

				LOIS
		He's a smarmy, money-grubbing
		opportunist! They all are!
		Everybody wants a piece of
		Superman! Keys to the city,
		telethons, benefits... What's
		next, a guest shot on A.M.
		Metropolis? Where's it all going
		to end?

				CLARK
		Are you worried that all this
		will go to Superman's head?

	A Man, the same man that we saw watching Mrs. Morris on TV, 
	and still wearing a hat, sunglasses, and a trench coat, stands in 
	the shadow of a lamp post, under the pouring rain.  As he steps
	into the light, he stands right beside a Wanted poster on the 
	lamp post, with his likeness on it.  The man is HENRY BARNES.  
	A bolt of lightning illuminates another sign on the fence	(X)

	Detective Burke, the Metropolis Police and their equivalent-to-
	SWAT-team have surrounded the massive old building perimeter.
	The fort door opens.  The police are at the ready, but do not
	see the ARMY OF INVISIBLE MEN who come out.  An over-anxious
	SWAT team member FIRES.

				BURKE
		Hold your fire! They may have
		hostages.

	But, it's too late. The invisible gang starts firing back.
	Burke and his squad are at a terrible loss, being shot at, but
	unable to return the fire.  Then, from above, a rain of a
	finely-ground, powdery substance begins to fall over the whole
	area.

	As the powder coats him, he becomes visible: the suit glows

		You want it in writing, right?

		I can't.

		But, all proceeds go to charity.
