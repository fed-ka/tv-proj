        A cloudless, cold evening under a sky sharp with stars. Few
        people brave the chill that invades the air. At the top of
        the wide steps, the hotel doors open and a woman in a black
        cape emerges into the night. This is LISA CAMPBELL. Over
        this:

                                      VINCENT (V.O.)
                      You darkness, that I come from,/
                        I love you more than all the
                        fires/ that fence in the world,/


    2CLOSE LISA2

          Etherially beautiful, descending the stairs. She pauses and
        looks back up at the hotel, her long hair blowing about her
          face... eyes wide as a frightened deer that flees the lion.
        Seeing nothing, she pushes forward.

                                      VINCENT (V. O.)
                      for the fire makes / a circle of
                        light for everyone,/

        As Lisa hurries down the slick sidewalk, swallowed into the
        night.

                                      VINCENT (V. O.)
                      and then no one outside learns of
                        you./                                                                                        2


        An alto sax is heard, faint and faraway, seeming to draw Lisa
          onward. Breathlessly, she turns a corner, stops dead
        in her tracks, listens ..... Nothing except the sax. Nobody
        is following. She continues moving, this caped figure in the
        dark. Finally, around yet another corner, she comes upon
          CLARENCE, playing his lonely sax, to the lonely night-- case
        opend before him

                                      VINCENT (V. O.)
                      But the darkness pulls in
                        everything:/


    5CLOSE LISA5

        With trembling hands and bowed head, she takes a sealed
        envelope from the folds of her cape and drops it into the case.
        Clarence doesn't miss a beat but his eyes widen ever
        so slightly .... as he watches her withdraw.

                                      VINCENT (V.O.)
                        shapes and fires, animals and
                        myself,/

        as Lisa quickly makes her way back towards the hotel.

                                                VINCENT (V.O.)
                      how easily it gathers them! --/
                        powers and people--/


    7WIDER ANGLE7

        Lisa hastens back along an alley. From the opposite side of
        the street, a shadowed figure of a man watches her.


    88SHADOWED MAN

        Close on the intent face of COLLIN HEMMINGS (British). A well
        dressed, heavy set man, his shrewd eyes following her.

                                      VINCENT (V.O.)
                        and it is possible a great
                        energy /

        Catherine looks at Vincent with concern. This message from
        the past has clearly affected him...

                                      VINCENT
                      A message in the night... It said so
                      little -- and yet I could feel the
                        urgency, her need.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                            7.

                                VINCENT
                          No. It's almost as if I imagined it.


                                        CATHY
                          There's a touring company here
                          now. She might be with them...

                          Your memories must be strong.

                          She left us so many years ago. We
                          heard of her successes. Helpers
                          would bring us news.

                                        CATHY
                          I saw her dance once...

            Vincent looks at her, waiting for more...

                                        CATHY
                          It was truly inspired.

                          ... Yes.

                                        CATHY
                          Did she leave the tunnels in order to
                          dance..?

            Vincent has no immediate response...

                                        CATHY
                          To follow her dream..?

                                (a long, troubled beat)
                          That is not why she left --
                          although, it might have been a
                          reason in time...

                                        CATHY
                          Why did she leave?

                                  (painful certainty)
                          ... Because I loved her.

                                                                      CUT TO:                                                                                          8.



          Lisa huddles on the ledge, fighting back her fear as she
          glances down at the long drop beneath her. Her breath coming in
          gasps, as she struggles to her feet. Her fingers dig into the
          bricks of the wall behind her as she inches along toward the
          fire escape, deftly balancing on the marginal footing. She
          edges forward, cringing as she HEARS Collin knocking at the
          door. The wind gusts about her, billowing her dress and hair.
          Almost a gothic image as she traverses the brick 'tower.'




          Lisa stretches her trembling fingers for the iron guard rail.
          From her room the SOUND of Collin's knocking grows louder,
          more insistant. Clutching the rail tightly, she leaps over.
          Without pause, she lunges toward the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:                                                                                          17.



          As Lisa speeds downward. Lightly, her nimble feet a
          blur... a 'bourree'. Down one flight, two flights.

                                                                      CUT TO:



          Lisa struggles to release the ladder that drops to the street,
          but it's rusted shut. Clutching the bottom of the grated
            platform, Lisa lowers herself over the edge.



          Lisa drops to the alley. Rolling as she lands, she bounds

          to her feet and races toward the street.



          Lisa runs desperately into the street, dodging traffic as
          cars screech to a halt and swerve to miss her, horns blaring.
          Lisa runs into the park and disappears in the trees, just as:


    3838COLLIN

            rounds the corner to the fire escape landing... but Lisa is
          nowhere in sight. He looks up, spitting mad, at the curtains
            billowing from Lisa's window.

                                                                      CUT TO:                                                                                          18.



          Like a frightened gazelle, Lisa runs swiftly across the
          grasses of the park.



          Lisa runs down the drainage duct and disappears inside...



      to establish.



        LONG SHOT

        Cathy exits her building, hails a cab... and as she enters the
        cab.

        RACK FOCUS

        to reveal that she's being watched from a late model Jaguar
        across the street. Inside it are Collin and a cohort, JOHN
        FARLEY -- who twists on the ignition and pulls away from
        the curb after Cathy.

                                                                    CUT TO:                                                                            33.



        Collin has come up beside Cathy on the busy street, wrapped his
        arm around her shoulder with one hand, the other hand pressing
        a gun concealed by a folded newspaper into her side.


                                      CATHY
                      Let go of me!

        Cathy struggles in his grip, but he jams the point of the gun
        into her ribs with a quiet, but ominous smile.

                                      COLLIN
                              (very dry)
                      Come, let's go for a drive, shall we?


        As he shoves her sharply toward the curb, into the idling
        Jaguar, which screeches away from the curb into traffic.

                                                                  CUT TO:

          A creeping mist rises from the rain slicked asphalt. The
        Jaguar pulls to a quick stop, and the driver door opens.
        John gets out and opens the back door, jerking Cathy
        violently from the car. Collin follows, shutting the door
          behind, following Cathy and John into an empty furniture
        factory.

                                                                  CUT TO:

          A throng of people mill about the front steps -- reporters,
          police, onlookers. Cathy is among them. "Think she'll show?"
          "She's already late." "No one's seen her for days." Then, a
          limo approaches and pulls to the curb. Instantly the moment
          comes alive as reporters surround the car with cameras,
          microphones. "It's her." "There she is."







                                                                                       44.

      The back door opens and a suited man gets out: Lisa's
        LAWYER. He turns and extends his hand to Lisa, who steps to
      the curb beside him. She wears a tasteful black suit and
        smiles charmingly for the cameras as her lawyer tries to
        shield her and get her to the steps.
