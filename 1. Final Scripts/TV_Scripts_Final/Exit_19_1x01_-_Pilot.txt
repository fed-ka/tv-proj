                                        ACT ONE

      INT. GLORIA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- MORNING

      CLOSE ON GLORIA.  She has a face that people immediately
      trust.  It's not just that she's lovely, there is depth and
      humor, and though it's well concealed, there is pain.  Perhaps
      her most remarkable feature is her eyes.  They don't miss a
      thing.  They're full of intelligence and compassion.  At
      this moment, however, they're a little impatient. 

      We'll notice that look a lot.

      REVERSE -- GLORIA'S POV: The TIMER on a microwave counting
      down the last three seconds... 3,2,1, DING:

      Gloria immediately YANKS open the microwave's door, pulls
      out a MUG of COFFEE, and she's on the move.  That's the other
      thing we'll notice.  This is a woman who is in perpetual
      motion.  Curious.  Brilliant.  But has trouble standing still. 

      WIDEN AND REVEAL: The kitchen is large, cluttered, but warm. 
      Post-it notes are scattered across everything: cupboards,
      closets and drawers.  They are reminders, directions and
      affirmations.  

      Gloria's eight-year-old son, LEO, is sitting at the table
      eating a bowl of cereal.  

                                      GLORIA
                    Why can't we live in a world where
                    there's a magic box and all you have
                    to do is say to the box, "I'd like a
                    coffee" or "waffles" or "blue
                    sweater," and it instantly appears. 
                    No timers, no waiting, just..., "DING,
                    here you go, Gloria." 

      She sets her coffee down across from Leo, playfully grabs
      him by the hair...

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    You're smart, invent that box for me.

      Before he can reply, she's on the move, calls up the stairs,

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Come on, Nicholas...  You need to
                    eat something before school. 

      Gloria grabs a PAD OF POST-ITS.  Jots something down.  While
      she's doing this, we might notice the wall behind her has
      large swaths of color as if she were considering painting,
      but hadn't decided upon a palette.  She glances up as...

      Her other son, NICK (11), shuffles into the kitchen, still
      in his pajamas.                                                                                         2.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    No you don't.  Back upstairs and get
                    dressed.

                                    NICK
                    Uncle Davey's still in the bathroom.

                                      DAVEY (O.S.)
                    No...

      Gloria's younger brother, DAVEY, hurries through the kitchen. 
      He's wearing a shirt, but has a towel wrapped around his
      waist.  He's mid-thirties, handsome, but we get the sense
      that he's never quite figured out the whole adult thing.

                                      DAVEY (CONT'D)
                    ...Uncle Davey is showered, shaved and
                    one pair of boxer briefs away from 
                    walking out the door.

      Davey dashes through the kitchen and down the basement stairs.

                                      GLORIA
                    C'mon, Nick, don't make us late.

      Nick heads back upstairs.  Leo looks over at Gloria as she
      unplugs the toaster.

                                    LEO
                    Mom, there's plenty of time.

                                      GLORIA
                    You're young.  You'll learn. --
                    There's never enough time.

      O.S. someone KNOCKS on the FRONT DOOR.  Gloria looks in that
      direction.  Now what?!  She peels off the note, crosses to
      Leo...

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Go brush your teeth.

      ...Sticks the Post-It down on the table in front of him,
      picks up a trash bag and exits.  Leo looks down at the note:

      CLOSE ON -- THE NOTE: "LEO, INVENT MAGIC BOX!"

      Off Leo, used to this kind of behavior:

      INT. GLORIA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- MORNING

      ANOTHER POLITE KNOCK.  Gloria opens the front door:

      INT./EXT. GLORIA'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

      Gloria sees a smiling, pretty WOMAN in her mid-thirties.                                                                                          3.

                                      KATIE
                    Good morning. -- I'm Katie Silvers. 
                    We live over there...

      She points catty-corner to a perfectly finished, beautifully
      landscaped home across the street.  Gloria just stares at
      her, as if perplexed why this woman would be visiting.

                                      KATIE (CONT'D)
                          (gives another hint)
                    My daughter, Olivia, is in Nick's class.

                                      GLORIA
                    Oh, hi... Welcome to the neighborhood.

      Gloria shakes Katie's hand.  

      Katie's quest for perfection is only matched by her love of
      family and her desire to be liked.  

                                      KATIE
                    Actually we've lived here for nine years.

      She smiles like it's a simple misunderstanding.

                                      GLORIA
                    Oh.  My bad.  I'm kinda new at this
                    talking to the neighbors thing. 
                    We've only been here --

                                      KATIE
                    -- Three months... I remember when
                    the trucks came.
                          (again, she smiles)
                    Of course, I met your brother a while
                    ago when he lived here with his wife. 

      Katie tries to peek around Gloria into the house.  Rather than
      invite Katie in, Gloria closes the door behind her and heads
      toward the trash cans down at the curb. 

      EXT. GLORIA'S HOUSE - PORCH -- MORNING

      This is our first look at the house from the outside.  Not
      as well manicured as Katie's, but it's a nice, middle-class,
      two-story in a quaint, Long Island neighborhood.  Like the
      interior, it has potential, it just needs a little love.   

                                      GLORIA
                    If this is a Scout, carpool or PTA
                    thing, my brother Davey, runs point
                    on most of that stuff. 

                                      KATIE
                    You're a police detective, right?                                                                                        4.

                                      GLORIA
                    Is there a problem?

      Gloria puts the plastic bag into the trash can.

                                      KATIE
                    Well.... Yes.  There've been several
                    thefts in the neighborhood.
                          (glances around)
                    Some of us on the block thought you
                    might be able to help...

                                      GLORIA
                    Okay... What's been stolen?

                                      KATIE
                    Gnomes. 

      Gloria stares at her. 

                                      GLORIA
                    Gnomes?

                                      KATIE
                    At least mine was a gnome.  But we're
                    missing all kinds of lawn ornaments --
                      flamingos, geese...

                                      GLORIA
                    I see... 
                          (then)
                    I gotta be honest, gnomes are a little
                    outside my jurisdiction.

      Gloria turns and faces her.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Now if you find a severed head, give
                    me a call. -- I've had a lot of success
                    with severed heads. 

      They stare at each other for a beat, like two ethnographers,
      studying the rituals of neighboring tribes.  Then, Gloria's
      cell phone rings.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Nice meeting you. 

      Gloria answers her phone,

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Sheppard!

      And heads back into her house.  SCORE KICKS IN and we MONTAGE
      Gloria into:                                                                                        5.

      EXT./INT. GLORIA'S EXPLORER - LINDENHURST, NY -- DAY

      CLOSE ON -- GLORIA: driving through the Village of
        Lindenhurst.  Quintessential Americana... Neighborhood shops
      and stores opening for the day... A MAILMAN talking to a MOM
      on the sidewalk..., 

      KIDS getting on a schoolbus... an ELDERLY WOMAN walking her
      TEENY DOG... 

      EXT./INT. GLORIA'S EXPLORER - WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE -- DAY

      High and wide.  Gloria driving across the steel bridge.  It's
      a lovely, cumulous cloud kind of day.

      CLOSE ON -- GLORIA: as she crosses over the murky green East
      River and into Manhattan.  She loves this drive.  This city. 
      It's as if Dorothy gets to commute between Kansas and Oz.

      INT./EXT.  NYC - GLORIA'S CAR -- DAY

      Quick shots of Gloria driving through crowded Manhattan
      streets.  Music cuts out hard as:

      EXT. DAVIS PARK -- DAY

      Gloria SLAMS her car door and heads toward a crime scene in
      this sketchy, urban park.  We notice she's wearing an elegant,
      long coat.  She loves this coat and almost always wears it
      on the job.  She feels strong and invincible in it. 

      CAMERA LEADS HER as she passes a few SQUAD CARS, the M.E.s
      VAN, and a HANDFUL of COPS.  One of the UNIFORMS lifts the
      POLICE TAPE as Gloria flashes her badge. 

      Gloria sees some people, including a MEDICAL TECH huddled
      around the sprawled body of a DEAD MAN.  A woman, next to
      the body, spots Gloria and hurries toward her.  

      Her name is, DETECTIVE MICHELLE DULCETT.  She is a voluptuous
      black woman in her early thirties.  Her well-tailored pants
      suit flatters, rather than diminishes her physique.  Brooklyn
      born and raised, there is nothing that intimidates her. 
      Except, on occasion, Gloria.

                                      MICHELLE
                    You want the bad news or the worse
                    news?

                                      GLORIA
                    You know me.

                                      MICHELLE
                    Okay, the worse news is that Van
                    Stone's been assigned lead Detective
                    on the case.                                                                                          6.

      Gloria glances around looking for him.

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm sure in one of our past lives we
                    did something to deserve him...
                          (then)
                    And the bad...?

                                      MICHELLE
                          (indicating the dead man)
                    You're looking at it. 

      They step closer to the Dead Man as Gloria slips on latex
      gloves.  The Man is white, mid-fifties, sharp suit.  Blood
      has pooled out of the back of his head and there is more
      blood splattered on the nearby bench.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    Phillip Campbell.  He's kind of a
                    big deal.  Hedge fund guy.  

                                      GLORIA
                    Aren't all those guys big deals?

                                      MICHELLE
                    Yeah, but Campbell's the mayor's
                    hedge fund guy.  Lots of pressure
                    from downtown to tie this up fast.

      Gloria glances around.  Notices a derelict swing set.  A
      DRUNK passed out on a bench.  A CHURCH across the street.

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess
                    he doesn't live or work around here.

                                      MICHELLE
                          (confirms)
                    Other end of the island.

      Gloria bends down for a closer look at Campbell as the MEDICAL
      TECH collects evidence nearby.

      GLORIA'S POV -- CAMPBELL: she spends a moment drinking in
      the details: clean shaven, expensive haircut, designer tie...
      even in death she can see he was handsome.

      CLOSE ON -- CAMPBELL'S HAND:  as Gloria examines it.  Three
      fingers are grotesquely bent backward.

                                      GLORIA
                    He had a briefcase or bag or something
                    he didn't want to give up.

                                      MICHELLE
                    Yeah. 
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        7.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    He either got pushed, or fell and
                    cracked his skull open on the bench
                    there.  Doesn't seem premeditated.
                          (then)
                    Van Stone said we should investigate
                    under the theory of --

                                      GLORIA
                    -- A mugging gone bad?         

      Michelle nods.  Gloria pulls back the man's coat sleeve
      revealing an EXPENSIVE WRIST WATCH.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Call me crazy, but when I mug a guy,
                    I take his 30,000 dollar watch.

      She looks over at the Med Tech.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    He still have a wallet on him?

      The Tech nods.  Gloria and Michelle exchange a look.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    Okay, worst mugger ever.

                                      MICHELLE
                    It happens. 

      The Med Tech pulls the WALLET out of a zippie bag and hands
      it to Gloria.  She flips through it, notices a:

      CLOSE ON -- A PSYCHIC'S BUSINESS CARD: MADAME NATALIA.  

      Gloria shows it to Michelle.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    I didn't know dudes saw psychics.

                                      GLORIA
                    Creepy, right? -- Like a guy in a
                    nail salon. 

                                      MICHELLE
                    Or a back waxer....

      Gloria tucks the card back into the wallet.  Michelle scans
      the area.  Has her theory.

                                      MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    Y'know, Glo, I feel dirty saying it,
                    but I think I'm with Van Stone on
                    this one.  Some meth head probably
                    grabbed the briefcase, tried to bolt
                    and Campbell fought back.                                                                                         8.

                    Maybe... Or the thing in the briefcase
                    was what he was after.

      Michelle shoots Gloria a look.

                                      MICHELLE
                    You know, I hate when you say "maybe"
                    like that.  

                                      GLORIA
                    Why's that?

                                      MICHELLE
                    Because it doesn't mean, "maybe", it
                    means, you have a different theory
                    and you think everyone else is wrong.

      Gloria stands up.  

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm just wondering what Campbell was
                    carrying that was worth dying for
                    and why he was hanging out in a park
                    at the ass end of the island?    

                                    VAN STONE (O.S.)
                    I don't care why.  I just care we
                    catch the dirtbag who killed him. 

      Gloria looks over as DETECTIVE JOE VAN STONE steps up.        
      Van Stone has the vanity and bitterness of a man who feels
      he is a giant trapped in the body of a tiny man.  He glances
      at his watch, as if Gloria's late.

                                    VAN STONE (CONT'D)
                    Nice of you to show up, Shepherd.

                    Mugging gone south, how hard can it be? 
                          (then)
                    Check out that church, see if anybody
                    saw anything..., I gotta drive up to
                    the Upper Eastside and tell this
                    guy's wife the good news.

      As he turns and walks away...

      Off her "innocent" offer:

      EXT.  NYC - UPPER EAST SIDE STREET -- DAY

      Gloria and Michelle walk along the busy sidewalk.

                                      MICHELLE

                                      GLORIA

                          (sees through the act)
                    Because we both know that the only
                    thing worse than being told your
                    loved one is dead, is hearing it
                    from an asshole like Van Stone.

      Gloria fights a smile. 

                                      GLORIA
                    You're giving me too much credit,
                    Chelle. -- If Van Stone's right, and
                    it was a junkie who killed Campbell,

                    he's wrong, we'll need to talk to a

                          (making a turn)
                    Hey, is my breath okay?

      She leans close to Michelle and forces an open-mouthed breath.        
      Michelle scrunches her nose.

                                      MICHELLE
                    Ehh, so so...

      Clearly, this behavior isn't foreign to her.

      Gloria starts rummaging through her bag in front of an
      expensive brownstone.  

                                      MICHELLE
                    You don't buy the mugger theory at

      Gloria's not listening.  She pulls a pack of Tic-Tacs out of
      her purse.

      building.  Gloria chomps her mint.

                                      MICHELLE
                          (after a beat)
                    I hate this part.

      Gloria nods in agreement.  The two women turn and enter the
      high end residence. 

      INT.  CAMPBELL HOME -- DAY

      CLOSE ON -- MARGARET CAMPBELL, early-fifties, lovely,
      perfectly coifed, tough -- a woman who's seemingly modeled
      herself on Nancy Reagan.

                    down there?

      REVERSE -- GLORIA AND MICHELLE: having just given Mrs.
      Campbell the sad news, and not getting the reaction they had
      braced themselves for.

                                      MICHELLE
                    We were hoping you might be able to
                    tell us.

      WIDEN AND REVEAL: we are in a posh sitting room; a formal
      place to receive guests, in an expansive home that has a
      room for every occasion.

                                      MARGARET CAMPBELL
                    Phillip didn't talk to me about his
                    business and I didn't bother him
                    with details of the house.  It's how
                    we stayed married all these years.                                                                                        11.

      Gloria studies Margaret Campbell, watches for tics or tells.

                                      MICHELLE
                    So you weren't aware of any threats
                    against your husband?  Anyone who
                    might want to hurt him?

                                      MARGARET CAMPBELL
                    Everyone loved Phillip.  Why shouldn't
                    they?  He made them lots of money.

      The front door opens and a teenage boy, SAM, enters in a
      prep school uniform.  His mother stands and he hurries to
      her.  She holds her son tightly.

                                      MARGARET CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                    Sammy, I'm so sorry...

      Gloria and Michelle exchange a look, not wanting to be voyeurs
      to the pain, as the mother comforts her son.  Gloria notices
      a large, beautifully framed illustration of the signs of the
      zodiac on the wall next to her.

                                      MARGARET CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                          (to Sam)
                    Wait for me in your room and I'll be
                    right in, okay?

      Sam glances at Gloria...

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm sorry for your loss.

      Sam nods and hurries out.  After he's left, Margaret turns
      to the detectives.

                                      MARGARET CAMPBELL
                    Well, this certainly isn't the morning
                    I was expecting. 
                          (then)
                    Anyone else need a drink?

      Off Gloria and Michelle as Margaret Campbell strides away:

      Gloria and Michelle exit the building.  Head back up the

                    Campbell didn't wanna give up the money. 
                          (then)
                    But what the hell was he doing in
                    that lousy park?  

                                      GLORIA
                    I just talked with a priest at the
                    church down there.  He i.d.'d
                    Campbell.  Said he'd been in earlier
                    to get a briefcase full of cash
                    blessed.  Campbell told the priest
                    that he was cursed. 

                                      MICHELLE
                    Cursed?  Like how...?

                    Not sure.  But if all his investments
                    turned to crap, he was probably
                      desperate.

                                      MICHELLE
                    You think someone overheard Campbell
                    confiding to the priest and then
                    grabbed the cash?

                    No. -- I think Campbell was set up.

      Michelle didn't see that coming.  Off Gloria, planning to
      dig deeper:

      Off Michelle, realizing not everyone shares her love for Gloria:

      INT. PRECINCT - VIEWING ROOM -- DAY

      A small dingy room full of Men: VAN STONE, DETECTIVE
        STEIGERWALD, who is middle-aged, thick, but fit, A UNIFORMED
      COP, and A DUDE named CAMERON in a collared shirt.  He's
      about forty.  Through a one-way glass we see a line up room,
      empty except for ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER.

      VAN STONE is in good spirits.          

                                    VAN STONE
                          (to Cameron)
                    So we're gonna bring everybody into
                    that room behind the glass.  You
                    take your time.  They can't see you.
                    Okay?                                                                                        18.

      Cameron nods nervously.  Van Stone raps his college ring
      against the glass and the Officer on the opposite side opens
      a door.  FIVE MEN enter and queue against the wall.

      Gloria enters the viewing room with the detectives while the
      Men settle into place.

                                    VAN STONE
                    Hey, too bad your fortune tellers

      They stare at each other for a beat, then Van Stone forces a
      smile, as if it's all in good fun.  He turns his attention
      to the line up: FIVE MEN, each holding a number, 1-5, in
      front of them.

                    Do you recognize the man who attacked
                    and killed Phillip Campbell?

      CLOSE ON CAMERON -- as he scrutinizes each of the five men.  

      He steps forward to get a better look and as he moves, he
      steps into a shaft of light that gives Gloria her first good
      look at him.  Something about him... 

      Cameron looks over at her.  Unnerved.  Gloria keeps staring. 
      Van Stone gestures toward the line up.

                                    VAN STONE
                          (to Cameron)
                    I want you to take a good look at
                    the men.

      Something's bugging Gloria and she MUST figure it out.  She
      sees a legal pad and sharpie on the table.  GRABS THE SHARPIE.

      CLOSE ON -- CAMERON: staring at the men.

      Cameron turns.  Before anyone knows what's happened, Gloria
      has drawn a moustache on him using the sharpie.

      Cameron struggles to get away.  Wipes at his upper lip.  

                                      CAMERON
                    What are you doin' --

      Steigerwald grabs Cameron.  Van Stone gets between Gloria

                    Outta here... Now. 

      Gloria doesn't move.  Looks past Van Stone.  Keeps her eyes
      trained on Cameron.  Steigerwald is still restraining him. 

      GLORIA'S POV - CAMERON: with the cartoon moustache.  Lights

      Van Stone feels his case falling apart.  Cameron's starting
      to blink a lot.  He looks kinda ridiculous with his moustache.

      Davey and the boys smile as Nick hands Gloria a knife.  As
      she readies her throw, she notices a brand new, chrome
      espresso maker sitting on the kitchen counter.  It's the
      nicest thing in the room, if not the house.  Davey nervously

      idealized, "Bread-Shaped" tupperware container.  It's way
      too big.  

      Thinking quickly, she turns the tupperware upside down on
      the sandwich and presses down hard, using the container like
      a cookie cutter.  The extra-bread and crusts are trimmed off
      by the container.

      Gloria stares at Kathleen a beat.  Reads between the lines.

                    Of course it's sad.  His wife might
                    be a total bitch, but I know he loved
                    his son.  He talked about that.

      Another KNOCK on the front door.  Gloria opens it.

      INT./EXT. GLORIA'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

      Katie Silvers stands on the porch.  A little less smiley
      than the first time.

                    Hi... hope it's not too late.

                    My daughter said you called and wanted
                    me to stop by? 

      Gloria reaches down and hands Katie a large shopping bag

                    I cracked the case.

      Katie pulls a LAWN GNOME with a pointy GREEN HAT out of the

      EXT.  GLORIA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

      It's late.  Most of the lights are out.

      INT.  GLORIA'S HOUSE - LEO'S ROOM -- NIGHT

      Leo's room is filled with cages and terrariums and aquariums. 
      The light from the fish tank shimmers across one wall giving
      everything a magical, calming quality.  

      A reading light casts a patch of brightness on the bed where
      Leo is being tucked in by Gloria.  She's wearing a long
      sleeved t-shirt and nice pajama bottoms.

      ANOTHER UNIFORM STANDS by the door as Gloria, Michelle and

                    Moyers only lived here about three

      Van Stone is questioning Margaret Campbell.  Her lawyer sits
      next to her.  A video camera is recording the confession.

                                    VAN STONE
                    Mrs. Campbell, when did you first
                    learn that your husband had been
                      unfaithful? 

      Before Margaret can respond, there's a sharp KNOCK on the
      door and Gloria steps in.  Van Stone glares over at her.

                                    VAN STONE (CONT'D)
                    We're busy, Sheppard.  I'll talk to

                    I just wanted to say that I don't

                    Out now!

      Van Stone literally charges toward Gloria, but she gets out
      of the room and SLAMS the door behind her.                                                                                         49.

      Kathleen ducks back into her townhouse, steps up to the front
      door.  Gloria clocks her expensive handbag (the one that
      matches the others).  Kathleen starts to dig through it for
      her wallet.

                    Here's what I think happened. -- You
                    learned Campbell was going to lose
                      everything.  Probably even go to
                    jail.  His wife'll get whatever's
                    left, Kathleen Monroe already has a
                    townhouse that he bought her and you
                    end up with bupkis.

      Ashley doesn't respond.

                    all the heavy lifting.  The wife
                    sure as hell isn't putting out. You
                    finally catch a really big fish and
                    he's going bust.  So you thought,

                    Say... three hundred grand.

      circle of light leaks out. Of the many repairs and upgrades
      the house needs, the basement is the most neglected.   

      She crosses over to the dryer, opens it, pulls the dry load
      out and places it into the basket on the machine. As she
      sorts through, looking for the napkins, she hears something,
      like a broom handle that's slid along a wall.
