      EMILY sits on the porch swing watching the sunrise, wearing 
      her father s blue sweater, toying with an object in her hand. 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Believing in something when no one 
                    else will is a lonely proposition. 
                    Some call it faith. Others call it 
                    insanity.

      Emily holds the WATCH Victoria gave her father, flips it 
      over, reads the inscription:  DAVID, UNTIL FOREVER, VICTORIA 

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    By the time my father was sentenced 
                    to prison, the world already 
                    believed him to be something he was 
                    not. I am just now beginning to 
                      understand what that feels like.

                                  DANIEL (O.C.)
                    Hey early bird...

      Emily snaps out of her reverie, discreetly slips the WATCH 
      into her POCKET. DANIEL joins her, hands her a cup of coffee. 

                                  DANIEL (CONT D)
                    No swim this morning?

                                  EMILY
                    Just enjoying the sunrise. Sleep well?  

                                  DANIEL
                    Better than you, I m guessing. 
                    Heard you get up in the middle of 
                    the night again.

                                  EMILY
                    Sorry. Still getting used to having 
                    someone sleeping next to me. I ll 
                    try not to wake you next time.

                                  DANIEL
                    I don t mind. As long as you want 
                    me there...

                                  EMILY
                          (reaching for his hand)
                      I definitely want you there.          REVENGE EP 109 "SUSPICION" 2ND Blue ProdDraft  10/21/11 2.


                                  DANIEL
                          (he smiles, believing her)
                    Got any plans today?

                                  EMILY
                    You re looking at  em. Why?

                                  DANIEL
                    Grayson Global does this  Business 
                    by the Beach  thing every summer. 
                    Basically my dad flies in a group of 
                    obscenely rich people and tries to 
                    get them to invest with the company. 
                    Starts off with an employee 
                      volleyball game this afternoon. 

                                  EMILY
                    And all this time you thought you d 
                    hate this job.

                                  DANIEL
                    Well, jury s still out. But I did 
                    tell my dad I d at least give it a 
                    try, so... come back me up? 

                                  EMILY
                    Always.

      Emily kisses him, then glances over his shoulder at Grayson 
      Manor, noticing VICTORIA watching from her cupola. Emily 
      smiles, relishes torturing her nemesis.


      Jack hoses down the Amanda. AMANDA CLARKE approaches.

                                  AMANDA
                    That boat s almost as handsome as 
                    her captain.

                    Kara. Hey... Where d you run off to 
                    last night? One minute we were

                          (re: boat, playing him)
                    So who s Amanda? An old girlfriend?

                    Nah. Found a motel not too far from

      In the bg, NOLAN strolls up to the wharf, SPOTS Jack and 
      Amanda on the boat, laughing, flirting. Uh-oh. Nolan hides.


      WHACK! Daniel dives to return a serve, keeps the ball in play 
      as it s bounced back to him for a SLAM over the net. Tyler, 
      on the opposing team, dives and misses. Emily and Ashley 
      watch from the sidelines beneath a banner:  Grayson Global 
      Business by the Beach Weekend.  Emily applauds. 

                                  DANIEL

                    Listen to the new guy...

      Daniel grins in friendly rivalry. Tyler, less so. The ball is 
      served and goes into wildly competitive play -- 

                                  ASHLEY
                    Notice how the boys managed to get us

                    Tyler s nothing if not competitive.

      Emily s CELL PHONE RINGS. She looks at the ID, steps away. 

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Excuse me a second. Hello?


      Nolan, on his cell, keeps a distant eye on Amanda, who is 
      making herself very comfortable on Jack s boat. He watches 
      her strip down to her bikini and lay out on the bow.

                                  NOLAN
                    You ve still got a problem, Ems. Or 
                    Ams. Even I m getting confused now.

                                  EMILY
                    Don t tell me she didn t leave town.

                                  NOLAN
                    Okay, but I will tell you she s got 
                    a killer bod. Pun intended. 
                    Amanda s on the Amanda. Toasting 
                    herself even as we speak.

                                  EMILY
                    Jack s boat? I don t believe it. 

                                  NOLAN
                    Believe it.

                                  EMILY
                    Keep an eye on her. But don t say 
                    anything. You never know how 
                    she ll react. 

                                  NOLAN
                    You think? 

                                  EMILY
                    I ll be there as soon as I can. In 
                    the meantime, talk to Jack. Say 
                    whatever you have to say to keep him 
                    away from her. He s already been 
                    hurt once because of us.

                    Because of you. Get down here, fast. 

      As they disconnect, we STAY WITH EMILY at the game just as a 
      PLAYER on Daniel s team sets up a lob. Daniel smashes the 
      ball right past Tyler, who misses it.

      As Daniel is slapped high fives by his team mates, he passes 
      Tyler under the net, goes for a hand shake. Tyler declines 
      the gesture. Daniel shrugs, looks to see if Emily saw his 
      win. Instead, he sees her leaving. 


      Amanda suns herself on the bow of the boat when Emily 
      suddenly looms over her. Amanda raises her sunglasses as 
      Emily looks around to make sure she isn t seen.

                    Actually, I came to speak with you. 
                    May I come in?

      Emily holds the door open, welcoming her. VICTORIA PAUSES AT 
      THE THRESHOLD-- This is the first time she s been in the 
      house since she betrayed David. Ghosts all around. She feels 
      them. IT sparks a mini-flashback:


      Emily steps out, closing the door behind her. Phone to her 
      ear. It s ringing. Nolan answers on the other end.

                    Go for it.

      She slides in between him and the wheel. Their bodies 
      dangerously close. She smiles. He smiles. Sparks fly. She 
      leans in, offering herself. They kiss, passionately.


      The party is in high gear. Conrad chats with Satoshi through 
      Hikari. Daniel nervously watches from a distance with Emily.

      ACROSS THE VERANDA - Tyler finishes a conversation with a 
      wealthy OLDER COUPLE. Ashley stands by his side.

                                  TYLER
                    Well, if you change your mind,

                    Nice meeting you.

      Tyler and Ashley step away from the couple, frustrated.

                    Seemed like they came for the free

      Tyler notices Nolan entering, perks up.

                                  TYLER
                    You re right. Mind grabbing me a

      Ashley heads to the bar. Tyler heads to Nolan, who plays coy.

                    if you re not going to invest. 
                    There are dozens of potentials here 
                    I can be talking to.

                                  NOLAN
                    You really must have cast iron

                    check book after you stole my 
                    credit card. It s shocking and 
                    admirable all at the same time.

                                  TYLER
                    What is it you want Nolan? You 
                    wouldn t have come down here if you 
                    didn t have something in mind.

      Nolan spots Emily with Daniel, she nods back to him. 

                                  NOLAN
                    Played like a fiddle. What say we
