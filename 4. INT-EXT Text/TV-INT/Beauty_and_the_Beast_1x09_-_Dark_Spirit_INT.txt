where a black-tie soiree is in progress. Servants circulate among the
well-heeled guests, proffering delectables on silver trays. CAMERA
FOLLOWS a tray to a cluster of people gathered near a lacquered
piano. ROGER HARDING, tall, dark and corporate, helps himself to an
hors d'oevre and turns to WILLIAM TOUSSANT, 50, the evening's host.
MIRIAM HARDING, Roger's sequined wife-ornament, listens with cocktail
party intensity.


                                      ROGER
                  I've got to hand it to you, old man.
                  That leveraged buy-out was a
                    brilliant maneuver.

                                        TOUSSANT
                                      (modestly)
                    I happened to be at the right place at
                  the right time.

LINDSEY WELLER, an exotic young woman in a slim black dress,
approaches and hands Toussant a drink.

                                        TOUSSANT

                    You're an angel.

He smiles at her, seems glad to have her near.

                                        MIRIAM
                  Don't be so modest, William.
                    What's your real secret?

                                        TOUSSANT
                  You know I never kiss and tell.

                                        ROGER
                    Forbes is calling you one of the most
                      successful entrepreneurs of the
                    decade.

A white-jacketed black servant, HECTOR OCALA, materializes at
Toussant's elbow. He speaks with a slight accent.

                                        OCALA
                      Dinner is served, sir.

                                          TOUSSANT
                    Thank you, Hector.
                      (with a gracious gesture
                        to his friends)
                    Shall we?

The guests begin to move towards the dining room.Toussant
follows them, taking a nervous gulp of his drink.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:



As the servants pour coffee and serve brandy, CAMERA PANS around
the table, picking up snatches of after-dinner conversation. An
older guest, ARTHUR MARCH, chats with his companion.


                                          ARTHUR
                    It's a legitimate write-off, even
                    under the new laws. Wouldn't you
                      agree, William?

Heads turn to Toussant, but he doesn't respond. A light sweat dots
his brow, and he looks pale. Suddenly aware that a response is
required, he snaps back to reality, trying to compensate for having
tuned out.

                                          TOUSSANT
                      You're absolutely right.

                                          ARTHUR
                                        (jovially)
                    It happens occasionally.

Arthur turns away, and Toussant leans over to Lindsey, seated to
his right.

                                                                  CONTINUED                                                                              3.

                                      LINDSEY
                  I don't think so.

                                      TOUSSANT
                  I'm burning up.

He takes a sip of brandy, then suddenly stares transfixed at the
glass.

                                      TOUSSANT

                  My God -

TOUSSANT'S POV

The brandy glass in his hand is crawling with a black mass of
beetles and vermin.

RESUME

Toussant stares horrified at the glass -- which, in this angle,
contains nothing more than a splash of gold liquid. He begins to
tremble.

                                      LINDSEY
                  Are you all right?

TOUSSANT'S POV

The bugs have started to crawl onto his hand.

                                      ROGER (O.C)
                  I'd like to propose a toast.

CAMERA TILTS to Roger, whose face and voice are ominous and
distorted.

                  . ROGER
                  To our gracious host -

CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the brandy glass. The bugs are
now on Toussant s arm, on his jacket --


ON TOUSSANT

He leaps from the table and throws the brandy glass against the wall
behind him. The guests are stunned, not seeing what he sees                                                                                    4.

                    Stop it!

He wriggles and writhes, struggling to brush the imagined bugs
away. To those on this side of reality, his thrashing resembles a
bizarre, violent seizure. The guests start to get up and back off,
alarmed. Emily Post doesn't have rules for this one. Roger moves to
help Toussant.

                                        ROGER
                      What's wrong?

He breaks loose and dashes from the dining room into



Toussant stumbles across the living room as if grappling with an
unseen demon. The madness has overtaken him.

                      Let me go!

Toussant struggles, choking, then as if thrown by his invisible
opponent,

oblivion.

Cathy and BRAD PHILLIPS, 35, an overworked attorney from the
p.d.'s office who looks like he sleeps in his clothes, stride
down the hallway.

                    I'm telling you, he's in some
                    kind of trance.

                    The last time I checked, "voodoo trance"
                    wasn't grounds for dismissal.

He drops the coins in the slot and pulls the knob. Nothing
happens. Frustrated, Brad bangs on the candy machine. Still
nothing happens.

Cathy checks the directory, then hurries to an elevator just as the
doors are about to close.



Cathy squeezes into the crowded car. A few students hurry in after
her, and she bumps into a man in a tweed jacket.

                                      CATHY
                  Excuse me.

                  My pleasure.


She glances up at him politely, then steals another look --
realizing she's wedged against one of the most dangerously
attractive men she's ever met. Though not classically handsome,
there is a brooding quality about him that is irresistably
compelling. At the moment, there is an amused twinkle in his
deep brown eyes. Cathy is suddenly aware of how close they're
standing. She glances away shyly.


,







The elevator doors slide open. Cathy steps out, followed by the crowd
of passengers who quickly disperse. Trying to appear inconspicuous,
she casually glances back at her companion from the elevator -- whom
she catches stealing a glance at her before disappearing down an
adjoining corridor. Cathy approaches the information window.


                                                  CATHY
                              Can you tell me where Professor

      Finding the number, Cathy knocks on the appropriate office door.

                              Come.



      Cathy steps inside. The office is dark, lined with book shelves.
      Eclectic curios are everywhere -- statues, dolls collections of
      shells, strands of beads.

      She stops mid-thought, startled to find that the academician seated
      behind the desk is none other than the dark-eyed Adonis from the
      elevator.

                                                CATHY
                          You spent five years in Haiti
                            studying the customs, and you
                          have a doctorate from Yale.

                                                ALEXANDER
                                                (impressed)
                          You've done your homework.

                                                CATHY

                          So have you.

  He studies her carefully, as if he can look into her soul.

                                                ALEXANDER
                          Why would a beautiful lady D.A. want
                          to know about voodoo?

                                                CATHY
                            I have a suspect who appears to be in a
                            trance. You're probably the only person
                          in New York who can tell me if it's a
                            put-on or not.

                                                ALEXANDER
                            Voodoo is a way of life for some
                            people.

  He gets up and paces, fiddling with some of the curios on the
    shelves. His words weave a spell.

                                                                        CONTINUED                                                                                        10.

                          They take all forms -
                          birds, clouds, beasts.


  Is it Cathy's imagination, or did he hesitate slightly before that
  last word?

                                              ALEXANDER
                          They see things where we see

  He picks up a shell from the desk.

                          What do you see?

                          What a beautiful thought.

  She starts to give the shell back, but Alexander closes her hand
  around it, not taking his eyes off her. His hand lingers on hers a
  beat too long. His touch is magnetic.

                                                ALEXANDER

                          carried away. I have a bad habit of
                          lecturing -- especially when the
                          audience is so captivating. You're
                          probably bored stiff.

                          You're too polite. You didn't come here
                          for a seminar. You came here to ask a
                          simple question which I really can't
                          answer without more information.


                                              CATHY
                          What kind of information do you
                          need?

                          I'd have to see him in person.

                          Would you mind going down there
                          and having a look?

                                              ALEXANDER
                          I was hoping you'd ask.

    Alexander's tone indicates he's interested in more than just the
    research value of the project. Cathy's smile indicates she doesn't
  mind.



  In the flickering candlelight, Vincent comforts Kipper, whose
    face is stained with tears.

                        It was only a dream. And dreams are
                          nothing to be frightened of because
                          they aren't real.

                          we wouldn't be human. But when we
                          face those fears, they go away. Do

  He curls up on the couch and stifles a yawn.

    Reassured, Kipper's heavy eyelids droop close.Vincent tucks a

They reach Ocala's cell. Huddled in the corner is a pathetic
creature that rocks back and forth, chanting in a monotonous
drone.

He repeats it continuously, oblivious to their presence.

                        Hey -- you got company.

Continuing to chant, Ocala turns around, a shadow of his former
self. His face is ghastly and gaunt, his glazed eyes sunk deep
into hollows. Suddenly, the fire of recognition lights in his
eyes. He lunges at them, held back by the bars.

  Alexander and Cathy shrink back instinctively, Alexander
  shielding Cathy.

ANGLE ON CATHY

  glancing back at Ocala, wondering what his words mean, as the
guard leads them away.                                                                                    14.

                        It was an invocation against evil
                        spirits. Most of it was, anyway.

                        It's nothing for you to worry
                        about. All you need to know is

                        he's on the level.

Cathy looks concerned.



  A boutique of the occult, selling everything for the do-it
  yourselfer, from crystal balls and manuals to candles, dolls,
  incense and amulets. Cathy approaches the girl behind the
  counter, who has her nose buried in a book. We recognize her from
the party in Toussant's apartment.

                          I tried to tell the police, but
                          they thought I was crazy.

                  He came in here desperate. He was
                    convinced this man who worked for
                  him - Hector Ocala had put him
                  under a curse. I thought he was a
                    refugee from Bellevue -- at
                  first.

                                                CATHY
                  What convinced you he wasn't?

                  His eyes. I've never seen anyone look
                          so frightened. He literally
                  begged me to help him.

                                      CATHY
                  Did you?

                    I tried, but I'm no expert. My
                    parents lived in Haiti when
                  I was a kid. I've seen some
                  of the rituals, but that's about
                  it. Everyone thinks I know more
                  than I do.

                    William phoned and insisted I
                  come to the party. It was as if
                  he thought my being there could
                    protect him from Ocala's power.
                              (sadly)
                  It didn't.

                    Toussant was poisoned. He
                    didn't die from a curse.

                                        LINDSEY
                    That's what I keep telling

Cathy heads towards Ocala's cell, then stops, stunned to see his
body, covered by a sheet, being wheeled out on a stretcher. She
hurries over to Brad Phillips, who stands near one of the medics.

                    had some kind of monster seizure and

                    Too bad, too. I could have made

Twelve-hour exhaustion weighing on her shoulders, Cathy stops
outside the door to her apartment and digs through her purse for
her keys. She comes across the shell Alexander gave her. Smiling,
she opens the door and steps inside.                                                                              19.

Dark. Cathy flips on the light. She freezes, shocked at
what she sees.


CATHY'S POV

Her apartment's been trashed in a deliberate, ritualistic way.
Pictures have been hung upside down, furniture has been turned
over. All the mirrors are shattered. There's a photo album on the
floor, its contents scattered everywhere. Cathy looks up to see her
name spray painted backwards in red on the wall.


ON CATHY.

as her eye catches something even more horrifying.


CATHY'S POV

Next to the writing on the wall is a primitive drawing of a
beast. It bears an uncanny resemblance to Vincent. As CAMERA

    FADE IN


    Cathy, horrified, crosses to the spray painted icon and touches it.
    The red paint comes off on her hand, still wet, staining her
    fingers blood red. A NOISE from the balcony makes her look up
      quickly.


    CATHY'S POV

    Vincent gazes in through the french doors.


    CATHY

    jumps, startled at first by his appearance. Then, remembering who
    it is, she hurries onto



      Father peruses one of the tomes from his library shelf.
      Vincent stands near. Father, answering Vincent's question,
      barely looks up, distracted by his own research.

                            It is known by several names --
                              chango, saneria, macumba, voodoo. It
                            is the national religion of Haiti,
                              though it's practice is strictly
                              against the law.

                              Because it is dangerous?

      Father puts his book back and turns his full attention to
      Vincent, scrutinizing him carefully.

    begins to move the rocks that choke the end of the tunnel,
    creating an opening. As he disappears through it,

    Vincent makes his way through a dingy tunnel filled with water and
    cobwebs, evidence it hasn't been traversed in years. The distant
    rumble of the subway causes bits of gravel to shake loose. Vincent
    wipes the dust from his eyes and continues on. He steps out of the
    tunnel and into



    An ancient-looking rotunda, resembling the remnants of a Greek
    ruin. Vincent glances around. Along the perimeter of the rotunda,
    like spokes branching out from a wheel, are arched entries to a
    myriad of identical tunnels. Vincent sweeps away the loose gravel
    on the floor, revealing a faded painting of a star. He follows its
    top point to the mouth of one of the tunnels and disappears
    inside.



    A steep decline. Vincent makes his way carefully down the tunnel,
    bracing himself against the walls to keep from sliding. The way
    levels out and widens -- and Vincent sees:

    a light flickering in the distance.


    RESUME

    Vincent continues, coming to a rickety bridge over what appears
    to be a bottomless drop. He crosses the bridge and enters:

    like it's been hollowed out of a tree. Shelves of odd

  bottles filled with colorful liquids line the walls, giving the
  chamber the appearance of an apothecary shop. A car radiator steams
  in the corner, adapted to provide heat. Vincent approaches a table
  where NARCISSA, a small black woman sits, her back to him. She
  tosses out a handful of shells onto the table as if she were
    throwing dice. Her voice is flavored with a South Seas accent.

  She swings around. Her animated face is dominated by eyes
    brilliantly white with cataracts. Her vision is intuitive

        Perfectly manicured female hands drop it into a metal pot. The pot
      is ringed by a circle of red candles. A male voice chants in the
        background, accompanied by the SOUND OF A RATTLE.

                                                  MALE VOICE

        The hands lower a snake, a mosaic of red and yellow markings on its
        side, into the pot. The chant is repeated.

      to her car, gets inside. She begins to pullout when she feels
        something strange and uncomfortable. Concerned, she looks down -



        CATHY'S POV

        A large slimy snake, with the same red and yellow
        marking, has begun to wrap itself around her leg.

        She gasps and quickly slams on the brakes, sending the car into a
        spin. She throws open the car door. Adrenolin pumping, he grabs the
        snake and pulls it from her leg.


        ANGLE ON THE SNAKE

        It slithers down a drain in the garage floor and disappears
        from sight.


        CATHY

          Shaken, she sinks into the seat of her car and slowly catches her
          breath. FOOTSTEPS echo in the distance. Cathy quickly glances
          around, but it's too late. The receding footsteps have faded into
        silence.                                                                                        30.



  CAMERA FOLLOWS a crack of moonlight that spills from the window
  to the bed, where Cathy tosses and turns, moaning softly as if
  haunted by a terrible dream. Her eyes flicker open as she
  comes to consciousness. Queasy, in a cold sweat, she reaches for
  the lamp next to the bed. She flips the light on and starts to
  lean back when her eyes widen with shock and terror.


    CATHY'S POV

    Furry black objects scurry across the bedclothes.Tarantulas
    Lots of them.

    jumps from the bed, choking down her horror. In a frenzy, she

    night table. As she begins to swing at the spiders,

    A PICTURE OF CATHY SMILING HAPPILY

  The male voice chants calmly, counterpointing Cathy's frenzy.

                                            MALE VOICE
                          Nous nous rassemblons.

                            I have seen you in her.

    Lindsey Weller steps into FRAME. She hands Alexander an opaque
    glass bottle, probably an old soda bottle. Alexander pours a clear
    liquid into one of the cups.

                            magic is working on her.


    Lindsey hands him another bottle. He pours a liquid into the cup
    on the other end. The liquid is red.

He fills a cup with water, puts the tea bag in it, then takes a
  vial from his jacket pocket. He empties the vial into the tea and
  stirs it until it dissolves.                                                                                    36.

                                      (checking his watch)
                              A little before six.

                                                  CATHY
                                      (sighing)
                              I have to get ready for work.

                              I have to be.


      ANGLE AT THE DOOR

                                                  ALEXANDER
                                                (sincerely)
                              I'm here if you need me.
                              Remember that.

                                                  CATHY
                              I'll remember.

      He brushes her lips with his and leaves. Cathy closes the door
      behind him. Her eye falls on the shell on the table near the door.
      As she picks it up, a NOISE from the balcony catches her attention.
      She crosses to the french doors.



      Edie punches some buttons and stares at the screen. Cathy
      gazes over her shoulder. It's business as usual -- except
        there's an uneasiness about Cathy (chemically induced) that
      we've never seen before. She's pale and disheveled.

                                                  EDIE

                              I don't have one.

      As she pushes the hair out of her face, we notice her hand
      shakes.

        Suddenly, a large black snake slithers across the top of the
        terminal. Cathy recoils in horror.

        The snake is clearly visible.

        She shrinks back, horrified.

        playing chess with Father. Suddenly, he cries out in pain,
        clutching his temples. The force of Cathy's hallucination is
        having its effect on him.

          Cathy rushes out of the computer room.



        Cathy bursts inside. Alone at last, she struggles to calm down.
        She takes a few deep breaths, concentrating on relaxing. Feeling
        a little better, she crosses to the sink and splashes cold water
        on her face. She looks up to grab a paper towel and glances at
        the mirror.                                                                                            41.


      CATHY'S POV

    Cathy's reflection gazes back at her -- but her face has broken out
    in ugly red welts. Horrified, Cathy lifts her hand to her cheek--



      ON CATHY

    Her skin is as clear as ever -- but her terrified expression
      indicates she's seeing something else.

          He stumbles out.



            Cathy hurries into the cubicle, looking down, trying to hide her
            face. Her hand shaking, she picks up the phone and dials.

            She slams down the phone. Maxwell's voice startles her.His
            manner is softer than normal -- he's clearly concerned.Edie
            Is with him.

            Cathy fights to seem normal, though she can feel the rug of
            reality being pulled out from under her.

        Maxwell and Edie exchange a look. Cathy, realizing the cracks in
        her facade have begun to show, takes another tact.

          the cubicle.                                                                                            .

        Struggling to keep her eyes forward, Cathy makes the trek past the
        endless rows of desks. The secretaries and clerks stare at her as
      she passes, whispering and laughing. The whispers become louder and
          distinguishable.



      The laughter grows cacophonous and surreal. Cathy swings around
      to confront her persecutors, but instead of seeing the
        secretaries, she sees: .


        CATHY'S POV


      Huqe black ravens perched on the desks, cawing incessantly.


      ON CATHY


      The cawing continues, coming from all directions.  Unable to
      stand the din, Cathy starts to run.

      The line between sanity and madness is all but obscured.



    Vincent doubles over in sudden pain, clasping his head.
      Narcissa hovers near him.

      Cathy bursts in, pale, on the ragged edge.She flips on a
      light and hurries into:



      where she gazes into the mirror.


      CATHY'S POV

      Her reflection stares back at her.  The welts have gotten
      much worse.                                                                                    46.


      RESUME

    Feeling totally out of control, Cathy breaks down, sobbing. She
    spots the shell and picks it up, clutching it tightly, fighting to
    hang on to a shred of sanity. She becomes aware of a familiar
      TAPPING. Distraught, she doesn't move. The TAPPING continues. Cathy
      starts for the living room.



Cathy rushes to the phone. Like an addict needing a fix, she
anxiously dials the number. Fidgeting with the shell, she waits
for what seems to be an interminable period of time. Finally
someone answers. The light of last hope dawns in her eyes.


                                        CATHY

                                    ACT FOUR

FADE IN


An expensive silk dress is dropped in a heap on the floor. Another
is dropped on top of it. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL Cathy standing in
front of her closet, methodically pulling each item out and letting
it fall at her feet. She isn't in a cliched zombi trance -- rather,
she works with a diligent, singleminded purpose, like a determined,
desperate child. At last, she comes to the beautiful white dress
Alexander gave her. Relieved, she puts it on the bed. She slips out
of her shoes and begins to change.




Moonlight shines through the dramatic skylight.Stone opens
the door, admitting Lindsey, who seems nervous.

                                        LINDSEY
                      Where is she?

                                          ALEXANDER
                      She'll be here soon.

Lindsey looks at the altar. The set-up is more elaborate than
before -- there are more candles, and they're surrounded by
stones, beads and shells. There is also a crucifix, and a plate
heaped with fruit. The flowers and coins are where they were
before, as are the pictures of Toussant and Ocala.

                                          ALEXANDER
                                (sensing Lindsey's
                                  uneasiness)
                      What's the matter?

                                          LINDSEY
                      Nothing.

                      She controls him, Lindsey. This
                      is the only way the power of the
                      beast can be returned to us. It's
                      the only way to make things the
                      way they were.

His sincerity is soul-piercing, his magnetism undeniable.                                                                                            50.





        PAN from the shells on the table to Vincent and Narcissa.

                              The shells have predicted it. It

                              magic has touched her.

                                here, Vincent. The priest who serves

                              He will steal your soul.

  He follows her inadvertent glance to a silver vial on the counter
  and hurries over to it. As Vincent reaches for the vial, he
    accidentally knocks over a bottle. Its contents spill out,
    instantaneously igniting into a sudden fireball.

    Vincent grabs the vial and hurries out.



  PAN ACROSS the flickering candles. Alexander pours the liquids
    into the bowls. Lindsey is nervous, but she goes along with
  it.

                          The spirit of the beast.

    CAMERA PANS across the altar, coming to rest on Cathy's picture,
    which leans against a black candle. Alexander's hands place a knife
    in front of it -- an ordinary hunting knife, rusted from use.                                                                                      52.



  Cathy is now wearing the shimmery white dress. Her hair has
  been crimped, framing her face in waves. She leans into the
    mirror, and with that single-minded concentration, carefully and
    deliberately applies the final touches to her exotic-looking make-
  up, though her hands shake. Her lips are sensuously red; her eyes
  are dramatically highlighted with unusual colors. The effect is
    primitive and sensual. Satisfied with the result, Cathy turns off
  the light, moves quietly through the living room and slips out the
  front door.



    Vincent makes his way through the dark, narrow tunnel. The rumbling
  of the subway grows until it shakes lose a slide of rocks and
    gravel, knocking him to the ground. Bruised but undaunted, Vincent
    shields himself from the shower of stone and continues on.




    Alexander slides open the door. Cathy steps inside. She looks to
    him like a helpless child, dizzy and weak from the drug.

                                              CATHY
                                (a tortured plea)

                            I will.

                                              CATHY
                            I feel so dizzy.

                                              ALEXANDER
                            It's all right.


    CATHY'S POV

    She glances around the loft, startled by the strange sight of the
    candles and the altar.

                                              ALEXANDER (O.C.)

    Cathy focuses on the pictures on the altar. They re blurry but
      distinguishable.
                                                                      CONTINUED                                                                                        53.

    Cathy spots Lindsey and starts to realize that the pieces are
    coming together -- and something is very wrong.


    RESUME

                                              CATHY
                                (fighting the mental haze)
                          Why is she here?

                                              ALEXANDER
                            She's a friend.

    Lindsey approaches Cathy with a cup.


    CATHY'S POV

                                                            .
    In her drugged state, Lindsey looks distorted, menacing.


    RESUME

    Cathy, frightened, backs away.

                                                ALEXANDER
                          You have to drink it.
                                (turning to the icon)
                            Lord Baka, she is here. We offer
                          her life to free your spirit so
                            that we may reign in power.


    RESUME

    Cathy, fighting to come out of her haze, knocks the cup from
    Lindsey's hand. Alexander grabs her and wrestles her towards the
    altar. Cathy kicks and struggles, but in her weakened state, she's
    no match for him. Alexander grabs for the knife. As his hand closes
    around its handle, there is suddenly a great SHATTERING OF GLASS.                                                                                        54.


    ANGLE ON THE SKYLIGHT

    Vincent crashes through it, rolling to safety on the floor.


  ON ALEXANDER AND CATHY

    Alexander's face blazes- with the wonderment of a true believer
    witnessing a miracle.

                                              ALEXANDER
                          Beast of the night!

    Vincent snarls, and Lindsey backs up in terror, knocking over the
    altar -- and knocking herself unconscious. The candles fall over,
    igniting the contents of the bowls, which instantly burst into
    flames. The fire spreads quickly.

                                              ALEXANDER
                          The power will be mine!

  He raises the knife aloft and is about to plunge it into Cathy.
    Cathy struggles valiantly, but it isn't a fair fight. With a fierce
    cry, Vincent lunges at Alexander.


    WIDE

                                                            .
    The fire has continued to spread, providing a hellish backdrop to
    their struggle. Vincent throws Alexander down -- and he falls on
    his knife. Vincent grabs Cathy, and they escape through the
    flames.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



    Maxwell and two of his CRONIES share a cup of coffee.

                            lose. Besides, it'll probably be
                          ten o'clock before I clean off my

                                    There was a fire in a loft down in
                                    the village. Police found enough of
                                    that voodoo poison to wipe out half
                                    the neighborhood.

                                    Yep. It belonged to a Columbia
                                      professor -- Alexander Stone.
                                    Seems he was into all that voodoo
                                    hocus pocus.

            Cathy appears in the door, listening.

                                                        MAXWELL

                                      professor killed Toussant?

                                    Stone was a gonner when they got
                                    there, but his girlfriend confessed to
                                      everything before she cashed in.
                                    Toussant was a member of their merry
                                    band.

                            police. Stone had the girl
                            poison him and plant the

      Cathy smiles in agreement, but her thoughts are far away.
