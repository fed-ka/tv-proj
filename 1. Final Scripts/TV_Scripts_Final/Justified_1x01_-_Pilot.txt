      EXT. SOUTH BEACH - DAY

    The sand is crowded with TOURISTS and SUN WORSHIPPERS who 
      didn t get the memo on skin cancer.  The ocean is inviting, 
    the surf speckled with KIDS on boogie boards.

      GLORIA, 20, crosses on the cement bike path/boardwalk.  She s 
    in a bikini and flip-flops, with a beach bag over her 
      shoulder.  Beautiful.  We follow her.  She heads up an 
      approach path to a big hotel.

      INT. HOTEL BAR/RESTAURANT - DAY

      Gloria cuts through the bar.  Some of the MEN are less subtle 
      about checking her out than others.

    One guy doesn t look at all.  He stands at the bar, drinking 
      a ginger ale.  We only see him from the back.  He wears a 
      Stetson, old cowboy boots.

      Gloria slows, scans the restaurant, sees who she s looking 
    for and heads for a table.

    At the table are TOMMY BUCKS, 35, a slick-haired goon from 
      Italy; HARRY ARNO, 55, balding and nervous, and JOYCE, 35, a 
      former exotic dancer who s wondering how the hell her life 
      brought her to be sitting at this table.

      Tommy Bucks lights up when he sees Gloria approach.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Gloria!  What a surprise!

                                  GLORIA
                    I was just coming in to use the 
                    john and I saw you.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Sit.  Join us.  

      ANGLE ON THE TABLE

      From the bar.  We see Gloria unsling the beach bag from over 
    her shoulder and sit down, putting the bag under the table.  
      PULL BACK to reveal we re looking at them in the mirror 
      behind the bar.

      CLOSE ON THE GUY IN THE STETSON

      Watching Tommy Bucks and the others in the mirror.  This is 
      RAYLAN GIVENS, 40s.Raylan pushes back from the bar, walks 
      into the restaurant.  Harry sees him first.                                                                                    2.



                                  HARRY
                    Raylan.  You re late.  I already 
                    checked him out.  He s clean.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You look in his socks?  He took an 
                    ankle gun off me in Italy, though I 
                    doubt he s wearing it.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Not my style.

                                  HARRY
                    Look, Raylan, Tommy and I been 
                    talking, and he s cool with me now.  
                    He knows it was all a mistake.  

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Tommy Bucks)
                    The airport s a good forty-five 
                    from here, but you ll make it if 
                    you leave in the next ten minutes.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    I thought I had until two-fifteen.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Yeah, well, now you got ten minutes.

                                  HARRY
                    You know what you re talking about?  
                    If you do, let me in on it.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    What it means, your friend gave me 
                      twenty-four hours to get out of the 
                    country, do you believe that?

      Harry and Joyce look at Raylan -- is that true?  

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Gloria)
                    Honey, you re through here, aren t you?

      Gloria doesn t move right away.  Raylan pulls her chair back.  
      Gloria looks at Tommy Bucks.  He gives a nod.  Gloria gets 
    up, walks off.  

                                  JOYCE
                    I think Gloria forgot her beach bag.                                                                                    3.



                                  RAYLAN
                    She ll get it later.  Harry, why 
                    don t you take Joyce to the bar for 
                    a drink.  

                                  HARRY
                    Raylan, I m telling you, me and 
                    Tommy, we re good.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Go on.

      Joyce and Harry look at each other, shrug, get up and walk 
      off.  Raylan takes a seat across the table from Tommy Bucks, 
    the table set with glasses and silverware.  A WAITER comes up 
    to Tommy Bucks.

                                  WAITER
                    Would you like another iced tea?

      Tommy Bucks shakes his head.  The waiter looks to Raylan. 

                                  WAITER (CONT D)
                    Anything for you, sir?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Give me about three minutes and 
                    come back.

    The waiter walks off.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    You don t look at your watch.  How 
                    do you know it s three minutes?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m estimating.  Now it s two 
                    minutes.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    You don t know that!

      Raylan shrugs.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS (CONT D)
                    You don t have the permission, what 
                    you re doing, the authority.

                                  RAYLAN
                    An officer of the law tells an 
                      undesirable like yourself to get 
                    out of town.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    4.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    It s done all the time.  If you 
                    don t choose to leave, then we play 
                    by your rules.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    I don t haverules.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s what I mean.  You have one 
                    minute.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    You just got done saying two 
                    minutes!

                                  RAYLAN
                    Time flies, huh?  Make up your mind.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    I couldashot you in Italy.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Maybe you should ve.  I was unarmed 
                    then.  Just like the man you 
                    killed.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    He was a good friend of yours?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Didn t know him that well.  Thirty 
                    seconds.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Now I munarmed.  You gonnashoot 
                    me?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You re not unarmed.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Harry told you.  I don t have a 
                    gun.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Then what s in the beach bag your 
                    friend left you?

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Okay, okay.  Fine.  You want me to 
                    leave Harry alone?  You got it.  I 
                    don t care.  He s nothing to me.                                                                                    5.



                                  RAYLAN
                    He s nothing much to me either.  
                    Twenty seconds.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Then why you doing this?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Ten seconds.

      Tommy Bucks looks at Raylan, really stares at him.  Nods.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Okay.  You re going to get what you 
                    want.

      Under the table, Tommy s hand comes out of the beach bag with 
      a pistol.

      Joyce and Harry, watching from the bar.  They see a glint of 
      metal in Tommy Bucks  hand.

                                  HARRY
                    HE S GOT A GUN!

      Raylan goes for his Beretta, fast.

      Tommy Bucks clears the table with his gun barrel and is about 
    to fire, but...

      Raylan fires first, through two water glasses, into Tommy 
      Bucks  chest.

      Tommy is startled.  He tries again to fire.

      Raylan shoots him again, jolting him, causing Tommy Bucks to 
      fire into the table, sending more glass and china flying.  
      Raylan shoots Tommy again and waits, the butt of his gun 
      resting on the table.

      Tommy Bucks looks at him, staring, before his shoulders go 
      slack and he lowers his head to the table.

      Raylan lays his gun on the table, stands.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                  END OF TEASER                                                                                    6.



                                  ACT ONE

      I/E. RAYLAN S CAR/HIGHWAY - DUSK

      Raylan drives a Cadillacon the highway.  A sign ahead 
      indicates the next exit is for Ocala.  Raylan takes the exit.

      Super:  One week later

      EXT. OCALA POLICE STATION - DUSK

      Raylan is leading DALE, 20, a rangy kid.  Two OCALA POLICE 
      OFFICERS watch.

                                  OCALA POLICE OFFICER #1
                    Just you escorting him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Strike team s shorthanded at the 
                    moment.  I believe I ll manage.

      Raylan walks off with Dale.  The officers watch him go.

                                  OCALA POLICE OFFICER #1
                    He believes he ll manage...

                                  OCALA POLICE OFFICER #2
                    Don t you know who that is?  He s 
                    the one the Mafia guy drew on last 
                    week in Miami Beach, the two of 
                    them sitting at the same table.  
                    That marshal shot him dead.  Raylan 
                    Givens.  It was on the news.

                                  OCALA POLICE OFFICER #1
                    I don t care who he is.  How do you 
                    transport a prisoner by yourself?

      I/E. RAYLAN S CAR/STREETS OF OCALA - NIGHT

      Dale drives.  Raylan sits in the passenger seat.

                                  DALE
                    I know who you are.  Saw it on the 
                    news.  Just like the Old West, huh?  
                    A real shoot-out.
                          (noanswer)
                    So.  Marshals drive Caddies now?  
                    Or was this confiscated?
                          (noanswer)
                    I had a Caddy myself one time, till 
                    I sold it for parts and went to 
                    work at Disney s.

                                  DALE (CONT'D)
                    You know what I tried out for?  
                    Goofy.  Mickey Mouse s friend?  
                    Only you had to water-ski and I 
                    couldn t get the hang of it--

                                  RAYLAN
                    If you re gonnatalk, I ll put you 
                    in the trunk and drive myself.

      Dale nods.  They drive in silence for a bit. 

                                  DALE
                    I don t see why we can t talk some.  
                    Pass the time.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t care to hear any sad 
                    stories, all the bad luck and bum 
                    deals life s handed you.

      Another bit of silence.  Dale can t help himself.

                                  DALE
                    My dad s never been to Palm Beach 
                    or seen the ocean.  Never got 
                      closer nTwenty Mile Bend.  You 
                    believe it?  Spent his whole life 
                    over there around Belle Glade, 
                    Canal Point, Pahokee.
                          (beat)
                    I only mention it,  cause if we was 
                    to get off the turnpike near Stuart 
                    we could take Seventy-six over to 
                    the lake, run on down to Belle 
                    Glade.  Wouldn t be more than a few 
                    miles out of the way and I d get to 
                    see my folks.  What would you say 
                    to that?
                          (waits, gets nothing)
                    Not much, huh?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Your old dad s never been to Palm 
                    Beach or seen the ocean, but he s 
                    been up to Starke, hasn t he?  Seen 
                    the inside of the Florida state 
                    prison.  You have an uncle who came 
                    out of there and another did his time 
                    at Lake Butler.  I think we ll skip 
                    visiting any of your kin this trip.

                                  DALE
                    My uncles reboth dead.                                                                                    8.



                                  RAYLAN
                    By gunshot, huh?  You understand 
                    how I see your people?

      Dale nods.  Then very suddenly he tries to club Raylan in the 
      throat with his fist.  Raylan deflects the blow and kicks 
      Dale in the face with the heel of his cowboy boot.  Dale 
      swerves off the road.  A second later, Raylan has his Beretta
    to Dale s face.  

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Stop the car.

      Dale stops the car.  Raylan hands Dale handcuffs.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Put one on your left wrist and snap 
                    the other one to the wheel.

      Dale does as he s told, blood dripping from his nose.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Now drive.

                                  DALE
                    I can t drive handcuffed to the 
                    steering wheel!

                                  RAYLAN
                    You ll get the hang of it.

      Dale exhales, gets back onto the road.

                                  DALE
                    You gonnareport what I did, get me 
                    another couple years?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m not your problem.

      Dale slows for a light, stops.

                                  DALE
                    I just wanna know if--

      WHAM!They are rear-ended.

                                  DALE (CONT D)
                    God damn!

      Raylan looks back to see a pickup easing back, making sure 
    the bumpers aren t locked.                                                                                      9.



      Raylan gets out of the Caddy to see two young black men get 
    out of the pickup, one wearing a CROCHETED SKULLCAP and the 
      other with his hair in CORNROWS.  Raylan sees Cornrows 
      holding something against his leg -- a pistol.  Raylan 
      pretends not to see it, goes to look at the damage.  

                                  CORNROWS
                    You see what I got here?

    He shows the gun to Raylan.  Raylan nods.  Skullcap heads for 
    the driver s window.

                                  CORNROWS (CONT D)
                    We gonnatrade, let you have a 
                    pickup for this here.  You see a 
                    problem with that?

      Raylan shakes his head.  Skullcap looks in the car.

                                  SKULLCAP
                    What the fuck?
                          (to Cornrows)
                    Come here look at this.

    The moment Cornrows turns his head, Raylan opens the trunk 
    and pulls out a Remington12-gauge.He points the gun at the 
    two carjackers, racks a load.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Let go of the pistol.

      Cornrows debates what to do.

                                  DALE
                    Do what he says.  He s the marshal 
                    outdrew that Mob guy in Miami.

                                  RAYLAN
                    And now I ve got a shotgun with a 
                    shell in the chamber.  Not much 
                    drawing involved.

      Cornrows drops the pistol.

      I/E. RAYLAN S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

    PAN ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT.  Dale is still driving, handcuffed 
    to the wheel.  Cornrows and Skullcap are next to him, 
      handcuffed together in a criss-crossfashion.  Raylan sits in 
      back, shotgun visible.  After some silence...                                                                                    10.



                                  CORNROWS
                    Saw that on the news.  You and that 
                    greaser in Miami.  Folks talking 
                    about it, saying if it was them, 
                    they couldabeat you.
                          (beat)
                      Whaddyathink?  If you just had 
                    your handgun, you think you coulda
                    beat me?

      Raylan says nothing.  After a beat...

                                  DALE
                    He s not much of a talker.

    On they go.

      INT. US MARSHAL S OFFICE - SOUTHERN DISTRICT - DAY

      Raylan is sitting across from his boss, DAN GRANT, 50.  

                                  DAN
                    Look, you wear what you wear, and 
                    you are what you are, and I put up 
                    with it  cause you get the job 
                    done.   Ceptnow I m to understand 
                    you ve become a target for all the 
                    mental wizards out there who wanna 
                    prove themselves.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t know if you can generalize 
                    from the word of two carjackers--

                                  DAN
                    You think they re the only ones 
                    talking this shit?  It s all 
                    through the FDC.Apparently 
                    there s a long line of idiots who 
                    want a crack at you.  As much as I 
                    would like to frame this as my 
                    concern for your safety, it also 
                    wouldn t look real good if one of 
                    my deputies is gunned down in a 
                    shootoutwith some yahoo who wants 
                    to prove he s the quicker draw.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What makes you think I d lose?

    Dan gives him a look.                                                                                    11.



                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    You want me to take some time off?

                                  DAN
                    No.  I want you to take a temporary 
                      reassignment.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Where?

                                  DAN
                    That s up to you.  There are five 
                    districts nationwide low on 
                    manpower, could use you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Is Eastern Kentucky on that list?

                                  DAN
                    It is.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I ll go there.

                                  DAN
                    You don t want to think about it?

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s where I grew up.  And I know the 
                    marshal, Art Mullen.  He and I taught 
                    firearms at Glynco.

                                  DAN
                    You still got family in Kentucky?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Ex-wife in Lexington.  I believe my 
                    father s still down in Harlan.

                                  DAN
                    You believe?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (shrugs, then:)
                    There s another reason I d like to 
                    go.  I was checking out the 
                    national suspects list and I saw a 
                    name in Eastern Kentucky I 
                      recognized: Boyd Crowder.  
                          (offDan s look)
                    He was a guy I knew growing up.  
                    Back when we were 19, we dug coal 
                    together.                                                                                      12.



      INT. COAL MINE - DAY - FLASHBACK

        19-YEAR-OLDRAYLAN and 19-YEAR-OLDBOYD are jack-hammering at 
      a pillar of coal in a worked-out mine with a four foot seam.

                                  RAYLAN (V.O.)
                    We started out robbing mines.  
                    That s where you go into a worked-
                    out mine and chop into the pillars 
                    of coal holding up the roof.  We 
                    did it because we were young and 
                    could move fast.  

      Young Boyd thinks he hears something, shuts off his 
      jackhammer, taps Young Raylan and makes a slashing motion 
      across his throat.  Young Raylan shuts down his jackhammer as 
      well.  They hear a groaning, cracking sound.  Chunks of rock 
      start crumbling down from the ceiling.

                                  RAYLAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     Cause if you chop out too much of 
                    the pillar, the roof starts coming 
                    down and you have to run like hell.  

      Young Raylan and Young Boyd drop their jackhammers and run as 
      fast as they can, hunched over in the four-foot seam of the 
      mine.  They run to the exit shaft, the long line of lights 
      behind them winking out one by one as the ceiling comes down.

      Young Raylan and Young Boyd get into the elevator, shut the 
      gate and hit the emergency UP button as a cloud of coal dust 
      floods into the shaft.

    As the elevator starts shooting up, Young Raylan and Young 
      Boyd are clearly terrified and exhilarated.

      CLOSE ON YOUNG BOYD, eyes afire, teeth flashing white against 
    his coal-blacked face, laughing his ass off.

                                  RAYLAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Anyway, yesterday I saw Boyd s name 
                    on the list, and what I want to know 
                    is: how did the kid I knew when I was 
                    19 come to be a white supremacist 
                    moron suspected in a string of 
                    bombings and bank robberies?

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      I/E. CHEVY BLAZER/DOWNTOWN CINCINNATI - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON BOYD CROWDER, now a man in his 40s.He s in the 
      passenger seat, looking out at something.                                                                                    13.



                                  JARED (O.C.)
                    Well, Boyd, whaddyathink?

                                  BOYD
                    Well, Jared, I think it sucks.

      REVEAL JARED, 20s, an eager, disappointed skinhead.

                                  JARED
                    What?  Why?

      They are looking at a building under construction.  A sign on 
    the hoarding around the site says the new building will be an 
      annex to the Federal courthouse.

                                  BOYD
                    No offense, son, but you d need a 
                    box full of Emulexto bring that 
                    down.  All s we got is an RPG.  
                    Most it s gonna do is rip up some 
                    sheetrock and knock over a few 
                    sawhorses.  But don t worry.  We ll 
                    just go to Plan B.

                                  JARED
                    Plan B?

                                  BOYD
                    There s always a Plan B.

      I/E. CHEVY BLAZER/CINCINNATI BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

      Jared drives, with Boyd beside him.  They roll through a 
      predominantly black neighborhood.  Some BLACK TEENAGERS on a 
      corner eyeball them as they pass.

                                  BOYD
                    Used to be, a couplacrackers in an 
                    SUVwould set the jungle on edge.  
                    But they all confident now they got 
                    one of their own in the White House.  
                    These surely are the end times.

      Boyd looks ahead, sees what he s looking for.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    There it is.  Go past slow.

      Jared drives past a rickety old wood church.  The handpainted
      sign out front reads: Temple of the Cool and Beautiful JC.                                                                                    14.



                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Turn left that next street and 
                    stop.  I believe I can take  er
                    from there.

                                  JARED
                          (panic rising)
                    You gonnablow up that church?

      Boyd climbs into the back.  He unfolds a tarp in the way-
      back, revealing an AK-47and a Chinese grenade launcher.

                                  JARED (CONT D)
                    Boyd, there s people on the street.

      Sure enough, there s a TALL BLACK MAN, 30s, wearing a dashiki 
    and a pillbox hat, on the sidewalk in front of the church, 
      talking to FOUR YOUNG BLACK MEN.

                                  JARED (CONT D)
                    They re gonnasee us, ID my car!

                                  BOYD
                    You worried about your car, huh? 

      Boyd pulls the pin, flips the safety.  

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Get ready.

      Boyd gets out of the Blazer.  He hefts the launcher to his 
      shoulder, flips the sight up and takes aim.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    FIRE IN THE HOLE!

    The people in front of the church turn at the sound of Boyd s 
      voice.  They see him and the grenade launcher, not quite sure 
      what to make of it.

      Boyd pulls the trigger.  The projectile rifles through the 
    air and smashes through a window of the church.

    The people start running.  Just in time.

    The Temple of the Cool and Beautiful JC blows up.

      EXT. COUNTRY BRIDGE - NIGHT

    The Blazer is stopped on a bridge.  Boyd tosses the grenade 
      launcher off the bridge into a deep dark stream.  He walks to 
    the Blazer, gets in the back seat.  The Blazer drives off.                                                                                    15.



      EXT. CINCINNATI AIRPORT - LONG TERM PARKING - NIGHT

    The Blazer heads into Long Term parking, goes down a row.

      I/E. BLAZER/AIRPORT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Jared drives, Boyd is still in the back seat.  

                                  BOYD
                    Don t worry about getting a close-
                    in spot.  Just go down to the end.  
                    Walk won t hurt us.

      Jared nods, keeps driving.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    How come you didn t want to blow up 
                    that church?  

                                  JARED
                    I told you -- I didn t want them to 
                    ID my car.

                                  BOYD
                    So you said.
                          (beat)
                    But I have to note, the target you 
                    selected was unoccupied.  

                                  JARED
                    So?

                                  BOYD
                    I was thinking maybe you had an 
                    aversion to hurting people.

                                  JARED
                    Hell, no.

                                  BOYD
                    Ah, well, see, I was alsothinking 
                    a building under construction is 
                    the kind of target the Federal 
                    Bureau of Imperialism would offer 
                    up as sacrifice in order to get 
                    someone deep in the movement.

                                  JARED
                    You think I m a snitch?                                                                                    16.



                                  BOYD
                    All I know is, you don t have any 
                    tattoos and you keep rubbing your 
                    head like you re not sure if your 
                    hair s gonnagrow back.

                                  JARED
                    You think I m a snitch because I 
                    rub my head?

                                  BOYD
                    Calm down.  Just pull in behind 
                    that Tahoe.

      Jared pulls into a spot, turns off the car.

                                  BOYD (CONT'D)
                    You understand my concerns, right?  
                    You show up from Oklahoma full of 
                    pissand vinegar, saying you re 
                    tired of spray-painting synagogues, 
                    you want to blow shit up--  

                                  JARED
                    You don t believe me, check me out!  
                    Call Oklahoma!

                                  BOYD
                    Don t worry, we are.  Devil s doing 
                    it right now.

                                  JARED
                    You ll see, Boyd.  I ain t no snitch.

                                  BOYD
                    Well, like you said, we ll see.

    And with that, Boyd puts the tip of the AK barrel up against 
    the back of Jared s headrest and pulls the trigger.  The 
      bullet goes through Jared s head and through the windshield.

      EXT. AIRPORT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Boyd gets out of the Blazer.  He pulls out his cell and dials 
    as he checks out the damage.  The bullet went clear through 
    the backglassand windshield of the Tahoe in front of them.

                                  BOYD
                          (into cell)
                    It s me.                                                                                    17.



      INT. BACKWOODS CHURCH - NIGHT - CROSSCUT

      A decrepit place.  It hasn t served as a church in twenty 
      years.  The walls are covered in swastika flags and other 
      white power signs.

      DEVIL, 30s, is on his cell.  He s wiry, tough, smarter than 
    all of them, save Boyd.  In the b.g.are DEWEY and the PORK 
      BROTHERS, all in their 20s, playing a video game.  Dewey 
      (spiked hair and necklace of gatorteeth) thinks he s a good 
      deal smarter than he really is.  The Pork Brothers are under 
    no illusions about their intelligence -- they are muscle and 
    are happy to have found a place in this world.

                                  DEVIL
                          (into cell)
                    How dit go?

                                  BOYD
                    The primary was a waste of time.  
                    Took care of the secondary just fine.

                                  DEVIL
                    Where are you?

                                  BOYD
                    At the airport.  I m coming into 
                      London-Corbin on the late shuttle.

                                  DEVIL
                    Got a call from Oklahoma.  Jared 
                    checks out.

                                  BOYD
                    Oh?

      Boyd s looking at dead Jared in the Blazer.

                                  DEVIL
                    How dhe do?

                                  BOYD
                    Yeah, I had to let Jared go.

                                  DEVIL
                          (beat)
                    Oh.
                          (beat)
                    Was it you didn t trust him or you 
                    just didn t like him much?                                                                                    18.



                                  BOYD
                          (thinks)
                    I guess both.

      EXT. CINCINNATI AIRPORT - NIGHT

      Boyd walks toward the airport, traffic light on the roads.

                                                                  TIME LAPSE TO:

      Raylan enters baggage claim, slows, smiles when he sees...

    ART MULLEN, 50s, waiting for him.

                    Tell me what you remember of Boyd 
                    Crowder.

                    Well, we dug coal side by side for 
                    EastoverMining, near Brookside. 
                    Boyd was senior to me, became a 
                      powderman.He d crawl down a hole 
                    with his case of Emulexfive-twenty 
                    and come out stringing wire.  He d 
                    call out  Fire in the hole!  to
                    clear the shaft. 

                                  ART
                    Fire in the hole, huh?

                    She d blow and we d go back in to 
                    dig out the pieces.  We weren t

                    twice.  Then he shot one of the 
                    scabs, almost killed him.  He took 
                    off and that s the last I saw of 
                    him.  I heard he joined the army,

                    Came out and what happened, he went

                    came to Kentucky to hook up with 
                    some commandos.

                    Could be the murder weapon.  
                    Recently fired.  No prints so far.  
                    The whole vehicle s clean.  Except 
                    for this.

                    You know what that is?  I didn t.  
                    Apparently it hooks onto the back 
                    of a grenade launcher.  Holds the 
                      propellant, the juice.

                    Yup.And last night, a few minutes 
                    past nine, in a black neighborhood 
                    just outside of downtown, somebody 
                    used a grenade launcher to blow up 
                    a church.  

      EXT. TEMPLE OF THE COOL AND BEAUTIFUL JC - DAY

      CLOSE ON the church s sign, on the pavement, charred and 
      splintered.  REVEAL the crime scene -- the burned-out remains 
    of the church.  Cop cars.  Police tape.  CSIs.

      Raylan is walking with Art and two other members of Art s 
      Special Operations Group -- TIM GUTTERSON, 29, and FRANK 
      GARCIA, 35.  Tim is clean-cut and buttoned-down.  Frank has 
      been doing this too long to take any of it too seriously.  
    Tim is going over notes for Raylan.

                    All the wits say the same:  Two 
                    white males drove up in a dark SUV, 
                    parked at that corner by the cone.

                    One male got out with something on 
                    his shoulder -- several of them 
                    said it looked like a bazooka.  He 
                    said a few words, then something 
                    shot out of the bazooka, hit the 
                    church and detonated.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What did he say?  The fellawho got 
                    out of the SUV.

      Forty yards away, RACHEL DUPREE, 35, African American, is 
      talking to the tall black man in a dashiki we saw outside the 
      church when Boyd blew it to shit.  He is ISRAEL FANDI, 40s. 
      Their conversation is animated, their voices loud.

                    His name is Israel Fandi.  He s 
                    Ethiopian by way of Jamaica.  
                    Believes marijuana is a sacramental 
                    herb.  See, The Temple of the Cool 
                    and Beautiful JC didn t have any 
                    actual services per se.  People 
                    just came here to get their 
                    supplies of sacramental herb.

                    So, basically it was a dope store.                                                                                    23.

                    and money to defend and the 
                    neighbors weren t complaining and 
                    it was just a little reefer, so...

      Raylan is driving a rental car.  He pulls up to a red light, 
      stops.  He looks over, sees something.

      drives by.

      Dewey -- Boyd s man with the spiked hair and gator-teeth
      necklace -- is pushing a loaded shopping cart waytoo fast.  
    The cart slams into the back of a rusted-out Cadillac.Dewey 
      whips open the trunk, tosses the bags of groceries inside.

    He dashes to the driver s door, jumps in, not bothering to 
      shut the trunk.  He stomps on the gas, screams back in 
      reverse, sends the shopping cart flying.  He throws the Caddy 
      into drive and peels out onto Main Street, handles of the 
      plastic shopping bags flapping out the back.                                                                                    27.



      EXT. BACKWOODS CHURCH - DAY

    The Pork Brothers are chopping wood.  Being the Pork 
      Brothers, they have made a stupid and dangerous game out of 
    it -- Pork Brother #1 holds a piece of wood on the chopping 
      block, only removing his hand at the last possible second as 
      Pork Brother #2 brings down the axe.  Pork Brother #2 almost 
      cuts his brother s hand off.  They laugh.

                                  PORK BROTHER #2
                    That was a close one!

                    I felt the air move!

      They turn as Dewey tears into the clearing, stomps on the 
      brakes, throwing up a shower of dirt.  Dewey jumps out.

                                  DEWEY
                    BOYD!

    The Caddy rolls forward at idle speed.  Dewey curses, gets 
      back in, shuts it down, jumps back out again.

                                  RACHEL
                    Said she got tired of him getting 
                    drunk and beating her up.  

                                  TIM
                    She was arraigned this morning.  
                    Released on her own recognizance.  

                                  ART
                    Seems the prosecutor is aware of 
                    what a known a-hole Bowman was and 
                    would rather plea it out than go to 
                    trial.  I was thinking she might be 
                    a way for us to find Boyd.                                                                                     29.



                                  RAYLAN
                    You speak to her?

                                  RACHEL
                    I did.  I told her Boyd s probably 
                    gonnacome looking for her.  She 
                    said it s none of our business.  I 
                    told her it is if he shoots her.

                                  FRANK
                    And what did you tell her first?

                                  RACHEL
                    I told her the only problem with 
                    what she did is she waited too 
                    long.  First time he laid a hand on 
                    her, she should ve cut off his man-
                    beans with a tiling knife.

                                  FRANK
                    Man-beans.  Lovely.

                          (to Raylan)
                    You want to talk to Ava?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I wouldn t mind.

      I/E. CAR/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      Raylan drives along a two-lane blacktop, comes to a t-
      intersection.There s a shuttered, out-of-season fruit stand 
      across the road.  On top of the fruit stand, a weathered 
      billboard proclaims: JESUS SAVES!  Raylan turns left.

      I/E. CAR/NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      Raylan drives along a narrow, twisting one-lane dirt road 
      that winds through the trees.  Raylan is deep in thought as 
    he drives.  Thinking.  Remembering.  In his mind he hears the 
      crunch of a football tackle and the roar of a crowd.

      EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY - FLASHBACK

        19-year-oldRaylan is in the stands with 19-year-oldBoyd, 
      watching the high school game.  At least Boyd is watching the 
      game.  Raylan can t take his eyes off...

    THE CHEERLEADERS.  One in particular.  A strikingly pretty 16-
      year-oldblonde -- YOUNG AVA.  She can feel his eyes.  She 
      looks up at him.  Smiles.                                                                                    30.



      Young Raylan, caught, manages a smile in return, then steers 
    his vision back to the game.

      I/E. CAR/NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      Raylan snaps out of his reverie as he comes around a bend in 
    the narrow road and sees a red Dodge pickup parked in front 
    of a one-story with aluminum awnings set among the pines.

      INT. AVA S HOUSE - DAY

      Raylan walks up to the open front door, peers inside.  He s 
      about to knock when a woman comes out of the back.  AVA, 40s, 
    in a soiled t-shirtover a housedress, her hair a mess.  It 
      only takes her a second to realize who she s looking at.

                                  AVA
                    Oh my God -- Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (stepping inside)
                    You remember me, huh?

                                  AVA
                    I never forgot you.

    Ava steps up to hug him.  Raylan quite naturally takes her in 
    his arms.  And then she kisses him.  On the lips.  And Raylan 
      doesn t stop her.  He hangs with the kiss until Ava finally 
      pulls back.

                                  AVA (CONT D)
                    I had a crush on you from the time 
                    I was twelve years old.  I knew you 
                    liked me, but you didn t want to 
                    show it.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You were too young.

                                  AVA
                    I was sixteen when you left.  I heard 
                    you got married.  Are you still?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Turned out to be a mistake.

                                  AVA
                    You want to talk about mistakes...  
                    I told Bowman I wanted a divorce?  
                    He goes,  You file, you ll never be 
                    seen again.   Said I d disappear 
                    from the face of the earth.                                                                                    31.



      A look passes between them.  Ava aims to change the mood.

                                  AVA (CONT'D)
                    Coffee?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I d love some.

      Raylan follows Ava into the kitchen, watches her make coffee.

                                  AVA
                    I married him a year out of high 
                    school because he was cute, he was 
                    sure of himself and he told me he d 
                    never work in a goddamncoal mine.  
                    He d wear the blue and white of the 
                    University of Kentucky then get 
                    drafted by a pro team, he wouldn t 
                    mind the Cowboys.  But colleges 
                    either wouldn t take his grades or 
                    didn t think he was good enough.  
                    He blamed me for it.  Said it was 
                    all my fault.  My fault he had to 
                    dig coal.  My fault he hit me.
                          (beat)
                    I ran off to Corbin and got a job 
                    at the Holiday Inn waiting tables.  
                    He wooed me back, saying he missed 
                    me.  Wasn t long before it was all 
                    my fault again.  My fault I 
                    miscarried after he beat me with 
                    his belt.  My fault he didn t have 
                    a son to take hunting with him and 
                    his creepy brother.
                          (beat)
                    Last time he hit me it was because 
                    I called his brother creepy.  He 
                    kept after me with his belt till I 
                    fell and hit my head on the stove. 
                          (beat)
                    I got up from that floor knowing he 
                    would never hit me again.
                          (beat)
                    The next night, he came in, I had 
                    his favorite supper on the table -- 
                    ham and yams, cream-style corn and 
                    leftover okra fixed with tomatoes.   
                    I waited until he was shoveling food 
                    into his face, then got his deer 
                    rifle from the kitchen closet and 
                    went in and did what I had to do.

      Raylan looks at the table where Bowman met his end.                                                                                    32.



                                  RAYLAN
                    Did you load the rifle before 
                    firing it?

                                  AVA
                    Is that my old friend Raylan asking 
                    or is that the lawman?
                          (beforehe can answer)
                    Bowman always kept it loaded.  I ve 
                    still got a knot where I fell and 
                    hit my head on the stove.  You want 
                    to feel it?

    Ava puts her fingers into her hair, probing for the bump.  
    She stops.

                                  AVA (CONT D)
                    Dear Lord my hair s a mess.  

    She hurries to the bedroom.

                                  AVA (CONT D)
                    You close your eyes, I don t want 
                    you to see me like this.

    Ava disappears into the bedroom, shuts the door.  Raylan 
      pours himself a cup of coffee.  Ava calls out.

                                  AVA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I was always proud of you, what you 
                    done with your life.  Some folks 
                    thought it odd, but it always made 
                    perfect sense to me.

                                  RAYLAN
                    How so?

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    Your house was crazy, but you 
                    always walked the line.  Raylan 
                    Givens had his rules -- like not 
                    making time for a pretty 
                      cheerleader who had a crush on him.
                          (beat)
                    I heard your father isn t doing well.  
                    You been to see him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not yet.

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    What would you do if you dropped by 
                    and he was up to something?                                                                                    33.



                                  RAYLAN
                    Depends on what he was up to I suppose.

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    By the way, I was right.

                                  RAYLAN
                    About what?

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    About having a crush on you.  
                    You re a good kisser.

                                  RAYLAN
                    And I was thinking we have to stop 
                    doing that.

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    Why?

                                  RAYLAN
                    This isn t a social call, Ava.  I 
                    came to Harlan on business.  

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    You tell me all about your business 
                    when I get out of the shower.

      Raylan hears the shower start.  A beat, then the front door 
      bangs open and in walks Dewey.  He looks Raylan up and down.

                                  DEWEY
                    Who in the hell are you, the 
                      undertaker?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I might be undertaking a situation.  
                    Let s see what you got on your chest.

      Raylan just walks up to Dewey and parts his shirt to reveal 
    the HEILHITLERtattoo and the gator-teethnecklace.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    You buy that necklace or poach the 
                    gatorand yank her teeth out?

                                  DEWEY
                    Who areyou?

      Raylan flips open his case to show his star.                                                                                    34.



                                  RAYLAN
                    I m Raylan Givens, deputy United 
                    States marshal.  
                          (flipscase closed)
                    You mind telling me who you are?

                                  DEWEY
                    I m Dewey.  Dewey Crowe.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What are you doing here, Mr. Crowe?

                                  DEWEY
                    I come to take Ava some place.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Lemme tell you something.  You 
                    don t walk in a person s house 
                     less you re invited.  What you 
                    better do, go on outside and knock 
                    on the door.  If Ava wants to see 
                    you I ll let you in.  She doesn t, 
                    you can be on your way.

      Raylan watches Dewey, curious to see how he ll take it.

                                  DEWEY
                    All right.  I m gonnago out.
                          (beat)
                    Then I m coming back in.

      Dewey turns and heads out the door.

      I/E. AVA S HOUSE - DAY

      Raylan walks over and stands in the doorway.  He watches 
      Dewey hurry to his old Caddy and open the trunk.  Raylan 
      takes off his suit coat and hooks it on the doorknob.

      EXT. AVA S HOUSE - DAY

      Dewey shuts the Caddy trunk lid, revealing a pump shotgun in 
    his hand.  He heads for the house, slowing when he sees 
      Raylan coming out.  He points the shotgun at Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Mr. Crowe?  You better hold on 
                    there while I tell you something.

      Dewey stops.                                                                                    35.



                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I want you to understand, I don t 
                    pull my sidearm  less I m gonna 
                    shoot to kill.  That s it s 
                    purpose, huh, to kill.  So it s how 
                    I use it.  I want you to think 
                    about what I m saying before you 
                    act and it s too late.

                                  DEWEY
                    Jesus Christ, I got a scattergun
                    pointed right at you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    But can you rack in a load before I 
                    put a hole through you?

    And Dewey does think about that.  Raylan walks up to Dewey, 
      pushes the barrel of the shotgun aside and takes Dewey by the 
    arm to the Cadillac.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Where dyou want to take Ava?

                                  DEWEY
                    Man, I don t understand you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Boyd want to see her?

                                  DEWEY
                    It s none of your business.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You know Boyd and I were buddies?  
                    We dug coal and drank beer 
                    together.  You see him, tell him 
                    I m in Harlan.

      Dewey gets into the car, starts the engine.  Raylan reaches 
      through the open window, puts his hand on Dewey s shoulder.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I was you, son, I d drop this Nazi 
                      bullshitand go back to poaching 
                    gators, it s safer.

      Dewey turns and looks up at Raylan.

                                  DEWEY
                    The next time I see you--                                                                                    36.



      Raylan grabs a handful of Dewey s spiked hair and slams his 
      head down hard on the windowsill.  Raylan hunches over to 
      look at Dewey s face, tightened with pain.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Tell Boyd his old buddy wants to 
                    see him.  Raylan Givens.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    37.



                                  ACT THREE

      INT. AVA S HOUSE - DAY

      Ava s in a tank top and shorts, a towel wrapped around her 
    wet hair, pouring Jim Beam into a couple of tumblers.

                                  AVA
                    You want something with yours?  I ve 
                    got Diet Coke, RC, Dr. Pepper...

                                  RAYLAN
                    Just ice, if you have some.

    Ava nods, gets an ice tray from the freezer.

                                  AVA
                    I ever forget to fill the trays 
                      Bowman dstart slapping me.  What s 
                    wrong with you?  Don t you know how 
                    to keep house? 

    Ava puts ice in the tumblers, carries them over to the table 
      where she shot Bowman to death.  She and Raylan sit.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    You haven t seen Boyd, have you?  I 
                    mean since?

                                  AVA
                    No, but he ll be after me, I know.  
                    He s beenafter me.  I assume 
                    that s the reason he sent Dewey.  
                    Why?  You looking for him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    We are.  But we have to catch him 
                    in the act.  Robbing a bank, 
                    blowing up a church... making an 
                    attempt on your life.

                                  AVA
                    Mine?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You said yourself he ll be coming 
                    after you.

                                  AVA
                    Raylan, Boyd don t want to shoot me, 
                    he wants to... go to bed with me.  
                    You want me to help you catch him?                                                                                    38.



                                  RAYLAN
                    Do you know where he is?

                                  AVA
                    Sure I do.  He s in church.
                            (offRaylan s look)
                    He bought an old rundown chapel up 
                    on SukeyRidge.

      EXT. BACKWOODS CHURCH - DUSK

      Raylan steers his Town Car into the clearing.

      INT. BACKWOODS CHURCH - DUSK

      Devil is at the window.

                                  DEVIL
                    Who do you know drives a Town Car?

                                  BOYD
                    Why don t we find out.

                                  DEVIL
                    Ain t anyone I ve seen before.

      Boyd goes to the window, looks out, sees a man in a Stetson
      approaching.  Boyd breaks into a wide smile.

                                  BOYD
                    It s my old buddy, Raylan Givens.

      EXT. BACKWOODS CHURCH - DUSK

    As Raylan approaches, Boyd and Devil come out.  Boyd opens 
    his arms, beaming.

                                  BOYD
                    God damn, look at you, a suit and 
                    necktie, all dressed up to look 
                    like a lawman.

      Boyd hugs Raylan, pats him on the back.  Then he looks at 
      Devil and points at Raylan s hat.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Here s how you wear a hat, casual, 
                    not down on your goddamnears.
                          (toRaylan)
                    I hear you called on Ava.  My boy 
                    Dewey said he ran you off.                                                                                    39.



                                  RAYLAN
                    You believe that?

                                  BOYD
                    Not if you say it ain t so.  Ava s 
                    the one told you I was here?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I talked her into it.  Told her I 
                    wouldn t tell anybody.

                                  BOYD
                    How do you know she didn t send you 
                    to me?  So I could decide what to 
                    do with you.

                                  DEVIL
                    I ll take care of him.

                                  BOYD
                    Go get a jar.  And some glasses.  
                    Clean ones.  And just two.  This is 
                    me and Raylan s party.

      Devil waits a second then heads inside.  

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    He just got his release, so he s 
                    looking for action.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I can tell.

      EXT. BACKWOODS CHURCH - NIGHT

      Boyd pours a few inches of corn liquor into each glass.

                                  BOYD
                          (raises his glass)
                    To the old days.

      Raylan nods, picks up a glass.  They clink and drink.  
      Moonshine.  Dear Lord.  Raylan lets his eyes clear.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    I hear your father s not well.

      Raylan gives a small nod.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    He sure was a wild man in his day, 
                    wasn t he?  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    What was that scam he had, back in 
                    the  80s, during the coal boom?  He 
                    was stealing mining machinery -- the 
                    expensive stuff, the continuous 
                    miners -- and shipping it to Columbia 
                    where they still had ten-foot seams 
                    of coal, and they were paying him in 
                    cocaine.  Wasn t that it?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Something like that.

                                  BOYD
                    Then his drug mule was parachuting in 
                    with a hundred pounds of cocaine on 
                    his back and it overloaded the chute 
                    or what have you, and he streamered
                    and punched a hole in a driveway 
                    outside of Corbin.  Old geezer comes 
                    out to get his morning paper and 
                    there s a man with a parachute waist-
                    deep in his asphalt.
                          (beat)
                    They never tied your old man to 
                    that, did they? 

      Raylan shakes his head.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    You missed the next boom.  No more 
                    following a seam underground.  
                    Cheaper just to cut the tops off 
                    mountains, let the slag run down 
                    and ruin the creeks.
                            (shakeshead, smiles)
                    Remember when we was robbing mines?  
                    Chopping into those pillars, runnin 
                    like hell when she began to cave.
                          (darkens)
                    Then there were the picket lines.  
                    Courts backing the company scabs 
                    and gun thugs.  Whose side the 
                    govermintalways been on, Raylan, 
                    us or the people with money?  
                          (beat)
                    And who controls the money and 
                    wants to mongrelize the world?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Who?

                                  BOYD
                    The Jews.                                                                                    41.



                                  RAYLAN
                    Boyd, you know any Jews?

                                  BOYD
                    A few.  I know they run the economy, 
                    control the Federal Reserve and the 
                    IRS.  It s become the Jew-nited
                    States of America now, my friend.  I 
                    recruit skins, don t know more n
                    you, have to show  em why we have a 
                    moral obligation to get rid of the 
                    Jews.  It s in the Bible.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Where?

                                  BOYD
                    Part of Creation.  Back at the 
                    beginning of time you have your mud 
                    people, referred to as beasts 
                    because they have no souls.  And 
                    Cain -- you know Cain, don t you? -- 
                    well, he started screwing the mud 
                    people, and out of these 
                    fornications came the Edomites, and 
                    you know who the Edomitesare?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Tell me.

                                  BOYD
                    The Jews.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You re serious.

                                  BOYD
                    Read your Bible as interpreted by 
                    experts.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You know, Boyd, I think you just 
                    use the Bible to do whatever the 
                    hell you like.  

                                  BOYD
                    And what do I like?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You like to get money and blow stuff up.

      Raylan has struck a chord in Boyd, not that Boyd would admit it.                                                                                    42.



                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I know about your friend Devil and 
                    his history selling dope.  I m 
                    willing to bet you blew up that 
                    church in Cincinnati, not because 
                    it was black, but because it was a 
                    dope store.  Ten-to-one you got 
                    paid to do it by some of the other 
                    dope dealers around who didn t like 
                    the idea of that pastor getting a 
                    pass from the police.  It was win-
                    win for you, wasn t it, Boyd?  Not 
                    only did you get to blow something 
                    to smithereens, you got money.
                          (beat)
                    See, I m giving you the benefit you 
                    aren t mental.  I know you aren t 
                    stupid enough to believe that mud 
                    people story.

      Raylan and Boyd lock eyes for a moment.  

                                  BOYD
                    So, you think you know me, huh?  
                    Well, I know you, Deputy Marshall 
                    Raylan Givens.  I know you like to 
                    shoot bad guys.  I heard how you 
                    shot a wopgun thug in that hotel 
                    in Miami.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You heard about that.

                                  BOYD
                    We have television in these parts 
                    now, Raylan.
                          (beat)
                    What I wonder is, at any time while 
                    you were getting ready to shoot 
                    that Eye-talianfella, did his face 
                    change at all?  
                            (offRaylan s look)
                    Did he -- even for a split-second -- 
                    did he take on the appearance of 
                    your poppa?

    And now Boyd has nailed Raylan, not that Raylan would admit 
    it, least of all not to Boyd.  And so Raylan smiles.

                                  RAYLAN
                    The reason I m here, we re having a 
                    little line-up tomorrow morning--                                                                                    43.



                                  BOYD
                    Tomorrow s Sunday.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Justice never sleeps.  We ve got a 
                    witness who saw the man who fired 
                    the bazooka into the church.  I 
                    sure would appreciate it if you d 
                    be in that line-up.

                                  BOYD
                    I bet you would.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You either show up or we ll come 
                    get you.

                                  BOYD
                          (beat)
                    You shoot me, you get the chance?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You make me pull, I ll put you down.

      Boyd nods.

      EXT. BACKWOODS CHURCH - NIGHT

      Raylan s Town Car heads off.  Boyd watches him go.  Devil 
      comes out.

                                  DEVIL
                    You kiss him goodbye?

                                  BOYD
                    You want your jaw broke?

                                  DEVIL
                    Why dyou let him go?  I couldaput 
                    him away, easy.

                                  BOYD
                    What I do with Raylan s my 
                    business.

      I/E. CAR/HARLAN RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

      Raylan slows, stops, in front of a long driveway at the end 
    of a leafy street.  He picks up a stack of letters, bound 
      with rubber bands.

      ECURETURN ADDRESS ON THE LETTERS: 323 MountainviewDrive.                                                                                    44.



      Raylan looks at the driveway.  A sign reads: 323 Mountainview
      Drive.  Raylan just looks at the address for a moment longer, 
      then puts his car in gear and drives off.

      EXT. CHURCH - DAY

      A pretty white clapboard church on a beautiful day.  The 
      PARISHIONERS are filing out after the Sunday service.

    An ELDERLY MAN, 70s, comes out, slows when he sees someone.

                                  ELDERLY MAN
                    I heard you were in Harlan.

      Raylan s standing by his Town Car.  This elderly man is 
      RAYLAN S FATHER.

                                  RAYLAN S FATHER
                    How dyou know I was here?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I followed you.

                                  RAYLAN S FATHER
                    From the house?
                          (Raylan nods)
                    Why didn t you just come in?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Didn t know what I d find.  I m an 
                    officer of the law now.  There s 
                    drugs in your house, I can t just 
                    look the other way.

      Raylan s father laughs, shakes his head.

                                  RAYLAN S FATHER
                    Well, there are drugs there, all 
                    right.  Paclitaxol. Carboplatin. 
                    Which sounds like something you do 
                    to your car.
                            (explaining)
                    I got a cancer, Raylan.  
                          (beat)
                    I m headed on outtahere.

      Raylan doesn t quite know what to say to that.

                                  RAYLAN S FATHER (CONT D)
                    Not what you were hoping for, huh?

                                  RAYLAN
                    What was I hoping for?                                                                                    45.



                                  RAYLAN S FATHER
                    Would only be a guess.

      Raylan looks at his father, his face impossible to read.

      INT. HARLAN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - OFFICE/HALLWAY - DAY

      Pastor Israel Fandi is sitting in the dark, looking through 
    the half-glass of a door into the brightly lit hallway.

      Boyd is one of SIX MEN standing against the wall of the 
      hallway, staring straight ahead.

    In the office, Art, Raylan and the SOG are looking at Fandi.  
      Finally, Fandi shakes his head -- sorry.

      EXT. HARLAN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

      Raylan comes out with Boyd.  Dewey and Devil are waiting by 
    the pickup truck.

                                  BOYD
                    Could be you ve got the wrong man.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Could also be he knows if he ID s 
                    you, your friends will kill him.

                                  BOYD
                    That man you shot in Florida.  Did 
                    I read that you gave him twenty-
                    four hours to get out of town or 
                    you d shoot him on sight? 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Was a gangster I saw shoot an 
                    unarmed man in a foreign land where 
                    I couldn t do anything about it.  I 
                    didn t feel he deserved any special 
                    favors.  I gave him the option to 
                    leave and he turned it down.

                                  BOYD
                    Well, all the trouble you re causing 
                    me I thought I d make you the same 
                    offer.  Get out of Harlan County by 
                    tomorrow noon or I ll come looking 
                    for you.  That sound fair?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Now you re talking.                                                                                    46.



      Boyd smiles, walks to his truck.  HOLD ON Raylan.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    47.



                                  ACT FOUR

      INT. HARLAN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - SOG OFFICES - DAY

      Raylan is in with Art.

                                  ART
                    It s become something personal?

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s what it looks like, since Boyd 
                    and I go back, but I think the only 
                    personal part is him not making a 
                    play when I went to see him.

                                  ART
                    What dhe say exactly?  He scoming 
                    for you or we recoming?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He said hewas.

                                  ART
                    But we don t know if he wants to 
                    shoot you or blow you up, do we?

      Raylan shakes his head.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    Or, Boyd might jump the gun, do it 
                    ahead of time, when you aren t 
                    looking.  I was you I d check under 
                    the car before you turn the key.

      Raylan gives him a look.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    We re like big game hunters.  Only 
                    you re the bait, like a goat 
                    tethered to a post.  All we have to 
                    do is keep you in sight.
                          (grins)
                    I knew bringing you here was a good 
                    idea.

      Raylan just looks at him.

      I/E. BOYD S PICKUP/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      Boyd is driving with Devil and Dewey beside him.                                                                                    48.



                                  DEVIL
                    I thought you were giving him 
                      twenty-four hours.

                                  BOYD
                    What that means is the next time 
                    you see the fella, not the next day 
                    to the hour.  Hell, he could be dug 
                    in waiting for you.  
                          (beat)
                    You know Raylan will have his own 
                    people.  We just have to separate 
                    him from his pack of suits and get 
                    him off by hisself.

                                  DEVIL
                    You wanna blow up a car like when 
                    we re going at a bank?

                                  BOYD
                    What I want is for you fellasto 
                    locate Raylan at the courthouse and 
                    follow him.  I m gonnaget the Pork 
                    Brothers to watch the motel.

      INT. HARLAN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

      Raylan comes out of the SOG offices.  He s surprised to see 
    Ava coming down the hall in dress-up clothes and pearls.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What brings you here?

                                  AVA
                    My lawyer s talking to the

      EXT. HARLAN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

      Raylan and Ava sit on the bench in front of the Coal Miners 
      Memorial.  Ava smokes.

                                  AVA
                    I plead to manslaughter and I won t 
                    have to go to prison.  Though if I 
                    have to, I have to.  It was worth it.
                          (beat)
                    Hey, why don t you come by for 
                    supper?  I ll fix you something 
                    nice.  Pick up a couple of fryers

                    Don t know when I ll be done.   

    Ava stubs out her cigarette.

                                  AVA
                    I m fixing it anyway.
                          (lookshim in the eye)
                    You re a big boy, Raylan.  You want 
                    to come, there s nothing on earth 
                    gonnastop you.

      EXT. HARLAN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DOWN THE STREET - DAY

      Devil and Dewey are watching Raylan and Ava from the front 
      seat of Dewey s old Cadillac.

                                  DEVIL
                    Wasn t for Boyd I d have me some of Ava.

                    Wasn t for Boyd me and you could 
                    have us the marshal.  Say we took 
                    him out, what would Boyd do, kick 
                    and scream?  He does that anyways.

                                  DEVIL
                    You got the nerve to shoot a marshal?

                                  DEWEY
                    I got the nerve and a reason to.

      They go silent for a moment.

                                  DEWEY (CONT D)
                    We get out on the highway, I reach in 
                    back for the twelve-gauge and blow 
                    him away.  What s wrong with that?

                                  DEVIL
                    There s nothing wrong with it.

      Dewey nods.                                                                                    50.



                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    Except for the squad of Fedsin front 
                    of and behind him watching you do it 
                    and shooting back until we re full of 
                    holes.  Other than that there s 
                    nothing wrong with it at all.

      Dewey frowns.  Devil allows himself a small grin.

      EXT. MOUNT-AIRE MOTEL - DUSK

    An SUV, Raylan s Town Car, and another SUVroll into the 
      parking lot of the Mount-Aire Motel on the highway.

    The battered Cadillacpulls off the highway and stops.

      I/E. CADILLAC/MOUNT-AIRE MOTEL - DUSK

      Dewey watches the motel with binoculars.  Devil gets on his 
      cell, dials.  Boyd picks up.

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                          (overcell)
                    Yup.

                          (into cell)
                    He s at the motel with his friends.

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                    You see ourfriends?

                                  DEVIL
                          (looking)
                    I do.

    He sees a pickup parked on the other side of the highway.

                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    You sure they re up for this?  Feds
                    usually have a shitloadof 
                    firepower.

      I/E. BOYD S PICKUP/COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK - CROSSCUT

      Boyd is in his pick up, on his cell with Devil.

                                  BOYD
                    All s I need is for our fat friends 
                    to slow  em down.  Even a minute ll
                    be enough.                                                                                    51.



                                  DEVIL
                    They could get killed.

                                  BOYD
                    I hope not.  But if they do?  
                    They re not that hard to replace.  
                    You saw with Jared, there s lot of 
                    folks want to hitch their star to 
                    Crowder s Commandos.  You just do 
                    your part, they ll do theirs and 
                    I ll do mine.

      Boyd hangs up.  PULL BACK to reveal he s parked by the 
      shuttered fruit stand with the JESUS SAVES! billboard.He 
      starts up his pickup and drives off.

      INT. AVA S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

    Ava wears a pretty dress.  Music is playing, the chicken is 
      frying, the biscuits are baking, the gravy is bubbling and 
      she s opening a bottle of wine.  

      There s a knock at the door and Ava smiles.

                                  AVA
                    Come on in, Marshal!  I m just 
                    opening the wine.  It s probably 
                    not as good as you re used to, but 
                    you d be surprised...

    She trails off when she sees Boyd standing in her living 
      room.

                                  BOYD
                    Hello there, Ava.  You expecting 
                    someone?

    And on Ava s expression--

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                  ACT FIVE

      INT. AVA S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Ava looks at Boyd, decides there s no future in lying.

                                  AVA
                    I invited Raylan for a homecooked
                    supper but I don t know if he ll 
                    make it or not.

                                  BOYD
                    Why don t you call him and remind 
                    him?  He s at the Mount-Aire.  
                    Here s the number.

      Boyd hands Ava a slip of paper.

                                  AVA
                    You talked to him?

                                  BOYD
                    Honey, me and Raylan are old 
                    buddies.  I thought you knew that.

    Ava hesitates, knowing something s off.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Go on, give him a call.  But don t 
                    say I m here.

                                  AVA
                    Why not?

                                  BOYD
                    I m not staying, so why mention it.  
                    I can see you want to flirt with 
                    him some.

                                  AVA
                    We was neighbors, that s all.

                                  BOYD
                    I know, and you want to talk about old 
                    times and so on.  Go on, call him.

      INT. MOUNT-AIRE MOTEL - RAYLAN S ROOM - NIGHT

      Raylan answers the ringing phone.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?                                                                                    53.



                                  AVA (V.O.)
                          (overphone)
                    Can you smell the chicken frying?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I sure can hear it.

                                  AVA (V.O.)
                    It ll be done by the time you get here.

      Raylan thinks for a moment, brow furrowed.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m on my way.

      INT. MOUNT-AIRE MOTEL - ART S ROOM - NIGHT

      Raylan is in with Art, Rachel, Frank and Tim.

                                  ART
                    Let s say he is there.  You don t 
                    see it as Boyd using her?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I would except she asked me this 
                    afternoon at the courthouse.

                                  ART
                    She could ve been setting you up then.
                          (beat)
                    I think we ll tag along.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I could give you directions, but it s 
                    a lot of  turn left at the falling 
                    down barn.   You best just follow.

    Art nods.

      EXT. MOUNT-AIRE MOTEL - NIGHT

      Raylan gets in the Town Car; Art and the others in the SUVs. 
      They head out, Raylan in the lead.

      I/E. CAR/PICKUP/SUVS/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

      Raylan turns onto the highway.  A second later... 

      A pickup lurches across the highway, gunfire spurting out of 
    the driver s side window and over the cab.

      Pork Brother #1 is driving, firing at the SUVs.                                                                                    54.



      Pork Brother #2 is in the truck bed, shooting over the roof.

      Both SUVsshudder to a halt as the occupants duck below the 
      dashboard, their windshields spiderwebbing.They all bail 
    out fast, taking cover behind their vehicles.

    ON THE HIGHWAY

      Raylan stomps on his brakes, starts to reverse.  His cell 
      rings.  He sees the caller ID -- it s Art.  Raylan answers.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (into cell)
                    Where do you want me?

    BY THE MOTEL

    Art is on his cell, hunkered down behind his SUVwith Tim.

                                  ART
                          (into cell)
                    Keep going.  Get Ava.  We got this.  

    ON THE HIGHWAY

      Raylan looks back at the stream of fire coming out of the 
      pickup and hitting the SUVs.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You got this?

                                  ART (V.O.)
                    We do.  Go.

    BY THE MOTEL

    Art shuts his cell, opens the back of the SUV, revealing an 
      arsenal of automatic weapons.  He and Tim each grab one.

                                  TIM
                    Do you want me to kill them?

                                  ART
                    Not yet.  

    He looks over at Frank and Rachel behind their SUV, arming 
      themselves.  He gestures to them.  They nod, start running 
      away from the firefight, keeping low, heading for the cover 
    of the other cars parked in front of the motel.

    ON THE HIGHWAY

      Raylan throws his car into drive and tears off.                                                                                    55.



    The Cadillacparked down the highway starts forward after 
      Raylan, lights dark.

    BY THE MOTEL

    Tim is down on the pavement with his rifle, aiming beneath 
    the SUV.He makes his shots coolly, with practiced aim, 
      taking out the tires of the pickup.  He gets back to his 
      knees, looks at Art.

                                  TIM
                    Kill  em or wing  em?

                                  ART
                    Start with winging.

    Tim nods, pops up, shoots twice -- through their SUV, out the 
      windshield. 

      Pork Brother #1 is hit in the arm drops down behind the dash 
    for cover.  His brother is hit in the shoulder flops down in 
    the bed of the truck.  

    Art and Tim go full auto and pump rounds into the windshield 
    of the Pork Brothers  pickup.

      WITH THE PORK BROTHERS

      Hunkered down, glass showering down on them.  And then the 
      fire from Art and Tim abruptly stops.  

                                  PORK BROTHER #1
                    You okay?!

                                  PORK BROTHER #2
                    I m hit!

                                  PORK BROTHER #1
                    Can you shoot?

                                  PORK BROTHER #2
                    I think so!

                                  PORK BROTHER #1
                    Then let s finish this.

      Pork Brother #1 starts to rise up, then stops when he feels a 
      pistol pressed to his temple.  The pistol is held by Frank.

                                  FRANK
                    Hey.                                                                                    56.



      Pork Brother #2 starts to rise up in the truck bed when he 
      hears a shotgun rack.  He glances up to see Rachel pointing a 
      shotgun at his head. 

                                  RACHEL
                    I ve been looking for any excuse to 
                    blow some asshole shead off, so 
                    please do something stupid.

    He lies back down, lets go of his AK.

      I/E. CAR/COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

      Raylan comes to the T-intersectionat the Jesus Saves 
      billboard, makes the turn.

    He checks his rearview, sees a car, lights out, make the turn 
    and follow.

      I/E. CAR/NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

      Raylan drives at a moderate speed down the narrow one-lane 
      dirt road winding through the forest.

    He checks his rearview -- the car is still following him, 
      lights still out, about fifty yards back.

      Raylan steps on the gas and shoots forward, now driving the 
      winding road at a wild speed.

      I/E. CADILLAC/NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

      Devil and Dewey see Raylan s car take off.  Raylan s soon two 
      bends ahead and out of sight.  Devil turns on the lights.

                                  DEWEY
                    He ll see us!

                                  DEVIL
                    He s already seen us, you moron.  
                    You want we should wrap ourselves 
                    around a tree?

                                  DEWEY
                    You re not gonnacatch him.

                                  DEVIL
                    Don t worry.  I ll get us to Ava s 
                    in plenty of time.  We ll back Boyd 
                    up when he makes his play.
                            (seessomething)
                    Christ Almighty...                                                                                    57.



      They ve come round a bend to find the Town Car stopped in the 
      middle of the narrow road.  Devil has to break hard to keep 
      from hitting it.

                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    The hell s he doing?

                                  DEWEY
                          (looking at Devil)
                    He must be sneaking up on the house.

                                  DEVIL
                          (looking past Dewey)
                    No, he ain t.

      Because there s Raylan standing at Dewey s side of the car, 
      hands resting on the sill next to Dewey.

                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    The hell are you doing?

                                  DEWEY
                    Why you blocking the damn road?

      Raylan doesn t say anything.  He opens the back door, gets 
      inside, picks up the shotgun and lays the barrel on the back 
    of the front seat, between Devil and Dewey.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Tell me what s going on.

      Silence.  Raylan racks the shotgun.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I didn t hear you.

                                  DEVIL
                    There ain t nothing going on.  We s 
                    out riding around.

      Raylan squeezes the trigger, putting a big hole in the 
      windshield.  Devil and Dewey clamp their hands over their 
      ears, shake their heads.  Raylan racks the pump again.

                                  DEVIL (CONT D)
                    Boyd wants to talk to you is all.

                                  RAYLAN
                    He told me he s gonna shoot me.                                                                                    58.



                                  DEWEY
                          (looks back)
                    Then what reyou asking us for, 
                    asshole?

      Raylan smacks the barrel across Dewey s face, hard, making 
    his nose run with blood.

                                  RAYLAN
                    An outlaw s life s hard, ain t it?

      Raylan puts cuffs on the end of the shotgun barrel, holds 
      them out to Devil.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Cuff your right hand, put the chain 
                    through the wheel and cuff gatorboy.

      Devil and Dewey do as their told.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Now your pistols and the keys.

      EXT. AVA S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Raylan approaches the house, shotgun barrel down.  The door 
      opens and there s Ava.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Don t feel you have to say anything.

                                  AVA
                    I swear to God, Raylan, I didn t 
                    know he was coming.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I believe you.

      INT. AVA S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Ava steps back and Raylan enters.  He sees Boyd, sitting at 
    the table laid out with a platter of fried chicken, bowls of 
      mashed potatoes, peas and carrots, a plate of biscuits and a 
      gravy boat.  Boyd is pointing an Army Colt .45 at Raylan.

                                  BOYD
                    No shotguns allowed.  Toss it outside.

      Raylan does.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Ava, why don t you go to your 
                    bedroom, watch TV or something.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    59.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                          (shehesitates)
                    Go on.

    Ava looks at Raylan.  He gives her a small nod and she goes.

      Boyd motions to Raylan with the .45.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Come on.  Have a seat.  Help 
                    yourself.  The gravy ain t bad.  
                    Not as good as your mama s, but it 
                    never is, huh?

      Raylan sits at the other end of the table.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    When you shot that Eye-talianguy,  
                    was there food on the table?

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, but it was set, glasses and dishes.

                                  BOYD
                    Have something.

      Raylan picks up a drumstick with his left hand.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    You had your gun -- what was it?

                                  RAYLAN
                    That time?  A Berettanine.

                                  BOYD
                    Where was your gun -- where mine is?

                                  RAYLAN
                    It was holstered.

                                  BOYD
                    Bullshit.

                                  RAYLAN
                    It was holstered.

                                  BOYD
                    Where was his?

                                  RAYLAN
                    In a beach bag, between his knees.

                                  BOYD
                    What dhe have in the bag -- what 
                    kind of piece?                                                                                    60.



                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t recall.

                                  BOYD
                    How dyou know when to pull?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He went first.

                                  BOYD
                    You gave him twenty-four hours -- 
                    the time was up when you shot him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Pretty close.

                                  BOYD
                    How much time you think you got 
                    left now?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I thought till noon tomorrow.

                                  BOYD
                    I m saying it s right now,  less 
                    you want to eat first.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You can call it off, I don t mind.

                                  BOYD
                    If you re gonnakeep after me, 
                    might as well get  erdone.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Your forty-five s on the table but I 
                    have to pull.  Is that how we do it?

                                  BOYD
                    Well, shit yeah, it s my call.  
                    What reyou packing?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You ll pay to find that out.

                                  BOYD
                    Ice water in your veins, huh?
                          (beat)
                    You want a shot of Jim Beam to go 
                    with it?
                            (callingover shoulder)
                    Ava!  Could you get us...?                                                                                    61.



    He trails off when he senses motion.  Ava is approaching, but 
    not from the bedroom.  She s coming from the living room, 
      shotgun leveled at Boyd.

                                  AVA
                    You want to know what Bowman said 
                    when he looked up and saw me with 
                    his deer rifle?

                                  BOYD
                    Honey, you only shoot people when 
                    they re having their supper?

    He looks to Raylan for appreciation of his quip, gets nothing.

                                  AVA
                    He had his mouth full of sweet 
                    potato and he said,  The hell you 
                    doing with that? 

                                  BOYD
                    Honey, put it down, would you, please?

      Boyd picks up a paper napkin, begins wiping his hands.  
      Raylan tucks a napkin corner into his collar, smooths it with 
    his right hand.

                                  AVA
                    And you know what I said?  I said, 
                     I m gonnashoot you, dummy. 

    Ava jerks the shotgun to her cheek and aims.

      Boyd grabs his Colt and points it at Ava.

    In one fluid motion, Raylan pulls his .45 and shoots Boyd 
      dead center, punching him back out of his chair, just as Ava 
      fires the shotgun, missing, a 12-gaugepattern ripping into 
    the bare wall.

      Raylan gets up, gun still in his hand, pulls away the napkin 
    and walks over to Boyd.  

                                  AVA (CONT D)
                    Is he dead?

      Boyd s pistol is out of his hand.  He s trying to say 
      something.  Raylan drops to one knee, listens. 

                                  BOYD
                    You killed me.                                                                                    62.



                                  RAYLAN
                    I m sorry.  But you called it.

    Ava watches Raylan with Boyd.  Raylan stands.

                                  AVA
                    He dead?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He is now.

                                  AVA
                          (beat)
                    Why dyou say you were sorry?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (beat)
                    Boyd and I dug coal together.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Establishing.

      INT. WINONA AND GARY S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Gary and Winona are in bed, lights out, asleep.  Gary wakes, 
      gets out of bed, moves sleepily toward the bathroom.

                                  WINONA
                    Toilet s broken.  

      Gary keeps going.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    And do not even THINK of pissingin 
                    the tub.  Or the sink.

      Gary changes course and heads out into the hall.

      INT. WINONA AND GARY S HOUSE - HALL/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      Gary comes out into the hall, feels a breeze.

                                  GARY
                    You leave the deck door open?

                                  WINONA
                    No, I did not leave the deck door 
                    open.

                                  GARY
                    Someone did and it sure as hell 
                    wasn t me.

      Gary moves off down the hall and into the kitchen.  He stops 
      when he sees...

      A FIGURE sitting at his kitchen table, drinking a beer, the 
      deck door open behind him.  

                                  GARY (CONT D)
                    What the--?

    The man at the table turns on the light.  It s Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hello, Gary.

      Poor Gary almost shitshimself.                                                                                    64.



      EXT. WINONA AND GARY S HOUSE - DECK - NIGHT

      Winona and Raylan are sitting out on deck chairs, Raylan 
      still working on his beer.

                                  WINONA
                    You almost gave him a heart attack.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Sorry about that.

                    What reyou doing here, Raylan?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m going to be in Kentucky for a 
                    while, working for Art Mullen in 
                    the Eastern District.

                                  WINONA
                    Why reyou here?

      Raylan shrugs, thinks, sighs.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I saw my father.

                                  WINONA
                    I heard he s sick.

                                  RAYLAN
                    He s dying.
                          (beat)
                    He wasn t... what I expected.

                    The lion has lost his teeth, huh?  
                    Nothing left for you to fight.  

      Silence for a few moments.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I was in Italy a while back, 
                    looking for a bookie named Harry 
                    Arno.  He d slipped my custody and 
                    I wanted to bring him back.  The 
                    Mob was looking for Harry, too, and 
                    they sent out a gun thug named 
                    Tommy Bucks to kill him.  One day, 
                    Tommy Bucks  goons took me, took my 
                    guns, put me in a room with another 
                    man, fellow named Robert Gee.

                    Good man.  Tommy Bucks comes in, 
                    asks me where Harry is and I tell 
                    him, no point in lying, but I guess 
                    he didn t believe me, or wanted to 
                    make sure I was telling the truth, 
                    so, to make sure I knew how serious 
                    he was, he shot Robert Gee in the 
                    heart.
                          (beat)
                    Next time I saw Tommy Bucks was in 
                    Miami.  I gave him twenty-four 
                    hours to get out of the country.

                    That s the man you killed?  The one 
                    on the news?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (nods, beat)
                    He pulled first, so I was justified, 
                    but ever since I ve been thinking, 
                    what if he hadn t?  What if he just 
                    sat there and let the clock run out.  
                    Would I ve killed him anyway?  I know 
                    I wanted to.  I felt it in my chest, 
                    behind my eyes.  
                          (beat)
                    I guess I never thought of myself 
                    as an angry man.

                                  WINONA
                          (laughs sweetly)
                    Oh, Raylan.  

      Raylan looks at her.

                                  WINONA (CONT'D)
                    You do a good job of hiding it, and 
                    suppose most folks don t see it, 
                    but honestly, you re the angriest 
                    man I ve ever known.

      Raylan looks at her -- what?  And on his incredulity mixed 
      with the realization she s absolutely right--

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                                  THE END
