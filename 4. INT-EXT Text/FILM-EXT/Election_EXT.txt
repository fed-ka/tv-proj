The school stretches out before us, slumbering in the overcast morning
air.
Along the front sidewalk, a lone JANITOR trundles a garbage bin filled
with overstuffed hefty bags.
A weathered FORD ESCORT pulls into the empty PARKING LOT and comes to
a stop near the athletic field.
A TEENAGE GIRL'S VOICE -
TRACY (VO)
None of this would have happened if Mr.
McAllister hadn't meddled the way he
did.
He should have just accepted
things as they are instead of trying to
interfere with destiny.
You see, you
can't interfere with destiny.
That's
why it's destiny.
And if you try to
interfere, the same thing's going to
happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.
JIM MCALLISTER, a teacher in his mid to late-thirties, emerges from
the car in running clothes and carrying a briefcase, gym bag, and
coffee mug.
On his way to the field, he crosses paths with the
janitor.
JIM
Morning, Lowell
Lowell nods, hoists a bag and tosses it into a dumpster.
JIM CIRCLES THE TRACK, sweating and panting.
ON THE GROUND JIM does sit ups
JIM
Twenty-one... twenty-two.
He collapses onto his back.
His head rolls to one side, and he
glances past the fence at --
THE PARKING LOT
Where a second CAR is just arriving.
JIM watches as TRACY FLICK, a
junior, and her MOTHER get out.
The mother helps remove a CARD TABLE and a big plastic sack from the
trunk before Tracy heads toward the school.
MOTHER
(distant)
Good luck!
JIM turns his gaze toward the sky, closes his eyes, sighs.
JIM sits in the bleachers, clapping his
hands
over his head.
JIM
C'mon, wolverines!
Defense!
Let's
hold 'em back!
JIM (VO)
I got involved. And I cared.
promise of good times.
TRACY (VO CONT'D)
It wasn't until junior year when we
worked together on the yearbook that
things got serious.
Dave wheels his car into the open garage.
The automatic door closes
behind him.
TRACY
Mr. McAllister? Mr. McAllister! Wait up
I
Jim, his tie loose and his sleeves rolled up, looks up from unlocking
his car.
Tracy runs toward him holding out a TERM PAPER FOLDER.
TRACY
I got all my signatures.
One hundred
and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
JIM
Hey, that's super
TRACY
Here they are.
JIM
You can put those in my box.
I'll look
at them tomorrow.
TRACY
Could you approve them now?
I'd like
to kick off my campaign right away, you
know, in the morning.
JIM
(resigned)
Right
He cursorily flips through the bound pages and offers them back to
Tracy.
JIM (CONT'D)
Looks good to me.
TRACY
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
JIM
NO, that's fine
TRACY
I thought you were supposed to keep
them.
JIM
Okay, fine. Sure
JIM throws his briefcase and Tracy's folder into the backseat.
TRACY
Thanks for everything.
JIM
You bet.
Tracy stays put as JIM climbs in, shuts the door and fastens his seat
belt.
TRACY
(cheery, awkward)
I can't wait to start campaigning.
JIM
Should be easy.
So far no competition.
TRACY
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's
number one soft drink, but they spend
more money than anybody on advertising.
I guess that's how come they stay number
one.
JIM
Yeah.
Okay.
well, good luck Tracy
They exchange a long, curious stare.
There's a tone at once
confrontational and vaguely sexual about this moment.
TRACY
You know, Mr. M., when I win the
presidency, that means you and I are
going to be spending a lot of time
together next year.
And I for one would
like that time to be harmonious and
productive. Wouldn't you?
JIM
Sure
TRACY
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to
make sure.
JIM
Good luck, Tracy.
JIM pulls away and heads for the parking lot exit.
JIM drives stone-faced, unblinking. Something about the music on the
radio mocks him.
JIM (VO)
I don't blame Tracy for what happened
with Dave. How could I? Dave was an
adult more than twice her age.
JIM pulls to a stop next to a giant DUMPSTER
Out of his window come yellowed newspapers, balled-up fast food bags,
and other detritus. He speeds away.
JIM (VO CONT'D)
Sure, she got on my nerves once in a
while, but I admired Tracy. I really
did.
INSIDE THE DUMPSTER we see Tracy's little bound book of signatures.
PAUL METZLER is SKIING in goggles and scarf. Behind
him is a cheesy
dated rear projection of other skiers. Suddenly Paul loses his balance
and FALLS.
CLOSE ON PAUL writhing in the snow.
PAUL
Why. . . ? Why. . . ?
PAUL (VO)
I was so mad at God when I broke my leg
at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break.
INSERT X-RAY LIGHT BOX
CLOSE ON AN X-RAY of a multiple FRACTURE.
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
The doctors told me I'd have to quit
sports for at least a couple years if
not forever.
INSERT	YEARBOOK PICTURE
Paul kneels in his FOOTBALL UNIFORM. The photograph erupts in flames.
Bonanza-style.
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
...which meant no first-string
quarterback in the fall. It was like the
end of my life!
Paul stands talking to FRIENDS in a very typical high school tableau.
All wear backpacks or carry books. A GIRL kneels to sign his cast.
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
When I got back to school everybody was
so supportive, and they all wanted to
sign my cast and everything...
and watches the river
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
... but I still couldn't shake the
feeling that now my life had no purpose.
What did God want from me?
THE VAST MISSOURI - always flowing, never stopping, no beginning, no
end
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
Why did I exist?
DAY
Paul is in the driver's seat of his hitching big-wheeled PICKUP TRUCK.
His door is open, and his radio blasts a SONG carefully selected to
boost soundtrack album sales.
Various FRIENDS OF PAUL'S hang around.
Tracy watches the scene from her seat on the SCHOOL BUS
TRACY (VO CONT'D)
Not like some rich kids who everybody
likes because their fathers own Metzier
Cement and give them trucks on their
sixteenth birthday and throw them big
parties all the time.
They don't ever
have to work for anything.
The .bus pulls away.
his car.
Tammy runs up to the car as it pulls away. She pounds on the window.
TAMMY
Stop! Wait!
Lisa stops the car, rolls down the window
TAMMY (CONT'D)
Where 're you going?
LISA
I'm not like you.
TAMMY
What...?
LISA
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in
love. We were just... I was just
experimenting.
Lisa speeds away, and we watch her car grow smaller and smaller.
CLOSE ON TAMMY'S FACE -
as we see the greatest disappointment of her short life break across
her face.
TAMMY (VO)
How can something that seems so true
turn out to be such a lie?
Lisa and Tammy are swinging synchronized on a swingset, smiling and
laughing. The image is slightly OVEREXPOSED as though to suggest an
ideal memory.
CLOSE ON TAMMY looking over at Lisa
TAMMY (VO CONT'D)
I mean Lisa and I were destined to be
together. It was so obvious. Of all the
people on the planet who had ever lived,
somehow we'd found each other.
CLOSE ON LISA
in SLOW MOTION, swinging next to us. She looks
back, her face so
happy.
TAMMY (VO CONT'D)
Lisa...
CLOSE ON LISA SWINGING -- next to us, a final reprise of Tammy's
favorite memory
TAMMY (VO)
What did I do to make her change?
What's wrong with me?
Lisa swings out of frame, and the swing returns EMPTY.
TAMMY (VO CONT'D)
(a whisper)
Lisa.
Tammy sits on a promontory overlooking an Omaha Public Power District
station -- towers, wires, insulators, a loud HUM.
TAMMY (VO CONT'D)
Sometimes when I'm sad, I sit and watch
the power station.
Tammy lifts a pair of BINOCULARS to her eyes, sees THE POWER PLANT.
TAMMY (VO CONT'D)
They say if you lie between two of the
main wires, your body just evaporates.
You become a gas.
I wonder what that
would feel like.
TAMMY'S STREET -- EVENING
Lisa's car speeds away, growing smaller and smaller. We're back at the
BREAK-UP.
CLOSE ON TAMMY'S FACE as she stares down the street, unable
to move. It
starts to rain. Tears roll down her cheeks, mixing with
the
rain. very French, very sad.
TAMMY (VO CONT'D)
I don ' t know what I did to make Lisa
hate me so much, but somehow she decided
to hurt roe. And she knew exactly what
to do.
LISA'S BEDROOM	DAY
CLOSE ON PAUL'S FACE --
matched in size to Tammy's. He is moaning, gasping.
FROM OVERHEAD --
Paul is sprawled on Lisa's bed, surrounded by stuffed animals. His
legs dangle over the edge of the bed, and Lisa kneels between them,
her head bobbing up and down.
PAUL (VO)
I sure was surprised the day Lisa
Flanagan asked me for a ride home and
ended up blowing me.
Lisa pauses and looks up at Paul.
LISA
I've wanted this for so long.
She resumes with renewed vigor
PAUL
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
LISA
Sorry.
Paul poses for a campaign photo in his football uniform.
He freezes
in position as though about to throw a pass.
Lisa adjusts his
position -- CLICK.
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
Since Lisa knew all about public
relations and stuff, she offered to help
me with my campaign.
We made a great
team!
Tammy spies from underneath the bleachers
Paul's truck pulls up, and Paul and Lisa get out
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
That spring was perfect.
My leg wasn't
bugging me too much, and the weather was
so nice.
And every afternoon after
school. Lisa and I would go to her house
to fuck and have a swim.
It was like we
were in a world all our own.
Tammy emerges from behind a tree.
She's on her bike.
Angry and
fragile, she watches the couple enter Lisa's house.
Tammy peeks OVER THE FENCE and sees --
LISA AND PAUL swimming.
Paul dives off the board and resurfaces right
into Lisa's arms.
MOVE CLOSER TO TAMMY as she dies a thousand deaths.
TAMMY (VO)
I had to do something.
I didn't know
what, but I had to do something.
FADE OUT
JIM is snapped out of his reverie by Sherry's voice
SHERRY
Say, Jim. Jim.
JIM looks. Sherry is walking out the patio door holding a big bottle
of wine with a corkscrew sticking out of it.
SHERRY (CONT'D)
Could you get this? I can't
JIM
Sure.
JIM takes the bottle.
CLOSE ON the neck as the cork emerges: POP!
A shirtless JIM is MOWING the lawn on a hot day.
He shuts it off as
Sherry emerges from the house with lemonade.
She wears culottes, a
halter top, and flip-flops.
JIM
I'd always liked Sherry, but we'd never
had a chance to spend any time alone
together.
How with Dave out of the
picture, I began to see what an
incredibly sensitive and giving person
she was.
JIM downs his glass in big thirsty gulps and hands her back the glass.
He watches her walk back to the house.
JIM (VO CONT'D)
Plus she had finally dropped all that
weight from her pregnancy, and really
she looked great.
THE RIPCORD of the lawnmower is pulled a couple of times until it
starts.
Tammy rides her bike on this crisp sunny spring day.
The music is
buoyant.
Tammy is all smiles.
TAMMY (VO)
Being suspended is like getting a paid
vacation.
Too bad it was only three
days
DAY
Tammy is hanging out by the entrance. A DUDE emerges from the store
carrying a 12-pack of beer. En route to his car, he throws Tammy a
pack of CIGARETTES.
DUDE
Here you go.
Tammy looks at the pack
TAMMY
Hey -- I said lights I
A cigarette hanging out of her mouth, Tammy rides by the front of this
Catholic girls' school.
NOW AT THE ATHLETIC FIELD -
Tammy gets off her bike, goes to look through the surrounding fence at
GIRLS PLAYING LACROSSE
in their cleats, short skirts, jerseys. LITURGICAL MUSIC accompanies
SLOW-MOTION close-ups of the girls in action.
Tammy seems to breathe them in
CLOSE ON A GIANT OUTLINED "0" --
drawn on white paper. A hand enters frame with a brush and begins to
fill in the outline with blue tempera-paint.
Camera RISES to reveal the "0" as part of a giant banner. Tracy is
working on some letters, while ERIC OVERHOLDT is working on others.
TRACY (VO)
What happened at the speeches was an
unconscienceable travesty. That little
bitch Tammy Metzier wanted to make a
fool out of me. Well, it wasn't going to
work. People do care who wins. Things do
matter.
Finally, we're high enough to read:
WHO CARES? I DO: VOTE TRACY!
TRACY
Eric, the "r" is supposed to be green,
not blue.
ERIC
Oh. Okay.
Eric carefully paints over his mistake, then works up
some courage.
ERIC (CONT'D)
So, Tracy, I was wondering if after we
finish with these you'd like to go to a
movie or something.
TRACY
That's okay.
I'm too busy.
Ouch.
Tracy's face is half-obscured by the bulging bag she carries down the
sidewalk.
Tracy opens her TRUNK and heaves the garbage bag inside slamming the
trunk, she looks around - no one.
MIGHT
Tracy's car drives down a REMOTE ROAD.
There are no sidewalks here,
and the surroundings consist of scrubby vegetation and industrial
structures.
In the background looms a POWER PLANT.
Tracy stop the car near an EMBANKMENT. She gets out and pulls the
garbage bag from the trunk.
With a big shove Tracy sends the bag cartwheeling down the hill
Breathing hard but clearly relieved, Tracy watches the evidence of her
deed tumble into obscurity.
NOW THROUGH BINOCULARS Tracy's shadowy figure runs back to the car.
HILL
ABOVE
POWER
PLANT
NIGHT
Tammy momentarily drops her BINOCULARS before raising them again.
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - Tracy's car speeds away.
Tammy drops her binoculars and mounts her bike
Tammy skids to a stop, drops her bike, and heads down the embankment.
CLOSE ON THE HEFTY BAG
as Tammy draws near. She pauses at first, but intrepid curiosity
conquers her fear. She unties the knot.
FROM INSIDE THE BAG we see Tammy's sudden look of HORROR
PAUL'S MANGLED FACE smiles up at her. Tammy raises it toward camera
JIM starts his car.
Sherry leans into his window.
She looks around
the neighborhood before kissing him firmly on the mouth.
SHERRY
Hey Yeah?
SHERRY
Take me to that motel.
Like you
wanted.
JIM
Right now?
SHERRY
Easy, tiger.
Come by after school.
I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
JIM
Three twenty-five.
SHERRY
Three twenty-five.
VROOM!
JIM roars past us in his new RED FERRARI CONVERTIBLE
JIM wears a BLACK SUIT and hip HRAPAROUND SUNGLASSES as he drives. He
lights a cigarette. Behind him is a cheesy dated REAR PROJECTION Of a
curvy MOUNTAIN ROAD. Next Stop: portofino!
JIM (VO)
What had blossomed between Sherry and
me was too real, too powerful to deny.
For the first time in years, I felt free
and alive!
JIM'S Ferrari heads up the driveway and into his assigned space He
opens the Ferrari door.
JIM'S FOOT touches the pavement - not a shiny Salvatore Ferragamo
loafer but a worn out Dexter.
WIDE -
JIM is back in his own clothes, and his car has reverted to a Ford
Escort in need of a wash. He heads toward the school.
TRACK WITH JIM as he SPRINTS toward the parking lot, fumbling for his
keys.
JIM exits with a bouquet of flowers and a plastic bag.
Jim's car speeds into the driveway and parks
Jim's car speeds toward the street.
JIM gets out of his car and races back toward the school.
JIM hurries back to his car, weaving his way through students
JIM pulls to a stop in Sherry's driveway.
JIM'S FINGER on the doorbell. DING-DONG.
JIM waits, rings again. Ho answer. He knocks. No one. He tries the
door. Locked. Maybe she's out back. He walks around the house to --
It's a lovely little backyard. Springtime flowers bloom. Bees buzz
among the peonies.
JIM opens the gate, approaches the back door, and knocks.
JIM
Sherry I
He rears back and aims his yell toward the second floor.
JIM (CONT'D)
Sherry I It's Jim!
No response. He tries the door. It's locked. JIM cranes his neck for a
last look at the house. As he starts to leave, he calls out one final
time, not really expecting a response.
JIM
Sherry
Suddenly A WASP STINGS him above his right EYE
JIM (CONT'D)
Oww! Fuck! Jesus fuck!
Cursing and holding his head, JIM stumbles out the gate
TIME LAPSE - as the sky darkens, the motel's NEON SIGN turns on.
JIM now descends the motel stairway carrying his Walgreen's sack.
He
puts the key into the drop box and gets in his car.
JIM'S car pulls into the driveway.
JIM wanders out the front door and stands in his driveway, bewildered
and alone.
The camera slowly CRANES UP, eventually looking down on
him from a great height.
JIM (VO)
As I walked out of my home that
evening, unsure if I'd ever return, my
entire life in question, I somehow
discovered within myself a place of
perfect peace.
Oddly, in my solitude I
felt more than ever a sense of communion
with every human being - past, present
and future.
Because no matter what we
tell ourselves, no matter what illusions
of friendship and family we create, each
of us is always and forever profoundly
alone.
TAMMY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
FROM OVERHEAD --
Tammy wears a white t-shirt and underwear and kneels at her bedside.
TAMMY (VO)
Dear God, I know I don't believe in
you, but since I'll be starting Catholic
school soon, I thought I should
practice.
Let's see... what do I want?
I want people to be nicer to each other.
I want Lisa to realize what a bitch she
has been and feel really bad and
apologize for how she hurt me and know
how much I still love her.
In spite of
everything, I still want Paul to win the
election tomorrow, not that cunt Tracy.
I also want a really expensive pair of
leather pants... and someday I want to
be really good friends with Madonna.
Love, Tammy
Jim's car has not moved from its spot on the driveway. Its windows are
now fogged. A LOUD GARBAGE TRUCK rumbles by.
JIM opens the door and looks around -- no sign of Sherry's car. He
stiffly walks to the side of the garage and unzips his pants to pee.
Now cradling his head on the roof of his car, JIM gathers what little
strength he has, gets in, and tries to start the cold engine.
JIM (VO)
I had no choice but to go home. I
needed to shower, get fresh clothes,
explain what I could to Diane.
But what
was I going to say?
That our marriage
had become a charade?
That making love
with Sherry had given me a vision of a
better life?
THE TAILPIPE finally coughs out a cloud of exhaust
JIM drives, bleary-eyed.
He creeps along his tree-lined middle-class
block.
JIM (VO CONT'D)
Then again, maybe I could slip in and
out without waking her up.
JIM slows to a stop, looks with dread at his home
JIM'S HOUSE	CONTINUOUS
On the front porch sits A GYM BAG.
JIM approaches, stares numbly at
the bag.
Drawing a long breath, he bends over and picks it up.
Attached is a NOTE reading:
"Don't come in."
At the foot of the main walk to the school, Tracy and her mother are
setting up a CARD TABLE covered with little pink cakes.
Jim's Ford Escort chugs its way through the fog and comes to a stop.
Looking like a war refugee, JIM emerges from his car carrying the gym
bag and heads toward school.
TRACY
(chirping)
Good morning, Mr. M.
JIM stops, turns slowly, regards mother and daughter with a crazed,
one-eyed, uncomprehending stare.
TRACY (CONT'D)
(holding one out)
Looks like you could use a cupcake!
JIM takes it wordlessly.
AS he heads up the walkway, he eats it in
two huge bites, like a feral animal.
TRACY (CONT'D)
(calling out)
What's wrong with your eye?
Are you
OK?
In the growing darkness, the restaurant radiates its distinctive
orange glow. The parking lot is nearly empty.
MCAILISTER
HOME	 NIGHT
JIM stands at his own back door, beaten and ashamed.
He lifts a hand
and knocks.
After a moment the door opens, and there is Diane.
JIM
Diane, I...
Diane looks at JIM in silence.
Her face reveals nothing, but there is
a deadness in her eyes.
After a moment, she turns back inside,
leaving the door open.
JIM follows his wife inside, closes the door.
The camera moves to
peek in the kitchen window, from where we watch JIM and Diane but
cannot make out anything they say.
JIM (VO)
I don't know how Diane and I made it
through that night, but we did.
Our
marriage had gone right to the brink,
but in the end I guess it was saved by
one simple fact: we truly loved each
other.
So we made a commitment to begin
the painful process of piecing our lives
back together.
The worst was over; the
mistakes of the past were behind us.
FROM OVERHEAD - JIM circles the track.
ON THE GROUND -- JIM does pushups. Then sit-ups.
JIM (VO)
The next day held the promise of a new
beginning. After all, what harm had
really been done? No one was dead.
As JIM moves toward the parking lot, the school recedes in an odd REAR
PROJECTION that suggests he is floating. The MUSIC here reinforces the
gravity of the moment, the inevitability of his fate.
JIM stops walking, and a disembodied STEEPING WHEEL floats into his
hands. The scene behind changes to:
The city passing by outside is another strange REAR PROJECTION. JIM
grips the floating steering wheel and makes turns wildly out-of-sync
with the background.
JIM (VO)
I don't remember driving home, or much
of anything that happened in the next
few days.
JIM lets go of the steering wheel, and it drifts away. JIM turns his
back to camera to face -
the sky.
JIM (VO CONT'D)
There were news stories in the paper
and on television, former students
calling with their support, endless
hours of doing nothing, thinking
nothing.
A shadow falls over Jim's face, and a hand offers him a glass of iced
tea. Grateful, JIM takes it, and looks up at -
DIANE, her head blocking the sun.
JIM (VO CONT'D)
Diane stood by me through the entire
humiliating ordeal, in a way, it sort of
evened things out between us.
Diane leaves. JIM looks up at the sky.
JIM (VO CONT'D)
Soon school was over, and summer
stretched out in front of me as it
always had. Funny how the rhythm of the
school year remains ingrained in you for
life. in mid-June we found out Diane was
pregnant.
FADE OUT
UNDER BLACK we hear the opening bars of a bouncy TIJUANA BRASS SONG.
PAUL IS DANCING,
twisting to the music at a PARTY, a giant grin on his
face, a big
sombrero with tassels on his head. Behind him
we can see an enormous
illuminated GRAVEL CONVEYOR. SUPER-IMPOSED:
"ONE YEAR LATER."
PAUL (VO)
Senior year was great I Sure, I didn't
get to play ball or be president, but I
got elected homecoming king and prom
king anyway. I got into Nebraska like I
wanted and early-rushed Phi Delts. At
the end of the year me and my buddies
threw a hitching Mexican party down at
the cement plant. Shit, that was a good
party. That was a good party!
LATER --
Paul is at a KEG, pumping it up and serving himself
a beer. He takes
a sip, seems to grow pensive.
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
The only really bad thing about senior
year was Lisa. Right before Christmas
she dumped me. One minute she's totally
in love with me and then boom she's
going out with my football buddy Randy.
Paul looks over at
LISA dancing suggestively with RANDY
Paul looks sad, takes another gulp, waves at unseen
friends.
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
Sometimes I wonder what would've
happened if I'd actually won the
election.
Maybe my whole life would be
different.
Like I might never have gone
to Yosemite with Greg and Travis.
Paul takes a BIG GULP and looks into camera.
PAUL (VO CONT'D)
Or maybe I'd be dead.
FADE OUT
UNDER BLACK we hear a distinctive AIRY HISS.
PARK DAY
Tracy walks along the edge of a pond on this overcast day, Her arms
are crossed, and she wears an oversized woolen sweater.
Wind blows
softly through her hair.
TRACY (VO CONT'D)
But sometimes I got lonely, and I'd
think about Dave.
I missed our talks.
Maybe it could have worked out between
us.
I don't know.
Tracy walks outside hugging her yearbook and sees
PAUL AT HIS TRUCK, surrounded by supplicants.
Tracy stops for a moment and watches.
She gathers her courage and
heads toward him.
Paul doesn't even notice her, so occupied is he
with his friends and admirers.
TRACY
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
PAUL
Sure, Tracy.
Paul takes the book, efficiently finds the page with his picture, and
goes to work.
TRACY
Can I sign yours too?
PAUL
Oh, yeah, sure.
(to a friend)
Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when
you're done*
Nolan finishes and hands the book over.
Tracy turns to the front
pages and finds them completely filled, as are the end pages.
Now she
looks for her picture.
When she finds it, it's almost completely
obscured by part of some ASSWIPE 'S long, illegible, exclamation
point-filled message.
Finally, she locates an available space and
begins to write.
TRACY (VO)
I thought very carefully about what to
write.
Because despite everything that
had happened with the election, I really
wished him well.
I even signed it...
CLOSE ON - Tracy writing: "Love, Tracy" beneath her inscription
Tracy takes Paul's book back to him.
He's already working on another
annual and barely looks up when he swaps with her.
PAUL
Thanks, Tracy.
Tracy starts to walk away and Paul stops her
PAUL (CONT'D)
Hey, Tracy I..
She turns around expectantly
TRACY
Yes, Paul?
PAUL
Have a great summer.
And good luck at
college.
TRACY
(genuinely moved)
Thanks.
You too.
It was great working
with you.
Tracy opens the book as she walks and stops when she finds
AN ALMOST BLANK PAGE with Paul's puny inscription at the bottom:
Have a great Summer!
Good luck at college
Paul Metzier'
A standard-issue car dealership: banner-draped lot, glass enclosed
showroom.
JIM (VO CONT'D)
...I landed a position at a Saturn
dealership.
OUTSIDE ON THE LOT JIM saunters toward a client reading stickers.
INSIDE THE DEALERSHIP JIM explains features of a CROSS-SECTIONED
SATURN
THE CLIENT IS IN A DRIVER'S SEAT while JIM leans in from the opposite
window, pointing out dashboard features.
JIM (VO)
Actually, it wasn't so difficult making
the transition from teaching to selling.
It's like I tell my customers: my role
is just to educate people so they can
make informed decisions.
THE GLASS DOORS TO THE SHOWROOM OPEN, and JIM watches a satisfied
customer drive slowly away in a new Saturn Twin Cam.
JIM (VO CONT'D)
When I send someone home with a new
unit, I feel a genuine sense of pride.
A test drive. JIM is in the passenger seat. Tracy nears the end of the
dealership's driveway.
TRACY
Where to?
JIM
Anywhere you want.
(checks his watch)
Just so long as we're not gone more
than a half-hour.
Tracy turns right.
They drive a moment in silence.
JIM
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
TRACY
Yeah.
JIM
Plenty of pep, too.
TRACY
Uh-huh.
JIM
And this model comes with ABS and dual
air bags standard.
TRACY
That sounds good.
A silence
JIM
So Tracy?
TRACY
Yes?
JIM
Why are you doing this?
TRACY
Doing what?
JIM
Coming to see me.
Are you trying to. .
humiliate me?
TRACY
Nooo.
I just thought...
l mean, I am
looking for a new car.
But I just
thought, well, I'm going away soon, and
you'll be stuck here and, I don't know,
I just think maybe if things had been
different we might have been, well,
friends. Real friends.
And then things
would be different.
Don't you think?
JIM just looks at Tracy - it's so very odd
JIM
Well, I... I... that's very nice of
you.
TRACY
(excited)
I've got an idea.
Tracy suddenly signals and takes a right.
Tracy and JIM and the Saturn zoom by.
Tracy takes a corner and pulls to a stop in front of a modest middle
class house.
JIM
What's this?
TRACY
My house.
Tracy sets the parking brake.
Jim's eyes register a suppressed panic.
JIM
I don't understand.
What's the deal?
Tracy looks deeply into Jim's eyes.
TRACY
I want you to do something for me.
JIM
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell
awaits him.
TRACY
(getting out)
I just have to get something. I'll be
right back.
Tracy heads toward the house. JIM sits and waits.
He scans Tracy's
house, notices the chipped and peeling paint,
the rusting lawn
furniture, the bowed porch steps.
NOW TRACY opens the door and gets in. She carries her YEARBOOK
and
gives it to Jim.
JIM
Oh, is this...?
(thumbing through
it)
God. First one of these I haven't been
in for a long time.
TRACY
Would you sign it for me?
Tracy reaches over the parking brake and flips the yearbook to the
blank pages at the beginning.
JIM
What a surprise.
TRACY
Take as much room as you want
JIM removes a pen from his breast pocket and uncaps
it. He considers
what to write.
TRACY (CONT'D)
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel
ready for college.
JIM
You'll be fine.
TRACY
I hope so
JIM
You will.
CLOSE ON JIM
He looks at the yearbook. He looks at Tracy. He looks out the
windshield. It's all so odd.
CLOSE ON THE BLANK PAGE JIM begins to write:
"Dear Tracy,"
