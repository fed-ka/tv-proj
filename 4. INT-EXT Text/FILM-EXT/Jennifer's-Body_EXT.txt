Devil's Kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded
by dense woods and mirrored lakes. It's the kind of town
that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one
stoplight.
On an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that
reads "WELCOME TO DEVIL'S KETTLE- Pop. 7,036. Come See
What's Cookin'!"
NEEDY
This is where it all went down.
"Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I
know, but the place just is named
after a dumb waterfall.
We see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing
over a rock face.
NEEDY V.O.
Well technically, it's two
waterfalls. One of them is normal--
it empties into a river basin. But
the other one goes into a hole.
And it doesn't come out. The
scientist guys can't explain it.
They've dropped all kinds of
things down there--bouncy balls,
red dye, radioactive slime-- but
nothing ever surfaces.

NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
Maybe it's another dimension. Or,
you know, just really deep.
The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except
for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifer's-- still
illuminated.
There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the
backyard. We're definitely in deep north country.
NEEDY V.O.
I've probably spent years of my
life in this house. Hundreds of
sleepovers, thousands of aimless
homework sessions, a million phone
calls. I've climbed through
Jennifer's window so many times.
But tonight, only one of us is
going to come out.
Three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and
lights engaged. OFFICER ROMAN DUDA, 22, a muscular young
COP, jogs authoritatively toward the house. He shakes his
head, dumbfounded.
ROMAN
Christ, Needy, what have you done?
Jennifer collapses in Needy's arms, coughing. Needy hugs
her fiercely, almost romantically. She cups Jennifer's
flushed face and looks into her eyes.
JENNIFER
(DAZED)
It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on
fire. Oh God, I'm burning!
NEEDY
You're okay, I promise. You got
burned worse when you wore that
tin-foil bikini to the beach.
Everything's fine.
Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both
girls jump. It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false
concern.
NIKOLAI
Are you girls all right?
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
Needy is less than thrilled to see him.
NEEDY
We're great. Maybe you should try
to find your band?
NIKOLAI
Those guys? They were the first
ones out the door. Ran for the van
like a bunch of Marys. Frankly,
I'm ashamed of them.
Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously.
Muffled SCREAMS rise up from the flame-engulfed building.
Jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down
her face.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
God, it feels like hell out here.
Come and hang with us in the van
for a while, just until they hose
this place down.
JENNIFER
Okay...okay...
She slumps against Nikolai's chest.
NIKOLAI
You're in shock. Here, drink this.
You'll feel better.
He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS
from his coat and holds it to Jennifer's lips. She swigs
it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin.
Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.
NEEDY
Aren't you a little freaked out
about this? What about all your
stuff? It's probably melting, and
when you get to the next stop
you'll have to do like, a crappy
acoustic set! Nobody likes that.
NIKOLAI
We'll be able to afford new gear
soon enough. I have a feeling
we're gonna blow up.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED: (2)
JENNIFER
(SLURRING)
I want to see your van. C'mon
Needy, let's go to the van.
NEEDY
Why? Why should we? We have the
Malibu. Let's just get out of
here. We can go to El Ojo and get
Northwoods Nachos with extra
Badger Sauce! Please? I'm
starving.
JENNIFER
Needy, stop it. Just stop it!
She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which
is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar.
Needy staggers after them slowly, watching.
Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence.
Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get
into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes.
Nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van,
revealing his slick, muscled white torso.
NEEDY V.O.
I watched her get into that van
and I knew something awful was
going to happen. But for some
reason, I felt drawn toward them.
Toward him. He was pale and
twisted and evil, like this
petrified tree I saw when I was a
kid.
We see LITTLE NEEDY, about five years old, staring up at
a petrified tree in the darkness, horrified yet
compelled. The tree seems to stoop forward, cracking...
BACK ON NEEDY:
Needy's face is fixed in the same haunted expression.
Nikolai turns to look at her, his teeth bared in a
vicious smile.
Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction,
away from the van and the fire.
29.
Moments before the first morning bell. Needy is sitting
at her desk in English class, still visibly bruised from
her scuffle with Jennifer the night before. She looks
like she hasn't slept a wink.
The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the
fire and gather in groups.
GOSSIPING GIRL
(WHISPERING)
I heard Needy and Jennifer were
there and they had to fight their
way out with a machete.
OTHER GIRL
Look, she's not even moving.
GOSSIPING GIRL
It's called Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder...
Suddenly, a figure steps in front of Needy. It's
JENNIFER, looking absolutely gorgeous-- and remarkably
unscathed. She smiles brightly at Needy as if nothing
happened the night before.
JENNIFER
Happy Friday!, D-bag!
NEEDY
You-- you're all right!
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
JENNIFER
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
NEEDY
Last night. At my house. You were
hurt. You had two black eyes and
blood everywhere and...
JENNIFER
Needy, you're delusional. I got a
little banged up when you made me
go out that window, but I'm fine.
NEEDY
(DUMBFOUNDED)
We had to go out that window. The
bar was like, engulfed in flames!
JENNIFER
You do have a tendency to
overreact. Remember at Girl Scout
camp when you thought there was an
earthquake and it was really just
two guys with a ghetto blaster?
NEEDY
A lot of people died, Jennifer.
They burned to death, or they
choked, or they just got trampled.
More than half of the people there
didn't make it out. It's like, all
over the news. National news. Kids
are dead. Parents are dead.
JENNIFER
Anyone we know?
NEEDY
We know everyone!
JENNIFER
Sucks to be them, I guess.
She giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse.
NEEDY
I don't get it. What's wrong with
you?
Jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together.
JENNIFER
What's wrong with you? I mean,
besides the obvious surface flaws.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED: (2)
Needy rubs her eyes, stunned.
NEEDY
(to herself)
There's no way I dreamed it. No
way.
She looks down at her hands. There's DRIED BLOOD under
her fingernails.
NEEDY V.O.
Her blood was still under my
nails. See, I'd been up all night
scrubbing the carnage off the
linoleum.
JONAS KOZELLE, the JOCK we saw sobbing earlier, is
standing at the deserted football field.
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles
eerily through the trees. The football is set back a good
a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone.
In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It
starts a dot on the horizon. As it draws closer, we see
it's JENNIFER. Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and
unmistakable.
Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder,
indifferent.
A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely,
Jennifer ISN'T THERE.
Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling
him.
JENNIFER
Hi!
JONAS
(ALARMED)
Oh. Hey, Jennifer.
JENNIFER
I'm crazy-sorry about your
profound loss. You are crying
about Craig, right?
JONAS
He was my best friend.
Jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically.
JENNIFER
I know. I was close to him too.
You know, I was there last night
in that horrible place. I saw
Craig a few minutes before the
fire broke out.
JONAS
You-- you did?
JENNIFER
Yeah. I was probably the last
person to talk to him. Like, ever.
Literally.
JONAS
Wow. What did he say?
(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED: (2)
JENNIFER
Well, we got to talking about you,
actually. And do you know what he
said? He said you were like a
brother to him. Not a bro. An
actual brother.
Jonas's lip trembles as he unsuccessfully fights back
tears. Jennifer cuddles closer to him.
JONAS
(choking up)
I just can't believe he's gone.
JENNIFER
I know, I know.
(BEAT)
Hey, you know what else Craig
said?
JONAS
What?
JENNIFER
Forget it. It's too intense.
JONAS
What? Please, Jen, you've gotta
tell me!
JENNIFER
Well, he said he always thought
you and me would make a totally
bangin' couple. Isn't that so
weird?
JONAS
He said bangin'?
Jennifer reaches for Jonas's hand and slides it slowly up
her shirt, placing it on her left breast.
JENNIFER
(WHISPERING)
Feel my heart, Jonas. I think it's
broken.
JONAS
(choking up)
Mine too.
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED: (3)
JENNIFER
Come with me. Just for a while.
We'll help each other get through
this nightmare. It's what Craig
would have wanted.
Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. Jennifer leads him away
from the field, toward the WOODS bordering the school
campus. They vanish into the woods. In the distance, we
see the FALLS rushing into the lake.
Needy and Chip are walking home from school, still deep
in discussion.
CHIP
The whole night must be a total
blur, right?
NEEDY
That's the thing, it's not a blur
at all! I remember everything, in
like ultra-high-def detail. The
band, the fire, everything.
Especially what happened after.
CHIP
"After" is the part I don't really
get, to be honest.
NEEDY
Please, I need someone to believe
me. Jennifer was-- she was
destroyed. She was dying in my
hallway, Chip. I saw. I used my
CPR training to check her pulse.
And I felt her dying, on the
inside, I mean. I've known her so
long that it's like sometimes I
can feel what she feels. We're
like E.T. and Elliot Ness.
CHIP
I believe you.
Chip takes Needy's hand and squeezes it.
NEEDY
Thanks, Chipper.
42.
A horrible SCREAM of agony rises from the woods. Mr.
Wroblewski is exiting the school, briefcase in hand. He
stops in his tracks when he hears the scream. He shakes
his head sadly.
MR. WROBLEWSKI
(to himself)
God, they're feeling so much pain.
Another scream, this time weaker.
MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)
Let it all out, kids.
He heads for his Ford Festiva, then pauses as if thinking
better of it. Something isn't right. He puts his keys
back in his pocket and walks toward the woods to
investigate.
Mr. Wroblewski ventures into the woods, heading toward
the clearing. At first, we can only hear mysterious
sounds-- scratching and smacking. Birds and animals are
closely gathered in a circle.
Suddenly, Mr. Wroblewski clutches his arm and gags,
realizing the animals are feeding on a huge CARCASS.
A BADGER looks up, its snout soaked in blood.
Mr. Wroblewski begins to scream. The animals scatter.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
A glimpse of the CORPSE: It's Jonas, of course. His
entire torso has been torn open, exposing his ribs and
guts. Blood and viscera everywhere, INTESTINES strewn
about the forest floor like party streamers.
MR. WROBLEWSKI
Virgin Mother!
Mr. Wroblewski falls to his knees, hollering.
A hysterical SCREAM pierces the twilight.
The sun has begun to set. An ambulance and four police
cars have pulled up near the woods, which are cordoned
off with yellow police tape. Near the woods, JONAS'S
PARENTS are crying. His MOTHER screams and begins beating
the ground with her fists.
A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance.
OFFICER WARZAK exits one of the police cruisers. Her
signature giant poofy bangs are in full effect.
She rushes to comfort Jonas's bereaved mother.
OFFICER WARZAK
We will get the man that did this
to your son. You hear me? We'll
get that sick M.F.
JONAS'S DAD
I'll get him myself! I will! You
hear me, you bastard? I'll cut off
your nutsack and nail it to my
door! Like one of those lion
doorknockers rich folks got!
That'll be your balls!
The sound of Jonas's parents screaming carries across the
lake. The water is eerily calm.
Suddenly, a HEAD breaks the surface of the lake. It's
Jennifer, gliding through the water. She looks calm and
serene.
The SCREAMING continues across the lake. The sirens,
shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful
scene.
Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the
pier, naked and dripping wet. She runs her tongue over
her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out
from between her two front teeth, like she's just
finished a delicious rib dinner.
Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her
clothes, which are neatly folded on the pier.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
Once she's dressed, she walks off into the woods, as if
nothing out of the ordinary has happened.
The park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a
popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's
Kettle. The abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of
couples making out. Needy runs past them skittishly.
As she ascends a grassy hill, CHIP is revealed,
silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights.
Needy squints at the lights, sees CHIP's house in the
distance.
NEEDY
Why are the cops at your house?
CHIP
They're not. They're at Jonas
Kozelle's house. He got murdered.
NEEDY
What?! Like, he was shot by
gangbangers?
CHIP
(EXASPERATED)
No, Needy! Do you see anyone
rollin' on dubs around here?
(BEAT)
Someone ripped Jonas limb from
limb in the woods behind the
school. Ate parts of him. They
found teethmarks on him-- on the
body.
His voice cracks. We see a brief, terrifying FLASH of
Jonas's mutilated body and pain-stricken face.
Needy doesn't want to believe it.
NEEDY
Some animals must've got to him.
CHIP
Human teethmarks.
NEEDY
Who would do that?
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
CHIP
I don't know. It just happened
after school. No one's supposed to
know yet, but my dad went over
there and talked to the cops.
Jonas's mom is catatonic. She's
just staring out the front window
like a zombie mannequin robot
statue.
NEEDY
This can't be a coincidence.
CHIP
What do you mean, Needy?
NEEDY
A fiery death trap last night, and
now a cannibal eats our starting
tight-end? Come on!
CHIP
Don't get spooky on me, babe.
NEEDY
Seriously Chip. Most small towns
only have something gruesome
happen like, once every decade
maybe. Devil's Kettle gets two
nightmares in 24 hours? It's
freaktarded. It's not right.
CHIP
What, do you think it's, like
supernatural?
NEEDY
I don't know. I'm extremely
intelligent but I obviously don't
know everything.
CHIP
Well, the bad luck's gotta be over
now, right? It can't get any
worse, right? Obviously it can't.
It can't. I mean, you agree,
right? There won't be another
victim.
NEEDY
You're shaking.
CHIP
I'm cold. It's very cold out here.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED: (2)
NEEDY
Want my sweater?
CHIP
It's pink.
NEEDY
Pink is cool. Rap guys wear pink.
She's shaking now, too. Chip leans forward and kisses
her. She closes her eyes.
In the chaste space between CHIP and Needy's bodies, the
volleyball-pit couple fuck like rabbits.
DISSOLVE TO:
A SERIES OF NEWSPAPER HEADLINES
The familiar Soft Shoulder ballad plays as we see a
dreamy montage of headlines.
The headline of the Devil's Kettle Sun-Post simply reads:
"WHY?"
The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads:
"'BUTCHERED': Devil's Kettle youth brutally murdered in
wake of devastating fire."
A smaller headline on the front page of the New York
Times reads: "Minnesota town rocked by grisly murder,
blaze."
NEEDY V.O.
We were famous. We were saints.
Our town's only bar had burned to
the ground and our star
quarterback was somebody's Quarter
Pounder. The whole country got a
huge tragedy boner for Devil's
Kettle. And the press-- God, they
couldn't get enough of our little
world of shit.
We see Devil's Kettle citizens holding a tearful
candlelight vigil by the former Carousel site. They
softly sing along with the Soft Shoulder song.
MOURNERS
(SINGING)
Through the trees, I will find
you...

54.
CONTINUED:
We see weeping students shoving flowers through the slats
of Jonas' abandoned locker. The hallway floor is covered
with teddy bears and bouquets.
We see the PASSING OF TIME as the bouquets wilt and the
blooms droop.
The pile of discarded scratch-off tickets next to Needy's
mother's bed grows steadily as the days go by.
Another Star Tribune headline. This one reads: "Two weeks
later, cannibal killer still at large." A smaller subhead
reads "ARTS: Local band Soft Shoulder sign to major."
NEEDY V.O.
The days marched on as usual, but
most of us were too numb to enjoy
ourselves. Most of us.
We see Jennifer cheerfully skipping down the school
hallway in a sleazy Technicolor outfit. The rest of the
kids look grey, ashen and depressed, but Jennifer pops
like a Roman candle.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
Still, we were healing. Like CHIP,
we figured things could only get
better. We had faith.
We see clusters of cautiously optimistic kids in the
school courtyard. They smile, then laugh, as if they're
re-learning how to be happy.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
We were fucking idiots.
It's late September. Leaves are beginning to drift off
trees. The surrounding woods are still blocked off with
yellow police tape.
Colin Gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a
classic car. He's blasting punk music on an iPod that's
been rigged to the ancient AM radio.
Colin holds up his CELL PHONE to re-read the directions
Jennifer texted him.
The street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by
a new townhouse development. The identical units still
appear to be under construction. There aren't even any
streetlights. The plastic sheeting over the windows flaps
eerily in the breeze.
Colin's brow furrows in confusion-- it doesn't even look
like anyone lives here yet. He checks the phone display
again.
CLOSE ON PHONE:
The TEXT MESSAGE reads:
"trn lft on camerford and your there. first house on rt.
1004 camerford. C-ya! xoxo jen"
Sure enough, the house number is 1004. Colin throws the
car into park and walks up to the porch. He looks up and
notices a glow coming from an upstairs window,

Colin presses the doorbell. Nothing happens-- the house
isn't wired for electricity yet.
Needy runs toward her mom's CAR, a beat-up Kia parked on
the curb.
She climbs into the car and starts the ignition,
trembling and crying.
She pulls out onto the street and guns it. She swings a
hard left. The streets are all almost identical, lined by
working-class homes.
She turns on the radio. The song is, of course, "Through
the Trees" by Soft Shoulder. She pounds the dashboard,
hysterical.
NEEDY
Fudge! Fudge! Maple fudge!
Needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark,
tree-lined street. Then, she sees something bright emerge
from the shadows. Her eyes widen...
It's JENNIFER, creeping toward the curb like an animal.
She's pale in the moonlight. The entire lower half of her
face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore.
She flashes a huge, deranged, toothy SMILE at Needy.
Needy screams and SWERVES. The car fishtails out of
control and slides into a ditch.
Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get
out of the trench. She glances desperately out the side
window. Jennifer is gone.
Panting, Needy tries to accelerate again.

67.

Suddenly, Jennifer appears from out of nowhere and SLAMS
her body against the windshield, her long limbs splayed
like an insect's. The windshield SHATTERS. Jennifer grins
at Needy through the cracking glass.
Needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and
manages to rear up out of the ditch. Jennifer's body
tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the
street.
RADIO DJ
That was, of course, Soft
Shoulder. They're going to be
playing a benefit concert in
Devil's Kettle next month. Talk
about giving back to the
community! Generous guys, I tell
ya...
Needy throws the car into park and races up the front
walk. She unlocks the door, shaking and fumbling. She
bursts into the darkened house.
Little Needy and Little Jennifer are playing Barbies in a
sandbox. Needy holds a brand new, immaculate Barbie doll.
LITTLE JENNIFER
I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and
you be her.
She tosses Needy a naked brunette doll with its hair
chopped off and an arm missing.

LITTLE NEEDY
Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley?
LITTLE JENNIFER
You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken.

She puts her hand down in the sand emphatically and
suddenly HOWLS in pain.
LITTLE NEEDY
What's wrong, Jennifer?
Jennifer lifts her hand. There's a TACK stuck in her palm
and it's bleeding.
LITTLE JENNIFER
OWWWWWW!
(trying to swear like
a grown-up)
Damn! Ass!
Needy grabs Jennifer's hand, pulls out the tack and wipes
away the blood. It's still bleeding. Panicking, she leans
forward and instinctively puts her mouth to the wound.
Jennifer watches quietly. Needy pulls away.
LITTLE NEEDY
Better. We should get a Band-Aid
though.
LITTLE JENNIFER
We're sisters now, you know.
Needy nods.
LITTLE JENNIFER (CONT'D)
Don't tell my mom about this.
She'll make me get a shot.
NEEDY
I never tell on you.
The van rumbles down an uneven forest path, deep into the
woods. They arrive at the real Devil's Kettle-- roaring,
ominous waterfalls. There's a crude stone altar
illuminated by moonlight.
The door of the van slides open. Nikolai pulls Jennifer
out of the van and hustles her into the clearing. He
looks up into the sky.
NIKOLAI
We got a waxing moon. Perfection.
MICK
You're the man, Wolf.
The four band members surround Jennifer, looking
statuesque in their sexy rock n' roll ensembles.
Without warning, Nikolai hauls off and KICKS Jennifer.
She yelps and falls onto her back on the dirt.
Dirk looks apprehensive.
DIRK
I don't know if we should go
through with this.
NIKOLAI
(ANGRILY)
Do you want to be rich and famous
like the guy from Maroon 5? Or do
you want to be a huge suicidal
loser?
DIRK
(SADLY)
Maroon 5.
NIKOLAI
Then grow a pair and fetch me the
ritual! God.
Dirk obediently heads over to the van. He pushes the
intimidating-looking magical books aside and retrieves a
single folded piece of computer paper.
MICK
That's it?
NIKOLAI
What? I found it on Google.
He unfolds the piece of paper and clears his throat.

The guys have dragged Jennifer onto the makeshift altar
and are holding her down. She struggles and screams, but
Dirk slaps her again.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
We come here tonight to sacrifice
the body of...
He tries to remember Jennifer's name and fails.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
...this chick from Devil's Kettle.
JENNIFER
(WHISPERING)
My name is Jennifer.
NIKOLAI
That's fascinating.
Dirk and Mick exchange nervous glances.
JENNIFER
Please let me go. I'll do
anything. Anything you want.
Nikolai examines her with an appraising eye.
NIKOLAI
I only hump nines and tens. You're
a seven at best, even with the
chicken cutlets.
He reaches into Jennifer's bra and casually pulls out a
GEL BREAST ENHANCER, tossing it aside.
Jennifer rears up and SPITS in his artfully rumpled hair.
Nikolai smooths his `do, enraged.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
I'm gonna carve you like a
pumpkin, bitch. Don't you know
that me and my boys are in league
with the Beast himself?
He wiggles his menacingly pointy fingers in her face.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
We've spent months making

We went from college radio to

But that's not enough, Jenny. We

stadium tours and Skittles sorted
by color. In short, we want more.
And to get more, we have to
butcher you. And bleed you.
JENNIFER
(DESPERATE)
Maybe you could just hire a
publicist. Make some T-shirts or
something. Hey, I could be on your
street team!
NIKOLAI
Sorry, darling.
JENNIFER
Please...
NIKOLAI
(LOUDLY)
Start chanting, boys.
The group begins chanting jibberish in unison. Jennifer
struggles, watching as their eyes go hollow and black.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
With deepest malice, we deliver
this virgin unto thee.
He unsheathes a huge, gleaming knife and raises it Psycho-
style, admiring his reflection in the blade.
DIRK
Dude, that is a hot murder weapon!
NIKOLAI
It's a bowie knife.
DIRK
Bowie. Nice.
Snickering, Nikolai begins to sing "Starman" by David
Bowie. The group joins in merrily.

As the group sings, Nikolai brings the knife down with a
grin. We hear Jennifer SCREAMING, sounds of violence and
clothes ripping as Nikolai relentlessly beats her and
stabs her, his face contorting demonically. The band
continues to sing, their voices carrying over the trees.
Nikolai walks over to where the "devil side" of the falls
rushes into a black hole. He drops the murder weapon
into the churning water, smiling.
We see Jennifer staggering down the street, battered,
mutilated and bloody. She spits a few TEETH onto the
curb, clutching her chest. We see her wander toward
Needy's house...
Jennifer is wandering down a rural road in a daze. She
hears a faint COUGH. Jennifer stops and sees a hunched
FIGURE walking down the opposite side of the street. It's
AHMET FROM INDIA, the foreign student. He's covered in
soot and looks traumatized.
Jennifer takes a step. Ahmet takes a step. Jennifer
stops. Ahmet stops.
Their eyes meet. Jennifer crosses the street. Ahmet
stares at her, frightened. Jennifer addresses him in a
quiet, gravelly voice.
JENNIFER
Ahmet. You made it out.
Ahmet coughs.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)
Are you lost?
Ahmet NODS.

JENNIFER (CONT'D)
Come with me. We'll sort this out.
She takes Ahmet's hand. As her BLOODY NAILS dig into his
wrist, his eyes widen.
We're in a small Catholic cemetery. A small, neat gravel
path runs through the stately old monuments into a small
valley where a funeral is taking place.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
Faint moaning and sobbing can be heard. Then, a
procession of 6 or 7 GOTH/EMO KIDS appears on the crest
of the hill. They move forward into the cemetery,
flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon
hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc.
These are Colin Gray's friends.
One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on
the path as she stumbles along, weeping.
At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative-
looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded
by sympathetic mourners. NEEDY stands near the back,
looking shell-shocked. There are also a few press
photographers snapping photos, and of course, a Catholic
priest.
PRIEST
We gather here today to celebrate
the life of Colin Gray, who was
plucked from the prime of...
The priest and family are momentarily distracted by the
motley crew of Goths descending on the funeral. The
priest clears his throat disapprovingly.
PRIEST (CONT'D)
What is this disturbance?
MR. GRAY
These are Colin's friends.
A GOTH BOY runs up to the grave and drops to his belly.
GOTH BOY
Colin! Take me with you! I belong
down there! In the DAAAARKNESS!
GOTH GIRL
No, Kevin. Those are just his
fleshly remains. He's among the
dark angels of the realm now. Fly,
Colin. Fly into the firmament.
She lights a bundle of SAGE and waves it in the air.
Colin's father gags, appalled.
GOTH BOY
Is it cool if we camp here for a
few days? We want to commune with
his corpse. He was our spooky
homeboy.
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED: (2)
PRIEST
Children, this is a private
service for family only.
GOTH GIRL
(to Colin's mother)
Oh, right. I need to ask you
something, Mrs. Gray. It's really
important for me to have closure.
PRIEST
Young lady, have some respect for
this family...
MRS. GRAY
(waving him off)
No. It's fine.
GOTH GIRL
Is it true that Colin had a date
with Jennifer Check the night he
was killed?
She says "Jennifer Check" as if it were the most
disgusting name imaginable. Needy covers her face.
GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
Because Jennifer Check is a social
disease. She's not like us. She
thinks she's so special just
because she's popular and and is
what "society" considers
"attractive." But she's not
sincere. She's about as emo as a
breast implant! And she listens to
Jessica Simpson and shops at
Hollister. And I just know Colin
would never go out with someone
like that, and I just need
confirmation. From you. So did he?
MR. GRAY
Did he...?
GOTH GIRL
Have a date with Jennifer Check.
Colin's parents stare at the ground.
GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
Oh God. Oh God. I knew it! That
BITCH! I will erase her! I'll put
a freaky Druid spell on her!

(CONTINUED)
81.

GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
I'll spell her preppy ass right
into the ground!
The parents flinch.
GOTH BOY
Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad
at the person who murdered Colin.
All Jennifer Check did was invite
him over to watch Aquamarine.
GOTH GIRL
That's WORSE!
She throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the
dirt like a toddler.
Colin Gray's mother buries her head in her hands and
begins weeping. Mr. Gray attempts to comfort her.
GOTH BOY
Colin wouldn't have liked this.
MRS. GRAY
(losing it)
Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah,
you're right! I'm pretty sure my
son wouldn't have liked being
eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and
buried before his eighteenth
birthday! Wow, you must have known
him so well!
MR. GRAY
Jill...
The goth boy looks terrified. But Mrs. Gray's not done
ranting yet.
MRS. GRAY
By the time they found Colin in
that godforsaken house, he looked
like lasagna with teeth. I'd know--
I had to identify the remains. My
boy's not in the realm of the
undead. He's not flying around in
the firmament with magical wings
of flame. He's in an overpriced
rosewood box that's headed six
feet downtown.
She kicks the coffin to illustrate.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED: (4)
MRS. GRAY (CONT'D)
So you can take your pain and
shove it up your asses, kids.
I got the monopoly on pain!
The kids stare at her in awe. Needy watches as Mrs. Gray
collapses into Mr. Gray's arms.
Two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence
surrounding the football field. It says "TURNABOUT DANCE
OCTOBER 5 -- TICKETS ON SALE."
Needy walks briskly toward school, huddled in her parka.
She looks totally fucked up, like she hasn't slept in
days. There are hollows beneath her eyes.
NEEDY V.O.
They did a big memorial assembly
for Colin at school, and we had to
watch another presentation about
curfews and the buddy system and
how to deal with grief. But nobody
seemed to care anymore. Sorrow was
last week's emotion.
We see Jennifer a few yards away, talking and laughing
with some other flag team members.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
Jennifer and I hadn't spoken since
our encounter in my room.
Actually, I hadn't really spoken
to anyone. I was busy with
research. Paranormal research.
Needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes. As
she stares at Jennifer, she see has a series of brief,
gruesome HALLUCINATIONS:
Jennifer as a grinning death mask. Jennifer as a corpse,
the lower half of her face rotted away. Jennifer as a
harlequin monster. Needy hears the rush of her own blood,
the barely audible buzzing of flies...
Chip jogs up next to her, jolting her out of her reverie.
CHIP
Hey. Did you buy Turnabout tickets
yet? I don't get paid until next
week.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
NEEDY
I gotta show you something.
CHIP
What is it?
NEEDY
Not here. Behind the school.
CHIP
What is it?
NEEDY
Evidence.
CHIP
(WEARILY)
Is this about Jennifer?
NEEDY
Yes, but I promise you this is the
last thing I need to show y--
CHIP
(INTERRUPTING)
Needy, I care about you. A lot. As
a person, not just a girl I made
love to for four minutes the other
night. And I'm scared of what's
happening to you. You're acting
really fucked up.
NEEDY
Please just let me show you.
Her gaze is so intense and crazed that Chip has no option
but to submit. He nods reluctantly.
Needy and Chip walk to an alley behind the school.
Melting snow drips off the eaves.
Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it. It's
full of copies from the library and Internet printouts.
The spine reads "JENNIFER RESEARCH"
NEEDY
Look at this.
She thrusts a piece of paper into CHIP's hands.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
CHIP
(CONFUSED)
Demon...demonic...
NEEDY
Demonic transference. It's
something that happens when you
try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan
without using an actual virgin!
CHIP stares at her.
NEEDY (CONT'D)
I think that's what happened to
Jennifer. Those guys from that
band were trying to sacrifice her
in the woods. But what they didn't
realize is that she hasn't been a
virgin since junior high!
Jennifer's a total cum-dumpster!
It all makes sense now! Read
this...
She grabs the piece of paper from him.
NEEDY (CONT'D)
(READING)
"If the human sacrifice is impure,
the result may still be attained,
but a demon will forever reside
the soul of the victim. She must
forever feed on flesh to sustain
the demon." See?
CHIP looks more dubious than ever.
CHIP
Uh-huh.
NEEDY
She's eating boys! They make her
strong. Really strong. And when
she's hungry, she gets weak and
cranky and her hair is all full of
split ends. And look at this...
She holds up one of the printouts.
NEEDY (CONT'D)
It says that before the demon
feeds, it vomits a gruesome
substance on its prey. Like I saw!
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED: (2)
CHIP
You--you really think Jennifer
killed Jonas and Colin?
NEEDY
And possibly Ahmet from India.
Needy is silent for a moment. She realizes CHIP will
never believe her and that she'll lose him forever if she
continues babbling.
CHIP
Really? You think she ate those
guys?
NEEDY
No. No! Of course not!
CHIP
Is that what you think?
NEEDY
No...Listen, I'll make an
appointment with Mr. Feely. I'm
real sorry about this sudden onset
of teenage paranoia.
(ROBOTIC)
My hormones and emotions are
aswirl, and my moods are
erratic...
CHIP isn't totally convinced, but his face softens.
CHIP
It's all right, Needy.
NEEDY
This has been a crummy school
year, Chip.
CHIP
No shit.
Needy turns and pitches the black binder into a Dumpster.
NEEDY
Listen, I'm done with all that
devil stuff. Do you know what
you're wearing to Turnabout?
CHIP
I was thinking a suit with black
shoes and a boutonniere, right
here.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED: (3)
He taps his chest. Needy laughs.
NEEDY V.O.
I was so in love with him. I
didn't want to mess it up with my
infectious crazy. Only I wasn't
actually crazy. Everyone else was
crazy. But when you're the only
sane one, you might as well be
crazy. It's subjective, you know?
CHIP
What color dress are you gonna
wear? I need to order your wrist
corsage.
NEEDY
I don't know yet.
CHIP
How about magenta? You're
definitely a winter. My mom says
winters should wear regal jewel
tones like magenta. Or possibly
teal.
NEEDY
Oh yeah, your mom's an Avon lady.
CHIP
Well, they call them "sales reps"
now.
NEEDY
Right. Well, I'll try to find
something magenta.
CHIP
That'll look dope.
Chip is cutting through the park on his way to the dance.
He whistles to himself.
Across the park, he sees a STRAY DOG trotting toward him.
The dog pants aggressively. CHIP tries to smile, but
looks uncomfortable.
A few SQUIRRELS emerge from the trees, gazing curiously
at him.
Chip picks up the pace, jogging down the path. In the
distance behind him we can barely make out Jennifer's
form. She looks more spectral then we've ever seen her.
Chip speeds up instinctively.
Suddenly, Jennifer's about ten paces closer.
Then she's closer again, as if she can fold space and
time. She's ethereal, flickering.
CHIP turns to look over his shoulder.
Chip continues to hurry briskly along through the park.
JENNIFER
CHIP!
CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer
appears, improbably, right in front of him. She's wearing
a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)
Didn't you hear me calling your
name?
CHIP
You weren't calling my name.
JENNIFER
Yes, I was.
CHIP
I couldn't hear it.
JENNIFER
I think you were maybe spacing
out. You were like this: Derrrrr.
She mimics a blank, drooling expression.
CHIP
I was?
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
JENNIFER
Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I
need to talk to you about you-know-
who. Our little Needy.
CHIP
I know.
JENNIFER
Are you worried? `Cause I'm super-
stressed about her. God knows how
I even sleep at night.
CHIP
She hasn't been the same for
weeks.
JENNIFER
I think I know what's wrong with
her. In fact, I know I know what's
wrong with her.
CHIP
Then tell me.
JENNIFER
I feel bad telling you this.
(SIGHING)
Okay, you know Needy's been a
total Lithium candidate since the
night Colin Gray died. But that's
not just because he was brutally
murdered and stuff. It's
because....I don't wanna say this.
CHIP
Say it!
JENNIFER
Needy and Colin were intimate. By
that I mean he was poking her
donut on a semi-regular basis.
CHIP looks astonished and hurt.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)
I know this must be hard for you
to hear.
CHIP
Needy's not like that.
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED: (2)
JENNIFER
That's what she wants you to
believe. But trust me, her and
Colin were doing stuff you haven't
even heard of. Total varsity
moves.
CHIP
But you were with Colin the night
he was killed.
JENNIFER
Well, apparently he had a thing
for me-- no surprise there. And I
figured Needy was busy jumping
your jock that night, so I agreed
to a little pity date. Colin
brought me to that empty house so
we could have some privacy. But he
wanted to go too far, so I left
after a few minutes. Next thing I
knew, they'd found...
She sniffles, wiping her eye.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)
...what was left of him.
CHIP
(to himself)
Eye-talian.
JENNIFER
Huh?
CHIP
Never mind.
JENNIFER
I'm sorry you had to hear this
from me. I'm just so worried about
Needy. She's losing her shit.
Colin was her everything.
CHIP looks miserable.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)
I wouldn't be surprised if she
winds up in the nuthouse.
CHIP
I just can't believe this.
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED: (3)
JENNIFER
Well, you've been talking to her
more than I have. How bad is it?
CHIP
It's bad, man. It's bad.
JENNIFER
I can only imagine the paranoid
theories she's come up with.
CHIP
Oh, you have no idea.
JENNIFER
I just can't believe she would do
this to you. I care so much about
you, Chip.
CHIP glances up at her. She's earnest, beautiful.
JENNIFER (CONT'D)
More than I've ever had the guts
to admit.
CHIP is hypnotized in the glow of the streetlights.
Jennifer leans forward and kisses him on the neck
JENNIFER
Needy didn't deserve a boy like
you.
Needy is running toward the park in her gown. She takes
off her shoes and tosses them aside, her arms and legs
pumping furiously.
NEEDY V.O.
One thing people don't know about
me is that I'm fast. I just never
went out for track because I look
bad in shorts. Also, Jennifer told
me track was for lezzies. But I
am. Fast, I mean. Even in that
fucking afterbirth of a dress, I
could really tear up the asphalt.
She picks up the pace, cheeks puffing.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
I had to. I was running for his
life.
Needy jogs toward CHIP's house. Exhausted and sweaty, she
presses the doorbell. She falls to her knees on the front
stoop, panting and wheezing.
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:
Camille answers the door.
NEEDY
(STRAINED)
Well, hi there Camille! Is Chipper
home?
Camille has no reply. She eyes Needy suspiciously and
licks a Popsicle.
CHIP's mother appears and shoves Camille aside.
CHIP'S MOM
Needy? Is something wrong?
NEEDY
Where's Chip?
CHIP'S MOM
(CONFUSED)
He left for the dance at least
twenty minutes ago. He certainly
should have been there by now.
NEEDY
He walked? Mrs. Dove, you mean to
only tell me that in these
dangerous, godless times-- you let
your only son walk alone at night?
CHIP'S MOM
Well, it's only five blocks. My
God, your hair is...
NEEDY
Which way did he go?
CHIP'S MOM
He usually cuts across the park.
She turns to scold Camille.
CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D)
Camille, let's sit like a lady! No
one wants to see your kiki.
She turns back to address Needy.
CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D)
Why don't you try...
But Needy's gone.

Anita?
Murphy Pool is even eerier from the inside. The fenced-in
deck area is littered with garbage, abandoned pool
furniture and graffiti. Someone has spray painted the
word "HOPELESS" on a wall.
CHIP shivers and looks around nervously.
Jennifer nonchalantly unzips her dress and shimmies out
of it, revealing her bra and panties.
CHIP
Aren't you cold?
JENNIFER
Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma.
She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to
climb down the ladder on the side. The pool is full of
filthy, freezing water.
CHIP
What are you doing?
JENNIFER
Swimming.
CHIP
Ha ha.
JENNIFER
Come on in, Chip. Show me your
breast stroke.
CHIP
The water looks disgusting.
JENNIFER
It's not so bad.
CHIP
Are you kidding? It's totally
bubonic in there. I think I see a
dead possum with a Doritos bag in
its pouch. And that looks like a
used syringe over there...
He slaps away a FLY.
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
JENNIFER
I'm sorry. I was just trying to
make you laugh. I think now, more
than ever, we need laughter. We've
both lost a close friend.
CHIP nods sadly.
CHIP
I know.
JENNIFER
I feel so empty.
CHIP
Me too.
JENNIFER
Please come here and kiss me
again. Make all this madness go
away.
Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees.
He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to
the ladder.
The sound of buzzing flies grows louder.
Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes. She hooks her arm
around Chip's neck and lunges backward. They tumble off
the ladder, into the pool. Chip SCREAMS.
Illuminated by lamp light, Needy limps toward the gym
entrance. She's completely covered in demon-goo. Her face
is bloody, her hair is full of blood and guts, and her
BROKEN ARM looks gruesome.
In the background, yet another oblivious COUPLE are
making out.
Needy stops to stare at them, her gaze calm but obviously
insane. They break apart and stare back at her.
GIRL
What are you looking at, Clumpy?
NEEDY
(QUIETLY)
Just watching your old man try to
suck the ugly off your face.
GUY
What did you say?
Needy bends over, casually holds one nostril closed, and
does a "farmer blow." A bloody clot flies out of her
nose.
The guy takes a good look at Needy and blinks, startled.
GUY (CONT'D)
Are you supposed to be Goth or
something?
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
NEEDY
Did you know the original Goths
were a Germanic tribe that settled
in Rome? They didn't wear black.
They wore regular linen tunics. I
don't know why nobody else knows
that.
The couple have already resumed making out.
Needy rolls her eyes, turns away, and continues limping
into the gym.
Needy is crouched outside Jennifer's window, hiding in
the shrubbery. She looks almost feral, with wide eyes and
a hungry expression.
Through the window, we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity
and combing her hair, oblivious to the intruder in her
yard.
NEEDY V.O.
What nobody realized was that I
was doing a different kind of
homework. I was watching her every
night. Waiting.
We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her
hair with a appraising eye.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
Waiting for her to get weak and
dull. Waiting for her to burn
through the life-force she'd
stolen from Chip.
Needy creeps away from the window.
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
It took weeks, but I finally made
my move. Remember?
We're seeing a FLASHBACK of the night Needy slaughtered
Jennifer.
Needy plunging through the window. Jennifer thrashing.
The blood. The struggle. The levitation. The arrival of
the police.
NEEDY V.O.
Even in her last moments of life,
she somehow managed to be cooler
than me.
We see, for a moment, Jennifer's sly, challenging smile
as Needy raises the boxcutter to slash her. That
signature look of mastery and control.
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
NEEDY
She left an insanely hot corpse.
We see Jennifer's mother holding her again, screaming,
though all we hear is SILENCE and STATIC. Sure enough,
Jennifer's bleeding body seems to be artfully, sensually
draped in her mother's arms. She almost seems to be
SMIRKING at us.
Needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers.
She heads confidently toward the SECURITY FENCE and
passes through it after casually mangling the bars. Only
a Needy-shaped hole remains.
Needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road.
The hospital recedes in the background.
A few RACCOONS gather by the side of the road, watching
Needy as she walks past.
A PICKUP TRUCK whizzes by with its windows rolled down.
"Through the Trees" blasts from the radio.
Needy begins to sing, a lopsided grin on her face.
NEEDY
(SINGING)
"Through the trees, I will find
you. Heal the ruins left inside
you..."
Devil's Kettle citizens are gathered around Murphy Pool,
crying. It's a CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL for Chip. Their faces
are weary and sorrowful. Photos of Chip have been
arranged around the edge of the fence. We see a picture
of CHIP AND NEEDY on the end.
Someone has brought a CD player, and the mourners sing
along, their voices soaring.
VIGIL ATTENDEES
(SINGING)
"...And the stars will remind you,
we'll meet again..."
Needy holds her thumb aloft as she walks down the remote
country highway.
(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:
NEEDY
(SINGING)
"...We'll meet again."
A small creek emptying into a stream
runs parallel to the
road. Needy seems something glinting
at the mouth of the
creek and stoops to pick it up. It's
Nikolai's BOWIE
KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's
Kettle, never to be
seen again.
Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband.
A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks
her thumb out again.
The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver,
a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes
Needy lasciviously.
OLD MAN
Where you looking to go, young
lady?
NEEDY
East, toward Madison.
OLD MAN
East, huh? Guess I'm headed that
way. But I'm gonna need you to pay
me in ass, gas or grass. Got that?
No free rides in this wagon.
NEEDY
I don't have any money or drugs,
so you'll have to settle for ass.
OLD MAN
Fair enough. Hop in my chariot.
Needy gratefully hurries into the driver's seat.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)
So why you headed East?
NEEDY
I'm following this rock band.
OLD MAN
Huh. Must be a hell of a group.
NEEDY
Tonight's gonna be their last
show.

Needy smiles blithely and pops the clear Lifesaver into
her mouth.
The station wagon pulls off. As it sputters off into the
distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, SOFT
SHOULDER.
We hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the DJ's
bumper.
RADIO DJ
What a song. Thought we'd play
that one in honor of Soft
Shoulder. They're playing in
Madison tonight. Should be a night
to remember...
The DJ's voice fades out as the car vanishes into the
horizon.
