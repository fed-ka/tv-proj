          BRUCE enters first.  Oddly, he takes a quick glance around
          the place.  JOHNNY enters behind him. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just how I like to spend my Sunday. 
                        Driving up and down the coast,
                          haggling over antiques.

                                        BRUCE
                        I told you, they aren't for me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, yeah.  Your dear old aunt. 
                        Here's a notion -- next time take
                        her.  I'll stay here and watch
                        some paint dry, stick some bamboo
                        under my fingernails--

          Johnny notices a knocked-over knick-knack on a table and
          rights it -- WHOOOOSH! 


  22VISION 

          RICK WICKLIN, 30, a wannabe rock star with piercings,
          tattoos, dreadlocks and a scruffy beard, stands at the
          nearby window, looking out.  Intensely.

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        It's 'bout time.

          He calls to unseen people behind him:

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        The psychic has landed! 

          Rick rushes off -- but knocks over the knick-knack and...


  33BACK ON JOHNNY

          As he finishes righting it.  Bruce is about to step further
          into the house -- but Johnny stops him.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's not right.

          Johnny MOVES past Bruce....

                                        BRUCE
                        Hang on, man--

          Johnny enters the main area of the house, and...


  44REVERSE ON A PARTY  --  A DOZEN OR SO PEOPLE

          With SARAH standing in front.  Everyone yells  "SURPRISE!"

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not my birthday.

                                        SARAH
                        That's the surprise.

          She motions to a banner going up -- "SCIENCE CLUB REUNION"
          and "CLEAVES MILLS HIGH."  The crowd is twentysomethings
          from science-related careers.  Doctors in short sleeve
          dress shirts and ties, corduroy-wearing geologists,
          computer game designers, engineers in shorts and sandals.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Sarah)
                        Your idea?

                                        SARAH
                        Group effort.  Something about
                        winning the State Science Decathlon
                        ten years ago.

          Johnny is approached by the piercing-laden Rick Wicklin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Richard Wicklin? 

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        Wicked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me?

                        Ricky Wicked.  That's my stage
                        name, Mr. Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're an actor?

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        Rock 'n' roll band.  We call
                          ourselves 'Isosceles Squared'.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought you got your Ph.D in
                        laser optics.

                                        RICK WICKLIN
                        It's a fall-back position, in
                        case the music thing doesn't fly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good thinking.

                                        STUDENT #1
                        Speech!

          The OTHERS AD-LIB for Johnny to say a few words. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to group)
                        Uh, well, I have to say this is
                        completely unexpected.  I've
                        thought a lot about you guys over
                        the years.  Glad to see you're
                        all doing so well. 
                                (points)
                          Henderson's face finally cleared
                        up.

            Henderson raises his hand, empty cups playfully tossed at
          him, ad-lib CHATTER and LAUGHTER.  In that instant, it's 
          a classroom in here.  A fleeting moment for Johnny.  A
          memory of another life.  Sarah notices Johnny's reaction.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quieting them down)
                        Seriously, guys.  This means more
                        than you'll ever --

                                        ALEX (O.S.)
                        If you ask me this is a complete
                        waste of time!

          All eyes shift to...  ALEX CONNERS, 28, a top-flight
          researcher (with a top-flight ego) who hasn't forgotten
          his inner geek.

                                        ALEX
                        Haven't you geeks heard?  Mr. Smith
                        isn't about science anymore.  We
                        lost him to the mystical world of
                          soothsaying and prestidigitation. 
                        I'll prove just how far he's strayed
                        by using the...
                                (makes finger quotes)
                          'Scientific method.'  You remember
                        that one, don't you, Teach?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Vaguely. 

          Alex builds anticipation by reaching into a jacket pocket.

                                        ALEX
                                (milks it)
                        Ladies and germs, I, Dr. Alex
                          Conners, have in my possession an
                        object, borrowed from Mr. Smith's
                        desk some short ten years ago. 
                        If you believe the tabloids and
                        the gossip rags, the Wizard of
                        Cleaves Mills should be able tell
                        us what I have and why I took it.

          Johnny considers the challenge.

                                        ALEX
                        Just one touch, right?
                                (off Johnny's pause)
                        You aren't gonna punk out on me,
                        are ya?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't even have to touch you.

          An "Ooooooo" from the crowd... The gauntlet is down. 
          Johnny playfully touches his temple...

                                        ALEX
                        So what's the frequency, Kenneth?

                                        JOHNNY
                            Nineteen-thirty-eight Indian head
                        nickel.  It was a good luck charm
                        my father left to me.

          The look on Alex's face tells everyone that Johnny nailed
          it.  Alex lifts it out of his pocket and holds it high
          above his head.  APPLAUSE.

                                        ALEX
                          I surrender, oh mystic one!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Still disrupting class.

                        Sorry, Mr. Smith, but you drilled
                        it into us on that senior trip to
                        the science museum -- question
                        the status quo.  Push the edge of
                        reason and -- what was it?
                                (everyone joins)
                        "Be the vanguard!"

          Alex and Johnny hesitate, then grab each other in a
            heartfelt hug, but when they come out of it--


  55WHOOSH! (RESEARCH LAB - VISION)

          Alex BEGINS to burn alive.  His skin BLISTERS and CRACKLES! 

          He is consumed by SUPER-HOT BLUE FIRE.  Vision Johnny
          pulls back and they're suddenly standing... 



          Surprise party in full swing.  Alex finishes his beer. 
          Johnny is across from him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you up to these days? 
                        Besides busting on your old
                          teachers.

          Alex puts down the cup.  Johnny casually "moves" it --
          but he's really fishing for another vision.

                                        ALEX
                          Plastics.

                          Plastics?

                          Polymers.  I'm a research chemist
                        at Portland Chemical.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's a good place to be.

                                        ALEX
                        Got my own lab.  Assistant.  Whole

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's great, Alex.  I'm happy
                        for you.

  99BRUCE AND SARAH - OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTY

          Bruce watches Alex.  Sarah munches on something.

                                        SARAH
                        Alex Conners.  One of Johnny's
                          greatest achievements.

                        I'm afraid to ask.

                                        SARAH
                        Alex came from a working class
                        family.  Johnny took him under
                        his wing, helped him get a
                          scholarship to M.I.T.

                        Spent more time with that kid
                        than he did with me.

                                        BRUCE
                        So our boy was into rescuing before
                        he got knocked on the head.

                                        SARAH
                        Alex was a prodigy.  Johnny was
                        the first one to recognize his
                        talent. 

                                        BRUCE
                                (eyes Alex)
                        Seems like a nice guy. 

          Sarah notices Bruce's uneasy look.

                                        SARAH
                        What is it?

                                        BRUCE
                          Nothing.


  1010BUT WE SEE WHAT BRUCE IS CONCERNED ABOUT: 

          As Alex is leaving, he leaves behind a paper plate.  Johnny
            nonchalantly touches it, fishing for another vision. 
          Bruce knows the drill nearly as well as Johnny.

          Alex puts on a leather jacket and gathers his motorcycle
          helmet.


          BACK WITH JOHNNY AND ALEX

                                        JOHNNY

                        chance I might get a tour?

                                        ALEX
                        I'll talk to the boss.  She's
                        kind of a hard-ass, but hey, if
                        it wasn't for you I wouldn't even
                        be there.  Oh, almost forgot.

          Alex pulls Johnny's good-luck INDIAN HEAD NICKEL from his
          coat pocket and returns it.

                                        ALEX
                        All these years, you knew I had
                        it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where else would it be?

                                        ALEX
                                (hands it back)
                        I took it the day before the
                        Science Decathlon.  For luck. 
                        Didn't know it was your Dad's,
                        man.  Sorry.  Real dickweed thing
                        to do. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        No problem.  You are a dickweed.

          Traded smiles, then Alex heads out, Johnny watches,
            concerned... he turns as his eyes land on Bruce.  Johnny
          knows he knows something is up.



          Johnny's collection of clippings, photos and facts about
          Greg Stillson, Armageddon, etc.  Johnny studies it closely,
          connecting the dots in his mind.  Bruce looks on. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure that's what you saw?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was Armageddon, Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        But you said it was different.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  Alex was there.

                                        BRUCE
                        Alex?  The only time you ever see
                        Armageddon is when you touch
                          Stillson.

          Johnny is standing in front of an image of Stillson.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's why this doesn't add up.

          The PHONE BEGINS TO RING, but Johnny doesn't move from
          the board.

                          connected to a defense contractor
                        that's going to work on a bomb.

                        Or maybe somebody on the inside
                        is dirty.

          RING.  Bruce glances at the phone, wondering if Johnny's
          going to pick it up.  He just stares at the board.

                                        BRUCE
                        I mean, how else could your former
                        student be involved with the end
                        of the world?

          RING.  Another glance.

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you gonna grab that?

          Johnny looks back, snapping out of his focus on the board.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

          The MACHINE PICKS UP and we HEAR Alex Conners' voice...

                                        ALEX'S VOICE
                        Hey, Mister Smith, it's Alex. 
                        Good news.  Got the thumbs up on
                        you spending the day in my lab. 
                        You should pop by in the morning. 
                        It'll be like old times. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Old times -- or End Times?

            Actually, it's digitized -- part of a game being played

          REVEAL TREY WALTERS, 21, prodigy, aspiring scientist but
          he dresses like a skateboarder.  Doesn't look a day over
          17.  Trey isn't angry at the world, just annoyed with it.

                        I've had warmer welcomes.

          Trey TURNS...

            REVEALING Johnny, a Portland Chemical "VISITOR" BADGE
          pinned on his jacket.  We realize we're in...



          The place is advanced, but not sleek or science-fictiony. 
          It's real-world, industrial, workmanlike.  Beakers,
          burners, spin plates and mass spectrometers.  There are
          also pressurized tanks of fuel and other materials.  In
          one corner, a glass-enclosed TESTING ROOM.

          Trey goes back to playing his game. 

                                        TREY
                        You must be the legendary teacher-
                            turned-coma-patient-turned-
                            celebrated-but-slightly-notorious-

                                        JOHNNY
                          'Johnny' works.

          Trey glances up.  He likes this guy in spite of himself. 
          Alex slides a piece of paper across to Johnny.

                                        TREY
                        If you wanna hang, our boss says
                        you gotta sign this.  Non-
                          disclosure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You guys deal in top secret stuff?

                                        TREY
                        Worse.  Profit-making stuff.  The
                        suits guard it like pit bulls. 
                        Dr. Conners is upstairs right now
                        with Mrs. Peck.  

          Johnny finishes signing, steps toward the lab center. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Peck.  She the boss?

                                        TREY
                        Yeah, and I'm pretty sure she's
                        got acid for blood. 

          Johnny checks out some of the work stations, poking around
          like a true science geek.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is a private company, right?

                          Chemicals their only business?

                                        TREY
                        Dude, the check gets direct-
                          deposited every week.  Beyond
                        that, I'm clueless. 

          Johnny arrives at a table with POLYMER SAMPLES on it. 
          Advanced plastics.  Some are cubes, others are flat and
          can be stretched.  Various colors.  Johnny touches a few --
          the way Johnny touches things.  And then, on a dark black
          polymer, he feels a WHOOSH.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This one's gonna end up in snow
                        tires.

          Trey looks up, then is quickly on his feet...

                                        TREY
                        Whoa!  Careful with that one.

          Johnny examines a SAMPLE POLYMER that resembles a thin
          silver-gray SHEATH, stretched across a metal device like
          a drum head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This looks interesting.

          To Trey's shock, Johnny sticks his hand into it.

                                        TREY
                        Hey!

          It immediately GLOMS to the shape of his hand.  He can
          move his fingers freely.

                                        TREY
                        You are gonna get me so fired.

          Johnny is about to remove his hand, when.

                                        ALEX (O.S.)
                        Don't move!

          Enter Alex, moving down the steps behind them.

                        Let it process the data.  You can

          Alex motions to a nearby LCD screen.

                        It's not perfected yet, but it's
                        close. 

          Alex motions to the polymer.  It has not sprung back.

                                        ALEX
                        It's adaptive, but the micro-
                          structure doesn't allow for
                          reactive formation of the macro-

                        By feeding his children, God

                        Headed that way myself, Gene. 
                          Wouldn't want to leave you behind.

                        May not be enough.

                        sky, Reverend.  Into the Heavens,
                        if necessary.

            A moment.  Purdy considers his options.

                                        PURDY
                          I can't.

          Stillson is taken aback.  But he just stares him down.

                                        PURDY
                        I have an obligation to my
                          ministry.

          Stillson wants to rip Purdy's head off, but stays
          remarkably calm.

                                        STILLSON
                        I see.

                                        PURDY
                        I will gladly fund you at current
                        levels -- and sing your praises
                        over the airwaves -- but I cannot
                        divert one more penny from
                        foundation coffers.

            A moment.  Then...

                                        STILLSON
                        Fair enough.
                                (shakes his hand)
                        God bless you, Gene.  And God
                        Bless all those who depend on you
                        for insight and guidance. 

          Purdy holds Stillson's icy stare, as...



          Alex and Johnny work on a clear DRY ERASE BOARD covered
          in formulas -- intricate "chains" of chemical bonds used
          to map and create polymers.  They jot as they talk, already
          mid-way through an impromptu work session.

                                        ALEX
                        I'll never get the polymer to
                        reshape without the right series
                        of bonds.

                        Very good.  So what am I missing?

          Alex laughs.  Science is hard.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't we cook up a new batch,
                        see what happens.  Like the old
                        days. 

                                        ALEX
                        Sounds good.
                                (to Trey)
                        Let's do this!

          Alex hits a BOOM BOX with his favorite MUSIC.  As they
          move off, Johnny can't truly enjoy this reunion knowing
          what he knows.


  1616MONTAGE - RESEARCH LAB CLEAN ROOM - DOING THE SCIENCE

          Alex's MUSIC CONTINUES under some of this.  This is the
          "clean room," where the precision stuff gets done.  There
          is also one computer and monitor in here.  Alex and Johnny
          are now in goggles, gloves masks and protective clothing
          (But again, nothing far-fetched).

          They mix SUPERHEATED liquids (monomers) in various beakers. 
          The liquids are extracted from PRESSURIZED TANKS in the
          testing room.  Each has a different chemical symbol and
          various industrial WARNING STICKERS.  Toxic, flammable.

          We get a sense of Alex and Johnny working well together. 
            Clicking.  They pour SUPERHEATED liquid plastic into an
          advanced metal FILTER DEVICE.

                                        ALEX
                        The idea is to capture what forms
                        underneath --

                                        JOHNNY
                        The precipitate.

                                        ALEX
                        You're getting the hang of this.

          Alex collects it, then spreads it over the wafer-thin
          palette.  It begins to cool.  As they work, Johnny catches
          an image "floating" on the computer -- Alex's screensaver.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT ONE - 4/20/05 - GOLD      16.

          It is a PHOTO OF ALEX and his FATHER.  On a boat against
          the water.  Holding up LOBSTERS.  (NOTE: If we have the
          extra playing the Mom, we should snap several combinations
          of the family, just to get some randomizing on the screen.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        How's the family?

                        Pop refuses to dock the boat. 
                        That man is gonna be lobsterin'
                        'til he croaks.  Mom is... mom.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They gotta be proud of you.

                                        ALEX
                          I guess. 

          Johnny's fishing now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I mean, Portland Chemical's right*

          The new POLYMER is stretched and wired to the LCD screen.

          Alex puts his hand through it.  The LCD screen lights up.

                                        ALEX
                        Faster readout than before.  We
                        managed to improve the density --

          SNAP!  Alex's hand goes right through the POLYMER.

          He kicks a stool out of the way.

                        It's just a little set-back.

                        I gotta... chill for a sec.

          After Alex exits, Johnny touches the sample.


    1818WHOOOOSH! (RESEARCH LAB - VISION)

          Greg Stillson is standing in the room!  In a tuxedo.  He
          LAUGHS, as if someone just told him a joke.  Vision Johnny
            observes.

          And then Alex is there... (NOTE: Not aged, wearing what
          he'll have on in Act IV explosion.)

          And there are FLASHBULBS going off. 

          It's all very Fellini -- until Alex begins to SCREAM, his
          SKIN BURNING and CRACKLING like before.  BLUE FIRE begins
          to envelope him, rounded out when...

          The WASHINGTON MONUMENT suddenly appears outside the DOOR! 

          And the entire BUILDING BLOWS UP AROUND JOHNNY, caught in
            a tsunami of NUCLEAR CONFLAGRATION, a FIRE WAVE that just
          doesn't quit until all of OBLITERATED D.C. is exposed --


    1919JOHNNY'S BACK TO REALITY. (RESEARCH LAB)

          Trey eyes him as Johnny's clearly shaken by the vision.

          up, gathering his coat.

                        Alex.  I don't need psychic powers
                        to know you're letting this get
                        under your skin.

                          Remember that.

                        Mister Smith?

                        My money's on the original Dark
                        Prince. 

          Bruce shows Johnny something he's found in the paper: A
          PHOTO of Greg Stillson waving through a group of reporters. 
          Off Johnny as he studies the photo...



          Start on a brand new POLYMER, GUNMETAL GRAY, sleek. 
            Stretched over a device.  Alex is at work -- and he clearly
          hasn't slept all night.  He's telling Johnny all about
          it, as Johnny sets down a box of donuts:

                                        ALEX
                        I kept running it through my mind,
                        then at about three this morning,
                        it hit me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You pulled an all-nighter?

                                        ALEX
                        Yeah, and this is what I got to
                        show for it.

          Alex touches it.  It BENDS, but it doesn't quite give. 
          Not very pliable.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't seem right.

                                        ALEX
                        I need to soften it.
                                (hates this part)
                        In about two hours, it'll turn to
                        this.

          He shows a BRITTLE SAMPLE of the polymer.

                                        ALEX
                        It's cool, though -- the micro-
                          structure has significant molecular
                          extension and alignment.

          Trey sees that Johnny is lost.

                                        TREY
                        It's really strong.  I mean, we
                        hit it with everything.  Extreme
                        heat, high-tensile stress tests. 
                        Even that.

          He gestures towards a PRESSURIZED TANK.  A NUCLEAR SYMBOL. 
          Johnny reacts.

                                        ALEX
                                (stretches sample)
                        It's a neutron absorber.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (not good news)
                        It's radiation-proof.

                                        ALEX
                        You have any idea what this means?

          Johnny touches the POLYMER --


    2323WHOOOSH!  (RESEARCH LAB - VISION)

            Suddenly, there's an AIR FORCE GENERAL standing next to
          Johnny -- and Alex is there, too (in Act IV wardrobe).

          The Air Force General looks off camera, not directly
          interacting with Alex.

                        in the defense of our nation. 
                        And we've got Portland Chemical's
                        amazing work to thank for it.

          During this, FLASHBULBS GO OFF again, recalling the
          previous VISION.


  2424BACK ON JOHNNY (RESEARCH LAB)

          His worst nightmare appears to be coming true.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds important.

                                        ALEX
                        Important?  How about earth
                          shattering! 

          [NOTE: Possible Act I break here, OFF Johnny's reaction
          to the above line.  Come back as Alex continues:]

                                        ALEX
                        You could shield organs around
                        cancer cells -- people won't get
                        their healthy tissue fried during
                          radiation treatment.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's incredible, Alex.

                                        JUDITH PECK (O.S.)
                        And a major find for Portland
                          Chemical...

          Enter JUDITH PECK, 45, a corporate taskmaster whose drive
          is only surpassed by her ego.

                                        TREY
                        Goes real nice with profit
                          participation, right?

          She regards Trey as a bug, barely looking at him.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        Get me some coffee.

          Trey shoots Johnny a shrug and scampers away.

                          Bendable plastic with the shielding

                        home run, Alex.  Congratulations.

                                (re: Johnny)
                        Don't thank me.  John suggested
                        some things that helped break it
                        wide open.
                                (introducing)
                        Johnny Smith, Judith Peck.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        I've heard about you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All good, I hope.

          Johnny shakes her hand--



          Mrs. Peck shakes hands with GREG STILLSON.  Vision Johnny
            observes.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                          Portland Chemical could not have
                          expanded if you hadn't squeezed
                        those subsidies out of House
                          Appropriations. 

                                        STILLSON
                        If the Governator can bring stem
                        cell research to California, I
                        sure as hell can open a spigot
                        for my people.

          She likes him.  Maybe she's taken by him.  Maybe she wants
          to ride him like a wild monkey.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                          Congressman, I'm not naive.  I
                        know why you're sending funding
                        my way.  You want my hard cash to
                        become your soft money.

                                        STILLSON
                                (plays innocent)
                        Did I say that? 

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        I just want you to know -- our
                        agendas are not mutually exclusive.

                                        STILLSON
                        Never thought they were, Ms. Peck. 
                        Not for one second.

          He's workin' it.  As Stillson leaves, we settle on Mrs.
          Peck (and Vision Johnny).  Yeah, she's taken by him
          alright.


  2626BACK TO SCENE (RESEARCH LAB)

          Johnny flashes out of the handshake.  Peck sets her hand

          REVERSE to reveal Bruce with Johnny, who searches stuffed
          FILE BOXES for something.

                        You said Alex's work could save
                        lives.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Until the military gets a hold of
                        it, makes it part of a W.M.D. 
                          Probably a next-generation nuke.
                                (then)
                        I can't let him perfect the
                          process.

                        Johnny.  Nothing's happened yet. 
                        What if Alex does save some lives.

                        I gotta believe stopping him will
                        save more.

                                        BRUCE
                        Listen to yourself.  You're talking
                        about sabotaging his work.

          As Johnny studies the images on his board.

                        It's the Apocalypse.  The Four
                          Horseman are on their way.

          Johnny finds a thin HARDBOUND BOOK in one of the boxes. 
          He flips through it.

                        Why don't you just lay it down
                        for him.  Like you did with me. 
                        Tell him everything.

                          Alright, so what're you gonna do?

          Johnny finds the page he's looking for.

                        Alex trusts his teacher.

                        So you get close and you switch
                          something in the formula.  He'll
                        think it's a design flaw and
                        they'll eventually bury the
                          project.

          That's it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I wish there was another way to
                        do this.

                        You're not the only one.

          Johnny TEARS OUT THE PAGE from the unseen book.  He TACKS
          it to the Armageddon wall, circles something then exits. 
          Bruce looks at what Johnny just added to the wall:


          A PAGE FROM THE CLEAVES MILLS HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK

          A PHOTO of the SCIENCE CLUB.  In the back: Johnny, the
          teacher.  There's a rambunctious kid off to the side,
          behind a lit bunsen burner: Alex, his face circled in red
          ink.



          Johnny contemplates the DRY ERASE BOARD, as if to steel
          himself for what he has to do. 

                                        TREY (O.S.)
                        Hey.  You mind?

          Trey, behind him, is working the keyboard on a desktop.

                                        TREY
                        Gotta make sure we get this right.

          He hits some keys and there's a FLASH of light, like a
          photo flash, from the dry erase board.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT TWO - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   26.

          Johnny looks at TREY'S SCREEN.  A perfect image of the
          board has been preserved on the computer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's where all the formulas get
                        stored?

          Boom box.  More tunes.  Johnny hates himself for what
          he's about to do.

          NEW SAMPLE

          Johnny and Alex wear protective gear as before.  A new
          sample is mixed.  Alex comes by, checks some digital
            readouts.  Adjusts settings. 

          After he passes, Johnny changes the setting. 

          Johnny is already hating himself.

          Purdy, in the midst of a televised sermon.  MOVE ACROSS...

          As Purdy talks, we hear TRANSLATED DUBS of his sermon
          being broadcast in SPANISH, PORTUGUESE and RUSSIAN.

                        Can we say that we are making the
                        world a better place, each and
                        every day?  Jesus said to his
                          disciples that the greatest
                          commandment was to love your God. 
                        But equally important was a new
                          commandment: thou shalt love thy
                          neighbor as thyself.  Matthew
                        writes that on these two
                          commandments hang the law and the
                          prophets.

          Purdy walks, an ASSISTANT (Male, mid-20s, clean-cut) talks.

                        There could be something wrong
                        with the uplinks. 

          Purdy looks down the hall.  Through his partially opened
          door, Purdy sees...  MALCOLM JANUS fiddling with a
            paperweight.

                                        PURDY

                        down.  I have a feeling the problem
                        will fix itself.

          Off the confused assistant...


  3232PURDY'S OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

          The knick-knack Janus holds is a FAITH HERITAGE paper
          weight, an acrylic ball with a GLOBE in the center.  "Faith
          Heritage - THE WORD, THE WORLD," it says.

                        Mister Janus.  Good afternoon.

                        posing and preening.  Over-sized
                        women holding leashes.

          Purdy is at a complete loss.

                                        PURDY
                        I'm not sure...

                                        JANUS
                        Myself, I'm addicted to it. 
                        Trouble is, I have a tree branch
                          blocking the dish on the roof of
                        my house.  Just like that I'm
                        left sitting in the dark.  All
                        alone.

          Purdy now understands the subject of their conversation.

                                        PURDY
                        I did not reject Greg Stillson's
                          request.  I simply refused --

                                        JANUS
                        Thing about those satellite
                        companies.  Once you buy the
                        equipment, they make you sign
                        your life away.  Do I make myself
                          understood? 

          Janus spins the paperweight on the desk and looks up at
          Purdy:

                                        PURDY
                        Tell the Congressman to consider
                        me a loyal subscriber. 

                                        JANUS
                          I already have.

          Janus walks out as Purdy watches him go, then hastily
          catches the heavy paper weight just as it spins off the
          edge of the desk.  He considers it as the world rests in
          the palms of his hands.



          Stillson shakes hands with Judith Peck, as we watch the
          end of the VISION seen in Act I, now happening for real:

                        I just want you to know -- our
                        agendas are not mutually exclusive.

                                        STILLSON
                        Never thought they were, Ms. Peck. 
                        Not for one second. 


          Alex, with goggles and gloved hands, tests a new sample
          of the SILVER POLYMER.  Johnny is next to him.  It gives. 
          It stretches.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How's it look?

                        Good.  Very...

          But then, SNAP!  It's toast.  And Alex is pissed.

          Johnny knows it's his doing, but has to play against it.

                                        ALEX
                        I don't understand.  I went over
                        the numbers three times...

          And as Johnny despises himself even more, we HEAR the
          SOUNDS of CHAOS and EXPLOSIONS, putting us KNEE-DEEP in...



          ...an X-Box game, MechAssault 2, a first-person shooter. *
          REVEAL Johnny and J.J. thrashin' each other.  Sarah's in
          the b.g. watching.  Johnny isn't that focused, so J.J.
          takes him out.

                                        J.J.

                        I need a breather.  Wreak some
                        havoc on your own.

          Johnny heads into the kitchen, rubbing his eyes from a
          tension (and X-Box) headache.  He finds some TYLENOL GEL
          CAPS and pops them open.  Sarah gets him a glass of water.

                                        SARAH
                        He's right.  You were barely paying
                        attention.

          Johnny cops to nothing.  Sarah knows something's up.

                                        SARAH
                        That reunion was something else,

                          Sometimes I wish the biggest thing
                        in my life was planning a lousy
                        twelfth grade field trip.

          A NOISE, and a dust-covered Walt lumbers through the
          basement door, carrying ripped-out wood and 2x4's.

          As Walt moves out, he fires a look at Sarah, who shoots a
          smile back.  Johnny catches it.

                                        JOHNNY

          Johnny makes a "pregnant belly" motion with his hand.

                        No.  Not yet anyway.

          The idea at first crushes Johnny, then he shakes off those
          old feelings and gives her a smile.

                                        JOHNNY

                        child.  And besides, Walt and I

                        own.

                        It's alright.  I understand.

          The awkwardness continues.  Johnny cuts it with:

                                        JOHNNY
                                (joking)

                        want -- tell you if it's a boy or
                        a girl.

          Johnny playfully reaches for her, but her reaction catches
          him by surprise:

                                        SARAH
                        No!

          She jumps back, surprising even herself.

                                        SARAH
                        I just don't want to find out
                        that way.

          Johnny feels like a total freak -- instead of handing her
          back the cup of water, he knows to just set it down.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I should get going.  Tell J.J. I
                        had to run. 

          Johnny heads to the door and looks back...

          He leaves.  Sarah ponders the moment, as...



          SNAP!  Another POLYMER SAMPLE fails in Alex's hands. 
          Johnny looks on.  We can tell he's just completed more
          sabotage -- and no, he's still not proud of it.

          Alex trades another look with Trey.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's the problem?

                                        ALEX
                        We've run five samples today. 
                        And every one -- every single one --
                        tanked because something was off
                        on your end. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        My end?

                                        ALEX
                        What is it?  Are you jealous? 
                        Can't stand to see one of your
                          students pass you by?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know that isn't true.

                                        ALEX
                                (to Trey)
                        Those who can't do, teach.  Those
                        who can't teach -- sabotage.

          Alex, frustrated, tosses a busted piece of the FAILED
          POLYMER at him.  Johnny catches it, and--


  3939MATCH, MOVE, MORPH AROUND THEM (CHEMICAL LAB #348-VISION)

          And Alex, holding his own piece of the POLYMER, approaches
          the dry-erase board with Trey.  Vision Johnny observes.

                                        ALEX
                        That's it.  The H-three bonds on
                        the last cycle are off.

          Vision Johnny reacts.  Alex has his Eureka moment.

                                        TREY
                        Dude.  You are officially on the
                        map.

          They share a high-five.  Alex goes to the board and circles
          something.  When he circles it, he presses too hard and
          the BOARD slips, knocking some plastic beakers over. 
          Alex laughs at himself, rights the board.

                                        JUDITH PECK (O.S.)
                        The joyous sounds of progress, I
                        hope.

          Alex spins around.  Enter Judith Peck.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        Dr. Conners, I have someone I
                        want you to meet.

          Enter Stillson.  The politician's smile on full.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                          Congressman Greg Stillson.  Alex
                          Conners.

                                        ALEX
                        Wow. 
                              (a joke)
                        Shoulda worn a clean shirt.

          Stillson laughs, shakes his hand.

                                        STILLSON
                        And an honor -- for me.  I
                        understand you're a true Maine
                        success story.

                                        ALEX
                        Guess I am today, although it's
                        been a pretty rough week.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                          Congressman Stillson was concerned
                        when I told him Johnny Smith has
                        been monitoring your work.

                                        ALEX
                        Really?  You know Mister Smith?

                                        STILLSON
                        We've crossed paths.  He's not
                        around now, is he?

                                (darkens)
                        No.  We're finished.

          Stillson likes the sound of that.

                                        STILLSON
                        Good decision. 


  4040BACK ON JOHNNY (RESEARCH LAB)

          He flashes out of the vision...

                                        ALEX
                        What's the matter?  Seeing things? 
                        Maybe you can tell security about
                        it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your work's gonna be used in other
                        ways, Alex.  Ways you won't be so
                        proud of.

                                        ALEX
                        I don't believe you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then believe this. 
                                (re: dry board)
                        You're gonna knock those beakers
                        over -- right after you have the
                          breakthrough.

          Two Portland Chemical SECURITY GUARDS arrive and "escort"
          Johnny out.  But he gets one more thing in:

                                        JOHNNY
                        And after that -- that's when
                        you're gonna meet him, Alex. 
                        You'll know him when you meet
                        him!  The man we have to stop! 
                        The man at the top!

          They take him away, and for a moment, it's easy to
          understand why some people see Johnny Smith as a madman.

                        I hope he gets some help, that's
                        all.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT TWO          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT THREE - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   36.

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:



          Johnny and Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why didn't you just tell him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They were dragging me out.  Only
                        thing they forgot was the
                          straightjacket.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you should grow a beard and
                        get a cardboard sign that says
                        'The end is near.'

          Not funny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Look, if you saw Alex laughin' it
                        up with the Dark Prince, then
                        that's your answer.  The future
                        connection with Stillson is giving
                        you the Armageddon vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But Alex is in the vision too. 
                        He's the first one to die. 


  4242FLASH MEMORY (REUSE)

          The VISION.  Alex, consumed by BLUE FLAME, then the
          ARMAGEDDON WAVE takes them.


  4343BACK TO SCENE

          As we reveal Johnny is holding the INDIAN HEAD NICKEL --
          the one Alex returned to him earlier.  Johnny is lost in
          thought, circling an emotional black hole about the kid.

          Bruce, also at a loss, searches for a way to help.

                                        BRUCE
                        This is crazy, man.  You cannot
                        keep living like this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You think I want this?  You think
                        I like the fact that I can't shake
                        somebody's hand without seeing
                        crazy things?

                                        BRUCE
                        That's not what I mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (his blood is up)
                        What do you mean?

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe there's nothing we can do
                        to stop the end of the world. 
                        Maybe the prophets got it right,
                        you know?  It's just... supposed
                        to happen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not asking me to give up.

                                        BRUCE
                          I learned to stop doing that a
                        long time ago, John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good. 

          Johnny exits.  Bruce is increasingly concerned about him.



          Alex shares a high-five with Trey.  Just like Johnny's
          previous VISION.  Alex makes a circle on the board.  It
          CLANKS and knocks over the plastic beakers.

          Now, things are NOT QUITE like the previous VISION.  The
          realization is hitting Alex...

  4646BACK TO SCENE (CHEMICAL LAB #348)

          Alex takes in what just happened.  He tries to right the
          board, it makes another NOISE, then FALLS BACK.

                          Conners.

          Alex tries to get his mind what has just happened.  The
          ongoing realization that Johnny was right.  Unlike before:

                                        ALEX
                        Wow... this is a surprise.

          Stillson shakes his hand.

                        I guess so.

          But Stillson, somehow, is not convinced...



          Remember that AIR FORCE GENERAL?  He's still here, buried
          in the flashbulbs.  Alex is here, too.  WE PICK UP THE
          PREVIOUS VISION.  As before, the General looks offscreen.

                                (new from here)
                        Their advanced, next-generation
                          polymers have allowed us to contain
                        the core of a tactical nuclear
                        weapon.

          We arrive at a spherical WEAPON CORE -- constructed
          entirely of Alex's silver polymer.  The General holds it
          up for an O.S. audience. 

          VISION Johnny watches, nearby.

                                        AIR FORCE GENERAL
                        Don't worry, people -- it's not a
                        live one.

          FLASHBULBS (not on Johnny).  And laughter, coming from...
            a coterie of SENATOR TYPES and low-level AIR FORCE STAFFERS
          (with digital cameras).  Among them is Judith Peck.  This
          is not a press conference, but a private showing of next-
          gen technology.

                                        AIR FORCE GENERAL
                        Pick your delivery system, folks.

          The General places the weapon core inside a next-gen
            artillery shell.  He sets the artillery shell next to a
          handheld rocket launcher. 

                                        AIR FORCE GENERAL
                        Another reason for our enemies to
                        fear us.

          The General motions toward a door. 

                                        AIR FORCE GENERAL
                        Now, I'd like to introduce the
                        man who helped spearhead these
                        and other achievements in our
                          nation's security.  We had to
                        pull him out of a fancy banquet,
                        but he insisted on coming by. 
                        Ladies and gentlemen, the President
                        of the United States! 

          Enter President Greg Stillson -- directly crossing Johnny.  
          In a tux.  Just like the previous vision.  FLASHBULBS.

          Johnny can hardly believe what he's just seen.

                        Talk to me, John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw Stillson.  He was different.

                                        BRUCE
                        Different?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was the President of the United
                        States.

          START on Janus' distinctive ring, as he holds his cell
          phone.

                                        JANUS
                        Dr. Conners is in possession of
                          Portland Chemical's intellectual
                          property.  I want it returned.

          Janus hangs up the cell phone, and we REVEAL he's in the
          back seat with Stillson.

                                        STILLSON
                        Smith won't quit that easy.

                                        JANUS
                        Stay focused on the prize.  There's
                        someone I want you to meet.

                                        STILLSON
                        Another cash cow?

                                        JANUS
                        Just make sure you see Gene Purdy. 

                                        STILLSON
                        The Reverend's here?

                                        JANUS
                        He's going to introduce you.



          Johnny waits inside.  Stillson is caught by surprise.

                                        STILLSON
                        Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to work on your security.

                                        STILLSON
                        You're like a wad of chewing gum
                        I can't scrape off the bottom of
                        my shoe.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we're connected by destiny.

                                        STILLSON
                        Scary thought.  What do you want?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want Alex Conners left alone.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   49.

    61CONTINUED:61

                                        STILLSON
                        Do you now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I want your people to back off
                        and let him walk away.

                                        STILLSON
                        What's so important about Conners?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't matter, I just want
                        your word he'll be safe.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm a politician.  My 'word' is
                        gonna cost you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You want a check -- like Reverend
                        Purdy?  Portland Chemical?

                                        STILLSON
                        You may find this shocking, but
                        unless there's some campaign
                        finance reform bill I don't know
                        about, I'm not doing anything
                          illegal. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Of course not.  But you live in
                        the loop holes, don't you? 

                                        STILLSON
                        From what I understand, Conners'
                        work is going to save lives.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The research is flawed.  It's
                          useless.  I don't want a public
                        failure to ruin his career.

                                        STILLSON
                        And you are offering...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Myself.  Stay away from Alex
                          Conners, I'll stay away from you.

          Stillson considers this.

                                        STILLSON
                        You really think you should play
                        that card so early in the game?

          Johnny holds out his hand.  Stillson considers it again,
          then... Stillson shakes Johnny's hand.


  6262BRIEF VISION - A TASTE OF ARMAGEDDON

          We see FIRE in Johnny's EYES... then, we HOLD on STILLSON
          and only see the GLOW of fire and RAGING EXPLOSIONS,
          flashing instead BACK TO....


  6363JOHNNY

          As Stillson watches him have a VISION.  Stillson is taken
          aback by it.

                                        STILLSON
                        My God, you're a man possessed,
                        aren't you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do we have a deal?

          Stillson nods.  Johnny rushes out of there.  Stillson
          pulls his phone, hits a SPEED DIAL.

                                        STILLSON
                        Did you find him yet?  Good, take
                        him in.



          Alex and Judith Peck.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        I'm glad your back with us.

                                        ALEX
                        Never left, Mrs. Peck.  Honestly,
                        I don't know what all the fuss is
                        about.

                                        JUDITH PECK
                        Good to hear.

          Mrs. Peck exits.  

          And Vision Johnny watches her go.  As Vision Johnny turns
          back to Alex, he realizes his former student has made a
          decision...

          Alex bolts the door from the inside and heads straight
          for the REMOVABLE HARD DRIVE.  Tears it out.  He sets it
          in the center of The PRESSURIZED TANKS near the testing
          room.  He also wipes the DRY ERASE BOARD CLEAN and exits
          the lab.


  6969SERIES OF QUICK CUTS (RESEARCH LAB CLEAN ROOM AND
          ADJACENT CORRIDOR - VISION)

          Alex rigs a gas burner with a HOT BLUE FLAME to FIRE UP
          near a tubing beside the pressurized tanks.  The tubing,
          wrapped in metal, begins to heat up.   Vision Johnny
          watches.

                                        ALEX
                                (to himself)
                          Consider this my letter of
                          resignation.

          Alex makes a quick escape for the door.

          But as soon as he gets to the corridor -- there's Sidekick.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/19/05 - YELLOW   53.

    69CONTINUED:69

          Alex moves back to another corner.

          Vision Johnny looks back -- THE BURNER begins to burn
          through the TUBING.  

          Alex bolts around a corner -- and Dark-suited Man stops
          him.

                                          DARK-SUITED MAN
                        I'll take that hard-drive now.

                                        ALEX
                        This is private property.  You
                          shouldn't be in here.

                                          DARK-SUITED MAN
                        Call the Sheriff.

          Dark-suited Man shows him a gun and pushes Alex back into
          the lab -- right past Vision Johnny.  And into the ENCLOSED
          TESTING ROOM.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Alex, don't!

          Alex SLAMS the door on him, as the Dark-suited Man and
          Sidekick appear in the window at each door.  Alex, caught
          in a moment of rage and desperation, yells at them through
          the glass:

                                        ALEX
                        My work is not gonna be used to
                        kill people.  You got that,
                          assholes!  You hearin' me?!  I'd
                          rather...

          The BURNER eats through the tubing and it CATCHES FIRE,
          moving like a fuse to the tanks and --

          We don't see the explosion, just yet, all we see is--


          JOHNNY'S POV - ALEX

          His skin and face bubble.  BLUE FLAMES surround him and
          he is consumed by the fire.  FLASH BACK TO:



          The Dark-Suited Man has already driven Alex back into the
          Testing Room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex!  No!

          And there's a HUGE EXPLOSION.

          All the chemicals go up, creating a MASSIVE WALL of SUPER-
          HOT BLUE FIRE.

          And we understand, this was the death of Alex Johnny was
          seeing all along.

          Johnny is KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET, as the blast wave rocks
          the entire area.

          Johnny scrambles to his feet and hurries towards the lab. 
          He climbs through the shattered door and over some
          smoldering debris, until he locates Alex Conners' badly
          injured body.  Johnny lifts some debris off of him and
          cradles his bloody body in his arms.  Bruce appears in
          the shattered doorway.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We need an ambulance!  Now!

          Bruce rushes off.  Alex comes to...

                                        ALEX
                        Did they get it?  They get my
                        work?

                        They didn't get it, Alex. 

          Alex struggles to sit up, but realizes he can't.  Johnny
          realizes Alex is fading. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hang on...

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO:



          Johnny sits in front of the board, still dressed in his
          funeral suit.  He holds a piece of paper in his hand, but
          we can't see what it is.  Bruce is here too.

                                        BRUCE
                        T.V. says the explosion was an
                          accident.  No mention of Stillson.

          But Johnny is elsewhere.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was so sure Alex was connected
                        to Armageddon.  

                                        BRUCE
                        He was.  You saw Alex die in that
                        fire.  From the very beginning. 
                        But it was his future connection
                        to Stillson that made you see
                          Armageddon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I hadn't said anything, he'd
                        still be alive.

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't know that.  Maybe Alex
                        was destined to die the way he
                        did.  Only God knows what might
                        have happened if he hadn't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So what do I do now?

          Bruce puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder.

                                        BRUCE
                        You rest.  And you mourn your
                        friend.  There's still time to
                        figure it out. 
                                (re: Johnny's paper)
                        He's not going anywhere.

          Bruce squeezes Johnny's shoulder, exits.

          Johnny considers the paper in his hand, then RISES and
          pins it on the board.  As he walks away as the CAMERA
          REVEALS a photograph of Greg Stillson.  The SHOT PUSHES
          SLOWLY TIGHT on his face and...



          SOMEONE holds a REMOVABLE HARD DRIVE, as we PAN UP to
          REVEAL MISTER JANUS...

                                        JANUS
                        You copied all of Conners' files?*

          REVEAL lab assistant Trey Walters, in his funeral attire.*

                                        TREY
                        It's all there.

          But then Trey gulps.*

                                        TREY
                        Um, except... *
                                (forced smile)*
                        Dude.  I, uh, hadn't totally backed*
                        up the last day's work.*
                                (off Janus' look)*
                        But, hey, you guys can find some*
                        genius to figure it out, right? *

                                        JANUS*
                        Sounds doable.*

                                        TREY*
                        This won't affect my fee, will*
                        it?  *

          Janus considers Trey, then nods to Sidekick, who hands*
          the kid a fat envelope.

                                        TREY
                        Do I need to count it?

          Janus doesn't think so.  But Trey is pushing it:*

                                        TREY
                        This wouldn't be happening if
                        they'd treated me with a little
                          respect.

                                        JANUS
                        Respect is earned, Mr. Walters.

          Trey feels the chill.  He OPENS the door to leave, then...




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vanguard" - ACT FOUR - 4/20/05 - GOLD      58.

                                        TREY*
                        I don't ever want to see you people
                        again.

          He gets out and shuts the door, as the Limo drives away
          leaving the kid rich and alone.  It's chilling to consider
          what might happen next...

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
