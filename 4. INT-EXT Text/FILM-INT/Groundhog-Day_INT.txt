PHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall
gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall,
talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he
points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience.
CUT TO:
Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but
from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out
of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's
pointing to -- a national weather map.
CUT TO:
We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers
from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed
memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award
statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.
As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small
sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
blanket.
GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his
head in the door.
HAWLEY
Christ, what a pit. Phil"
The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley.
It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman.
PHIL
(SLEEPY)
What?
HAWLEY
It's February first, Phil. You
know what tomorrow is?
Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart,
rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but
clearly a guy with a lot of personality.
PHIL
(catching on)
Oh, no! Not again.
He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.
PHIL
Forget it! I'm not going.
Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9
Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local
news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as
WPGH - Pittsburgh.
Phil ducks into the studio.
-3-
Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather
corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather
stats up on a chart.
PHIL
Get away from me. I'm working.
HAWLEY
So what's the outlook? We gonna
get that blizzard?
Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
"Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next
to the title.
PHIL
No way. All that moisture coming
up from the Gulf is going to miss
us completely and take a dump on
Harrisburg.
HAWLEY
(with authority)
Good, 'cause you're going up to
Punxsutawney to cover the
groundhog story tomorrow morning
and I want you back here in time
to do the five.
PHIL
Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will
you! I covered the goddamn
groundhog last year and the year
before that.
HAWLEY
And you'll do it :next year and
the year after, too. When I
worked in San Diego, I covered
the swallows coming back to
Capistrano for ten years in a
row.
PHIL
You should've killed the guy who
made you do that.
HAWLEY
I wanted to do it.
PHIL
Then you should've killed
yourself. I don't want to get
stuck with the groundhog for the
rest of my life.
-4-
HAWLEY
It's a cute story. He comes out,
he looks around, he wrinkles up
his little nose, he sniffs around
a little, he sees his shadow, he
d oesn't see his shadow-- it's
nice. People like it.
PHIL
Many people are morons.
HAWLEY
Just do it.
PHIL
What'11 you give me?
Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a
very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.
HAWLEY
(to Phil)
I'll give you Rita.
(calls her over)
Rita, could you come here for a
second? I got a little job for
you.
Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,
personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,
a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this
point to realize it.
PHIL
(TEASING)
You can't send Rita out on a
story like this. She's just a
cub, a pup, still wet behind the
ears. Look at her. Her ears are
sopping wet. This needs a
Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a
big story. People need to know.
RITA
(INTRIGUED)
What's the story?
HAWLEY
The Punxsutawney Groundhog
Festival.
RITA
Gil, if it's all right with you
I ' d rather follow-up on the
nurses' strike.
-5-
HAWLEY
You can do the nurses when you
get back. Just take the squeaky
wheel here up to Punxsutawney and
get him back in one piece. Okay?
RITA
Yeah, okay.
Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She
knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still,
she finds him appealing in an odd way.
PHIL
(PLEASANTLY)
You know, this could be extremely
interesting.
RITA
I've never done a weather story
before. What's Punxsutawney
like?
PHIL
Oh, it's an enchanted place. A
magical world. It's the
Constantinople of the whole
Western Appalachian-Susquehanna
Drainage system.
RITA
Do you always joke?
PHIL
About 70 to 80% of the time.
Inside I'm actually a very shy
and sensitive person.
RITA
A lot of people around here think
you're not very sincere.
PHIL
Tell me the names of these
people.
RITA
I'll line up a crew and
transportation. If you don't
feel like driving, we can all go
up in the van together.
PHIL
I think I'll take my own car.
I ' m not that fond of my fellow
man.
-6-
RITA
(EXITING)
Nice attitude.
PHIL
Nice face.
(calls after her)
Why don't you ride up with me?
RITA
No, thanks.
STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired
correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio.
Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past
two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number
of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching
himself on the TV monitor.
PHIL
(on the phone)
They don't really think of me as
a weatherman around here. More
of a "personality," but with the
credibility of a first-class
broadcast journalist. Once you
look at my tape I think you'll
see what they mean.
Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for
a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about
this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little
scary.
STEPHANIE
(BITTERLY)
I just want to know one thing:
did I do something wrong or are
you just tired of me or what? I
have to know.
Phil sighs.
PHIL
(on the phone)
Dan, can I call you back? I've
just been handed something and I
better get on it...
(he picks up some
papers and rustles
them for effect)
...Okay, thanks.
-7-
He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for
privacy.
PHIL
(KINDLY)
You didn't do anything wrong,
Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of
you. It's just that I don't have
time for a real relationship
right now. I told you that the
first time we went out.
STEPHANIE
(getting close)
Everybody says that at the
beginning of a relationship.
PHIL
(gently pushing her
AWAY)
I'm different. I really meant
it! Things are really starting
to move for me now. I ' m not
going to be doing the weather for
the rest of my life. I was just
talking to the CBS guy about a
network job. I want that. This
is just the beginning for me. I
can't waste any more time.
STEPHANIE
Are you saying our relationship
was a waste of time?
PHIL
Our relationship? We went out a
total of four times! And only
twice did anything happen. It
was fun but I don't see that as
a big commitment.
STEPHANIE
(closing in again)
I had our charts done. My
astrologer says we're extremely
compatible. There may even be
some past lives involvement here.
PHIL
See? So we've already done this.
Let's move on. Next case.
STEPHANIE
You know what's wrong with you,
Phil? You're selfish. You don't
have time for anyone but
yourself.
-8-
PHIL
That's what I ' m trying to tell
you. You don't want to be with
me. You can do better. Look,
Stephanie, if I ever said or did
anything to mislead you I'm sorry
for that, but right now I have to
do this groundhog thing and I
don't have a handle on it yet.
He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
puts on his jacket.
PHIL (CONT.)
I'll tell you what. I ' m going to
do some serious thinking while
I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay?
He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her
standing there with a malevolent look on her face.
CUT TO:
Phil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a
stack of CD's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both
hands.
PHIL
. . . . I thought maybe you could
meet me up there tonight and let
me vulgarize you for about seven
hours....So I ' m supposed to spend
the night in Punxsutawney all
alo ne? Thanks.
Phil loads a CD and a great, driving song kicks in.
CUT TO:
A SIGN
"Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the
World Since 1887." Depicted on the sign is a large cartoon
GROUNDHOG wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his
arm.
The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts
of town.
Phil sits up in bed and looks around the room. The decor is
typical bed and breakfast, flocked wallpaper, framed prints,
and an odd assortment of mismatched furniture. His suit is
hanging neatly on the back of the closet door and his suitcase
is open on a stand at the foot of the bed, still neatly packed.
A iradio, DEEJAY and his SIDEKICK come on with hyped-up,
drivetime Chappy talk." Phil stares at the radio and listens
to them.
DEEJAY
Okay, campers, rise and shine,
and don't forget your booties
because it's COOOLD out there
TODAY1
Phil grimaces and swings out of bed.
SIDEK ICK
It's cold out there everyday.
W hat is this-- Miami Beach?
The deejay laughs. Phil shakes his head at the cheesy repartee
as he crosses to the sink and starts brushing his teeth.
-12-
DEEJAY
Not hardly. And you can expect
hazardous travel later today with
that, you know, blizzard thing--
SIDEKICK
That "blizzard thing?"
Phil splashes some water on his face and prepares to shave.
SIDEKICK (CONT.)
Oh, here's the report: the
National Weather Service is
calling for a big blizzard thing.
DEEJAY
Yes they are, but there's another
reason today is very special--
SIDEKICK
Es pec ia lly cold--
DEEJAY
Especially cold, okay, but the
big question on everybody's lips--
SIDEKICK
Ch ap pe d lips--
DEEJAY
:--on their chapped lips, right--
Do you think Phil's going to come
out and see his shadow?
SIDEKICK
Punxsutawney Phil.
Phil looks up at himself in the mirror, admiring his own face.
DEEJAY
That's right, rodent lovers!
IT'S--
BOTH DEEJAYS
Groundhog Day1
SOUND EFFECT of GRUNTING GROUNDHOGS.
Phil grunts at his reflection in the mirror.
PHIL
(to himself)
Never again.
CUT TO:
-13-
Phil heads for the breakfast room of the inn, now well-dressed
in a suit and tie, a nice overcoat slung over his arm. A
CHUBBY MAN passes.
CHUBBY MAN
Morning .
PHIL
Morning .
CHUBBY MAN
Think it'll be an early Spring?
PHIL
I ' m predicting March 21st.
CUT TO:
Phil enters the old library of the house now set up with a
breakfast buffet. An old spinet piano stands in the corner.
One wall is lined with .bookcases filled with books. A handful
of guests are seated around the room, eating.
The matron of the house, MRS. LANCASTER, spots Phil as she
comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee.
MRS. LANCASTER
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
PHIL
(with mock civility)
Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs.
Lancaster.
MRS. LANCASTER
Would you like some coffee?
PHIL
I don't suppose it1 d be possible
to get an espresso or a capuccino
around here.
MRS. LANCASTER
(BLANKLY)
I don't really know --
PHIL
Forget it. This '11 be fine.
-14-
MRS. LANCASTER
( as she pours)
I wonder what the weather's going
to be like for all the
festivities.
PHIL
My guess is it'11 be cold and
overcast, high today in the low
30's, dropping to the low 20's
tonight, but I'm predicting that
all that moisture coming up from
the Gulf is going to miss us and
dump some locally heavy snow,
possibly blizzard conditions with
travel advisories in the
Harrisburg area and maybe as far
east as .Philadelphia.
(off her surprised
LOOK)
You want to talk weather, you
asked the right guy.
He heads for the door.
;MRS. LANCASTER 
:
Oh, will you be checking out
today, Mr. Connors?
PHIL
Unfortunately yes.
Phil exits.
CUT TO:
Phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates.
The snow is getting heavier. Phil switches on the windshield
wipers.
PHIL
Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit!
He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and
notices slow traffic up ahead. He honks his horn as the
traffic comes to a complete stop. He keeps honking but nothing
moves.
He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a
parking lot.
PHIL
No. No!
Phil is on a pay phone. Snow is falling heavily outside.
GAS STATION ATTENDANT is shovelling around the pumps.
PHIL
So all the long distance lines
a re down? What about the
sa tellite? Is it snowing in
space?...But I have to call
Pittsburgh...Isn't there some
special line you keep open for
emergencies or for
celebrities?...Well, I'm both
really. I'm a celebrity in an
emergency. Can you patch me
through on that line?
-23-
The door opens and Phil is blasted with frigid Arctic wind and
blowing snow. The GAS STATION ATTENDANT enters the tiny office
and in trying to squeeze past Phil accidentally bangs him on
the head with his snow shovel.
CUT TO:
Phil is at the bar in Punxsutawney ' s oldest and best hotel , the
Pennsylvanian. He looks very bored, drinking a beer,
unsuccessfully hustling an attractive local girl named NANCY.
PHIL
You never saw me on TV-- on the
news?
NANCY
I don't think so. What part of
the news do you do?
PHIL
I ' m the White House correspondent
for NBC news.
NANCY
Oh , I ' m so sure .
PHIL
Ask me anything?
NANCY
Okay, how big is the White House?
PHIL
Three bedrooms, two and a half
baths. Looks much bigger than it
, is.
Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor.
Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes
into the bar, crying and shouting. A gaggle of BRIDESMAIDS
flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding
but she won't budge. Then the GROOM, wearing a bad rented tux,
comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the BEST
MAN restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away.
Phil watches the whole drama play out, then turns back to
Nancy .
PHIL
Good start. I ' m sure they'll be
very happy. So what do you say?
You want to play doggie obedience
school with me?
-24-
NANCY
Thanks. I'll pass.
She gets up to leave.
PHIL
Sit! Stay!
He watches her go, then tosses a tip on the bar and exits
somewhat unsteadily.
CUT TO:
INSERT - A THICK BOOK
The cover reads "101 Curses, Spells and Enchantments You Can Do
at Home." A well-manicured feminine hand opens the book to a
marked page .
Phil enters his room and drunkenly tosses his overcoat, scarf
and gloves on the floor in a heap.
Stephanie Decastro, Phil ' s disaffected ex-lover, is sitting
cross-legged on the floor with the book of curses open in front
of her. Her hair is down, she's wearing a caftan with a Zodiac
print, there are candles everywhere and other vaguely occult
decorating touches.
INSERT
Phil's business card is dropped into a dish. Then the Tarot
card of the Hanged Man, a chicken bone, and a feather are
placed on top of it .
PHIL
He stands at the sink, looking at himself in the mirror,
flexing his muscles .
STEPHANIE
Reading from the book> she mutters incantations in a secret
language, then she sprinkles some powder on the plate, then a
few drops of oil. Then she makes a few passes over it with her
hands and, much to her surprise, the contents of the plate
spontaneously combust.
PHIL
As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the
suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor.
-25-
He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave
them there, and flops down on the bed. He lies there looking
u up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around, then
he closes his eyes and quickly drops off to sleep, still fully
clothed.
STEPHANIE
To complete the spell, she picks up a broken wristwatch and
drops it into the fire.
INSERT
Phil's business card, the Hanged Man and the broken watch in
flames. The watch crystal is cracked and the hands are frozen
at 5:59.
DISSOLVE TO:
C LOSE UP - CLOCK
The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The
radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I
Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before.
Phil sits up in bed, quickly alert, and looks around the room.
Something is wrong. He's wearing pajamas, his suit is once
again hanging neatly on the closet door and his suitcase is
back on its stand at the foot of the bed, again neatly packed.
The song ends and the same radio deejay and his sidekick come
on with the same manic energy. Phil stares at the radio and
listens to them. A look of astonishment comes over his face as
they banter.
DEEJAY
Okay, campers, rise and shine,
and don't forget your booties
because it's COOOLD out there
today!
SIDEKICK
It's cold out there everyday.
What is this-- Miami Beach?
The deejay laughs. Phil "mock" laughs at exactly the same
time, recognizing the repartee from the previous morning.
PHIL
(to himself)
Nice going guys. That's
yesterday's tape.
Phil crosses to the sink and gets a towel off the rack, only
half-listening to the radio.
-26-
DEEJAY
Not hardly. Expect hazardous
travel later today with that, you
know, blizzard thing --
SIDEKICK
That "blizzard thing?"
Phil turns on the water and splashes some on his face as if
trying to wake himself up, vaguely disturbed by the repetition
of the broadcast.
SIDEKICK (CONT.)
Oh, here's the report: the
National Weather Service is
calling for a big blizzard
thing."
DEEJAY
Yes they are, but there's another
reason today is very special --
SIDEKICK
Especially cold --
DEEJAY
Especially cold, okay, but the
big question on everybody's lips --
Phil supplies the next line in unison with the radio.
SIDEKICK AND PHIL
Chapped lips --
DEEJAY
-- on their chapped lips, right --
Do you think Phil's going to come
out and see his shadow?
SIDEKICK
Punxsutawney Phil.
Some vague doubt causes Phil to go to the window.
DEEJAY
That's right, rodent lovers!
IT'S--
BOTH DEEJAYS
Groundhog Day!
SOUND EFFECT of GRUNTING GROUNDHOGS as Phil pulls back the
curtains and looks out.
HIS POV
The street is full of people heading toward Gobbler's Knob,
exactly as they did the day before.
-27-
PHIL
(AGHAST)
What the hell?
CUT TO:
Phil rushes out into the corridor, hastily tying his tie, his
suit jacket and overcoat over his arm. As he heads for the
breakfast room, the same Chubby Man passes.
CHUBBY MAN
Morning.
PHIL
Morning.
CHUBBY MAN
Think it'll be an early Spring?
PHIL
(stops, irritated)
Didn't we do this yesterday?
CHUBBY MAN
(INTIMIDATED)
I don't know what you mean.
Phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into
his eyes.
PHIL
Don't mess with me, pork chop.
What day is this?
CHUBBY MAN
(TERRIFIED)
Febr uary second--Groundhog Day!
Phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the
poor man.
PHIL
Okay. Sorry. I'm having a bad
day.
Phil walks on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted.
CHUBBY MAN
(to himself)
I'll say.
-28-
Phil enters the old library of the house and finds everything
exactly as it was the day before. Mrs. Lancaster spots Phil as
she comes out of the kitchen with the fresh pot of coffee.
MRS. LANCASTER
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
PHIL
(completely confused)
D i d I? I don't know--
MRS. LANCASTER
Would you like some coffee?
PHIL
Yes, thank you. I ' m feeling a
little strange.
MRS. LANCASTER
( as she pours)
I wonder what the weather's going
to be like for all the
festivities.
PHIL
Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs.
Lancaster?
MRS. LANCASTER
Is that the Italian dessert with
the brandy and the chocolate
mousse?
PHIL
No, that's spaghetti. Never
mind.
He heads for the door, still in a daze.
MRS. LANCASTER
Oh, will you be checking out
today, Mr. Connors?
PHIL
(VAGUELY)
I don't know. I don't think so.
I'll tell you after I wake up.
Phil exits.
CUT TO:
-29-
Phil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the
nightstand. The pencil is whole again. Completely stunned by
the phenomenon, he jumps out of bed and starts dressing
hurriedly as the morning Deejays begin their now familiar rap.
DEEJAY
Okay, campers, rise and shine,
and don't forget your booties
because it's COOOLD out there
today!
SIDEKICK
It's cold out there everyday.
What is this-- Miami Beach?
Phil rushes out of the room.
CUT TO:
Phil enters and passes Mrs. Lancaster in the breakfast room.
MRS. LANCASTER
Painting something, Mr. Connors?
PHIL
I ' m conducting an experiment.
Phil enters and dumps the bags on the bed. Out fall a couple
of big paintbrushes, a small sledgehammer, a handsaw, a
crowbar, plastic goggles and assorted other tools. He puts on
the goggles, grabs a hammer and some nails and starts nailing
the door shut.
CUT TO:
-37-
Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork
in the room. He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with
the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
sink.
Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying
to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing
heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's
going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric
barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
mirror with his sledgehammer.
Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into
the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,
madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the
room with it.
As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,
then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
feathers.
Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can
hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.
We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in
the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on
and "I Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil
sleeping on the bed.
He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. No
paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy
as the day he checked in.
He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His
hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved.
The song ends and the deejays come on. Phil says every word
right along with them, shocked into a state of complete
wonderment.
-38-
PHIL AND DEEJAY
Okay, campers, rise and shine,
and don't forget your booties
because it's COOOLD out there
today.
PHIL AND SIDEKICK
It's cold out there everyday.
What is this -- Miami Beach?
The deejay laughs. Phil laughs insanely along with him.
CUT TO:
EXT . GOBBLER ' S KNOB - EARLY MORNING
Phil is wrapping up another groundhog report, trying to be
completely professional despite the circumstances.
PHIL
(with forced good
HUMOR)
. . . S o according to Mr. Groundhog
I guess we can expect six more
weeks of winter. It's not very
scientific, but it sure is fun.
Hey, wait a second. If he's
right, I could be out of a job!
(mock laugh)
For Channel 9 News, this is Phil
Connors in Punxsutawney .
He holds until Larry stops tape, then approaches Rita.
PHIL
How was that?
RITA
(PLEASED)
It was good. A little smarmy for
my taste, but I guess that's what
sells.
PHIL
Could I talk to you about a
matter that is not work related?
RITA
You never talk about work.
PHIL
Do you know what I did last
night?
RITA
Do I want to know?
-39-
PHIL
I destroyed my hotel room.
RITA
You whatl This is not some kind
of rock and roll tour. We don't
have the budget for that--
PHIL
No, it's okay. This morning it
was all right again. That's what
I have to talk to you about.
RITA
Phil, what are you doing?
CUT TO:
Phil and Rita sit together at the same table they had
previously. The WAITER approaches.
RITA
(to waiter)
Could I have some coffee, please?
The waiter pours her a cup.
WAITER
(EXITING)
I'll be back to take your order.
RITA
Thanks.
(to Phil)
Okay, so tell me. How'd you know
where to put the camera?
PHIL
Because I've done it before.
RITA
I know, but the groundhog doesn't
do exactly the same thing every
year, does he?
-40-
PHIL
I ' m not talking about last year.
I ' m talking about today. I lived
it before.
RITA
You're having deja vu?
PHIL
Big time. Rita, I know it's nuts
but I keep reliving the same day
o ve r and over-- Groundhog Day--
today. This is the third time.
RITA
(completely skeptical)
Uh-huh. I'm waiting for the
punchline.
PHIL
No, really. It's like today
never happened. I shaved my head
last night, today its all grown
back. I could probably cut off
my limbs, one by one, and - pop!
They'd grow back. Just like a
starfish. I probably don't even
have to floss?
RITA
I'm wracking my brain, but I
can't even begin to imagine why
you'd make up something like
this.
PHIL
'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm
asking for your help.
Rita looks at him for a long moment.
RITA
Okay, I'll bite. What do you
want me to do?
PHIL
The truth? I'd 1ike you to spend
the next 24 hours with me and
don't leave my side for a second.
RITA
I see. You know, Phil, you can
charm all the little P.A.'s at
the station, all the secretaries,
and even some of the weekend
a nchors, but not me-- not in a
thousand years.
-41-
PHIL
Wa it a second--
RITA
Not if I was dying and your
breath was the only cure; not if
having your child was the only
way to preserve the human race.
Just get it out of your head
because it is NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN!
PHIL
So much for the truth.
Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
and makes his way over to their table.
LARRY
(to Rita)
You ready? We better get going
if we're going to stay ahead of
the weather.
RITA
Yeah, , I ' m . ready, Larry.
(EXITING)
Good luck, Phil.
CUT TO:
INSERT
X-rays of Phil's skull are slapped up onto a light box.
Phil is having his head examined by a NEUROLOGIST.
NEUROLOGIST
No spots, no tumors, no lesions,
no clots, no aneurisms.
Everything looks fine and dandy
to me, Mr. Connors. Have you
considered psychiatric help?
CUT TO:
Punxsutawney's only PSYCHOLOGIST is a marriage and family
counselor at the local Lutheran church. His appearance and
manner indicate he may have some serious problems of his own.
-42-
PSYCHOLOGIST
(not too confident)
That's kind of an unusual
problem, Mr. Connors. Most of my
work is with couples and
families.
Phil is lying on a couch. His head is completely shaved.
PHIL
Yeah, but you're still a
psychologist. You must have had
some course in school that
covered this kind of thing.
PSYCHOLOGIST
Sort of, I guess. Abnormal
Psychology.
PHIL
So based on that what would you
say?
PSYCHOLOGIST
(HESITANT)
I ' d say that maybe you're -- I
don't know -- a little delusional.
PHIL
You're saying this thing is not
really happening to me?
PSYCHOLOGIST
Uh-huh.
PHIL
Then how do I know this
conversation is really happening?
PSYCHOLOGIST
I guess you don't.
PHIL
Then forget about me paying you.
A discreet little alarm sounds.
PSYCHOLOGIST
(RELIEVED)
I'm afraid that's all the time we
have, Mr. Connors.
PHIL
Wait! Are you saying I'm crazy?
-43-
PSYCHOLOGIST
(humoring him)
Not necessarily. If it concerns
you we should schedule our next
session as soon as possible.
How's tomorrow for you?
Phil glowers at him.
CUT TO:
INSERT - A MODEL OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
A SCIENTIST in a white lab coat is holding up the model. Phil
looks on with interest.
SCIENTIST
(AUTHORITATIVELY)
Now if the moon exerts a
gravitational pull strong enough
to cause the tides, .then it may
be theoretically possible for a
Black Hole or a Singularity of
sufficient magnitude to actually
bend time enough to cause it to
fold back ,on itself.
PHIL
You think that's a realistic
possibility?
A paper airplane sails past his head, accompanied by a noisy
outburst of juvenile laughter. We pull back to REVEAL:
Twenty-five eighth-graders running amok.
SCIENTIST
(STERNLY)
All right! I think someone may
just need a little visit to the
Assistant Principal's office!
Get back in your seats. The bell
has not rung yet.
The kids sit back down, but keep up their noisy chatter.
SCIENTIST
(to Phil)
Well, I ' m speaking purely
hypothetically.
CUT TO:
-44-
Phil is walking toward the exit when he passes a first grade
classroom. The door is open and the TEACHER is discussing a
story with the class.
TEACH ER
So the princess picked up the
frog and kissed him.
Phil stops outside the door to listen.
TEACHER
Now who can tell me what happened
when the princess kissed the
frog.
LITTLE BOY
Her lips got slimed!
The whole class erupts in giggles and shrieks.
T EACHER
Okay, come on now. What happened
when she kissed the frog?
LITTLE GIRL
The princess kissed the frog and
the spell got broke and he turned
into a handsome prince and they
got married and lived happily
ever after.
TEACHER
That's right.
Phil is leaning against the wall listening. There is something
very arresting about the fairy tale, but finally he just shakes
his head and exits.
CUT TO:
Phil is at a bar getting drunk with two local blue-collar
workers, GUS and PHIL.
PHIL
Gus, what would you do if there
was no tomorrow?
-45-
GUS
You mean like if the world was
gonna end?
PHIL
No, I mean like if it was never
going to end. If everyday was
the same and you were stuck here
and you couldn't get out and
nothing you did mattered?
GUS
You're right. Everyday is the
same, I can't get out of here and
nothin' I do matters.
V RALPH
No, he's askin1 you a question,
ya idiot.
GUS
What was the question?
RALPH
What if nothing mattered?! Jeez,
I know what I'd do. I ' d j ust
spend all my time drivin' fast,
gettin1 loaded and gettin' laid.
That's it.
PHIL
That's it. It just doesn't get
any better than this, does it?
Good friends, good conversation
and quality brew. Drink up,
boys.
They salute each other and drink.
CUT TO:
Phil is having a great time. Gus and Ralph are whooping it up
like kids on a roller coaster.
PHIL
This is great, Ralph!
RALPH
Oh, hey, take a left!
Phil passes the intersection.
RALPH
You missed it!
PHIL
No problem --
EXT . MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
Phil throws the car into a high-speed, skidding U-turn, goes up
on the curb, across a couple of lawns, takes out a mailbox and
a STOP sign and bounces back onto the street.
A POLICE CAR parked in front of the hardware store pulls out
and takes off after him.
Phil swerves in and out of oncoming traffic. Gus is starting
to look a little green.
PHIL
So many rules --
-47-
RALPH
You can say that again.
PHIL
"Don't do this--"
Ralph hears the siren and looks back at the police car.
All right! Try and stop us, you
mothers !
PHIL
No more rules!
RALPH
No more rules!
Phil rushes into the breakfast room just as Mrs. Lancaster
comes out of the kitchen with the coffee. Everything is
exactly the same as before.
MRS. LANCASTER
W o u l d you--
Phil interrupts, answering all her questions before she even
asks them.
PHIL
(URGENTLY)
Yes, I would like some coffee;
the weather is going to be cold
and overcast with blizzard
conditions moving in later today;
and yes, I will be staying an
extra day.
MRS. LANCASTER
(BAFFLED)
Why thank you.
PHIL
Mrs. Lancaster, has anyone been
around here looking for me this
morning? Maybe a state official,
blue coat, hat, gun, nightstick,
badge, driving a late-model Ford
br Chevy, black and white with
bub ble lights on top--
MRS. LANCASTER
(SHOCKED)
No, no one like that-- I .don't--
Will they be?
PHIL
(greatly relieved)
Apparently not.
Phil gooses her, grabs a sweet roll, and heads for the door,
starting to believe now that he can truly do anything he wants
to.
CUT TO:
-50-
Phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an
incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage,
pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc.
Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs
himself with pastry.
RITA
Is this some new fad diet? Don't
you worry about cholesterol?
Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate
eclair.
-52-
PHIL
I don't worry about anything
anymore.
RITA
What makes you so special?
Everybody worries about
something.
PHIL
That's exactly what makes me so
special.
He takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head.
PHIL
(with his mouth full)
What?
RITA
"The wretch, concentered all
in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair
renown,
And doubly dying, shall go
down to the vile dust from
whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and
unsung." Sir Walter Scott.
PHIL
(stares at her for a
long moment)
"There was a young man from
Na n t uc k e t-- "
RITA
That's really funny. When are
you going to grow up, Phil?
PHIL
At this rate-- never.
(he pulls out a pack of
CIGARETTES)
Okay if I smoke?
Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette.
RITA
You really do have a death wish,
don't you?
PHIL
Just the opposite, Rita. I have
a life wish. I'm just trying to
enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the
little things. Don't you ever
just want to cut loose and go
wild?
-53-
RITA
I wouldn't even know what it
means to go wild.
PHIL
Yeah, well, that's where I come
in. Going wild is one of my
specialties. Last night I got
completely loaded and drove head-
on into a police car.
RITA
(DISBELIEVING)
Oh, really? You look pretty good
this morning.
PHIL
That's my point. I know you
won't believe me, but we could do
anything we want today and it
wouldn't matter one bit.
Absolutely no consequences.
Complete and total freedom.
RITA
And how. . , do we manage that?
PHIL
You leave that to me. Why don't
you send Larry back and hang out
with me for the rest of the day?
You never make it through that
blizzard anyway.
Larry enters the diner and spots them.
RITA
I'll take my chances with the
-weather. But you have a good
time.
PHIL
Don't worry. I plan to.
CUT TO:
Phil is making passionate love to a WOMAN in the dark.
WOMAN
(MOANS)
Oh, Phil.
PHIL
Oh , Rita .
The woman suddenly freezes. There is a moment of silence, then
she snaps on the light. It's Nancy, not Rita. Phil is as
surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue.
NANCY
(COLD)
Who's Rita?
PHIL
(CAUGHT)
No one. It's just something I
say when I make love. You know --
"Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like
"Oh, baby" or something.
NANCY
(not entirely
CONVINCED)
Oh.
PHIL
(corrects her)
O-rita.
Nancy laughs uncertainly. Phil switches off the light,
thinking now about Rita.
CUT TO:
-56-
Some elderly GUESTS are sipping coffee and eating breakfast,
staring uncomfortably at something on the other side of the
room.
THEIR POV
Phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing only pajamas,
absently munching on a Danish as he reads from one of the
books.
Mrs. Lancaster approaches him.
MRS. LANCASTER
Isn't it a wonderful collection?
PHIL
(not looking up)
Yes, it is. You don't usually
find this many trashy novels in
one place.
MRS. LANCASTER
You can take a book up to your
room if you like.
PHIL
No, thank you. I've actually
read them all. I was just
rereading some of the dirty
parts.
He finishes and puts the book back on the shelf.
MRS. LANCASTER
(WORRIED)
How long will you be staying with
us, Mr. Connors?
PHIL
Indefinitely. I've already been
here for 211 days.
MRS. LANCASTER
(humoring him)
Really? That's quite a long
time, isn't it. I hope you're
finding things to do in our
little town.
PHIL
(CASUALLY)
Yes, well, I'm getting a little
tired of casual sex so today I
thought I'd rob a bank and buy
myself a really expensive car.
-57-
Phil kisses her on the lips and walks off.
CUT TO:
Phil pats the hood of a used BMW 850 sports car as a SALESMAN
stands by beaming. Phil is wearing a full Steelers football
uniform complete with shoulder pads.
-58-
SALESMAN
A real beauty, huh. We picked it
u p at a--
PHIL
I'll take it. How much?
SALESMAN
Well, the sticker says $62,999
bu t if you want--
PHIL
I'll tell you what. I'll give
you $70,000 if you just knock off
the car salesman stuff and let me
get out of here with my car.
The Salesman gawks as Phil opens his briefcase and starts
counting out stacks of bills.
CUT TO:
Phil is lying on the table, getting elaborately tattooed.
Rita walks by, looks in the window and is shocked to see Phil
there.
Phil waves at her and points to the colorful new heart pierced
by a bloody dagger being tattooed on his arm.
CUT TO:
We pan down the line of ROUGH TRADE PATRONS to. Phil, dressed
all in black leathers, both arms heavily tattooed, looking like
Sid Viscious on crack. He takes off his hat to reveal red,
white and blue hair shaved almost down to his skull. A slut
named ANGIE and another overweight, not very pretty MADONNA
WANNA-BE, both in too-tight jeans and bullet bras are coming on
to him, practically licking his ears. Angie pops a couple of
mystery pills into his mouth. Phil washes them down with a
shot and a beer.
I
CUT TO:
It looks like ;outtakes from Fellini's "Satyricon." Heavy metal
is blaring from the radio, as several unsavory looking men and
women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off
whatever hit them. Someone is knocking loudly on the door,
shouting complaints about the music. A beer bottle smashes
against the door.
Phil is sitting up on the bed with Angie. He has his arm
around her shoulder and a fifth of Wild Turkey in his hand.
PHIL
(more to himself than
to Angie)
Yeah, but eventually you' d just
get tired of screwing around and
then you'd want a real
relationship, wouldn't you?
ANGIE
I don't know.
A big German Shepherd tries to jump up on the bed with them.
PHIL
Get down, Brunoi
(CONTINUING)
Someone decent, someone who you
respected, who respects you.
-60-
ANGIE
I guess so.
The dog jumps up again.
PHIL
Down , Bruno !
(still musing)
It's tough to find a relationship
like that, especially if your
time is kind of limited. But you
still have to try, don't you?
(the dog again)
Bruno! I told you! Off the bed!
Phil looks over at Angle who's passed out with her mouth open
PHIL
There ' s got to be more to it than
this.
CUT TO :
Phil and Rita are at their usual table, drinking coffee.
RITA
I guess I want what everybody
wants-- you know, career, love,
marriage, children. So far I
don't have any of it.
-62-
PHIL
You have a career.
RITA
I have a job. Doing stories on
the Punxsutawney groundhog is not
my ultimate goal. No offense.
PHIL
How about the other stuff? You
seeing anybody?
RITA
This is getting too personal. I
don't think I ' m ready to discuss
these things with you. What
about you? What do you want?
PHIL
What I really want is someone
like you.
RITA
O h , please--
PHIL
Why not?
RITA
Phil, you know, you have so much
talent and ability. If you'd
just drop the attitude and act
like a decent human being, then
maybe I ' d --
(she hesitates)
PHIL
You'd what?
RITA
I don't know what.
PHIL
Then maybe you'd like me?
She stares hard at him.
RITA
I don't know. It's sort of like
the way I feel about UFO's. I'd
have to see it to believe it.
Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
and makes his way over to their table.
-63-
LARRY
(to Rita)
You ready? We better get going
if we're going to stay ahead of
the weather.
RITA
Yeah, I'll be right out, Larry.
Larry scowls at Phil and exits.
PHIL
(to Rita)
Why don't you stay for a while?
The road's going to be closed
anyway. Do you really want to be
stuck in the van with Larry for
three hours?
RITA
I've got to get back. I'll see
you later.
Phil watches Rita exit.
PHIL'S POV
Rita gets in the news van and drives off with Larry.
Phil stares out the window, more" determined than ever to win
her over.
CUT TO:
Rita is sitting at the bar in the town's best restaurant, a
good chophouse with Black Forest decor and waitresses dressed
in dirndl skirts and aprons. Phil enters and sits down next to
her.
PHIL
(acting surprised)
Oh, hi, Rita. You still here?
RITA
(GLUM)
The van won't start. Larry's
working on it.
PHIL
(INNOCENT)
Wouldn't you know it. Buy you a
drink?
RITA
Okay.
PHIL
(to the bartender)
Jack Daniels.
BARTENDER
For you, miss?
RITA
Tequila,with lime. Gold, if
you've got it.
Phil nods to himself.
CUT TO:
SAME SCENE - ANOTHER DAY
Phil walks in and sits next to Rita.

Rita looks at Phil, surprised.
BARTENDER
For you miss?
RITA
Same for me, please.
The BARTENDER pours.
PHIL
(to Rita)
What should we toast to?
RITA
Your call.
PHIL
To the groundhog!
Rita stares for a moment.
RITA
I always drink to world peace.
CUT TO:
SAME SCENE - ANOTHER DAY
BARTENDER
Take your order?
PHIL
Tequila with lime, gold if you've
got it.
Rita looks at Phil.
, BARTENDER
For you, miss?
-66-
RITA
Same for me, please.
The BARTENDER pours.
Phil lifts his glass.
PHIL
To world peace.
Rita smiles, reevaluating him.
RITA
To world peace.
They clink glasses.
CUT TO:
Rita and Phil are now sitting together at a table, a plate of
cheese and crackers and a bottle of white wine between them.
PHIL
You like your job?
RITA
It's okay. I think it could be
really challenging. Of course
it's about a million miles from
where I started out in college.
PHIL
You weren't in broadcasting?
RITA
At Bryn Mawr? No, uh-uh.
"Believe it or not, I studied
Nineteenth Century French Poetry.
PHIL
(laughs good-naturedly)
Really? What a waste of time.
Rita looks offended. Phil knows he made a mistake.
CUT TO:
SAME SCENE - ANOTHER DAY
PHIL
You weren't in broadcasting?

RITA
At Bryn Mawr? No, uh-uh.
Believe it or not, I studied
Nineteenth Century French Poetry.
Phil leans in closer to her.
PHIL
La fille qui j'aimera
Sera comme bon vin
Qui se bonifiera
Un peut chaque matin.
Rita smiles, entranced.
CUT TO:
Phil and Rita are sitting at a table in a small confectionery,
tasting chunks of different flavored fudge. Rita takes a bite
RITA
This is terrific.
PHIL
Best fudge in town.
RITA
How do you know so much about
Punxsutawney?
PHIL
I like small towns. I think they
engender real community more than
big cities.
RITA
That is so true! I've always
thought that, too.
PHIL
No kidding. Here-- try the white
chocolate.
RITA
Oh, yuk, don't make me sick.
PHIL
(making mental note)
No white chocolate.
RITA
There's something so familiar
about this. Do you ever have
deja vu?
Phil smiles. Then Larry enters.
-68-
LARRY
(irate, to Rita)
I don't believe it. Someone
bought every distributor cap in
this town. We're going to be
stuck here all night1
Over Phil's sympathetic look we hear the song, "I Can't Get
Started With You".
CUT TO:
The music continues over Rita and Phil on the small dance
floor. They dance, close, dreamy, romantic.
CUT TO:
Rita hugs him again and starts to exit.
RITA
Thanks. See you tomorrow.
PHIL
Tomorrow? Wait, aren't you going
to come up to my room for a
while?
RITA
(very reluctant)
I don't know, Phil--
PHIL
Noreason to end a perfect day.
RITA
(DECIDING)
Well-- we better not.
PHIL
No, you should. The, uh, the
poetry! I've got some books,
Rimbaud, Beaudelaire, we could
l ig ht a fire--
-70-
RITA
Thanks, but --
PHIL
(seeing it all slip
AWAY)
Please come, Rita. It'll be --
RITA
(DEFINITE)
Phil, I'm tired. We can be
together tomorrow.
PHIL
(getting desperate)
But there is no tomorrow for me!
RITA
(ADAMANT)
Let's not ruin it, Phil. There's
no way I ' m sleeping with you
tonight.
PHIL
Why not? Rita, I love you!
RITA
You don't even know me!
PHIL
(grabs her hand)
Please! You have to!
Rita shakes loose from his grasp.
RITA
What's wrong with you!
There is a long moment of silent tension, then all her old
doubts about Phil come rushing back.
RITA
(shaking her head)
Oh, no. I can't believe I fell
for it. This whole day was just
one long set-up. And I ate
fudge. Yucchh! I hate fudge.
PHIL
No, it was real. I love you.
RITA
Stop saying that! Do you really
expect me to trust you? The
whole secretarial pool is a Phil
Connors recovery group.
-71-
PHIL
But I can change! I really can--
Rita slaps him hard on the cheek.
RITA
That's for making me care about
you.
She turns and stomps off, leaving Phil standing there hurting.
CUT TO:
Phil is trying (MOS) to talk his way into Rita's room. She
^pushes him away and slams the door in his face.
CUT TO:
"I Got You, Babe" is playing. Phil hits the clock radio to
turn it off. He lies there for a moment, then hefts himself
heavily out of bed, not eager to repeat the day yet another
time. With the radio off, Phil does the deejays' morning
routine himself, seemingly for the millionth time.
PHIL
(DULLY)
Okay, campers, rise and shine,
and don't forget your booties
because it's cooooold out there
today.
Phil continues the radio report at his own pace, obviously
fatigued.
-72-
PHIL
It's cold out there everyday.
What is this -- Miami Beach? Haw.
Not hardly. And you can expect
hazardous travel later today with
that, you know, blizzard thing.
CUT TO:
Phil is sitting in his bathrobe in a big lounge chair in the
parlor of his hotel. Mrs. Lancaster, and other guests watch
his performance, awed by his "intellect."
ALEX
(on TV)
Twin brother and sister Sebastian
and Olivia create confusion in
this Shakespearean comedy.
PHIL
What is "Twelfth Night."
CONTESTANT
(on TV)
What is "Twelfth Night?"
ALEX
(on TV)
Correct.
More cheering from the small group.
CONTESTANT

I'll take New Jersey for eight
hundred, Alex.

ALEX

And the answer is-- an audio
daily double.
PHIL
Count Basie.
CUT TO:
Phil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and
dangerous, and enters the children's section. No one is
present except the CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN, a young woman,
reshelving books in the stacks. He looks around quickly and
sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads:
"Punxsutawney Phil - The Great Prognosticates"
Phil heads right for it.
The groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled
habitat, oblivious to the approaching danger.
As Phil approaches the groundhog display, he reaches into his
overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip.
The children's librarian sees the gun and freezes.
Phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the
case.
PHIL'S POV
The groundhog looks right into his sights.
Philsqueezes the trigger. LOUD GUNSHOT.
The glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it. The
groundhog looks up playfully.
Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. Phil
can't believe it. He charges the glass and pounds it with the
rifle butt. He can't even chip it. Suddenly he is seized from
behind by TWO STRONG MEN who take the rifle from him and
wrestle him to floor.
The librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog.
BYSTANDER
Is he all right?
LIBRARIAN
He's just fine. That's two
inches of bullet-proof glass
there. You can't be too careful
in this day and age.
-79-
CUT TO:
Phil looks at the groundhog on the seat next to him, then
punches the gas as he turns up a mountain drive.
PHIL
Coming to the end of the trail,
Phil. Then we're going out in a
blaze of glory.
Buster pursues Phil with relentless determination.
BUSTER
Nobody takes my groundhog and
gets away with it.
..  .
Rita is driving. Larry is hooking up the camera.
RITA
(very upset)
What is he doing? What can he be
thinking? He must1 ve just --
snapped.
Larry squeezes into the passenger seat with the camera mounted
on his shoulder .
LARRY
This oughta be good.
BUSTER
Okay! I know this road. There's
no way off ' cept the way we come
up.
FIRST OFFICIAL
All right! We got him now.
-82-
Phil looks in his rearview mirror at the cars chasing him. He
glances down at the groundhog. He takes a breath.
PHIL
Okay, pal. It's showtime.
Phil hits the gas.
Larry is taping as Rita comes around the curve just in time to
see the pickup truck speeding toward the cliff. Rita hits the
brakes and watches in horror.
RITA
PHIL! NO!
Ned and a client are huddled over his desk, looking at some
papers. A BODY DROPS quickly past the window behind them.
It's Phil.
They rush to the window and look down at the sidewalk three
stories below. Phil is sprawled there like a broken puppet,
lifeless.
"I Got You, Babe" is playing. Phil wakes up and smashes the
radio.
CUT TO:
Rita stands by weeping while Phil's body is covered with a
sheet.
In the shadowy darkness under the sheet, a CLICK is heard and
Phil's eyes pop open. "I Got You, Babe" plays.
Phil pulls the sheet off his face and finds himself back in his
bed in his room. A tear falls from his eye.
CUT TO:
Phil and Rita are sitting in the diner at their regular table.
RITA
I ' m sorry. What was that again?
PHIL
I'm a god.
RITA
You're God?
PHIL
No, I'm A god. Not THE God-- at
least I don't think I am.
RITA
That's reassuring. For a mintute
there I thought you might be
crazy.
PHIL
No, it's true. It's the only
possible explanation. I'm a
supernatural being.
RITA
Because you survived a car wreck?
-85-
The waiter comes to the table.
WAITER
Are you ready to order?
PHIL
(to Rita, ignoring the
WAITER)
Not just the car wreck! I didn't
just blow up yesterday, you know.
I've been run over, drowned,
crushed, stabbed, shot,
electrocuted, poisoned, frozen,
burn ed, and asphyxiated--
RITA
Really?
The waiter looks at him like he's nuts.
PHIL
--but I always wake up the next
day without a scratch, without
even a headache. I'm telling
you, I ' m immortal.
WAITER
The special today is blueberry
waffles.
RITA
Why are you telling me this?
WAITER
(SHRUGS)
Because some people like
blueberry waffles.
RITA
(to the waiter)
No t you-- him.
PHIL
Because I want you to believe in
me.
RITA
You're not a god, Phil. Take my
word for it. This is twelve
years of Catholic school talking.
WAITER
I could come back if you're not
ready.
PHIL
How do you know I'm not a god?
-86-
RITA
Please.
PHIL
How do you know?
RITA
Because it's not possible.
WAITER
I'll come back.
The /waiter turns to leave.
PHIL
Hey, Billy!
The waiter turns back.
PHIL
This is Bill. He's been a waiter
for three years because he left
Penn State and had to find work.
He likes the town, he paints toy
soldiers, and he's gay.
WAITER
I am notl
Phil grabs an astonished Rita and pulls her over to the next
table.
RITA
What are you doing?
PHIL
This is Doris Kleiser and her
fiance Fred.
DORIS
Do I know you?
PHIL
They're supposed to get married
tonight but Doris is having
second thoughts.
FRED
What!
Doris touces her engagement ring, dumbfounded. Rita is a
little embarrassed.
RITA
Lovely ring.
DORIS
Thanks.
-87-
Phil drags Rita to the counter.
PHIL
This is Ralph. Say "Hi," Rita.
Rita flashes a quick smile.
RALPH
Don't believe I've had the--
PHIL
Ralph hates his life here and
wants to drive around town
smashing into policemen.
RALPH
Well, who don't?
RITA
This is some kind of trick.
PHIL
Yes, it's a trick. But maybe the
real God cheats, too. Maybe God
isn't omnipotent-- he's just had
a lot of practice.
RITA
How about that guy?
PHIL
Tom. Worked in the coal mine
til they shut it down.
RITA
Her?
PHIL '
Nancy. Went to Lincoln High
School in Pittsburgh. Takes
herself out to lunch once a week.
Rita is getting very bewildered. From their reactions she can
see that Phil is right about each and every one of them.
RITA
How do you know these people!
PHIL
I told you the truth. In five
seconds there's going to be a
grease fire in the kitchen.
Five, four--
RITA
This is nuts.
-88-
PHIL
--three, two, one.
Phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the
service window. Everyone in the diner is now staring at them
RITA
(trying to puzzle it
OUT)
Okay, enough. Let's just sit
down and think for a second.
(they sit)
What do you know about me, Phil?
Do you know me, too?
Phil takes a long pause.
PHIL
I know all about you, Rita. I
know you like producing, but hope
for better than Channel 9,
Pittsburgh.
RITA
Everyone knows that.
PHIL
You like boats but not the ocean.
There's a lake you go to in the
summer with your family, up in
the mountains, with an old wooden
dock and a boathouse with boards
missing in the roof, and a place
you used to crawl underneath to
be alone, and at night you'd look
up and see the stars. You're a
sucker for Rocky Road, Marlon
Brando, and French poetry.
You're wonderfully generous;
you're kind to strangers, and
children; and when you stand in
the snow, you look like an angel.
RITA
How are you doing this?
PHIL
I told you! I wake up every day
right here, right in
Punxsutawney, and it's always
February second and I can't turn
it off. If you still don't
bel iev e me, listen--
RITA
B u t , Phil--
-89-
PHIL
Listen! In ten seconds Larry is
going to walk through that door
and take you away from me.
RITA
Larry?
PHIL
But you can't let him. Please
believe me. You've got to
believe me.
RITA
I don't --
Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around and spots
Rita.
PHIL
Look.
As Rita turns around to see Larry, Phil grabs a pen and pad
from a passing waitress and quickly writes something down as
Larry makes his way to their table. Phil finishes writing.
LARRY
(to Rita)
You ready? We better get going
if we're going to stay ahead of
the weather.
Phil hands the paper to Rita. She reads it.
RITA
(READING)
" . . . stay ahead of the weather. "
Larry looks at the paper.
LARRY
What ' s that?
Rita looks at Phil with new understanding and empathy.
CUT TO:
A hat is lying on Phil's bed. A playing card flies past. A
second playing card sails right into the hat. Another playing
card sails past, missing. Another playing card sails right in
Phil and Rita are tossing cards. Rita is missing. Phil is
hitting.
PHIL
It's not in the wrist so much as
the fingers. Be the hat.
RITA
It would take me a year to get
good at this.
PHIL
Uh-uh. Six months. Four, five
hours a day.
RITA
Is this what you do with
eternity?
-93-
PHIL
Now you know. It's like waiting
for a bus that never comes . You
should see me play pool -- and
bowling, juggling, hacky sack.
I can ride a unicycle.
There ' s a knock on the door .
PHIL
I'll get it!
Phil jumps for the door and opens it. The PIZZA GUY is there.
PHIL
Hi, Marty. $11.75 including the
delivery charge, right?
PIZZA GUY
U h hh h --
Phil pays him, takes the pizza and closes the door.
RITA
(opening the pizza box)
MMMM. Pepperoni and olives. My
favorite .
PHIL
Of course. I told you, I know
everything .
RITA
(taking a bite of
PIZZA)
I don ' t think I ' d want to know
everything that ' s going to
happen. I like to be surprised.
PHIL
That's not the worst part.
RITA
What's the worst part?
PHIL
The worst part is starting over
everyday. Tomorrow you won't
remember any of this. You'll go
back to treating me like a
complete jerk --
RITA
No --
PHIL
It's not your fault. I am a
jerk.
-94-
RITA
No, you're not.
PHIL
Okay, I ' m not. It really doesn't
make a lot of difference. I've
killed myself so many times, I
don't even exist anymore. I'm
just completely empty.
RITA
Or completely clean.
PHIL
If you're going to be this
positive all the time I may have
to rough you up a little.
RITA
Wait! Have we done this before?
PHIL
Which part?
RITA
You getting me up here, the card
gam e, the pizza--
PHIL
No, this is the first time.
RITA
(EXCITED)
Well?
PHIL
Well, what?
RITA
Well how does it feel to be doing
something completely new?
Phil looks at her with tremendous affection and gratitude.
PHIL
Good. Really good.
He takes a slice of pizza and starts eating with gusto.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE PIZZA BOX - LATER
There's only one slice left.
Phil and Rita are sitting together on the bed, close but not
touching. Soft music is playing on the radio.
-95-
RITA
Sometimes I wish I had a thousand
lifetimes. One to be a great
journalist. One to, I don't
know, go back to school, study
art, or auto mechanics. One just
to take care of all the busywork,
you know, pay the bills, get my
car tuned up. One to be the wild
woman of Borneo. One to be
Mother Theresa. Maybe it's not
a curse, Phil. It all just
depends on how you look at it.
Phil stares at her for a long time letting this sink in. Then
he belches really loud. Rita stares at him, then burps
surprisingly loud herself.
RITA
I want you to know, it's been a
really nice day for me.
PHIL
Me, too.
RITA
Maybe, if it's not too boring for
you, we could do it again.
PHIL
I hope so.
The clock reads 11:59. Rita grabs Phil's hand. He puts his
arm around her.
They look into each others' eyes. Rita gives Phil a reassuring
smile. She squeezes his hand. Their eyes turn to the clock.
11:;59 turns to 12:00.
Rita looks up at Phil as if expecting some magical event.
RITA
You're still here!
PHIL
I know.
RITA
I thought you were supposed to
disappear-- or I was or
something.
PHIL
Not 'til six.
RITA
You rat!
-96-
She is mad in a playful way.
PHIL
I never said midnight--
RITA
You knew I was waiting for
midnight!
PHIL
But I never said it.
RITA
Oh, I can't believe you!
(she slugs him with a
PILLOW)
I didn't know this was going to
take all night!
PHIL
Does that mean you're going?
RITA
No.
Phil takes Rita's hand. She doesn't resist.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER
Rita is now sitting right next to Phil on the bed, her head
resting on his shoulder. She nods off then catches herself.
RITA
I'm sorry.
PHIL
It's okay to go to sleep you
know. I promise I won't touch
you-- much.
RITA
No, it's all right. I'm not
tired. What were you saying?
Her eyes start to close again.
PHIL
I was saying that the cow was
eventually returned to it's
rightful owner.
RITA
(drifting off)
Really?
-97-
PHIL
That's right.
He looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers
her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed. Then he
carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to
her.
PHIL
What I was going to say was, I
think you're the kindest,
sweetest, prettiest, most
wonderful girl I ever met in my
life.
She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep.
PHIL
Shhhh. That's good.
(satisfied she's still
ASLEEP)
I could never tell you this, but
from the first minute I looked at
you I wanted to just hold you
close and be with you forever.
iEverytime I -saw you around the
station, I thought my heart was
going to explode. I used to
dream about us being together.
In my dream you loved me as much
as I loved you and we didn't have
to say anything but I knew you
understood everything.
She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep
sleep.
PHIL
I know a guy like me could never
deserve to have someone like you,
but if I did, I swear I would
love you for the rest of my life.
Rita opens her eyes.
RITA
(HALF-ASLEEP)
Did you say something?
PHIL
Good-night, Rita.
He kisses her gently on the forehead.
RITA
Good-night, Phil.
-98-
C LOSE UP - THE CLOCK
The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing.
Phil wakes up alone in bed. He lies there for a moment then
leaps out of bed like a man reborn and heads straight for the
shower.
CUT TO:
Phil enters the library, approaches the Librarian.
PHIL
Where would I find the Philosophy
section?
LIBRARIAN
Down and to the left, 600's.
Phil walks through the stacks, past the groundhog window.
CUT TO:
Phil walks happily down the hallway. He passes the chubby man.
CHUBBY MAN
Morning.
PHIL
Buon Giorno, signore.

CHUBBY MAN
Think it ' 11 be an early Spring?
PHIL
"Winter slumbering in the open
air wears on his smiling face a
dream of Spring."
CHUBBY MAN
Oh.
CUT TO :
Phil and Mary are sitting together at the piano. Phil is
playing, poorly.
MARY
Not bad, Mr. Connors. You say
this is your first lesson?
PHIL
Technically, yes.
Phil plays on, definitely improving.
CUT TO:
-101-
We see several cuts of Phil studying at the library.
SUPERED over these cuts is a calendar with the pages flipping
by. They all read "February 2 . "
CUT TO:
Phil is playing the piano with ever increasing skill as more
February 2 calendar pages flip by.
CUT TO:
Phil is sitting on the piano bench with Mary, playing pretty
well. Mary is astonished.
MARY
How long have you been studying,
Mr. Connors?
PHIL
One day. I'm gifted.
CUT TO:
A nurse approaches Phil.
NURSE
You the one brought in the old
man?
-105-
PHIL
How is he?
NURSE
He passed away just now.
Phil pauses for a long moment.
PHIL
What'd he die of?
NURSE
(SHRUGS)
He was just old. It was his
time.
PHIL
I want to see his chart. Excuse
me.
Phil brushes past her and makes for the big double doors
leading to triage.
NURSE
Sir, you can't --
(hurrying after him)
Look! Some people just die!
PHIL
Not on my watch.
CUT TO:
Phil is propping up the old man at a table, trying to feed him
hot soup.
CUT TO:
Phil is furiously looking over X-rays, flipping through medical
journals and making notes.
CUT TO:
Phil enters the crowded restaurant and pushes past all the
people waiting to be seated. He walks casually but quickly and
purposefully around the tables, squeezing past busy waitresses
and seated patrons toward a commotion in the back of the
restaurant.
TWO BUSINESSMEN are leaning over a THIRD.
BUSINESSMAN
Oh, my God! He's having a heart
attack!
SECOND BUSINESSMAN
Lay him down!
-108-
BUSINESSMAN
What do I do? He's not
BREATHING1
SECOND BUSINESSMAN
He's turning blue! Help!
Phil walks straight up to the BLUE-FACED MAN, grabs him from
behind, gets him in the Heimlich grip and squeezes sharply.
A bolus of food flies across the room. The victim coughs and
sputters, then starts breathing again.
FIRST BUSINESSMAN
Jerry, you okay?
SECOND BUSINESSMAN
I think that did it.
Phil lets go of the grateful victim.
PHIL
If you're going to eat steak, get
better teeth, will you? Enjoy
the rest of your lunch, gents.
He exits.
JERRY
Wow. Who was that guy?
Phil gets to the door and finds Rita standing there, looking at
him in awe.
PHIL
Rita!
.RITA
(CONFRONTING)
-Okay, hold it right there. I
want to know what' s going on and
I want to know right now.
PHIL
I'm sorry, I'm really pressed
right now. Meet me outside the
hospital about 5:00 and we'll
talk about it.
RITA
The hospital?
Phil looks at his watch and rushes away.
PHIL
Try the curlycue fries. Killer.
CUT TO:
-109-
A gurney bursts through the double doors, paramedics and nurses
in attendance. The patient is a teenage girl, JANEY, totally
unconscious.
The gurney is wheeled into the surgery.
NURSE
Looks like insulin shock. She's
probably diabetic.
Phil enters wearing a doctor's scrub suit and begins barking
orders.
PHIL
She's not diabetic. It's an
overdose. Let's get her up here
and pump her stomach, then I want
a complete blood work-up, STAT.
NURSE
R i g h t , Doctor--uh--
She realizes she's never seen him before.
PHIL
Call me Phil.
NURSE
Phil. Like the groundhog?
PHIL
Exactly.
CUT TO:
Sick CHILDREN in hospital gowns are gathered around Phil,
laughing and squealing. Phil is. making balloon animals.
KID
Make a giraffe!
PHIL
A giraffe? Let's see. It's just
like a dog with a biiiiig-- what
was it?
ALL THE KIDS
Neck!
-110-
PHIL
A big tail? Okay, a big tail.
KIDS
Neck! A big neck!
Phil makes an animal really quickly.
Rita watches from the doorway, unseen by Phil.
PHIL
There. A dog with long legs.
KIDS
Nooo ! Long neck !
PHIL
Oh! Right! A dog with a big
head.
KIDS
Noooo!
The kids attack Phil. Lots of rolling around on the bed. Rita
watches, completely enthralled.
Finally, Phil extricates himself and exits to find Rita
waiting.
RITA
All right, now what's going on?
PHIL
(taking her arm)
Come on. We have to hurry.
CUT TO:
EXT . RESIDENTIAL STREET - A LITTLE LATER
Phil rushes down the sidewalk with Rita close behind him. He
stops under a tree and puts his arms out just as a YOUNG BOY
falls out of the tree and into his arms, knocking him to the
ground. The kid runs off unhurt as Phil gets back to his feet
and brushes himself off.
PHIL
(to Rita)
That little bastard has never
thanked me once . I ought to j ust
let him fall. Teach him a
lesson.
RITA
Phil, this is too -- I must be
dreaming.
-1 1-

PHIL
Yeah, you and me both. Come on,
We're almost done.
CUT TO:
As Phil and Rita enter there is music coming from a side room.
The black velvet announcement board proclaims: KLEISER-SCOTT
WEDDING.
CUT TO:
Phil and Rita walk into a banquet room decorated with
streamers, balloons and flowers. There is a long buffet table
and a punch bowl. Another long table is loaded with wedding
gifts. A small band is playing.
People are dancing. The wedding party is dressed in rented
tuxedos and appropriately pouffy bridesmaid dresses.
RITA
This is incredible. Who's
wedding is this?
-113-
Phil grabs two glasses of champagne and hands one to Rita.
PHIL
Just some friends. Dorisi
The bride, DORIS, young and cheery, is on her way to see Phil.
She is dragging FRED, her groom, with her.
DORIS
Hi, Mr. Connors! Come ON,
Freddy.
FRED
Hi.
DORIS
This is the guy I told you about.
FRED
No way!
PHIL
How's it going, Fred?
FRED
Hey, I ' d like to thank you for
making Doris go through with
this.
PHIL
Are you kidding? Don't buy that
playing hard to get stuff. She's
crazy about you, you stud.
DORIS
I ' m really glad you could come.
PHIL
Congratulations.
Phil reaches into his pocket, pulls out two tickets and hands
them to Doris.
DORIS
What is this? Oh, no way! No
way! Ahhh!
Doris throws herself on Fred and jumps up and down. Fred grabs
the tickets.
FRED
Wrestlemania! No way! No way!
Doris throws herself on Phil.
DORIS
How did you know?
-114-
FRED
We're like going to be in
Pittsburgh anyway.
PHIL
I don't know. I just thought
about you two, tried to picture
what you ' d want more than
anything in the world and it came
to me. Bing! Wrestlemania.
FRED
Thanks, Mr. Connors. You're a
real pal.
DORIS
This is the best!
Doris gives Phil a kiss. She and Fred move on.
RITA
I don ' t understand . You rush
from one person to the next in a
town you only visit once a year,
you know everything before it
happens , and you -- - I don ' t know ,
you seem to be Punxsutawney ' s
leading citizen.
The band finishes a set. The guests stop dancing and head for
the refreshments. Phil and Rita are left alone for the moment
PHIL
What do you want to know?
RITA
Who are you?
PHIL
I really don't know.
RITA
No, there's something going on
with you.
PHIL
Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney
on February second -- every day.
It's supernatural. I don't even
try to explain it anymore. So,
I live each day as if it's the
only day I've got.
Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only
good, true things.
RITA
That's pretty amazing. "
-115-
PHIL
You want to know what's really
amazing? I've been waiting for
you every day for ten thousand
years. I dream of you every
night of my life. You've been my
constant weapon against total
despair, and just knowing you
exist has kept me alive. How's
that?
Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing
anybody has ever said to anybody.
Mary the piano teacher notices Phil.
MARY
Phil!
(to her friend)
This is the guy.
PHIL
Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one
of Punxsey's finest musicians.
MARY
Give me a break. You should
talk. Why don't you play
something?
PHIL
N o , I--
MARY
Please.
FRED
Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it.
Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs.
Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. He begins
to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone falls
silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears.
Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil
transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.
Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in,
everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance.
An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up
a storm.
LEO
That's a great guy you've got
there. Doctor Connors fixed my
back, you know.
- -116-
RITA
Do ctor Connors?
Rit a looks over at Phil, joyously playing the piano.
CUT TO:
EXT . STREET - NIGHT
It is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm
in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita.
She looks like an angel.
PHIL
Wait! Don't move!
Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously,
joyously, then rolling it into a large ball.
RITA
Making a snow man? I'll help.
PHIL
No, stay there. Stand right
th ere.
Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on
a mailbox. Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER
Phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model
a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look
o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work.
RITA
Can I look?
PHIL
O kay, look.
It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as
alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.
RITA
(OVERWHELMED)
Nobody's ever done this for me.
Not even a drawing. It's
beautiful.
-117-
PHIL
This is how I see you. When it
all gets too much, I just close
my eyes and there you are-- just
like this. Take it home and keep
it in the freezer.
Rita embraces Phil. They are about to kiss, looking deep into
each others eyes.
PHIL
This one's for the Frog Prince.
RITA
What?
PHIL
Nothing.
They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.
PHIL
Will you come with me?
Rita nods. They continue standing there, embracing, warming
each other in the cold night air.
RITA
(looks back at the ice
SCULPTURE)
We're just going to leave her?
PHIL
It doesn't matter. Really, it
doesn't.
They kiss again.
CUT TO:
CLOSE UP - THE CLOCK
The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00. Silence.
No Sonny and Cher, no deejays-- nothing.
Phil sits up in bed. He looks around the room. Things are
different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed
now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep
under the covers.
PHIL
(DISBELIEVING)
It's not true. It's not. It
can't be true. Rita? Rita!
-118-
RITA
(STRETCHING
LUXURIOUSLY)
Mmmm. Morning.
Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with kisses.
PHIL
You're here! My god! I can't
believe you're here!
RITA
Glad to see you, too.
PHIL
No! It's happened. Don't you
get it? It's tomorrow! It's --
Phil turns on the radio.
DEEJAY
. . . still shoveling put the
highways, but if you're walking,
it's a beautiful day.
S IDEKICK
Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned
e ve r yt h in g up--
DEEJAY
--except your mouth.
Phil kisses the radio.
PHIL
I love those guys.
RITA
Are you always this jolly in the
morning?
Phil runs to the window and looks out.
HIS POV - THE STREET
The street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up. Kids
are throwing snowballs.
PHIL
No groundhog! Rita! They're all
gone!
RITA
You must've had some dream.
Phil stops, thinks.
-1 1 9 -
PHIL
Did I just dream it?
Phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only
pajama bottoms.
RITA
Phi l? Phil!
Rita sits up in bed and waits. Suddenly, from somewhere else
in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the piano expertly
playing a difficult classical piece. He stops after a few
bars.
PHIL (O.C.)
Yeah!!!!
Phil runs back into the room.
PHIL
It really happened! You're
really here!
He pounces on Rita again.
PHIL
You're really actually here.
RITA
(LAUGHING)
I'm here, I'm here!
They kiss, passionately, hungrily.
PHIL
Let's go!
He scoops her up in his arms.
RITA
Where're we going?
PHIL
Anywhere! Everywhere!
CUT TO:
Phil and Rita, dressed now, enter and encounter Mrs. Lancaster
Phil hugs her.
MRS. LANCASTER
Oh, my!
-120-
PHIL
Florence! Say hello to Rita.
She loves me.
MRS. LANCASTER
I'm not surprised.
He kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with Rita.
