       I require little rest, Captain. 
       I would prefer to commence our 
       mission. 
 
     Picard and Riker share a glance -- "pushy little guy, 
     isn't he?" 
 
 
     Worf crosses to Data. 
 
         WORF 
       Despite their reputations, this 
       Zakdorn does not appear to be a 
       very formidable warrior. 
 
         DATA 
       In the game of military 
       brinksmanship, individual 
       physical prowess is less 
       important than the perception of 
       a species as a whole. For over 
       nine millennia potential foes have 
       regarded the Zakdorns as having 
       the greatest innately strategic 
       minds in the galaxy. 
 
         WORF 
       And no one is willing to test that 
       perception in combat. 
 
         DATA 
       Exactly. 
 
         WORF 
       Then the reputation means nothing. 
 
 
     A magnificent view of the galaxy surrounds them as they 
     take their seats at one end of the table. Kolrami keys 
     the screen, and the DIAGRAM of a solar system appears.

       The Braslota System. In orbit 
       around the second planet is the 
       eighty-year old Starcruiser, 
       Hathaway. 
        (nodding at Riker) 
       He is still your choice? 
 
         PICARD 
       Commander Riker will captain the 
       Hathaway. 
 
         KOLRAMI 
        (to Riker) 
       You will have forty-eight hours 
       to ready the vessel before the 
       Enterprise attacks. 
 
         RIKER 
       And we'll be experiencing actual 
       battle conditions? 
 
         KOLRAMI 
       Correct. Engineering will 
       disconnect the Enterprise's 
       weapons and link the system with 
       the modified laser-pulse beam. 
       All "hits" will be recorded 
       electronically. If the computer 
       registers "damage," it will react 
       accordingly -- shutting down the 
       affected areas for the appropriate 
       "repair" time. Additional 
       questions? 
 
     Riker and Picard share a look and shake their heads. 
 
         KOLRAMI 
       Captain Picard, I understand that 
       you initially resisted Starfleet's 
       request for this simulation.

       Yes.

       In a crisis situation, it is

         RIKER 
       I still prefer brains over brawn. 
        (to Kolrami) 
       I think it's a waste of 
       effort to test our combat skills 
       -- it's a minor province in the 
       make-up of a starship captain. 
 
         KOLRAMI 
       Your objection is noted. Let us 
       hope your distaste for the 
       exercise will not affect your 
       strategic abilities. 
 
     There is a moment as Riker absorbs the words and the 
     underlying contempt with which they were delivered. 
 
         RIKER 
       Mister Kolrami, when I agree to 
       do a thing. I do it. 
        (to Picard, lighter) 
       Care to surrender now, Captain? 
 
     Picard gives Riker a warm, small smile, then looks to

     FADE IN: 
 
 
     Picard, Riker, Data, PULASKI, and Kolrami are 
     present. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops. Burke at 
     Tactical. 
 
         PICARD 
       Well, Number One, you are allowed 
       a complement of forty. Select 
       whom you will. Save Data, who 
       will serve as my first officer 
       in your absence. 
 
     Before Riker can respond, Kolrami jumps in -- leaving 
     Pulaski slightly taken aback by his rudeness. 
 
         KOLRAMI 
        (to Picard) 
       I had envisioned you defining the 
       crew. 
 
         PICARD 
       On my ship, the leader of an away 
       team has total control of the 
       mission. If you want to judge 
       "leadership" -- why not start at 
       the beginning? 
 
     Kolrami sagaciously nods his assent, eyeing Picard as 
     if he, too, were under scrutiny. 
 
         KOLRAMI 
       Very well, Captain. 
 
     With a curt bow, he glides to the turbolift and 
     disappears.

       The Zakdornian culture is replete 
       with self-assuredness and 
       confidence. It is seldom 
       undeserved. For example, Kolrami 
       is a third level grand master at 
       the game of Strategema. 
 
     Fine, but it doesn't make Pulaski feel any better.

         RIKER 
       You've heard of the simulation 
       aboard the Hathaway? 
 
     As they talk, Goerdi takes Riker on a walking tour of 
     Engineering, checking "this" here, tweaking "that" 
     there. 
 
         GEORDI 
       Yes, sir, and the best of luck 
       to you. I've researched the old 
       Avidyne engines -- archaic by our 
       standards, very touchy. 
 
         RIKER 
       Anticipating the worst, do you 
       think it can be whipped into shape 
       in forty-eight hours?

       a few necessities. 
 
     At this, Riker breaks into a grin, also. 
 
 
     The room has been modified into a Klingon haven. The 
     lighting is subdued with a ruddy overtones. There is 
     a powerful scupture of a Klingon man, bare to the waist

     two twisted horns springing from above each eye.

       Forever curious, this urge to 
       "compete." 
 
         PULASKI 
       It's a human response, that inborn 
       craving to gauge your capabilities 
       through conflict. 
 
         DATA 
       Doctor, there are other ways to 
       challenge oneself. 
 
         PULASKI 
       Perhaps... but they all lack a 
       certain -- thrill! 
 
         TROI 
       Data, sometimes humans find it 
       helpful to have an outsider set

         WORF 
       With my knowledge of the 
       Enterprise's security override, 
       we may be able to convince the 
       sensors that an enemy ship is 
       approaching. Their instruments 
       would "lie" to them. 
 
         RIKER 
       If you can pull that off, Mister 
       Worf, it might just give us the 
       edge we're looking for. 
 
         NAGEL 
       But what about the viewscreen? 
 
         WORF 
       If I am successful, the computer 
       will project a false image of the 
       enemy ship on the main viewscreen.

       The lining is still smooth, and 
       we ought to be able to do 
       something with the dilithium chips 
       we scavenged.

       him anyway -- he is just a 
       non-commissioned child. 
 
     Though irritated, Picard holds his tongue -- 
 
     CONTAINMENT DEVICE 
 
     The magnetic chamber is round, about the size of a 
     human head -- a clear orb with a snowball-sized piece 
     of anti-matter suspended in the center. Long, 
     intricately-cabled pieces of clear tubing extend out 
     from opposite sides of the orb -- generating the force 
     which keeps the anti-matter from escaping and wreaking 
     havoc. Attached to the end of the tubes are 
     finger-friendly handles. 
 
     TWO VERY CAREFUL HANDS now wrap themselves around these 
     grips. WIDEN to reveal Wesley -- in the company of 
     Ensign Burke -- delicately maneuvering the orb from 
     his personal experimental station. 
 
     Throughout this scene Wesley is talking just a little 
     too much. Nervous chatter as he tries to cover that 
     he's doing a naughty. Burke is equally anxious to be 
     back on the bridge.

       within it during a battle 
       simulation. And as a lieutenant 
       aboard the Potemkin, his solution

       implementation is off by a 
       millisecond, the Hathaway will 
       not survive. 
 
         GEORDI 
       Data, that's the one part of this 
       plan that we're all absolutely 
       sure about. 
 
     Linger for a moment on the concerned faces. 
 
     (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY) 
 
     Everybody has settled down into their positions. 
 
         PICARD 
       Are we ready, Number One? 
 
     Both Data, to Picard's right, and Riker respond. 
 
                   DATA                       RIKER'S COM VOICE 
              Ready, Captain.            Ready, Captain. 
 
     Everybody pauses to smile. 
 
         PICARD 
       Good luck to both of you. 
        (beat; to Burke) 
       Bractor. 
 
     The viewscreen fills with the sneering Bractor and 
     tactician. 
 
         BRACTOR 
       I will wait no longer, Picard. 
 
         PICARD 
       You needn't, Bractor. The answer 
       -- is "no." 
        (beat) 
       Your actions have been wholly 
       criminal, and you will not profit 
       by them. 
 
         BRACTOR 
       You are a fool. 
 
         TACTICIAN 
       How can you stop us? 
 
         PICARD 
       You feel the Hathaway has value? 
       Well, I deny you your prize.

        (to Burke) 
       Fire! 
 
     (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY) 
 
     Bractor is barely-controlled raw fury on the viewer. 
 
         TACTICIAN 
       Destroy your own rather than 
       endure the ignominy of defeat and 
       capture? 
 
         BRACTOR 
       I did not think the Federation 
       had such iron. 
 
         PICARD 
       You had no claim to that ship -- 
       it was ours to destroy. 
 
         BRACTOR 
       As you are ours to destroy! 
 
         PICARD 
        (unperturbed) 
       You can try. 
 
         TACTICIAN 
       Enterprise targeted, Leader. 
        (a long beat then with 
         stunned alarm) 
       Leader! There is another 
       Federation ship closing -- a 
       starship! 
 
         BRACTOR 
       Maximum shields! We've been 
       outmaneuvered. Retreat! 
 
     The image of Bractor on the Main Viewer is replaced 
     by the Kreechta, which almost instantly bolts into the 
     Ferengi version of warp nine, and is absolutely gone!

         BURKE 
       Captain, our sensors show no 
       Federation starship nearby. 
 
         RIKER'S COM VOICE 
       Of course not, Mister Burke. That 
       was Klingon guile. 
 
     Great relief as the Main Viewer reveals Riker on 
     the Hathaway bridge. 
 
         PICARD 
       You made it, Number One. Smooth 
       ride? 
 
     On the screen, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Wesley and Nagel 
     share a look -- it was obviously a bitch! 
 
         RIKER 
        (wryly) 
       Different! 
 
         PICARD 
       We'll lock on and pick you up. 
 
         RIKER 
       With pleasure. 
 
     The viewscreen returns to the Hathaway in space. 
     Picard turns to Kolrami. 
 
         KOLRAMI 
        (begrudgingly) 
       I must admit -- your Commander 
       Riker has acquitted himself 
       quite... admirably. 
 
     Picard's look and silence is all "I-told-you-so."

       Thank you, Mister Kolrami.

       Initiate recovery procedures, 
       continue repairs, plot a course
