Like an intricate ballet, Jacob, his body strapped to his
chair, tumbles away from the DC-10 and 747 as they seem to
merge and bend into some kind of mutant DC-47 - wings and
tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a
flower and together they EXPLODE - a fiery ball lighting the
nighttime clouds and Jacob's shrieking face.
And Jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking
straight up from the blasting wind.
That's when CORPSES start falling past him.
The captain of
the plane - the stewardess, her body bent in half - the
greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand.
More men, women, crew people - and CHILDREN.
But these children aren't dead bodies.
Two LITTLE GIRLS and
one LITTLE BOY, all dressed in white, plummet down next to
Jacob, head first, like high divers.
And they're singing:
THE CHILDREN
One two, Freddy's coming for you...
The children turn around in the sky so that they are
travelling feet first.
The Little Boy's pants puff up and
the Girls' skirts poof out and RIP UPWARD - the wind taking
away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their
hair...
THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
Three four, better lock your door...
Leaving three tiny SKELETONS - taunting and laughing as Jacob
screams and covers his eyes.
THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
Five six, grab your crucifix...
And the Skeletons sprout wings - leathery and veiny - the
wind catching them and sending them up and away as their
voices echo in the sky.
THE CHILDREN (cont'd)
Seven eight, gonna stay up late...
Jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to
frantically pull on his seat belt.
SNAP - it flies off his
back and miraculously turns into a PARACHUTE.
Rope swirls
into the air - the wind grabs the canvas - and Jacob's body
slows with a violent jerk.
But at least he's not falling anymore.
Jacob catches his
breath as he starts gently floating through the sky.
He
smiles.
This isn't so bad.
This is actually kind of fun.
Not for long, though, because his new upward momentum carries
him back up to:
The winged children's Skeletons.
Jacob's eyes bug out as he
rises into them and they start to circle.
They move closer
and we can see something in their hands:
SCISSORS
Jacob twists his body, trying to steer his parachute away
from the demons.
One of the Skeletons swoops up to his face
and pokes its scissors inches away from Jacob's eyes.
It
sings alone:
CHILD
Nine ten, never sleep again!
The Skeleton cranks its arm back - ready to plunge the
scissor's blades into Jacob's sockets.
The arms swings
toward him - then suddenly diverts up past his head, heading
for:
THE CHUTE'S STRINGS
The Skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one
of the ropes.
The other two Skeletons join it over Jacob's
head.
The three of them look down at Jacob, their boney jaws
in a perpetual smile.
JACOB
No!
The Skeletons nod "yes".
SNIP - SNIP - SNIP - they cut away
at Jacob's parachute as he swings underneath them, trying to
pull away - SNIP - SNIP.
The parachute flutters away - the Skeletons cackle - and
Jacob plummets.
ON JACOB
We stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the
clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him.
The
ground becomes a town, the town becomes a block, the block
becomes a house, the house becomes a roof, and...
Smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth.
Splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant
toothpicks.
Some of the toothpicks start to move.
Jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped,
battered and, unfortunately, alive.
He climbs up to the edge
of the crater.
He looks back a the remnants of his home.
Then something starts to happen.
Something his growing from the crater - spreading out.
It's
not a cloud, it's not smoke - it's a DARKNESS.
Even though
it's night, this darkness is darker.
It creeps out from the
hole - fingers of blackness reaching out.
What it covers
doesn't disappear.
It becomes GLOOMY.
The shroud is getting
bigger.
And it's getting faster.
Jacob runs.
WITH JACOB - RUNNING
He bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic.
He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its
gloominess covering houses.
Then whole blocks.
Everything it touches seems to fall deeper into SHADOW.
AT THE STREET CORNER
Jacob comes across a WOMAN walking her dog.
He stops and
yells at her.
JACOB
Get the hell out of here!
It's coming!
WOMAN
What's coming?
Jacob points down the street.
The shroud is swooping down
the road - browning out street lights in its wake.
And the
woman doesn't find anything threatening about this.
Jacob
screams at her.
JACOB
Don't you see it?
WOMAN
See what?
And it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything.
The Woman is
totally oblivious to the danger.
Jacob shakes his head --
stumbles away.
The woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER.
She sighs.
And begins to MUTATE.
Her hair gets scraggly, her skin
bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which
she DOESN'T seem to notice.
She just shrugs her twisted shoulders.
WOMAN (cont'd)
Kids...watcha gonna do?
She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and
two heads.
BACK WITH JACOB - RUNNING
Like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets
passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become
passively accepting monsters.
A VOICE booms out from nowhere.
FREDDY (O.S.)
Jacob!
You're too old to run away from
home!
Jacob covers his ears and races out of town.
Jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town.
He
rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him.
most of the town
is covered in an opaque gloom.
Suddenly a CACKLING sound is heard and Jacob turns to its
source:
HIS POV: THE SPRINGWOOD SIGN
The town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over
almost all of it now.
The sign reads: WELCOME TO SPRINGWOOD.
POPULATION...
And the numbers after the word "population" are changing.
They're counting BACKWARDS, clattering away like an old-time
gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the
"thousands" digit disappears, then the "hundreds", then
"tens", then...
CLINK - the count stops at "1".
Springwood is entirely
engulfed in the shroud.
There is a pause.
CRASH - the sign is violently YANKED into the ground.
It
vanishes into the earth and a CRACK APPEARS at the edge of
the road. The crack grows - moving out to the center of the
highway.
BACK ON THE STREET
Jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of
the street and a GURGLING sound starts to build.
The tar in
front of Jacob becomes molten.
It bubbles and pops.
Jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from
boiling asphalt.
It's a hat.
The hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. A left
hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it.
Four sharp
blades jut out of the muck on the other side.
A head is up
now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat -
hiding the face.
The body beneath the head ascends.
The
veil of asphalt parts:
It's FREDDY KRUEGER.
Jacob SCREAMS.
Freddy LAUGHS.
He shakes off his layer of tar and looks
towards the clouded town of Springwood.
A look of pure
hatred appears on his ragged face.
FREDDY
Payback time...
Freddy opens his mouth - lets out a large breath - and then
INHALES an even larger one.
A WINDSTORM starts, the source being Krueger's own lungs.
The gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding
Springwood.
Fingers of darkness pull up from the town and
towards Freddy's mouth -- and houses begin to DISSOLVE.
Freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop.
Krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body - and the
entire town of Springwood is going with it.
Trees,
buildings, cars, picket fences.
It's all crumbling and
fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in
the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into Freddy's mouth.
The vortex swirls into Krueger.
Then it's gone.
Nothing but
a vacant lot the size of a town remains.
Freddy turns to
Jacob and BURPS, it sounds like a THUNDERCLAP.
JACOB
No!
FREDDY
Don't worry, I have a strong stomach.
Freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater.
He pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts - and a
transparent stomach.
Inside the stomach: a black swirling mass.
Flashes of
houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible
anguish.
Freddy drops down his sweater.
FREDDY (cont'd)
Springwood is mine, boy!
JACOB
I dreamed you away before I was born!
Mom said you couldn't come back!
FREDDY
Is that true?
Then she told you all
about me, huh? Let's see what else she
has to say.
Freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his
feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out:
ALICE.
Jacob's mother.
Tar dripping down her body.
Krueger
has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her.
Jacob
gets up and runs toward him.
Freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and KICKS Jacob
back a good fifteen feet.
ALICE
Run, Jacob!
The boy rolls painful on the hard road.
He sits up and
screams:
JACOB
Leave her alone!
FREDDY
You're such a momma's boy!
Freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat,
then swoops the daggers towards Alice.
CLOSE ON JACOB
as OFF SCREEN we hear a horrible multiple GLITCH!
Jacob
shrieks in gut-wrenching anguish.
WIDE ON SCENE
We're far enough away so that we don't barf at the sight but
close enough to see that Freddy has impaled Alice's body on
his blades.
He lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp
figure RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD.
Krueger swings his arm out, shaking off Alice, sending her
flying over Jacob's head.
The body lands behind him.
ON JACOB
as he runs to his mother.
She VANISHES just as he reaches
out to touch her bloody body.
He turns to Krueger and raises
his fists.
A look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind,
insane anger.
He bellows:
JACOB
You fucker!
FREDDY
Springwood is only the beginning.
All I
need from you is a ride!
Suddenly, between Jacob and Freddy, three SHAFTS OF LIGHT
burst up from the road.
Three FIGURES appear as the light
dissipates.
They're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with
dark visors covering their faces.
One is large and muscular.
The one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under
her skin-tight outfit.
The third is a little smaller than
the other two with a slightly different face
that allows us
to see his mouth.
They're the DREAM POLICE.
Jacob doesn't know this yet, but
Freddy seems to.
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns
at the sight of these new apparitions.
Then he looks past them and smiles at Jacob.
FREDDY (cont'd)
See ya later!
Freddy violently DROPS down into the bubbling asphalt pit.
Two of the black figures start after him.
The third one
turns to Jacob as his partners leap into the hole after
Freddy.
The sound from his exposed mouth is DEAFENING!
SOUND COP
WAKE UP!
Jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly:
CUT TO:
Jacob's eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash.
He's lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal
position.
Jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up.
He
shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead - and that's when he
notices something in his hand.
INSERT: JACOB'S HAND
it's a bracelet, a simple band of gold with a larger plate in
the middle, like an ID band.
Jacob's fingers turn the plate
over. Printed on the other side is the name of the bracelet's
former owner: ALICE.
Jacob has a souvenir.
BACK TO JACOB
He raises his face and looks at the road in front of him.
It
goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty
fields.
This is where Springwood used to be.
A look of anguish
crosses Jacob's face as he stares at the desolation.
JACOB
Mom...
HONK!
SCREECH!
Jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van
blasting right at him.
He rolls off to the side of the road.
The truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in
its wake.
Jacob chokes on the dust.
He slowly recovers and looks back
down at the bracelet in his hand. He clenches his fist around
it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him.
He takes
a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks OUT OF FRAME.
ANGLE DOWN THE HIGHWAY
We can see a pickup truck in the distance. Jacob's HAND
ENTERS FRAME, thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet
dangling from his wrist.
The pickup truck starts to slow down.
A sprawling little community with pleasant streets and
cheerful houses.
It looks a lot like Springwood, the only
real difference being that it actually exists.
It also has a
sign: WELCOME TO ROSEDALE.
POPULATION: 8,786
A Volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of
blocks down the road from us.
Jacob steps out of the
passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye.
He
shuffles into town.
CLOSE ON YET ANOTHER SIGN
It reads: DRUG ADDICTS NOT WELCOME TO ROSEDALE!
The sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry
expression: MR. HOPKINS
MR. HOPKINS
Clean up your act somewhere else!
He walks along as we PULL BACK TO SEE
It's a nice-looking two-story house in the middle of a
usually quiet neighborhood.
Today the home is surrounded by
about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs: NO HALFWAY
HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!, DON'T LOWER OUR PROPERTY
VALUES!, and GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL!
The crowd mumbles
amongst itself, occasionally bursting out with a chant in
protest.
ON JACOB
We catch him walking down the sidewalk.
He tramps along with
his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the
pavement.
He looks like he hasn't slept in days.
The sound
of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention.
Jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young
girl standing behind a bush holding a BAG OF GROCERIES.
She
is KAREN MILLER, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a
faraway look in her eyes.
Jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a
zombie.
She doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks:
JACOB
What's going on?
KAREN
Free speech.
The right of assembly.
JACOB
What is this place?
KAREN
It's a home.
A foster home.
For
teenagers.
It's where you go when things
get bad.
It's the place to figure out
what to do next.
It's a home for kids
that no one else wants.
(beat)
It's MY home.
Karen hasn't looked at Jacob once.
She suddenly seems to
steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the
house.
Jacob is befuddled.
JACOB
Oh...
He stands there and watches.
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
Karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head
up, eyes staring forward.
The crowd parts ever so slightly
as the irked townsfolk start to heat up.
They have an actual
human to vent their anger on now.
Mr. Hopkins lays in on her
as she passes him.
MR. HOPKINS
Why can't you find somewhere else to
shack up?
Karen turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt.
KAREN
What have we ever done to you?
MR. HOPKINS
Nothing...YET.
Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler
head.
Her groceries tumble onto the grass.
A hand reaches
down to help her.
It's Jacob's.
He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr. Hopkins
looms above them.
Both angry and embarrassed now.
MR. HOPKINS (cont'd)
Look, we've been here for years.
This is
a quiet street.
We'd just like to keep
it that way.
Jacob can't take this guy anymore.
He stands up and faces
the older man with a scowl.
JACOB
Lighten up, mister.
MR. HOPKINS
(smirks)
And what gutter did you crawl out from,
kid?
(frowns)
We don't want your kind here.
JACOB
My kind?
What kind is that?
MR. HOPKINS
Drug addicts.
Dope pushers.
We have
stand up and take charge.
JACOB
Swell.
I've just got a couple of
questions for you...Do you love your
parents?
MR. HOPKINS
Of course I do...
JACOB
Are they alive?
MR. HOPKINS
My mother is.
JACOB
What's it like?
Jacob stares at Hopkins.
He doesn't answer.
He just huffs
and puffs as Karen grabs Jacob and pulls him up to the front
porch of the home, then into the floor.
We watch as various lit windows go dark and the residents of
the house go to bed.
Jacob walks out the door and closes it behind him.
He
crosses to the porch steps and stops.
He has to hold onto a
porch column just to keep standing.
Karen appears behind him.
Jacob jumps a bit.
KAREN
Where are you going?
JACOB
I'm leaving.
KAREN
Why?
JACOB
He can't hurt you if I'm gone.
Maybe
I'll go to the desert or something.
I'll
lie down in the middle of nowhere and
finally get some sleep.
Krueger can feed
of the dreams of snakes and vultures.
KAREN
Fine.
You're just going to take off
then...
Karen has an angry expression on his face.
Jacob gives her a
pained look.
JACOB
Don't do this to me.
I'm just trying to
protect you and the others.
KAREN
Right.
You blow into town and then blow
right out.
Terrific.
JACOB
I don't understand why you're so mad at
me.
KAREN
You just don't get it, do you?
JACOB
Get what?
Karen, though still very angry, looks like she's about to
cry.
Jacob, confused, sits down on the porch steps.
JACOB (cont'd)
Maybe I'm crazy.
KAREN
Running away doesn't help.
He sighs and smiles a bit.
JACOB
And you're going to convince me, huh?
KAREN
Maybe.
This time Karen smiles.
Jacob looks at her and sighs.
Then
he yawns.
KAREN (cont'd)
I'm going to make some coffee.
You
promise not to move?
JACOB
Yeah.
Sure.
Karen jumps and heads back into the house.
Jacob stares at
the grass in front of him, his eyes heavy.
JACOB'S POV - THE LAWN
A bush sits there doing nothing.
Until it suddenly comes TO
LIFE.
Its leaves start to shrivel, the lawn turns brown, the
sky turns dark.
Everything changes and turns into
DREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD
We're in a different front yard in a different town, in a
different dimension.
The mutant bush starts to change, sprout legs, grow arms,
become human.
ALICE
Her body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us.
ALICE
Jacob!
Help me!
She's fully formed now.
And Freddy bursts out from the
ground behind her.
He grabs Alice, reaches his knife arm
around
ALICE (cont'd)
No-o-o-o-o!
Her words are cut off as Krueger jams his blades in her gut
and we re-live her death once more.
But it's even worse this
time.
Blood POURS from Alice like a burst fire hydrant, spraying
and showering the entire nightmare lawn like a human
sprinkler.
Freddy LAUGHS.
FREDDY
Say it, don't spray it, huh, Jacob?
Come
and join the fun!
JACOB (O.S.)
NOOOOOOO!
Jacob's voice rips through the scene as everything starts to
BLUR RED.
Jacob is lying in the grass, violently shaking.
Karen drops
down next to him.
KAREN
Jacob!
JACOB
Nooooo!
His body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an
epileptic seizure.
He SHRIEKS, ignoring Karen completely,
and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake.
Like
he's never going to stop.
We're directly across the street from the Foster Home as
Jacob's cries echo through the neighborhood.
Mr. Hopkins
opens the front door.
He sees what's going on, scowls, and
yells into his house.
MR. HOPKINS
I told you!
It's an overdose!
Jesus
Christ, I saw this coming.
Call 9-1-1!
He watches the commotion growing across the street, and never
once moves to help.
Jacob is being strapped into a stretcher, babbling
incoherently.
The residents of the Foster Home stand off to
the side while neighbors gawk from the street.
Karen is next
to the AMBULANCE GUYS looking frantic.
JACOB
No!
Don't let them take me!
KAREN
Jacob, it'll be alright.
AMBULANCE GUY #1
Calm down, kid.
We'll take care of you.
Jacob grabs the Ambulance Guy.
JACOB
You don't understand!
Let me go!
The ambulance guy straps Jacob's arm down.
Mr. Ross grabs
Karen and pulls her away as they start loading the crazed
teenager into the ambulance.
Scott shakes his head.
Wesley
looks terrified.
Gina keeps her distance from any human.
Karen can't take it and runs into the house.
Mr. Ross
frowns.
DAVID
This is just what we need.
The ambulance drives away as the gathered crowd stares at the
kids angrily.
The ambulance zooms by.
All is quiet for a second until
CRASH! A twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk
and settles at an ugly angle.
It's an ELM ST. sign.
WE START on WESLEY'S BODY.
Eyes closed, head normal and
everything from the neck down charred mass of burnt torso,
shriveled limbs, all wrapped in the scorched blanket.
ZIP.
A body bag hides this ghastly image from us as we PULL BACK.
A FIRE MARSHALL and a COP are talking at the doorway in the
background.
The CORONER is here, a world weary seen-it-all
older guy, with his nervous ASSISTANT who's never seen
anything like this.
They whisper their conversation as they
lift the body bag onto a stretcher.
ASSISTANT
I don't get it.
The couch is barely
scorched.
And how can he burn from just
the neck down?
CORONER
It happens.
ASSISTANT
It happens?
That's your explanation?
CORONER
I've seen worse.
We FOLLOW them as they push the stretcher towards the
doorway.
ASSISTANT
What?
What worse?
CORONER
Never mind.
Our shot STOPS at the doorway with the fire Marshall and cop
while the wigged-out assistant's voice trails off outside.
ASSISTANT
No.
I wanna know.
Really.
What could
be worse than...
FIRE MARSHALL
You know what the gossip rags are going
to say?
Spontaneous human combustion.
COP
What's that?
FIRE MARSHALL
That's where bodies are supposed to go up
in smoke for no reason.
It's all psychic
bullshit.
What really happened is called
the candle effect.
A tiny fire gets
started, usually from a cigarette.
It
slowly smolders through the blanket and
clothes until the skin starts to actually
bake.
The body fat begins to melt and
liquefy, fueling the fire like a slow
burning candle.
It takes hours, but it's
real.
The cop makes some notes.
Behind them we see Scott, Karen
and Gina.
The girls have been crying, and even tough-guy
Scott looks pretty screwed up by all this.
The cop nods.
COP
He fell asleep while smoking.
What a
waste.
The kids shoot unbelieving looks at each other as the two men
walk off.
SCOTT
That's impossible.
Scott and Karen head for the front door.
A coroner's van, a fire chief's car and the now familiar mob
of suspicious neighbors are gathered around the front of the
house as the stretcher with Wesley's body is put away.
A
small van marked ROSEDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL pulls up and Jacob
jumps out of it.
Jacob's face turns grim as a tearful Karen runs up to him,
Scott following.
JACOB
Who?
KAREN
Wes...
JACOB
Oh my God.
It's started.
SCOTT
He fucking burned alive.
KAREN
They said he fell asleep smoking.
SCOTT
And we all know that can't be.
JACOB
I already told you how it would happen.
Mr. Ross appears behind the three teenagers, a wasted look on
his face.
SCOTT
Don't start with that shit.
JACOB
It's not shit.
DAVID
C'mon, kids.
Everyone inside.
Now.
David leads them back to the house as the coroner's van pulls
away.
Jacob and Karen sit on the steps.
Across the street we can
see window curtains part as Mr. Hopkins sneaks a wary peek.
KAREN
They're going to use all this to shut us
down.
JACOB
I know.
It's my fault.
KAREN
You going to try to run away again?
JACOB
It's too late for that. I have to stay
and try and put a stop to it.
KAREN
I'm sorry.
It's all so hard to accept.
JACOB
I wish I could convince you of the danger
you and the others are in.
KAREN
I've been in danger before. THAT I can
handle.
JACOB
This is worse than anything you can
imagine.
KAREN
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Come
on.
Let's go inside.
She stands up.
Shafts of sunlight filter through as leaves flutter down from
the towering trees and Jacob and Karen step out of the
bedroom door.
KAREN
I don't believe it.
JACOB
It's true.
We're really doing it.
KAREN
But what if I'm just dreaming of you
telling me that?
JACOB
We'll compare notes when we wake up.
Then you'll know.
Karen looks around.
Then she giggles.
She likes this a lot.
Karen suddenly runs away into the trees like an excited
little girl.
Jacob frowns.
JACOB (cont'd)
Karen.
Wait.
He heads off after her.
AMONGST THE TREES
Jacob runs.
Karen jumps out from behind a tree and laughs.
JACOB (cont'd)
You have to be careful.
KAREN
Did you bring us here on purpose?
Can
you go anywhere you want?
JACOB
Sometimes.
It's not as easy as linking
up, though.
KAREN
Wow, I never knew...
She starts wandering off again.
Jacob follows her.
KAREN (cont'd)
You know what I like to do in my dreams?
She ducks behind a tree.
And comes out suddenly dressed as a
sharp BUSINESSWOMAN.
Jacob is slightly taken aback.
KAREN (cont'd)
I like to be other people!
Jacob grins as she steps behind another tree - and a FIREMAN
walks out in her place.
Jacob is really taken aback this
time.
KAREN (cont'd) (as fireman)
I can be anybody I want.
JACOB
Show off.
Karen slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall
VOLUPTUOUS REDHEAD.
KAREN (AS REDHEAD)
When things get bad it helps to be
someone else.
I use it to protect
myself.
The redhead walks seductively towards Jacob.
He raises his
eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him - her ample
cleavage inches away from his nose.
KAREN (cont'd) (as redhead)
What do you think?
JACOB
I think I like you the way you always
are.
He smiles.
DIFFERENT ANGLE
And now Karen is herself again.
They're still very close.
JACOB (cont'd)
Much better.
They look like they're about to kiss... but Karen suddenly
sees something that grabs her attention.
KAREN
Look!
Jacob turns as Karen runs over to ANOTHER DOOR.
It's not the
one to the bedroom.
It just hangs there in space between two
trees.
KAREN (cont'd)
I wonder where it goes?
She reaches for the knob and opens it.
JACOB
Karen, no!
But she's already stepped through.
Jacob runs up to the
doorway and it SLAMS in his face.
Jacob tries to open the
door.
It doesn't budge.
He keeps twisting the knob to no
effect.
JACOB (cont'd)
Karen!
Jacob starts to pound on the door as we:
CUT TO:
Mr. and Mrs. Ross are getting into their car.
The engine
starts and they drive away.
The coroner's back, the neighborhood gawks.
Jacob, Karen and
Scott sit on the front steps in a daze.
But this time there are police barricades up.
In another
part of the front yard we can see Mr. and Mrs. Ross with a
social worker, MR. SILVERMAN.
Mary Ross is crying while her
husband David is having a heated argument with Silverman.
The kids watch on gloomily.
The social worker leaves as Mr. Ross walks over to the kids.
Mary walks right by them and into the house - to broken up
over something to talk.
DAVID
Pack your bags, kids.
JACOB
You're kicking us out?
DAVID
No.
They're taking you away.
They say
it's for your own good.
KAREN
They can't do that.
DAVID
Yes, they can.
They consider Mary and I
possibly unfit to act as foster parents.
They're going to find temporary homes for
you until this mess is straightened out.
I'm so very sorry.
Karen runs up to David and hugs him desperately.
He holds
her.
KAREN
No, please.
DAVID
They're not calling it an accident this
time.
They don't really know what to
call it.
Karen lets go.
Scott stands up.
SCOTT
What's going to happen to us?
DAVID
You'll be alright.
KAREN
What's going to happen to you?
DAVID
I don't know.
They're thinking of
pressing charges.
JACOB
Aw, Jesus...
DAVID
Come on.
A car from juvenile hall will
be here in an hour.
He leads them up the stairs.
A sign reads: ROSEDALE YOUTH CENTER.
Jacob is sitting on a bench looking like a beaten man and
hating himself for it.
Karen and Scott step out of a door.
They watch him for a few
seconds.
Then Karen walks towards Jacob.
Scott stays behind
and lights up a cigarette.
KAREN
How can you do this?
JACOB
Do what?
I'm not doing anything.
KAREN
Exactly.
After all we've been through
you just throw in the towel.
Why?
JACOB
Because we're fucked.
The last thing the
Dream Police told me was that they needed
all our help.
Together.
Even if we
weren't about to be split up there aren't
enough of us left to make a difference.
KAREN
How do you know that?
JACOB
I don't.
But, it's all just too much.
I've tried so hard and nothing's worked.
I'm spent.
I'm wasted.
I'm...I'm so
tired.
Jacob puts his face in his hands.
JACOB (cont'd)
I've had enough.
KAREN
So you're just going to give up?
I'll
bet that's something your mother never
taught you.
That hit home.
Jacob uncovers his face.
His ID bracelet
dangles from his wrist.
He looks at the bracelet.
ALICE
glints in the setting sunlight.
He remembers.
Jacob looks
up at Karen.
KAREN (cont'd)
We still have one night together.
JACOB
And we're not going to waste it.
Jacob stands up.
Scott falls out of a tree and lands with a THUD.
He groans,
slowly gets to his feet and takes in his surroundings.
The road is dark and desolate.
The street lights emit a grim
brown glow and there are no stars or moon in the sky.
SOUNDS echo through the trees and buildings.
Weird MOANS,
odd GURGLINGS, eerie WHISPERS, and an occasional unearthly
HOWL.
This does not comfort Scott.
SCOTT
Oh, this is lovely.
He starts cautiously walking down the sidewalk.
SOMETHING
flies by with a FLAPPING.
Scott ducks.
Was it a bird or a
bat or what?
It's already gone.
Then a craggy voice calls out from behind a tree.
BUM
Hey, buddy?
SCOTT
Yeah, what?
Scott is understandably jumpy.
The dark figure of a BUM
starts walking towards him.
Scott backs away.
BUM
Can you spare some change?
SCOTT
Um, well, let me see...
Scott starts sifting through his pockets, and the BUM steps
out into the light.
He has THREE EYES and a HUMP BACK.
Scott YELPS.
SCOTT (cont'd)
Holy Jesus Christ.
The Bum grins and Scott starts stumbling away, his voice
trailing off:
SCOTT (cont'd)
I'll catch you next time, buddy.
The mutant bum belches.
Karen rounds a corner.
She walks nervously down the middle
of the street.
There are no cars, and she wants to keep as
far away as possible from the houses on either side.
There is a CREAKING sound from one of those houses.
Karen
turns her head to look.
A craggy OLD WOMAN is rocking back and forth on her front
porch.
She's eating something, something stringy and slimy.
She munches away with a vacant look in her eyes.
The something in her hands MOVES slightly.
The old woman's
meal is still alive.
Karen gags and walks faster.
And a PANTING sound is heard,
like two dogs.
Someone is walking their pet down the
sidewalk.
It's the MUTANT WOMAN from Jacob's opening nightmare:
straggly hair, oozing sores, limping.
The source of the
multiple paintings is her single dog, all two heads of it.
The mutant woman waves unpleasantly at Karen.
Karen whimpers
and starts to RUN.
WITH KAREN - RUNNING
She stumbles quickly down the street.
We catch fleeting
glimpses of other horrors, twisted shapes, bent shadows.
Karen rounds a corner, and SCREAMS when she bumps into
someone.
It's Scott, out of breath from his own sprinting.
KAREN
Scott!
You're here.
SCOTT
Yeah.
Fun town.
Talk to any of the
neighbors, yet? They're a swell bunch of
folks.
KAREN
Uh-huh.
Real friendly, too.
SCOTT
So this is a dream?
KAREN
And I'm in it with you.
Convinced?
SCOTT
Maybe I'm just dreaming bout being here
with you.
Wouldn't be the first time.
KAREN
Nope.
I tired that one already.
Doesn't
work.
Come on, we have to find Jacob.
Scott nods and they take off down the street.
A cat with
three tails slithers by.
Jacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road.
He
stares down into the darkness, a wooden expression on his
face.
Karen and Scott are running up behind him.
KAREN
Jacob!
Thank God!
SCOTT
So this is the place, huh?
Jacob's eyes are steady.
He hasn't yet acknowledged the
other's presence.
He eyes are fixed on the gloominess in
front of him.
A look of vengeance beginning to grow as our
SHOT MOVES IN on him.
JACOB
I'm home.
Karen and Scott are next to him now.
They stand silently
with Jacob for a few seconds.
Then:
KAREN
What now?
JACOB
Scott, are you with us?
SCOTT
A deal's a deal.
JACOB
Then we wait.
And not for long.
FLASH!
In three bursts the Dream Police
appear directly across from the teenagers.
Scott and Karen
jump back.
Jacob hold his ground.
SCOTT
Whoa!
The threesomes stand face-to-face in two parallel rows.
SCOTT (cont'd)
Nice outfits.
POWER COP
Is this all?
JACOB
All that's left.
SOUND COP
It'll have to do.
SCOTT
We can always come back later.
Like when
it's daytime.
POWER COP
It's always night here.
JACOB
What's the plan?
BLADE COP
We need you to draw him out.
SCOTT
Terrific.
We're supposed to be bait.
SOUND COP
Essentially.
JACOB
Then let's do it.
KABOOOOOOOOM!
A huge BRICK WALL, ten feet high and spreading
out across the street and through the houses, BLASTS up from
the asphalt.
Right between the Police and the kids.
ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE
The three cops crouch into battle positions.
ON THE TEENAGER'S SIDE
The three of them have hardly any time to react before three
perfectly round HOLES open up underneath each of them.
And Scott, Jacob and Karen fall into darkness.
ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE
Sound Cop stands up and his body begins to VIBRATE.
A new
noise emits from his mouth: a HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL.
And like the walls of Jericho, the bricks in front of them
fall apart and tumble to the ground.
Dust settles and the
Police walk over the rubble to the other side.
The kids are
gone.
BLADE COP
Fan out.
The Dream Police break formation and scatter.
A hole opens up in the road and WHOOSH, KAREN is elevated up
into the scene and the hole seals up instantly.
She jumps
a few feet and drops to her knees, holding onto
the ground.
She looks up at a street sign.
It reads: ELM
ST.
Karen stands up and heads down the road.
Another hole, and VOOM, Jacob is shot up into the street.
He
spins around, trying to get his bearings.
It doesn't take
him long.
He knows exactly where he is.
JACOB
Oh no...
He starts to run and we FOLLOW him.
Jacob jumps over a procession of RATS making their way across
the street and just keeps on sprinting.
Until he reaches a
certain house.
He catches his breath as he looks at the
building, pain registering on his face.
JACOB (cont'd)
Mom...
Jacob runs towards the house as our shot MOVES IN CLOSE to
the mailbox and ate name printed across it.
It reads
JOHNSON.
Scott BLASTS out of the asphalt.
He staggers for a few
seconds from the ride, then looks at the building in front of
him.
A puttering neon sign, SPRINGWOOD TAVERN', marks the
local saloon.
Muffled MUSIC and VOICES seep through the
cracks of the double doors.
Scott looks around, then shrugs.
He heads for the entrance.
Scott steps off the sidewalk and looks up and down the
street.
He thinks and we MOVE IN on him.
SCOTT
Mayor of Rosedale.
Scott sneers.
SCOTT (cont'd)
What a crock of shit.
We PULL WIDER as Scott cups his hands around his mouth.
SCOTT (cont'd)
Hey!
He's over here.
Yo!
Dream Police.
Hello!
Come on.
Move you collective
asses.
CLOSE ON SCOTT
He puts his hands on his hips and sighs.
SCOTT (cont'd)
Never a cop around when you need one.
GLITCH! a stabbing sound of flesh, and Scott JERKS violently
as our shot PULLS BACK to reveal:
Freddy behind Scott, his deadly fingers buried in the boy's
back.
Scott chokes on his own blood as Krueger growls.
FREDDY
I hate a snitch!
Freddy pulls out his blades as Scott falls forward and with
his final breath utters:
SCOTT
Eat shit...
His body hits the ground with a THUD as a sudden ROAR fills
the air.
Freddy looks around for its source.
And Sound Cop
drops down on him with a SMACK.
The two of them tumble, then both jump up. Freddy laughs.
Sound Cop looks down at Scott's body, then back up at
Krueger.
His body is shaking with fury,and he opens his
mouth.
The loudest sound yet comes from Sound Cop.
KABOOM!
A blast
of air at Mach 3 smacks into Freddy and sends him sailing
back, SMASHING right through the Tavern wall.
Like in an old wester, Krueger flies out of the double doors
and somersaults onto the pavement.
Sound Cop is a few yards
away knelt down next to Scott's dead body.
He looks up as
Freddy sneers.
FREDDY
No more playing around.
Freddy raises his left fist and it begins to EXPAND.
It
grows like an inflated beach ball, except it doesn't look
soft at all.
Freddy slides up to the side of the entrance,
and raises his giant hammer hand.
Power Cop steps through,
looking for blood.
Sound Cop tries to warn him.
SOUND COP
Kincaid!
Too late.
BAM!
Freddy's fist slams down on Power Cop's
head.
He's actually shoved down into the ground a full two
feet - trapped at the legs.
BAM!
Freddy hits him again.
Power Cop is down to his thighs
and he can't get out.
A RUMBLING is heard.
Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting
to open his mouth.
Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs
a brick from the rubble and THROWS it at Sound Cop.
FREDDY
Put a lid on it!
THUNK!
The brick lands squarely in Sound Cop's mouth,
stretching it painfully and blocking it completely.
Sound
Cop reels from the impact.
Tries to pull out the firmly
wedged plug.
Freddy turns back to Power Cop, BAM!
Hits him down to his
hips.
The giant fist swings, BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! like
hammering a nail until Power Cop DISAPPEARS into the ground.
Freddy's hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the
struggling Sound Cop.
Sound Cop's head is EXPANDING.
Pressure seems to be building
up, something's gonna blow.
Freddy picks up a boulder from
the street rubble.
He catapults it with both hands at Sound
Cop.
The boulder hits Sound Cop's head and takes it CLEAN
OFF.
Sound Cop's decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick
still stuck, as a blast of air shoots up from the stump of
his neck with a SCREECH.
Sound Cop's body stumbles for a few seconds, then falls over
limply.
Freddy LAUGHS and laughs and laughs... KACHUNK! until a KNIFE
embeds itself in his back.
Krueger spins around.
CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!
Three more knives slam into his body as
he staggers back in surprise.
Blade Cop stands twenty feet
away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after
knife, flinging them at Freddy.
They sail like flying
bullets.
CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!
Krueger falls back from the sheer force
of the onslaught, at least a dozen blades sticking out of his
body.
Blade stops. She stands there for a beat, waiting to see what
Freddy will do next.
Krueger sways, looking like an inhuman pincushion.
Then he
grins.
His body steadies, and he suddenly poses like a body
builder and flexes every muscle.
POP POP POP!
The daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs,
CLATTERING to the ground.
The girl in black steps back and raises her arms.
SHINK
SHINK!
Two-foot-long sabers jut out from her forearms.
They're not held by her, they're a PART of her, exiting from
the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists.
She crosses
the blades in front of her.
FREDDY (cont'd)
(smiling)
Ah... a girl after my own heart.
KACHINK! Freddy shoots out his finger knives and they EXTEND
to double their normal size.
He raises them and takes on a
fencing stance.
FREDDY (cont'd)
En guard, bitch
SWOOP/CLANG!
A swordfight ensues.
Freddy swinging his four
long knives.
Blade slashing her rapier-arms.
They lunge,
they parry, they leap, they duck.
CLANG!
They connect.
SCREEEEE.
Metal scrapes metal.
It's
a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop
and Freddy are equally matched.
Blade moves to get the upper
hand.
CLINK CLINK!
Blades shoot out of the girl's ELBOWS.
Now
when she takes a swing with her fists, another sword is right
behind it on the follow-through.
Freddy gets caught off-guard.
Gets slashed twice in the
shoulder and twirls away.
Then starts to move FASTER.
Blade counters with an equally increased intensity.
Freddy
ducks, SWOOPS out twice quickly.
A fold of black cloth drops
down on Blade's stomach, revealing naked skin and a little
blood.
They pause for a second.
FREDDY (cont'd)
Touche.
And Blade becomes AIRBORNE putting a Samurai to shame,
twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from
her RIGHT HEEL, chopping off Freddy's left hand.
Krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out
of the stump.
Astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again,
swinging away at an incredible rate.
An impossible rate.
JACOB rounds the corner.
He stumbles into the action just as
the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling GLINTING
MASS.
Pieces of them start to drop away.
Blade's foot hits the ground.
Freddy's arm plops away.
A
broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then
one of Blade's arms.
CLOSE ON JACOB
as he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action
that's moving too fast for him to see.
Then there's silence.
We PULL BACK and PAN
to follow Jacob as he walks into the
scene of carnage.
He steps up to two pills of remains: one
black and flesh colored covered with red blood, the other a
heap of red and green cloth, scarred tissues, and pukish
green glop.
Blade and Freddy have literally chopped each other to bits,
the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air.
Jacob sees something else and walks over to it.
It's Scott's
body.
Jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager.
JACOB
I'm sorry, Scott.
A CRACKING sound makes Jacob stand up.
Over to the now-
silent bar entrance a BLACK FIST punches up through the
cement.
With a crumbling of granite, Power Cop rises from
the earth.
Something else moves behind Jacob and he turns, then SCREAMS.
Sound Cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held
ABOVE FRAME over his neck.
Then Sound Cop's arms lower his dismembered HEAD onto his
stump, push it down, twist it til it stays.
With great
effort, Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth.
Jacob now looks OFF SCREEN at something else, something that
REALLY makes his eyes widen.
We get to see the shadow of
what Jacob sees, projected on the wall of the bar behind him.
The shadow of the pile of body parts that was Blade Cop
begins to MOVE.
The pieces start to REFORM, leg to torso,
arm to shoulder, head to neck.
The shadow on the wall rises
and we PULL BACK.
Blade Cop stands across from Jacob, whole again except for a
flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the
experience.
Jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected Dream Police
step around him.
JACOB (cont'd)
Okay, I'm impressed
Blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girl's face.
BLADE COP
You shouldn't be.
Jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of
Freddy remains.
But they're not remains anymore.
All that's
left of Freddy is a stack of CLOTH remnants.
A WIND rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness.
The other two Dream Police raise their visors, looking
equally distraught.
They all face Jacob.
BLADE COP (cont'd)
This is what we were afraid of.
SOUND COP
He still exists.
JACOB
What!
How?
POWER COP
We're already dead, that's why he
couldn't destroy us.
BLADE COP
But he's not dead. He's not alive either.
He's something in between.
SOUND COP
He's not entirely part of reality or part
of dreams.
He's unique.
BLADE COP
WE can't kill him.
POWER COP
We can wail away on each other until
doomsday and not do any good.
JACOB
Then who's going to kill this fucker?
SOUND COP
YOU have to.
JACOB
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
BLADE COP
Krueger's power comes from his rage and
the souls of children.
POWER COP
You have to find the original source of
that rage and use it against him.
BLADE COP
This town in its present condition
encompasses all evils from all times in
its history.
The answer is here
somewhere...
Jacob sighs, then gets an idea.
JACOB
I think I know where...
And he starts to run down the street.
BLADE COP
Jacob, wait.
We have to find him first.
JACOB
No time.
You guys find Karen!
He disappears down the road as the Dream Police snap down
their visors
Karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down
building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation.
This isn't just an ELM STREET house, it's THE Elm Street
house.
And for some reason Karen is drawn to it.
She looks
to her let at the bent mailbox.
It has a name plate on it.
Another one underneath it.
And
another.
It's as if people moved in and out and instead of
changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new
one over the old.
Karen steps closer to the mailbox.
The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.
She touches it
with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on
rusted away to dust.
A new plate is revealed.
This one says
THOMPSON. Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away.
The
name underneath makes Karen gasp.
It reads KRUEGER.
And there's still another one under that horrible name.
Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off.
The last sign
reads UNDERWOOD.
Karen frowns.
She turns back to the house, a determined
expression on her face.
KAREN
No more...
She KICKS the gate open and walks up to the house.
The Dream Police and Karen bolt out the front door and run
down the street as a RUMBLE joins Freddy's thunderous SHRIEK
and the entire town begins to SHAKE.
We stay with a shot of the house as the noise and vibrations
continue.
And the Elm Street House EXPLODES.
The BLACK CLOUD punches
out the roof and the walls, sending wood and debris flying
everywhere.
The rubble flies into the air, hangs there for a beat, then
falls to the ground.
All is SILENT.
And the dark cloud turns WHITE.
The milky
fog spreads out.
Karen falls to her knees on the pavement, not looking back at
the destruction one block away.
The Dream Police stop running to turn to face her.
Karen
hangs her head and cries.
Blade steps forward.
BLADE COP
It took a human touch.
It took knowing
HIS nightmare.
Goodbye, Karen.
Karen raises her head as the Dream Police turn away.
KAREN'S POV - THE DREAM POLICE
walk off into the distance.
Just as they are about to vanish
into the darkness, a FOURTH FIGURE appears and joins them in
formation.
Then they all disappear.
ANGLE ON KAREN
Her mouth drops open at what she's just seen.
What she
DOESN'T see is the white cloud swooping down the street
behind her. She just closes her eyes as the ivory mist
envelops her and the SCREEN GOES WHITE.
FADE IN FROM WHITE TO:
Karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees.
Her eyes open and squint at the bright light.
She sits up
and tries to get her bearings.
Some hair falls into her face
and she brushes it away.
Only then noticing that she's
holding something in her hand.
She opens her hand and looks down.
KAREN'S POV
It's an ID bracelet.
A band of gold with a larger plate
dangling from the middle of it.
Karen's hand turns it over.
This time the printing reads JACOB.
WITH KAREN
she chokes back the tears.
We hear a PANTING O.S.
Then a
woman's voice.
WOMAN
You okay, honey?
Karen looks up as we PULL BACK.
A pleasant-looking woman, no
longer a mutant, is walking her cute dog.
She looks
sincerely concerned.
Karen nods.
KAREN
Yes.
I'm alright.
WOMAN
I've never seen you around.
Are you new
in town?
KAREN
Sort of.
WOMAN
Well then...
(she smiles)
Welcome to Springwood.
The woman continues on her way.
Karen sighs and puts the
bracelet on her wrist.
She stands and our SHOT PULLS UP AND
AWAY as the pretty young girl starts walking through a town
she's never seen - except in her dreams.
FADE OUT.
