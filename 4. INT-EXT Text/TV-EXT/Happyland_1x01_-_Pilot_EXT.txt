      CLOSE ON: the beautiful, ageless, Latina face of GLORIA 
      VILLAR. Well, she isn t really ageless; she s 34, and right 
      now she s under about nine pounds of stage makeup and clad in 
      full-on fairy-tale regalia to play  Princess Sophia. 

                                  GLORIA
                    ... Dreams really do come true...

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Gloria is being embraced by the handsome 
      PRINCE VALOR (a younger  ageless  than Gloria s ageless) as he 
      stares into her eyes, completely in love. 

                                  PRINCE VALOR
                    How about  happily ever after?  

                                  GLORIA
                    Well, Prince Valor  

                                  PRINCE VALOR
                      If we re going to marry, you should 
                    probably start calling me  Edward. 

                                  GLORIA
                    Well, Edward... I think  happily ever 
                    after  starts right about now.

      Prince Valor leans in and gives her the most romantic   and 
      chaste   stage-kiss a six-year-old could dream up...

      ... And indeed, we now see the audience is comprised of scores 
      of CHILDREN and their PARENTS, watching what s called a 
         Street-mosphere  show on the  Main Street  of the celebrated 
      American institution Wonderland Theme Park. 

      Gloria and Prince Valor are surrounded by ANTHROPOMORPHIC 
      ANIMALS and performers dressed as GIANT VEGETABLES, all 
      cheering their love. A movable BACKDROP of a royal animated 
      kitchen is in the background. 

      As the romantic couple kiss, we Panic Room-style ZOOM THROUGH 
      a hole in the ivory-covered fence behind them into:


      Past the waiting PERFORMERS IN COWBOY COSTUMES and black-clad 
      TECHIES preparing a large prop stagecoach, and into:                                                                                       2.



      We hear the sound of kids CHANTING  Rocky! Rocky!  from the 
      other side of the fence. They pass by Gloria (Princess Sophia) 
      and Prince Valor, who offstage is the GAYEST MAN ALIVE. 

                                  LUCY
                          (to Rocky; incensed)
                      You were burning one?

                                  PRINCE VALOR
                    Oh, helllllll s to the no!

      As Gloria gives her Prince Valor a playful smack, the FENCE 
      SWINGS OPEN and the stagecoach rolls out with the cowboys. Too 
      late to turn back now   stoned Rocky is going on.


      The crowd goes nuts when they see Rocky, the cowboys, and the 
      entourage (Lucy included) roll out. Rocky begins speaking 
      through a COMPUTERIZED VOICE (not the performer), as operated 
      by a nearby TECH, just as Lucy said.

                                  ROCKY COMPUTER VOICE
                    Howdy kids, looks like it s time for 
                      a hoedown! Whaddya say?

      The kids CHEER. But as the cowboys and Rocky go into a cowboy 
      hoedown, Rocky starts off strong, but then he stumbles... And 
      Rocky falls down. And stays down. Shit   he must have passed 
      out! Still, his computer headpiece KEEPS TALKING:

                                  ROCKY COMPUTER VOICE (CONT D)
                    I love a good hoedown!

      But with him on the ground, it seems creepy. A kid starts 
      CRYING. From the sidelines, Lucy radios into her earpiece:

                                  LUCY
                    We have a Rocky tumble.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Rocky lies on the ground, unmoving, as kids grow concerned and 
      whisper. The COWBOY PERFORMERS continue their dance, standing 
      in front of the fallen Rocky.

                                  COWBOY #1
                    I reckon Rocky is hidin ...

      As the cowboys improvise, we find Lucy in the audience again. 
        A 6-year-old KID looks up at her, scared:

                                  KID
                    Did Rocky have a stroke? My grandpa 
                    had a stroke.

                                  LUCY
                    Rocky didn t have a stroke! He loves 
                    to hide! You know how silly he is...

      The kid smiles, while in the background we see WILL and the 
      other guys in black, who discreetly enter through the 
      stagecoach while the cowboys onstage stay in character:

                                  COWBOY #2
                    How we gonna have a Rocky hoedown 
                    without a Rocky? You fellas seen him?

      While behind them... The guys surround the fallen Rocky. We 
      don t see exactly what s happening   we re with the audience 
      here   but only a few moments later, Rocky bounces up again. 
      The kids LAUGH and CHEER with relief.

                                  ROCKY COMPUTER VOICE
                    Looks like it s time for a hoedown!

      The cowboys and Rocky begin their dance again, while behind 
      the stagecoach, the black-clad guys carry a SEMI-CONSCIOUS GUY 
      away. Will is no longer with them   he s in the suit.

                                  LUCY
                          (into earpiece)
                      Switch-out s done. Show s back up.

      As the show goes on, Lucy allows herself a moment of relief   
      which quickly turns to anger.                                                                                      7.



        A 4-year-old BOY screams and cries while sitting on the lap of 
      TWINKLE BIRD, an anthropomorphic canary wearing suspenders. 
      They sit in giant bird nest outfitted to look like a house.

                                  CRYING BOY
                      AHHHHH!!!! HE S SCARY!!! 

      The boy cries and thrashes while his PARENTS attempt to calm 
      him, photographer HARPER MUNROE (16, crucifix necklace, good 
      Christian girl turning restless,) tries to keep a happy face.                                                                                     10.


      We now see that Lucy and Will stand off to the side in 
      civvies, amused by the display.

                                  HARPER
                    And... Smile?

                                  BOY S MOTHER
                    C mon, honey! Smile for Twinkle!

                                  CRYING BOY
                    I HATE TWINKLE!!!! AHHHH!!!!!

      Harper sighs and snaps the photo. After the boy throws his 
      slushie at Harper s head, TWINKLE S GREETER leads the crying 
      boy away. Harper is tapped on the shoulder by a NEW 
      PHOTOGRAPHER, signalling her break.

      Heading away from the LONG LINE OF KIDS AND PARENTS, Harper 
      wipes her face as she joins Lucy and Will as they walk through 
      THE PARK. Harper and Will hold hands, a longtime couple. 
      Everywhere you look there s something  Wonderland-Ful,  with 
      rides, shops, stands of food and apparel. Paradise to an over-
      stimulated kid, but old hat to Lucy, Harper, and Will.

                                  HARPER
                    I m so over this job. I can t believe 
                    my parents are still making me work 
                    at this Diet Snot-flavored park.

      Lucy and Will exchange a glance. She nods:  Go ahead. 

                                  WILL
                    Pop quiz!

                                  HARPER
                    No! Why?

                                  WILL
                      Shirtless, coked up Charlie Sheen 
                    shows up at your family s new house 
                    at 3 AM. He just wants to talk. Do 
                    you let him in?

                                  HARPER
                          (not enthused)
                    ... No...?

                                  WILL
                    Bad move! He wanted you to join the 
                    Dazzle Homeowner s Association where 
                    they weigh you and then give you that 
                    weight in gold as a  Welcome to the 
                      neighborhood  gesture. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                  WILL (CONT'D)
                    So then he breaks all your dishes and 
                    makes you tell him he s pretty.

                                  HARPER
                    I change my answer to  yes.  I let in 
                    shirtless coked up Charlie Sheen.

                                  LUCY
                    Bad move! He blames your father s new 
                    promotion for escalating violence in 
                    Syria and says you need to move back 
                    to your old neighborhood with your 
                    friends. 

                                  HARPER
                    Then he cries in my soup, right? 

                                  LUCY
                    Yes, but they re delicious tears.

                                  HARPER
                    What did I say to deserve a pop quiz? 
                      Seriously, I m still Harper from the 
                    block. I can do the dance and 
                      everything.

                                  WILL
                    You literally live in a Wonderland-
                    owned town named  Dazzle.  My car got 
                    towed there  cause it didn t  meet 
                    the aesthetic requirements.  Exactly 
                    what  block  are you talking about?

      The mood s joviality is tested in a moment of tension. Harper 
      opts to ignores Will s snark and instead says to Lucy:

                                  HARPER
                    Dude, Luce: Did I hear a GQ cover 
                    model took a Rocky tumble?

                                  LUCY
                    Whatever, he s not that cute. Kinda 
                    big on the dick-scale.
                          (before Harper can joke)
                    Not that dick-scale.

                                  HARPER
                    You sure you don t want a litter of 
                    Hot Rocky s raccoon babies inside 
                    you? Park chatter says he s gorg.                                                                                    12.


                                  LUCY
                    If by  gorg  you mean  inconsiderate 
                    towards the livelihood of his fellow 
                      performers,  then yes: totes gorg. 

      As Will watches Lucy deny the obvious fact of Ian s 
        attractiveness, we see a look of jealousy on his face. 

      And Harper notices Will s look, but doesn t say anything. 
      Instead she just takes her boyfriend s hand. 


      With the lights of Wonderland in the distance, Lucy walks 
      through the working-class neighborhood that houses many of its 
      employees. She approaches a drab, nondescript building that 
      could almost be a college dorm. For Lucy, it s home.


      The main square of Wonderland has been lit up like it s 
      Christmas   no different from every night here, with one big 
      exception: no guests. Tonight, it s employees only. Everyone 
      from CAFETERIA WORKERS to HIGH-POWERED EXECUTIVES are there. 
      This is the  Wonder Buddy Ball. 

      You can tell the working-class  Brickers  apart from the 
       Dazzlers  by their clothes and affect. They ve clustered on 
      opposite sides of the park like kids at a middle school dance. 

      On the Bricker side, Gloria is exuberant as she hugs her 
      daughter, proud and exclaims to her nearby BRICKER FRIENDS.

                                  GLORIA
                    My girl s curing malaria!

      The Brickers CHEER. Lucy tries to temper expectations:

                                  LUCY
                    Again, malaria: already curable. But 
                    I still have a final interview  

                                  GLORIA
                      You re going to murder that final 
                      interview. You re celebrating! We re 
                    getting you a boy to rub up on.

                                  LUCY
                    You re really piling up my future 
                    therapy bills here.

      Gloria spots Ian walking through the park. He s dressed well. 
      Very well. As he passes by, he sees Lucy. He confidently 
      smiles and nods at her, charisma in effect even at a distance.

                                  GLORIA
                    Who is that? Did you see the way he 
                    looked at you? I got lady tingles.

                                  LUCY
                    I d sooner kick it to Chef Antonio, 
                    ESL and all.

                                  GLORIA
                    Then, my precious treasure, you must 
                    be deaf, dumb, blind and dead.                                                                                    17.


      Will comes over, pissed. Still, Lucy s relieved to see him:

                                  LUCY
                    Please save me from this 
                      conversation.

                                  WILL
                    This is some straight-up nonsense. 

      Will points out Harper on the other side of the park talking 
      to a group of WELL-DRESSED TEENAGERS.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Harper s hanging out with Chris 
                    Rummel? Freshman year that kid put 
                    his pubes in my cheeseburger. Not a 
                      euphemism. 

                                  LUCY
                    He lives on her new block. And if 
                    it s any consolation, she says 
                    they re top-notch pubes.

      He look at her, amused by her joke but still saddened by 
      Harper on the other side of the party. 

      As Lucy gives him a consoling look, the sound of a CHAMPAGNE 
      GLASS BEING CLINKED is heard through the loudspeaker.

                                  JAMES (O.S., ON LOUDSPEAKER)
                    Hello! And welcome!

      All eyes turn to the steps of the ENCHANTED CASTLE   a large 
      attraction at the front of the park. Standing atop it is a 
      dashing man of 45; a silver-haired, square-jawed, well-
      tailored captain of industry. As we ll learn in a moment, this 
      is the new president of Wonderland. This is JAMES CHANDLER. 

      He stands next to his elegant, glamorous wife MARGOT (45), and 
      speaks into a mic:

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    As some of you know, my name is James 
                    Chandler, and I am honored to take 
                    over as Wonderland s president today.

      The crowd APPLAUDS. Lucy notices Gloria watching intently.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    ... My Grandpa Hank started this 
                    company when he drew the very first 
                    Rocky Raccoon cartoon back in 1928. I 
                    worked in this very park twenty-five 
                    years ago. Even played Rocky myself.                                                                                    18.


      Will throws Lucy a look:  give me a break. 

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    More recently, I was an executive 
                    here and then in our New York 
                    offices. But now I m here to stay. 
                    And so is my family. So I d like to 
                    introduce my beautiful wife Margot  

      Margot waves to the crowd, in full on Jackie O mode.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    And my son Theodore, who will be 
                    taking over as creative director of 
                    the park. Theodore, c mon up. Say hi.

      By James s side is young man we recognize as  Armani Suit.  
      Now we know his name: THEODORE CHANDLER waves to the crowd.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    He looks twelve, but kid graduated 
                    Harvard in three years. It s unseemly 
                    but a dad s gotta brag, right? 

        Good-natured CHUCKLES from the Dazzlers, while some Brickers 
      like Will are more suspicious.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    Working in the character department 
                    taught me the ropes, so I thought 
                     Why not have my younger son start at 
                    the same place?  In fact, he s 
                    already begun working. Ian, wave hi.

      And now Ian stands on stage. He smiles that charming smile, 
      and waves to the crowd. 

      In the audience, Lucy GASPS. She s been working   or rather, 
      sparring   with the son of the president of Wonderland. As 
      Lucy s jaw hangs open, Will leans over and whispers:

                                  WILL
                    ... Guess we know why my dad had to 
                    promote Snoop Lion...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    19.


                                        ACT TWO


      Lucy, Gloria, and a few others stand in an informal  greeting 
      line  to say hello to James and his family. We recognize a few 
      assorted Brickers   Patrick, gay Prince Valor, some Cowboys   
      who ve all had a few extra glasses of  Magic Ale.  

      Harper and Will are conspicuously off to the side, engaged in 
      what appears to be their umpteenth lover s spat. The mood in 
      line is buoyant, but Gloria seems nervous. 

                                  GLORIA
                    Maybe we ll meet him another time.

                                  LUCY
                    I think this love and shove is a one-
                    time deal. Aren t you excited to  hob-
                    knob with the Dazzler elite? 

                                  GLORIA
                    I was. I am. I just  

                                  JAMES
                      Gloria, right?

      Lucy and Gloria have reached James, Margot, Theodore   and of 
      course, Ian. He gives Lucy a little wave, but she looks away.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    You were here when I was an executive 
                    twenty years ago...

                                  THEODORE
                    You ve been a princess for twenty 
                    years?

      Gloria is flustered; it s not every day she comes face to face 
      with a man of this much power and wealth. And the fact that 
      Creative Director Theodore is scrutinizing her age isn t doing 
      wonders for her confidence. Still, she manages to say:

                                  GLORIA
                    Not quite twenty years... Don t you 
                    go aging me. I m not ready to play a 
                    crone just yet.

                                  JAMES
                    Far from it. Wonderful to still see 
                    you here, Gloria.

      Gloria forces her most confident smile and moves away from the 
      receiving line. Lucy follows, but doesn t get far:                                                                                    20.


                                  IAN (O.S.)
                    Lucy, hold up.

      She turns to see that Ian has left the line and followed her. 
      Gloria gives her daughter a look:  Are you okay? 

                                  GLORIA
                    I can hang around...

                                  LUCY
                    I got it.

      Still flustered, Gloria nods, and disappears into the crowd. 
      Now away from her mom, Lucy turns to Ian, self-conscious:

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    Our adjectives list about you didn t 
                    mention  Wonderland president s 
                      offspring. 

                                  IAN
                    I knew I forgot something. 

      Lucy is awkward: what should she say to this guy?

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Look... I didn t open with that 
                    salient detail because I didn t want 
                    you to feel like you had to play 
                    nice. You re more fun when you re 
                    pissed at me.

      He smiles at her: is he flirting? Fuck. This can only lead to 
      trouble. But look at his eyes: you could swim in those things.

                                  LUCY
                    We re lucky I m still pissed at you.

                                  IAN
                    At least let me try to get back on 
                    your good side.

                                  LUCY
                     Back  implies a time when you were.

                                  IAN
                    Have you ever been to the top of the 
                    executive penthouse?

                                  LUCY
                    Crap, must ve lost my key.

                                  IAN
                    Want to see it now?                                                                                     21.


      Lucy is thrown for a curve?

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    What? I think you re sweet.

      He s 100% serious. For once, Lucy has no quick retort. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                     Sweet  might be a stretch. We ll go 
                    with  plucky.  I can make adjective 
                    lists, too. What do you say?

      But before she can answer, the moment is interrupted by:

                                  HARPER (O.S.)
                    ... What do you say to what exactly?

      They turn to see Harper: drunk and flashing her biggest and 
      best flirtatious smile at Ian. This duet just became a trio.


      Our first real glimpse of Dazzle, and it s a sight to behold: 
      clean and tidy, with uniform houses boasting perfectly fresh-
      mowed lawns, the streets litter-free and immaculate. 

      One such Dazzle lawn is being examined by HARPER S MOTHER 
      (40s, slightly out of her element) and MRS. COVINGTON (45, 
      total Stepford wife, everything in place). Ms. Covington holds 
      a clipboard while Harper s Mom anxiously listens:

                                  MRS. COVINGTON
                    Lawns must be mowed each week to 
                    avoid a fine, with of course the  
                    exception of December, when we import 
                    the snow....

      We MOVE UP TO HARPER S HOUSE, where Lucy and Harper are on the 
      second floor, watching Harper s Mom and Mrs. Covington talk. 
      Harper nurses a Gatorade after last night s hangover.                                                                                    27.


                                  LUCY
                    She s saying these words out loud and 
                    yet it s not a Funny or Die video.

                                  HARPER
                          (holding her head)
                    Shhh... We need to create a hangover-
                    friendly space...

                                  MRS. COVINGTON (ON THE LAWN BELOW)
                    ... Of course you ll need to provide 
                    a minimum of three reindeer...

      Harper starts unpacking boxes, less enthused to laugh at this.

                                  LUCY
                    I wonder if she s read 1984. Dude, do 
                    you think the Dazzle neighborhood 
                    committee is secretly Big Brother? I 
                    can t believe you actually live here.

                                  HARPER
                    It s a bit much, but I see where 
                    they re coming from.

                                  LUCY
                    ... Are you really defending the 
                    reindeer Gestapo down there?

                                  HARPER
                    Having a nice lawn isn t exactly 
                    puppy genocide. There s nothing wrong 
                    with wanting to fit in.

                                  LUCY
                    ... So  fitting in  means getting 
                    bombed and throwing yourself at Ian 
                    Chandler when you have a boyfriend?

                                  HARPER
                    Like my boyfriend would ve been more 
                    upset about me being there with Ian 
                    than he would about you being there 
                    with him. 

      This hits close to home. Lucy tries to play it off:

                                  LUCY
                    ... Will s like my brother.

                                  HARPER
                    You think he sees it that way?

      Lucy is silent.                                                                                    28.


                                  HARPER (CONT D)
                    Even before I moved, you guys have 
                    always had more in common. You have 
                    those in-jokes. You both work in the 
                    character department. You re both 
                    raised by single parents. Both...

                                  LUCY
                    ... Economically challenged?
                          ( Lucy, you dick )
                    Sorry, I   I m not saying the right 
                    thing today at all...

      Before Harper can respond, Lucy leaves.


      Gloria approaches the tunnels when her phone RINGS.

                                  GLORIA
                    Hello....

      Whoever Gloria is talking to throws her for a curve.

                                  GLORIA (CONT D)
                    ... How d you get this number?... No, 
                    I can t see you now. I have a show...

      But she s not hanging up   in fact, she s getting emotional. 
      We don t know who s talking to her   at least, not yet... 


      Ian pulls up. Lucy rushes out, covered in sweat. She finds 
      Denise   the woman who interviewed her   walking to her car.

                                  LUCY
                    Denise! I m here! I can meet your 
                      supervisor...

                                  DENISE
                    You re half an hour late.                                                                                     33.


                                  LUCY
                    I know, It s complicated but   but 
                    I m here now...

                                  DENISE
                    She s gone. We filled the spot. 

      Denise looks at Ian in his Porsche. Nods to herself. Getting 
      back in her car, she says one last thing to crestfallen Lucy:

                                  DENISE (CONT D)
                    But your boyfriend s very good-
                    looking. Nice car.

      Denise drives off. Lucy watches her go, fighting back tears. 

                                  LUCY
                    ... We need go back. Not supposed to 
                    take costumes out of the park. 


      Lucy is alone in the fenced area behind the park just as the 
      sun is setting. Ian enters from the tunnels and joins her.

                                  LUCY
                    My mom has never flaked like this. 
                    I'm a little worried she fell out of 
                    a roller coaster or something.

                                  IAN
                    Nah. My dad says the safety 
                      regulations are up to snuff.

                                  LUCY
                    ... Thanks for the ride. That was 
                    solid of you.

                                  IAN
                    I m not sure what to do with you 
                    being nice to me. It feels so wrong.

      She laughs sadly, then looks out at the setting sun.

                                  LUCY
                    I ll never get out of here.

                                  IAN
                    ... Maybe there s a part of you that 
                    didn t want to leave. Maybe, despite 
                    what you say, you kinda like it here. 
                    Your friends are here. Your family is 
                    here. Wonderland is home.                                                                                    34.


                                  LUCY
                    I just wanna play my whole life safe? 

      Ian takes a step closer to her.

                                  IAN
                    I didn't say  safe ... But maybe you 
                    kinda wanted it to happen that way. 

                                  LUCY
                    Yeah, I wanted my mom to flake out  

                                  IAN
                    Nothing here makes you want to stay?

      Now he s right up in her face. She almost whispers:

                                  LUCY
                    No... Nothing.

      And finally they re kissing. Imagine the best first kiss 
      you ve ever had, and you re still nowhere near this. But then:

                                  GLORIA (O.S.)
                    Lucy!

      Lucy and Ian break away from the embrace. Gloria stands in the 
      tunnel doorway, sweaty, out of breath, and horrified.

                                  GLORIA (CONT D)
                    You can t  

                                  LUCY
                      I m not talking to you.

      Both livid at her mother and embarrassed by the interruption, 
      Lucy runs away, leaving Gloria alone with a confused Ian.


      Ian and Theodore walk through the park towards TWINKLE S NEST. 

                                  THEODORE
                    For a sick lady, Gloria Villar seemed 
                    quite intent on rushing to the show.

                                  IAN
                    Maybe she just really, really wanted 
                    to see me play Prince Valor. Lucy and 
                    I killed it, huh?

                                  THEODORE
                    You two were very convincing.                                                                                    35.


                                  IAN
                    ... I think I might do well here. 
                    Maybe it won t be like New York.

                                  THEODORE
                    I m pleased you re taking something 
                      seriously. But... Having you publicly 
                    work minimum wage   you know this is 
                    just Dad s PR stunt, right?

                                  IAN
                          (trying to play it off)
                    ... Oh... I know...

                                  THEODORE
                    So... By all means, have your fun 
                    with your lady co-stars   onstage or 
                    off. But let s not pretend you re 
                    going to bring these people home... 
                    Not in the daytime, anyway. 

      Ian is torn: he doesn t agree, but it s his big brother...

                                  THEODORE (CONT D)
                    C mon. Car s waiting.

      As Theodore leads his conflicted brother away, in the dark 
      they don t notice Harper packing up her equipment. She s heard 
      everything. She looks she s just been punched in the gut... 

      She takes out of her phone and sends a text that we don t see. 
      But then she looks up to see Will approaching.

                                  WILL
                    Hey...

      Harper turns to see Will approaching.  There s an uncertain 
      coolness between them. Neither knows what to say...


      From her rooftop, Lucy looks out onto Dazzle, only miles   but 
      many worlds   away. Then DING: She gets the text from Harper:

                                  HARPER S TEXT
                    <3

      Lucy is confused, but touched. She texts  <3  back, as a 
      nervous Gloria opens the door to the roof. Palpable silence.

                                  GLORIA
                    ... The Red Cross?

      Lucy shakes her head. That s not happening.                                                                                     36.


                                  LUCY
                    ... No curing of malaria, typhoid, or 
                    any of the actual things I could ve 
                    worked on.

      Gloria s heart breaks, the world on her shoulders...

                                  GLORIA
                      I didn t... I didn t know you d sub 
                    in for me. I d never have  

                                  LUCY
                      What the hell, Mom? Where were you? 

                                  GLORIA
                    Luce... Look... With Ian... I didn t 
                    want you to kiss him because  

                                  LUCY
                      Let s just focus on one of your 
                    epic screwups at a time, okay?

      Gloria collects herself. This is excruciating for her:

                                  GLORIA
                    ... They re connected because   God, 
                    this got so messed up   I was late 
                    because I got a phone call...

      Gloria s been dreading this conversation for years. She nearly 
      chokes on the words:

                                  GLORIA (CONT D)
                    ... I got a phone call... I got a 
                    phone call from James Chandler...

                                  LUCY
                    Ian s dad?

                                  GLORIA
                    ... Ian s dad... And... Your dad.

      Lucy stares at Gloria, dumbfounded...
