  SPECIAL AGENTS G. CALLEN and SAM HANNA are sitting at their 
  desks, both sipping coffee, both staring at Deeks  desk, 
  though we don t yet know what they re actually staring at...

                              SAM
                He s going to freak.

                                CALLEN
                Yep.

                              SAM
                He s going to think I did it.

                                CALLEN
                No doubt.

                              SAM
                For the record, I m not 
                  responsible.

                                CALLEN
                Noted.

                              SAM
                Who do you think is responsible?  

                                CALLEN

                Less likely.

                              SAM
                He is so going to freak.

  Callen reacts as DETECTIVE MARTY DEEKS arrives.

                                CALLEN
                Standby.

  Deeks enters the bullpen -

                              DEEKS
                 Morning all -- 

  Deeks stops in his tracks, staring at his desk... and we 
  reveal - THE BOX (first seen in EP412-84 - KILL HOUSE).  

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                There s a box on my desk.

                                CALLEN
                Mind like a steel trap.

                              SAM
                More like a mouse trap.

  Deeks approaches his desk.

                              DEEKS
                This looks just like the box Kensi 
                got a few weeks ago -

                              SAM
                You might want to check the 
                shipping label, Deeks.

                              DEEKS
                It is the box Kensi got. What s it 
                doing on my desk?  
                      (freaks out)
                Argh!

  He grabs the box and is halfway between his desk and Kensi s 
  desk when --

                   Morning.

  He stops in his tracks, caught in the act, as SPECIAL AGENT 
  KENSI BLYE enters carrying a cup of coffee.

                              DEEKS
                This isn t what it looks like.

                              KENSI
                It looks like a man holding a box.

                              DEEKS
                An innocent man. I ve got 
                  witnesses, it s addressed to you, 
                and I was just returning it.  
                Which suggests I took it.  Which I 
                didn t.  The box was incorrectly - 
                or maybe on purpose - put on my 
                desk and ... 
                      (falters)
                I m holding your box.  

  He holds it out to her.  She sits down.  Deeks puts the box 
  on her desk like it s a bomb.

                    DEEKSKENSI
  I ll just put it here.I put it on your desk.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                You put it on my desk? But this is 
                your box.

                              KENSI
                And now it s yours.

                              DEEKS
                My box?

                Could you take it off my desk, 
                please?

  Deeks picks up the box.

                              DEEKS
                You re giving me the box?

                Huh-huh.

  Deeks puts the box on his desk.  Frowns.

                              DEEKS
                What s in it?  What s in the box?

  Kensi is casual, almost indifferent.

                              KENSI
                Open it and find out.

  Deeks begins to open it - stops. Realizes Callen, Sam and 
  Kensi are all watching.

                              DEEKS
                Is this some sort of devilish trick 
                to pay me back for snooping?  Which 
                I did not do by the way -- the 
                Google of the sender, of the said 
                box, in question. 

                              KENSI
                It s not a trick, Deeks.

  Deeks falters, drums his fingers on the box top.  

                              DEEKS
                Okay.  Then I guess I ll... open 
                it...

  He doesn t.  A beat, then a shrill whistle breaks the moment. 

  They look up to see TECH OPERATOR ERIC BEALE stands on the  *
  mezzanine floor.

                              ERIC
                We ve got business.

  No one moves.  They watch Deeks.

  Eric reacts.  Whistles again - louder this time.

  And he pushes back from the desk.  The others follow suit, 
  heading for the stairs.  Deeks perplexed, Kensi relaxed, 
  giving nothing away.  Callen and Sam walk behind them.

                                CALLEN
                She s good.

                The shooting took place in Griffith

                An Indonesian national - Rashid 
                Santoso.  Mister Santoso was a 
                vocal supporter of radical Islam 
                and a suspected arms dealer.

                Santoso dropped off the grid ten

  Hetty hangs up the phone.

  She nods towards SPECIAL AGENT CLAIRE HAWKINS, who is  *
  cleaning a stripped ASSAULT RIFLE at the table.

                Claire Hawkins...

  Claire gives them a nod as she snaps the weapon back 
  together.

                                CLAIRE
                Hi.  Either of you smoke?

                              PARIS
                And that s Dave Voss.

  They turn to see SPECIAL AGENT DAVE VOSS, pouring stock into  *
  a large pot on the stove.

                              DAVE
                No vegetarians?

                              SAM

                That s a relief.  Ahh - no vegans 
                either, right?

  Callen and Sam shake their heads. Callen looks the question 
  at Granger.  Granger isn t amused.

                              GRANGER
                No.

                The head is that way.  Danny, the

                -- You might want to take a bucket.

  Off Callen and Sam, wondering what they ve stepped into...


  Water drip, drip, drips into a plastic container in the 
  center of the table.  Everyone is squeezed in, Paris and her 
  team eating heartily, Dave fussing about replenishing empty 
  bowls.  

                              PARIS
                Shaw was in Moscow on a five day 
                leave. Visiting his sister.

                              SAM
                You ve spoken with her?

                                CLAIRE
                She s pretty cut up.  Eddie was her 
                only brother. Bread, please?

  Sam passes the bread.

                Thanks.

                Did Sergeant Shaw have a security 
                  clearance?

                              PARIS
                Low level.  Worked in transport.  
                Clerical position. 

  An ominous creaking noise from the ceiling.  Callen, Sam and 
  Granger all glance up.  The others ignore it.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               18.

                He made a call from a roadside 
                  emergency phone.  Said he d crashed 
                his car.  Someone was chasing him.  
                  Emergency services found him about 
                ten minutes later.

                Low caliber round to the back of

                Motive?

                                CLAIRE
                Not robbery.  Wallet, cash and 
                credit cards were found next to his 
                body.

                              PARIS
                Not the way Marines normally end up 
                getting murdered -- if there is a 
                   normal .  The ballistics report 
                linking him to Santoso s murder 
                puts it in a whole different light. 

  A CHIMING SOUND interrupts the moment.

  Kai crosses to a desk computer, types quickly... and the BIG 
  SCREEN IMAGE of the road outside the trucks changes to an 
  image of Hetty.

                Sorry to crash your supper, Miss 
                  Summerskill.

  Paris, Callen, Sam and the others push back from the table, 
  cross to the screen.

                Evening, Hetty.

  INTERCUT WITH:


  Hetty, with Eric and Nell in support.

                              HETTY
                Just calling to brief you on the 
                latest with the Santoso 
                  investigation.  Eric?

  Eric does a double take, not what he was expecting.  He 
  stutters into action.

                              ERIC
                Ahhh - right.  The... briefing.  
                Kensi and Deeks - ah - Agent Blye 
                and Detective Deeks - attended the 
                crime scene and found... Santoso s 
                missing shoes. And Nell and I are --

                        (scrambling)
                - we are in the process of checking 
                  Santoso s phone records. But 
                nothing to report.

                              ERIC
                Yet.  Nothing... yet.

                              HETTY
                Thank you, Eric.
                      (leaning into camera)
                And how is everyone getting on in 
                Idaho?

  Callen and Sam exchange a look - is Hetty checking up on 
  them?

                              GRANGER
                  Everything is fine, Henrietta.

                              HETTY
                Mister Callen?

                                CALLEN
                All good.

                Ahhh... great to have company for 
                dinner.

  Hetty nods, pleased.

                Fish.  It was... fish.

                              HETTY
                  Excellent.  We regroup tomorrow.  
                Go to bed. Stay warm.
                      (aside)
                Shut it down, Eric.

  And the screen goes black, returning to the view of the road 
  outside the trucks. 

  Paris gives Callen and Sam a look.

                              PARIS
                What exactly was that about?

                                CALLEN
                  Something.

                              SAM
                  Something we don t know.

                              GRANGER
                  Something we may never know.

  Callen and Sam exchange a look with Granger - for once they 
  agree with him.  

  Off Granger, pensive...


  A beat, then the door opens and Callen and Sam enter.  With 
  their duffle bags in hand, it s a tight fit.  Sam eyes the 
  two racks against the wall as Callen dumps his bag on the 
  lower one.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               21.

                Whoa -- why do you get the bottom 
                bunk?

                                CALLEN
                I was here first.

                              SAM
                G, the last time I slept on the top 
                bunk, I rolled over in the morning 
                and landed on a Petty Officer tying 
                his shoes.  Broke his arm in three 
                places.

  Callen points to the opposite wall, where a rack has been 
  folded up against the wall.  Sam pulls it down, sits on it.  

                              SAM (cont d)
                That s more like it.

  Callen stretches out, testing his rack.

                                CALLEN
                Hetty was checking up on us.

                              SAM

                Maybe she just wanted to see if you 
                and Paris were hitting it off. *

  Callen doesn t bite. *

                                CALLEN
                Must have something to do with the

                Shooter carried the weapon across 
                state lines.  

                              SAM
                Looks like a professional hit.

                                CALLEN
                Yet a pro wouldn t use the same 
                weapon twice.

                              SAM
                Means the shooter s arrogant.  
                Doesn t believe he s ever going to 
                get caught.

                                CALLEN
                Judging by the lack of physical 
                evidence he left behind, he could 
                be right.

  He looks at the top rack, then at Sam.  

  Sam looks at Callen, who puts his hands behind his head - 
  he s not moving anywhere.

  And off Sam, realizing Granger has just pulled rank...

                Hetty s unexpected briefing freaked 
                me out because we didn t have 
                  anything.  I mean we had nothing, 
                Nell.  It was a non-briefing, I 
                don t know what Hetty expected to 
                hear, but I know she didn t hear 
                it.

                              NELL
                It was kinda weird...

                So I stayed and trawled cameras in 
                the neighborhood where Santoso was 
                shot.  And I found this...

  Up on the BIG SCREEN, security camera footage of a car 
  pulling into a parking lot.  Santoso gets out.

                              ERIC (cont'd)
                The car was parked in a lot a 
                quarter mile from the road where 
                his body was found.

  He pulls up a still frame close up of the car s license 
  plate.

                It s a rental.  

  He pulls up a rental lease.

                Santoso was using a fake name and 
                driver s license.  But the address 
                he gave is real...

                About the same time his name was

  And they reach for the phones...


  TOAST pops from the toaster.  Callen puts the toast on a 
  plate, opens the fridge, peers inside, takes out a container, 
  butters his toast.

  Callen looks up as Paris joins him, helping herself to

                It might not be butter.

  Callen is about to bite into the toast.  Stops.

                What might it be?

  Callen stares at the toast.  Puts it back on the plate.  

  Paris offers him a cup of coffee.

  Paris crosses to a work station.

                              PARIS
                Hardly.  It was snowing.  Not much 
                left to find.  No footprints, no 
                tire tracks.  No physical evidence.

  The BIG SCREEN changes from an exterior view to a series of 
  crime scene photos.  

                              PARIS (cont'd)
                The scene was processed by the

  Callen gazes at the crime scene photos.

  They return to the living room, take in the scene. A couple 
  of SLEEPING BAGS on the floor.  SODA CANS and PIZZA BOXES on 
  the coffee table.  Several BAGS OF TRASH in the kitchen.

                              DEEKS
                Okay.  Either Santoso really loved 
                pizza or he had company for dinner.

                              KENSI
                Not just dinner.  Two more sleeping

  Kensi takes out her phone, punches in a number as Deeks pulls 
  on gloves and takes a peek in one of the trash bags.

  Kensi turns as Deeks upends the trash bag.  Dozens of small 
  cardboard boxes spill out.

  The METAL DETECTOR being put in the back of the SUV, the 
  tailgate slamming shut.

  Danny gets in behind the wheel.  Sam slides in beside him. 
  Paris and Callen climb into the back. 

                              PARIS
                We ve done a preliminary check of

                calls, few family calls... nothing 
                out of the ordinary.  

  Danny starts up, pulls out onto the road.

                our guys will find it -- *

  CRUNCH! as a SNOW PLOW T-bones the SUV at an intersection.

  With its engine roaring, the Snow Plow accelerates, pushing 
  the SUV down the road in a spray of snow, sparks and 
    protesting metal.  

  Chaos inside for a moment, then a beat as Sam realizes this 
  is no accident. He pulls out his SIG -- BAM! BAM! BAM! fires 
  up through the sunroof, exploding the glass.  He scrambles 
  onto his seat, rising up out of the sunroof, opens fire on 
  the unseen DRIVER.  The windshield shatters, the Driver 
  swerves the wheel violently.  

  The SUV spins across the road.  Sam drops back into the SUV 
  as it slams into a ditch.  

  A moment to recover.  

                              PARIS (cont d)

  Sam scrambles through the sunroof, drops to the ground.  
  Callen and Paris force open their door, follow him out.

  Sam opens fire at the retreating Snow Plow.  Callen and Paris 
  join him, all three of them pouring fire into the Snow Plow.  

  Suddenly the back tire blows out and the Snow Plow swerves 
  violently off the road and into a snowbank.

  Sam reloads as he runs, Callen and Paris close on his heels.

  Foxy Lady on screen, she looks towards camera, it swings off

                Kensi and Deeks are still working 
                on it.

  Off Hetty, troubled...


  Deeks is sitting at his desk.  Staring at The Box.  Kensi 
  nowhere to be seen.  Deeks picks it up, weighing it in his 
  hands.  Puts his ear to it, gives it a shake.

                              KENSI S VOICE
                You could always open it.

  Deeks hastily puts the box down as Kensi enters.

                              DEEKS
                Or you could just tell me what s in 
                it and why you gave it to me...

                Nearest traffic cam is two blocks 
                from where Santoso was staying. No 
                security cameras, no ATMs nearby. 

  Kensi turns to the flat screen, which displays an aerial 
  photo of Santoso s neighborhood.

                              KENSI (cont'd)
                The gas station at the end of the 
                street has three cameras, none of 
                them point in the right direction.  

  Deeks peers at the building across the street.

                              DEEKS
                What s this building?

                              DEEKS
                She runs a string of massage 
                  parlours.

                they ll just hand over their hard 
                drives. 

  A beat, then he senses Kensi is looking at him.  Realizes 
  what she s thinking.  He stretches his neck from side to 
  side.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                Yeah.  I need a massage.


  Deeks enters.  The reception area has an Asian theme that 
  wouldn t feel out of place on a 1970s porno set. A middle-
  aged Asian woman behind the counter smiles, nods a welcome.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                Hello, hello. You want massage?  
                Half hour? One hour? Full body?

  She slides a glossy folder in front of him.

                                RECEPTIONIST (cont d)
                You choose a pretty girl, please.

  Deeks opens the brochure. Several Asian girls, each one 
  numbered.

                Your place has got a real retro 70s

                I ll have the... number seven.  
                With a number three on the side - 
                just kidding.  She s - good hands?

                                RECEPTIONIST
                Miss Daisy.  Very good.  This way 
                please.

  She hustles him through a curtain.  A longish hallway with 
  half a dozen doors on either side.  A HEAVY-SET BOUNCER sits 
  in an alcove, sipping tea.  He clocks Deeks, fixing him with 
        a  don t-mess-with-the-girls  look.

  Deeks sees a door marked Private, opens it, glimpses an 
  office with a stack of hard drives and a couple of security 
  monitors.

                                RECEPTIONIST (cont d)
                No, no, this way, this way...

  Deeks shoots an apologetic look at the Bouncer, who is half 
  out of his chair.

                              DEEKS
                Sorry, my bad.

  He s shown into a room...    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               44.




  There s a massage table in the middle of the room.  Along one 
  wall, a side table with various massage oils and folded 
  towels.  Deeks pulls a face, takes out his phone, sends a 
  quick text:  What s in the box?

  The door opens and an Asian woman in her 20s enters wearing a 
  super short satin robe. 

                              DEEKS
                   Morning.

  The Girl begins to untie her robe.

                Don t! Don t do that just yet...

  The Girl moves close to him, begins to unbutton his shirt.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                Or that. If you d just wait for a 
                  moment...

  He smiles.  She smiles back uncertainly.  A beat, then the 
  sounds of an argument from the reception area.  Deeks cracks 
  open the door.

                              DEEKS (cont d)
                Oh no! It s my girlfriend!  She 
                must have followed me here.  You ve

                              ASIAN GIRL 
                Stay here, we ll take care of it.

  The Asian Girl slips through the door.  Deeks peeks out the 
  door after her.

  In the reception area, Kensi is loudly remonstrating with the 
    Receptionist.







                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               45.

                when I catch him...

  The Asian Girl and the Bouncer stand halfway down the hallway 
  watching.

  Deeks steps out into the hallway, crosses behind the Bouncer 
  and slips into the security room.


  Deeks pulls out a USB DRIVE, plugs it into the hard drive, 
  types a command via the keyboard.  On screen, a  DOWNLOADING 
  DATA  alert opens.

  IN RECEPTION

  Kensi is fighting a losing battle as the Receptionist and the 
  Asian Girl shepherd her towards the door.

  The Bouncer loses interest, turns away. But instead of going 
  to his alcove, he enters the security room.

  IN THE SECURITY ROOM

  No sign of Deeks.  He closes the door, revealing Deeks hiding 
  behind the door.  Deeks moves.  A floorboard creaks.  The 
  Bouncer turns -

  IN THE EXCURSION

  Paris, Callen and Sam fill in the blanks.

                              SAM
                Spears is the head of the snake.   *
                He took out Santos, who supplied 
                his cell with weapons.  

                                CALLEN
                Either didn t trust him or didn t 
                need him any more.  And he took out 
                Sergeant Shaw on the off chance 
                someone might recognize him.

                              PARIS
                Spears is a Westerner.  Which do  *
                you think?  Money? Or ideology?

                                CALLEN
                Money.  I hope.



  TRACK towards the door until CRASH, it s violently kicked 
  open and Sam leads them into the apartment.

  They rapidly spread out, clearing the rooms. We follow Paris 
  as she pushes through the dining room into the kitchen.

                              SAM S VOICE
                Clear!

                              KENSI S VOICE
                Bedroom clear!

                              PARIS
                Kitchen clear!
                      (into her comms)
                Claire?

                                CLAIRE (V.O.)
                      (distorted)
                Just me and Dave and the crickets.  
                Garage is clear. I think we ve 
                missed them, Paris.

                              PARIS
                Come on up.

  She turns and heads back into the living room, where Callen 
  has pulled on a glove and is checking the body of a FAIR 
  HAIRED MAN in a uniform with BURBANK AIRPORT emblazoned under  *
  the TSA logo on his jacket.  He s tied up, his throat  *
  slashed.

                                CALLEN
                Airport employee.

  He finds his wallet on the floor.  Checks it as Paris takes a 
  closer look at the victim s wound.

                              PARIS
                Blood s still clotting. We didn t 
                miss them by much.

                                CALLEN
                Cash, driver s licence, but no 
                airport I.D.

  Claire and Dave enter. Claire is holding a STENCIL in her 
  gloved hand - TSA.

                Found this in the garage along with 
                some empty spray cans.  I m 
                guessing they applied it to a van.

  Paris looks back at the victim.

                              PARIS
                Fair hair, fair skin...

  She looks from Callen to Sam.

                Burbank Airport. They re going to  *
                drive right through security.



  Paris and her team sharing the bullpen with Callen and the 
  others.  

                              DAVE
                What s in the box?

                              DEEKS
                You should ask my partner that, not 
                that she s going to tell you.

  Dave turns to Kensi.

                              DAVE
                So what s in the -







                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               54.

                I forgot his birthday.  I felt so 
                bad, I decided to give him 
                  something he s always wanted.  More 
                than anything else in the world.

  Deeks blinks, caught by surprise.

                              DEEKS
                Really?

                              DAVE
                Cool.  Claire gave me socks for my 
                  birthday.  They gave me a rash.

                                CLAIRE
                You already had the rash, Dave.

                              DAVE
                But it got worse.  They re warm 
                socks though.

  Deeks holds Kensi s gaze.

                              DEEKS
                You really did that?

                              KENSI
                Open the box and find out.

                              DEEKS
                What if you got it wrong?
                      (beat)
                  I mean... it doesn t get any better 
                than right now. I got what I ve 
                always wanted in a box.  There s 
                really no need to open it...

  A flicker of a smile from Kensi.

                              KENSI
                No, there s not.

  A beat, then --

                              DAVE
                It s not socks, is it?

  Claire digs him in the ribs.  

                              DAVE (cont'd)
                What?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)    EP418-90 - "Red" - Network Draft - 1-30-13               55.

  Across the room, Paris hangs up the phone, breathes a sigh of 
  relief.

                                CALLEN (O.S.)
                Danny?

  Claire turns to Callen. *

                              PARIS
                They ve taken him off the critical 
                list.

                Good news. *

                      (beat)
                Better tell the team.

  And she crosses to Dave and Claire as Sam clatters down the  *
  stairs from ops. *

                              SAM *
                Eric and Nell are checking  *
                  cellphone calls with the NSA... we  *
                might have a lead on Spears within  *

                      (beat) *
                I want this guy. *

  Callen gazes across at Hetty s office.  She s on the phone.  
  Granger stepping up into her office.

                              CALLEN *
                You re not the only one... *


  Hetty hangs up the phone as Granger joins her.  

                              GRANGER
                Any word on Spears? *

                              HETTY

  Granger smiles, doesn t answer.

                              HETTY (cont d)
                You ve seen his work before.

                              GRANGER
                  Shooter s got a name now.  Or at 
                least a face.

                              HETTY
                Long story, is it?

                              GRANGER
                Red team s a man down.

  Hetty pushes a file across her desk.  Granger opens it. 
  Reacts.

                              GRANGER (cont'd)
                Are you serious?

                              HETTY
                It s about time they put the past 
                behind them.

                              GRANGER
                I hope you don t expect me to tell 
                her.

                              HETTY
                My decision.  My job -
                      (she reacts)
                Oh bugger.  He s early.

  Granger turns in his seat to see a man entering the bullpen. 
  ROY QUAID, late 40s. 

  BACK WITH PARIS AND CALLEN 

  Sharing a laugh.  And suddenly Paris  laughter dies as she 
  sees Roy...

  And a moment later, he sees her.  The bullpen falls silent as 
  everyone senses the rise in temperature. The tension is 
  palpable.  

                              PARIS
                Roy.

                              ROY
                Sorry to hear about Danny.

                He s going to be okay.

                              ROY
                Good.

  An awkward moment, then Hetty steps in...

                              HETTY
                   Evening, Roy.

                              ROY

                              HETTY
                You re early.

  Roy shrugs and we get the sense he s always early.

                              HETTY (cont d)
                Paris, Roy s going to be filling in 
                until Danny s fit for duty.

  Paris reacts.  A long moment, then --  POW! She punches Roy  *
  in the face.  Hard.

  And heads for the door.

  Roy ruefully rubs his jaw. *

  Granger winces.

  And off Hetty, her will being tested, we...

  FADE TO BLACK
