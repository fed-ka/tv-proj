            Johnny/Messenger in torn black jeans and black thermal
          long-sleeve with a logoed, messenger service's shirt draped
          over it, and also a very scuffed black safety helmet,
          kneepads and elbow pads, and wrap-around mirror-lens Oakley
            shades... does a daring stunt (tbd) down and across stairs,
          ending with a perfect bar spin on his way to the concrete
          below.

          Mort is a homeless man in desperate condition... he stands
          outside a coffee shop, holds a sign, "Veteran, please
          help"... picks up a half-eaten scone from a garbage can...
          coughs a phlegmy cough... sees a businessman walking into
          the coffee shop...

                                          JOHNNY/MORT
                        Spare some change for a cup of
                        coffee, sir?

          The man looks at him with disgust but gives him a
          quarter...

                        God bless, sir.

          He coughs again.

          His eyes narrow as the vision ends... he frowns...

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I knew who you were or where
                        to find you, I'd get you some
                        cough medicine, my friend.

          He rinses his hair out...



          Everything is sideways.  ANGLE DOWNWARDS toward the ground. 
          No buildings or cars are visible -- there's only concrete,
          a few weeds, nothing to reveal where this is taking
          place... a dozen feet are rushing towards the CAMERA. 
          Clearly something terrible has happened -- we realize
          this is the POV of a person lying there...  Over this the

          The PT Cruiser parallel parks and Johnny and Bruce leap
          out and head into a walkway between buildings.  Revealing:



          Johnny emerges on the edge of a vast pedestrian plaza,
          bordered by stores, restaurants, businesses.  It's a few
          blocks long, full of people.  He turns excited, manic.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes!  This is it!  This is the
                        place.

          GONG!  Clock strikes one.  Johnny sees a clock tower rising
          above the plaza, the tallest structure around.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The clock tower!  It's one o'clock! 
                        We only have two hours.   

          A RUMBLING NOISE grows.  Johnny recognizes the sound,
          turns to see --

          Johnny starts to follow but with his cane, he's never
          going to catch anyone... Bruce follows Johnny's lead...
          takes off after the messenger... but even for him, it's
          quickly clear it's a useless cause... the messenger is
          well ahead already... in fact, as Johnny reacts to a new
          vision --

          glancing back at Johnny and Bruce who are slowing down in
          their pursuit well behind him, waving their arms but it's
          unclear why they're signaling or to whom and

                        Long story...

          They begin to walk.  Sotto exchange as Bruce and Johnny
          hang back a few steps --

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you touch him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you touch him?  Was he the
                        guy you saw on the pavement or
                        not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's really sick.  I think it's a
                        pretty good bet that...

                                        BRUCE
                        You didn't touch him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're gonna have to touch him.

          Johnny looks up at Mort who's walking a few feet in front
          of them now... the idea of touching him is not at all
            appealing... but he catches up and pats Mort on the back
          of the neck with his hand...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're gonna be okay, Mort...

                                        MORT
                        Yeah, yeah, I really got to quit
                          smoking, you know.  I been
                          promising myself for years.

          Johnny rejoins Bruce...

                                        BRUCE
                        So?

                                        JOHNNY
                        So he's got a temperature.  That's
                        all I can tell you.

          Johnny and Bruce come outside.  (Sign on door reads
            "Piscataquis Free Clinic"). 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have a good feeling about this,
                        Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        A good feeling... like a good
                          feeling?  Or a good feeling... 
                        like Johnny's got a feeling...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just a good feeling.  I mean of
                        all the people... Mort is the one
                        who was clearly at risk... you
                        heard the doctor...
                                (beat)
                        I think we actually may have found
                        the right guy first time out...

                                        BRUCE
                          Think... like a regular 'think'
                        or like Johnny thinks...

          But Bruce looks at Johnny, realizing he isn't paying
          attention.  Because he's going into a vision.



          On a bench, lonely Bob/Johnny sits consoling pregnant
            Shari/Johnny.  They're sharing popcorn with the birds. 
          Then Shari/Johnny looks up to see... a hulking tattooed
          horror of a man (CLYDE) riding in on a monster Harley,
          climbing down and moving angrily down the stairs towards
          them...

            Suddenly, Johnny/Messenger breezes by on his bike and
          does a dangerous jump down the stairway... leading us to
            Fatty/Johnny coming out of a drugstore where he's got a
          small box of pink bismuth pills for TUMMYACHES that he's
          opening... but pauses as his attention is drawn skyward
          where he sees --

          his yellow shirt, clearly visible, as he stands on the
          roof of a six story building next to the bookstore...  



          Johnny is stunned.

                                        BRUCE
                        What?  

          GONG!  GONG!  Clock tower rings two o'clock.   Johnny
          reacts as --


  5959THE DEATH VISION

          as we saw it before - the POV of a dying person staring
            downwards toward the ground as feet rush up to him or
          her... one more GONG.

                        I've gotten to know you a little
                        over the last couple of weeks.

                        I know about the job.  The horse's
                        ass of a manager.  Your writing. 
                        I know you're feeling like you
                        want to... to give up...

          Jonah is bursting with feelings that he hasn't been able
          to share with anyone and now here is this guy who's
          reaching out to him... this psychic who, in the familiar
          phrase, knows his pain...

          But at the same time, he looks over and sees the manager
          giving him the eye... he picks up a random book as though
          to show it to Johnny, turns his back to the manager...
          Johnny plays along as needed... much of this is sotto...

                        just here to do what I can.

          Jonah is touched.  Johnny's cell phone rings... he answers
          it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, Bruce...?

                                                                            INTERCUTTING:



          Bruce, completely out of breath.  Revealing, as he speaks,
          BOB and SHARI walking together, sharing popcorn they just
            bought...  Bruce watches them from a discreet distance...

                                        BRUCE
                        I just missed the messenger again,
                        but I have a couple moving from
                        the popcorn cart toward a park
                        bench, male overheard identifying
                        himself in conversation as 'Bob' --
                          mid-thirties, five-four, wearing
                        penny loafers, last year's pony-
                        tail, your basic loser type;
                        female, partially i-d'ed as Shari,
                          Shirley, or Charlize is late
                          twenties, sad eyes, wearing the
                          giraffes...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Harley?

                                        BRUCE
                        No sign of the Harley guy yet...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll be right there.

          End Intercutting.  Johnny looks back to Jonah whose
          writer's mind is working...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have another... 'client' to see
                        while I'm here.  Can we talk more
                        about this later?  

                                        JONAH
                        My break is at three.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good.  I'll meet you here.
                                (as he leaves, to
                                  Jonah, for the benefit
                                of the manager)
                        Gift wrap all ten of those, I'll
                        be back later to pick them up.  

          Johnny heads towards the door, torn between getting to
          Bruce and making sure Jonah is okay. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        At three oh one. 

          And he's out the door, moving fast.  Jonah's spirits are
          clearly lifted.  

                                        BOOKSTORE MANAGER
                        Ten books.  Not bad.  What'd he
                        buy?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - ACT THREE - REV. 9/20/02 YELLOW  39.

          For the first time, Jonah looks at the book in his hands. 
          It's the Star Trek: Insurrection hardcover novel, marked
          down for the bargain table.

                                        BOOKSTORE MANAGER
                          Finally.  I never thought we'd
                        move those.

          The bookstore manager hands Jonah some mail that came in
          for him...

                                        BOOKSTORE MANAGER
                        Hey, by the way, Hemingway, I
                        told you not to get your mail
                        sent here.

          Jonah looks at the return address.  "Beyond the Grave
            Magazine"...  Jonah rips it open...

          Those fateful words of a form letter: "We regret to inform
          you..."


  7171JONAH

          frowns as his heart sinks... and any optimism that Johnny
          Smith brought into his life is fading quickly away...
          he's not safe yet.  



          Johnny moves as quickly as he can towards the opposite
          end of the plaza.  He looks at the clock tower.  Two
          forty.  Johnny picks up the pace.


  7373AT THE PARK BENCH WITH SHARI AND BOB

          as they feed popcorn to the pigeons...

                                        SHARI
                        I've just been going through a

                                        BOB (CONT'D)
                                (off her surprise)
                        I hear you on the phone sometimes
                        with your boyfriend... not that I
                          eavesdrop but when you work in
                        the cubicle next door...

                                        SHARI
                        You just can't help it, I know...

          She laughs... then admits...

                        I hear you too sometimes...

                        I felt so bad for you... all those
                        stupid girls... you're such a
                        nice guy...
                                (off his reaction)
                        After three years in the next
                          cubicle, you get a feeling about
                        someone...

                                        BOB
                        Why... why didn't you ever...

          And in the midst of this intimate moment...

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Hi...

          They look up... who would be so rude?   Revealing Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Johnny Smith, maybe you've heard
                        of me.  Visions.  Past, present,
                        future.  Can we cut to the chase
                        here?  

          He squeezes between the incredulous couple on the bench...
          holding both their hands, perhaps yield a tiny sound effect
          on his touch... they exchange an incredulous glance... 
          {And let me try to explain the rules here so we all
          understand: Johnny has interceded now and can see a new
          future for them.  But now that he's involved, the
            circumstances are changing every instant until he
          disconnects and if a wrong move is made, the consequences
          might still turn ugly.)

                                (in a hurry)
                        You two are meant for each other. 
                        Every other relationship up to
                        this point has been meaningless. 
                        Bob, your loneliness has come to
                        an end.  Shirley, you'll never
                        date a jerk again.

                                        SHARI
                        It's Shari.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Whatever.  Bob's going to be your
                        Lamaze partner.  And he's going
                        to be the perfect father, going
                        to every little league game and
                          changing the messiest of diapers.

          The far off sound of a Harley... Bruce is standing a few
          yards away...

          Johnny acknowledges... rushes faster...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Bob)
                        You'll also have your own child
                          together who will be a perfect
                        kid despite a bad allergy to
                          strawberries.
                                (to both)
                        After you each move out of your
                        respective apartments you'll buy
                        a cute little two bedroom Cape
                        Cod that will be somewhat out of
                        your range, but a second mortgage
                        and a promotion will keep you
                        warm and happy there for years to
                        come, surrounded by your loving
                          children....

          Now, the ROAR of an engine.  He glances towards the street,
          and sees...


          A HARLEY

          And sitting atop it, CLYDE, the tattooed monster coming
          towards the couple on the bench in Johnny's vision.  Shari
          reacts at the sight of her angry boyfriend.

                        Just one thing.  In order for
                        these wonderful things to occur,
                        it would be extremely wise for
                        you to get out of here NOW!

          Bob and Shari (and Bruce) are startled.  Clyde is on way
          across the yard now... murder in his eyes...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go.  We'll hold him off.

                        We...?

          Johnny boldly steps in Clyde's path... the gorilla towers
          over both Johnny and Bruce...  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi.  How are you?  My name is
                        Johnny OOF!

          The OOF comes as Clyde lands a solid body blow to Johnny's
          stomach.  Johnny goes down.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey!

          Bruce races towards Clyde.  WHAM!  Clyde knocks Bruce
            backwards with one huge swipe.

          Now Clyde heads towards Shari and Bob.

                                        SHARI
                          Clyde... don't do this...

          Clyde ignores her...

                                        BOB
                        You heard her, Clyde.

          And grabs Clyde's arm and in a stunning series of Aikido
          moves - known as Nikyo, Ikkyo, Koshi Nage - uses Clyde's
          weight to throw him over his hip.  Clyde ends up on his
          back, on the ground, not far from Johnny and Bruce, also
          on the ground.

                                        BRUCE
                                (through pain)

                        not to eat the oysters.  You should

                        left?

8686A JOHNNY VISION - THE DOMINOES WHICH ARE ABOUT TO FALL...

          (This vision will utilize both the array shot we used in
          the Vietnam vision in the pilot, and the quick reverse
          effect we used to backtrack Malcolm's steps in "Enemy
          Mind" -- except this time the action moves FORWARD.)  We
          start at normal speed with:

            SHARI/BOB

          at the flower stand, kissing... Shari holds a bouquet of
          flowers that Bob just gave her... Johnny stands behind
          them, watching.  We follow this action for only a second
          or two, when Shari, feeling generous in her new found
          happiness, whimsically decides to hand a flower to FATTY,
          who is carrying a boxed pizza... Fatty, touched by this
          unexpected gift, takes the flower, and we FREEZE.  (Note:
          Johnny is NOT frozen...)

          Johnny absorbs this significant moment.  The messenger is
          visible in the distance at the top of the stairs...  Then
          the action UNFREEZES, rolls forward at normal speed for a
          second, and then we FAST FORWARD.  The crowd of people
          whips by.  Fatty heads down the stairs, and then we FREEZE
          again...

          Johnny walks down the stairs through the frozen people
          and hovering pieces of litter and blowing leaves to find...


          FATTY - FROZEN

          giving a few coins to Mort (he's covered by a new, space
          age camping blanket, wears a new coat and hat, etc., and
          humorously, Mort's friend sitting next to him is covered
          in the EXACT same gear -- obviously Mort spent Johnny's
          money on both of them).  Fatty already gave Mort's friend
          his pizza, and now Mort's coins are frozen in mid-air,
          half way to a shiny chromed thermos cup Mort is holding
          (another recent purchase at the sporting goods store)...

          The bike messenger is frozen nearby...  Bruce is visibly
          getting closer in the distance... Johnny absorbs this new
          moment for a beat... Then we UNFREEZE as Fatty's coins
          drop into the cup... Mort lowers his cup, then FREEZE...


          THE CUP - FROZEN

          at the perfect spot to reflect a ray of sunlight right
          into the eyes of:


          JONAH - FROZEN

          The ray of light is visible like a laser beam, and Johnny
          follows it over to Jonah who sits on the steps wincing
          from the sudden glare in the eyes.  Then, we UNFREEZE... 
          Jonah reacts to the light, looks up from his notebook,
          SEES the biker coming down the stairs... SEES the Tercel
          coming around the truck...

            FREEZE... 


  8787ON THE ROOF WITH JOHNNY

          a push into his face... as he reacts... smiles knowingly
          as he is filled with wonder by what's about to happen...
          he knows, even if we don't yet...

          Now we see the dominos fall in real time. (This entire
          event takes eleven seconds.)

          Like a child looking down on a game board, Johnny watches
          the pieces of this mousetrap-like game go through their
            movements...

          FATTY gets the flower from BOB and SHARI.

          FATTY walks down the stairs as the MESSENGER begins his
          high speed cross of the square.

          The TERCEL starts to come around the truck.

          FATTY arrives at MORT and drops money into his cup, the
          tiniest bit of glare visible in the distance...

          JONAH reacts to the light...          DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - ACT FOUR - REV. 9/30/02 GRN2  52.

            MESSENGER launches off stairs...

          JONAH dives, knocking MESSENGER off bike as it slides
          under TERCEL...



          The bike is crushed by the Tercel at the very spot Johnny
          had his vision.  As people gather to see what happened,
          Bob and Shari and Fatty all stand in the group... Bruce
          arrives last among them... GONG, GONG, GONG!  goes the
          clock.  Like the heavenly music of miracles.  The messenger
          removes her helmet to reveal she's a girl, a cute one at
          that...

                                        JONAH
                        You okay?

                                        MESSENGER
                        I think so.
                                (looking at her bike)
                        I never saw him coming.  Good
                        thing you were here.

                                        JONAH
                        Yeah.


          ANGLE ON BRUCE

          who understands the big picture...

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah.  Real good thing.

          He turns and looks toward the building and we move to
          find the tiny silhouette of Johnny Smith standing against
          the sky towering over the Plaza... 

          NOTE: AT THE END OF THE KARMA SCENE... WE SHOULD PROBABLY*
          END WITH A SHOT OF OUR 'FAMILY', LOOKING ON AT THE NEAR*
          DISASTER - TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME, NONE OF*
          THEM (EXCEPT JONAH) REALIZING HOW THEY CONTRIBUTED TO*
          SAVING THE DAY... AND THEN SPLITTING UP AND GOING ON WITH*
          THEIR SEPARATE LIVES AS WE DISSOLVE SLOWLY...*



          Bruce and Johnny sit by the fountains, enjoying the*
          serenity of the gurgling water and the empty plaza...*

                        right about now, I'm trying not*

                        me as a muse anymore, he's found*
                        a real one in the messenger girl...*

                                        BRUCE*

                        in visions...*

                        So I noticed... oh, speaking of*
                        the future, Mort might be coming*

                        You know if it ever gets really*
                        cold... I gave him your address...*
                                (off Johnny's look)*
                        You can give him the east wing*
                        for a night or two.  You can use*
                        the company.  He's a great*
                          raconteur.*

          Johnny shrugs, what the hell... rises to leave...*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        I'm meeting Barclay for dinner,*
