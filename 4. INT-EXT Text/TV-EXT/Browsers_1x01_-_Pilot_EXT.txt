        ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF AN ORDINARY SEPTEMBER MONDAY MORNING. 
      KATE, 22, ATTRACTIVE, NEUROTIC, CASUALLY DRESSED, WALKS OUT 
      OF HER APARTMENT BUILDING DOOR ONTO THE STREET, WEARING 
      EARPHONES. DISNEYESQUE MUSIC BEGINS WHEN SHE CLOSES THE DOOR; 
      THOUGH LOUD, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT S COMING FROM HER EARPHONES. 
      SHE SINGS TO THE CAMERA, MUSICAL-THEATERY OVER-THE-TOP CHEERY 
      AT FIRST, BUT QUICKLY LOSING CONFIDENCE.

                                    KATE
                      Hello, Monday morning!
                    Oh, how wonderful you feel!
                      You re just like me: you re breezy, 
                      bright, and sunny!
                    And although I may be slightly stressed, 
                    And my heart is pounding in my chest,
                    And I got four hours of sleep at best, 
                    And I'm either manic or depressed,
                    And I'm overwhelmed and underdressed...
                          (The music ends awkwardly. 
                            She looks at herself)
                        Under-underdressed, actually. Like, 
                    slut.
                          (Looks at her chest)
                      Aaaand I m nippin  out. So dumb 
                    slut.
                          (Turns around, walks away)
                      Headlights on and nobody home.
                          (Keeps walking away)
                      I should not be trusted with me.

      SHE KEEPS WALKING FOR AN AWKWARD SECOND.    BROWSERS - 10/25/122



      THE EXACT SAME ESTABLISHING SHOTS. ONCE AGAIN KATE EMERGES, 
      THIS TIME IN DRESSIER CLOTHES, AND TO LESS DISNEYESQUE, 
       REALER  MUSIC THAT SOUNDS MUCH FULLER. NO ONE ELSE NOTICES 
      HER OR EXPRESSES AWARENESS THAT SHE S SINGING AS SHE WALKS.

                                    KATE
                      Hello, Monday morning.
                    So listen, here s the deal:
                    I am starting at a job that pays no 
                      money.
                    I m twenty-two and I live in Queens,


      KATE DESCENDS DOWN A SUBWAY STAIRCASE.

                                    KATE (O.S.)
                    And I'm kind of lost, and a bit confused,
                    But I can t help feeling amused


      GABE, 22, BLACK, GAY, STRIDES THROUGH PENN STATION, FASTER 
      AND MORE CONFIDENT THAN OTHER COMMUTERS. HE SINGS PROUDLY TO 
      THE CAMERA.

                                    GABE
                    So much injustice worth fighting!
                    So many wrongs worth destroying!
                    I m gonna go make a difference!
                    It s gonna make me annoying!


      PRUDENCE, 22, CHINESE-AMERICAN, STONED, STANDS IN AN URBAN 
      APPEARS TO HAVE THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF HUMAN EMOTIONS ARE HER 
      DISPOSAL.

                                    JULIANNA (V.O.)
                    It's a huge operation I'm running,
                    And I keep it from running amok
                    By making it known to both bigwig 
                    and drone
                    That I'm someone with whom not to 
                    fuck.

      AN INSTRUMENTAL BREAK IN WHICH WE SEE GABE RETURNING TO THE 
      BULLPEN AREA WITH JUSTIN. HE IS GREETED BY PRUDENCE AND JOSH 
      AND GIVES KATE A BIG HUG. WE CUT AWAY TO A SHOT OF CASSIE RE-
      WATCHING THE CLIP THAT JOSH SUBMITTED. SHE SIGHS AND GIVES A 
       MAYBE IT S NOT SO BAD  GESTURE.

                                    VICKY
                            (Loudly)
                    Hey, um... Josh?

      CUT TO A VERY, VERY SLOW CLOSE-UP OF AN UNHAPPY 23-YEAR-OLD 
      WORKING BEHIND THE COUNTER AT QUIZNO S. HE HAS A NAMETAG THAT 
      SAYS  EVAN . HE STARES FORLORNLY AT THE CAMERA.

                                    JULIANNA (V.O.)
                    It's nothing I want people 
                      stressing about.
                    In fact, people's stress level 
                    falls off
                    As soon as they're free of the 
                      burden of doubt
                    As to whether I might cut their 
                    balls off.

      WE FINALLY COME BACK  LIVE  TO JULIANNA, WHO IS DOING YOGA ON 
      A MAT IN HER OFFICE. HER EYES ARE CLOSED. SHE IS IN AN 
      IMPRESSIVE STRETCH POSITION. SHE SINGS.

                    But for now, I'm content to do yoga
                    And serenely await the next schmuck
                    Who walks in my room
                    And brings on his doom
                    By being naive enough not to assume
                    I'm someone with whom...
                          (Opens her eyes, looks at 
                            camera)
                    Not to fuck.

      SHE SMILES. THE SONG ENDS.     BROWSERS - 10/25/1236


      AS THE MUSIC OF THE OPENING SONG BEGINS WE DISSOLVE TO THE 
      FOUR NEW INTERNS TALKING TO EACH OTHER ON THE ELEVATOR AT THE 
      END OF THE DAY. THEY HAVE CLEARLY BONDED. THEY WALK OUT THE 
      DOOR; EVERYONE BUT GABE GOES ONE WAY; GABE WAVES GOODBYE AND 
      BEGINS WALKING DOWN THE STREET; HE SINGS.

                                    GABE
                    This is my life
                    And I very nearly blew it.

      PRUDENCE SITS AT A TABLE AT QUIZNO S EATING A SANDWICH. 

                                    PRUDENCE
                    This is my life,
                    And I'm glad I'm passing through it.

      JOSH IS IN BACK IN HIS BEDROOM ON HIS COMPUTER, WATCHING THE 
      BARE MINIMUM VIDEO ON GUSH, SMILING. HE  THINK-SINGS .

                                    JOSH
                    That is my life!
                      That s it right there
                    On the site - there,
                      That s my link!

      FINALLY, KATE RETURNS TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE APARTMENT 
      BUILDING WE SAW HER LEAVE AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW. 

                                    KATE
                    For a first day...

      SHE THINKS FOR A MOMENT. WE SEE A VERY BRIEF MEMORY SHOT OF 
      JUSTIN FROM HIS LAST CONVERSATION WITH HER. SHE SMILES.

                                    KATE
                      There s potential, I think.

      SHE TURNS THE KEY AND WALKS IN. HER IMAGE STOPS, AS AT THE 
      END OF A MOVIE PLAYED BACK ON YOUTUBE. THE CURSOR OF GOD 
      REAPPEARS AND CLICKS THE  X  BUTTON IN THE TOP RIGHT. THE 
      IMAGE DISAPPEARS.
