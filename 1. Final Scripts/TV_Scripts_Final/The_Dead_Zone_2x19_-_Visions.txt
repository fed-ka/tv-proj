  11OMITTED


  22EXT. STADIUM TRACK - DAY

          It's one of those days that make you understand why people
          spend their summers in Maine.  The stadium seats are empty,
          but the field is buzzing with activity, as this is the
          finish line/reception area for a town-wide MARATHON. 

          CROWDS mill around booths selling juice, snacks, balloons,
          etc.  A van from a local RADIO STATION broadcasts live
          from the summer event.     

          Most people are cheering the runners as they come into
          the home stretch.  JOHNNY, SARAH, and J.J. are in the
          crowd.  J.J. is holding a paper water cup, craning his
          head to look down the line.

          Johnny is barely watching the race, mind elsewhere.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny.  Johnny.

          He snaps out of his funk, looks at her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, what?

                                        SARAH
                        You feeling okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Huh?  Yeah.  I'm having a great
                        time...

                                        SARAH
                        Staring at your shoes?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're really cool.

          Sarah shakes her head, then considers something else.

                                        SARAH
                        You weren't having a vision, were
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually, I was.  I saw myself,
                        at home, watching ESPN.

                                        SARAH
                        If you didn't want to come, you
                          should've said something.  You
                        used to love this marathon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's 'cause I was running in
                        it.
                                (beat)
                        And way before it was called the
                        "Faith Heritage Alliance Race for
                        Peace."

          (There may be a banner somewhere declaring just that.)

                                        SARAH
                        Who cares who sponsors it, it's
                        still a fun event for a good cause. 

          Johnny watches the runners come in.  Most wear white,
          some have peace slogans on their shirts or headbands.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (muttering to himself)
                        A cause with no effect.

  2CONTINUED: (2)2

          Johnny looks back to the marathon, and we drift into slow
            motion... sound becomes hollow as we watch people running,
          crossing the finish line, totally in the moment, unaware
          of the fate that he's seen for all of them.

                                        J.J. (O.S.)
                        Dad!

          Johnny turns to see WALT, running in shorts and a muscle
          shirt proclaiming "Penobscot County Sheriff Dept.," waving
          to cheering neighbors as he crosses the finish line.

          J.J. runs up to Walt with his cup of water, and Sarah
          follows him, clapping.  Johnny smiles as Walt scoops J.J.
          up into his arms.  Walt doesn't look that winded as he
          hams it up for J.J. 

                                        WALT
                        Did I win?  Did I win? 

          J.J. laughs, pouring the water cup over Walt's head. 
          Walt pulls Sarah into his embrace.  Johnny watches from a
            distance, a smile still on his face, however distant.  

                                        HOMELESS MAN (O.S.)
                        You have no meaning!  You mean
                          nothing!

          Johnny turns to see a HOMELESS MAN (he guesses) ranting
          and raving over by some recycling and trash bins.  The
          Man is wearing a dark, torn overcoat, boots, and a hood
          in the summer heat.  He is muttering loudly to spectators. 
          They are all pointedly ignoring him, but he continues.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        You're all dead.  Why bother? 
                        What?  What do you want me to
                        say, the end is coming?  The sky
                        is falling?

          Johnny stares harder, and then realizes... he recognizes
          this man.  Gripping his cane in hand, he begins to walk
          over.  As he nears, Johnny sees how ripped up the clothes
          are.  The look is Grim Reaper by way of Salvation Army. 

          The Man's left hand is jammed into his left pocket.

  2CONTINUED: (3)2

          His other hand gestures wildly.  The Man suddenly stops
          and POINTS DIRECTLY AT JOHNNY, spitting rage.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        Don't come any closer!  Shame on
                        you, Johnny Smith!  Shame on you
                        for what you've done to these
                        people!

          Johnny tenses.  This guy knows him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me?

          Johnny can see the Man's face; a face half scarred, maybe
          burned.  A face he's seen before.  A face that freezes
          him in his tracks.  The face twists into a pained smile. 

          The Man jams his free hand into its pocket and walks around
          the corner into the tunnels under the stadium.

          Johnny hurries after him in the same shot.  He rounds the
          corner only to find the tunnel empty.  Johnny can see way
          down the tunnel before it begins to turn. 

          There are no doors, nothing to hide behind.  Whoever the
          Man was, he just vanished into thin air.  Johnny, freaked
          out, turns to see if anyone else saw this.  No one did. 
          He is alone in the tunnel.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  33INT. SMITH HOME - DAY

          Johnny mixes a drink at the wet bar.  Bruce watches him,
          a little worried.

                                        BRUCE
                        A homeless guy?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's not homeless, who knows. 
                        The point is, this wasn't the
                        first time I've seen him.

          Johnny takes a drink.  He needs it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Seen him seen him, or...
                                (points to head)
                        Seen him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's not a vision, Bruce.  The
                        people in my visions usually don't
                        turn to look and talk to me...

          His voice trails off, uncertain.

                                        BRUCE
                        When was the first time you saw
                        him?

          Johnny thinks about it, draws a deep breath.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The first time was during the
                          storm...

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                        for this one guy.

                        Yeah, but that doesn't explain
                        the second time I saw him.

                        Why didn't you say anything about
                        this before?

          Johnny mimes holding a phone to his ear.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Bruce, what's goin' on?  Me? 
                        Oh, I just keep seeing this
                          mountain man circus freak
                          everywhere...

                                        BRUCE
                          ...Who's not a vision.

          Johnny suddenly becomes serious, showing signs of the
          strain these cumulative sightings have had on him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I get visions off of touch, and I
                        wasn't touching anything.  If
                        you've got another theory, I'd
                        love to hear it.

                                        BRUCE
                        How about you've got someone
                          stalking you? 

          Johnny shakes his head, he doesn't think so.

                                        BRUCE
                        There's something you're not
                        telling me.  You said he yelled
                        at you.  What'd he say?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (covering)
                        It... was just rambling.  About
                        the end of the world.  Typical
                        crazy man at the fair stuff. 
                        Didn't make any sense.

          Bruce studies him, not convinced.


  88EXT. SMITH HOME - NIGHT

          From the right angle it looks like a haunted mansion.


  99INT. SMITH HOME - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Shooting down empty hallways, stairwells.  Anyone, anything
          could be lurking in the deep recesses of shadow.

          In the KITCHEN, we move in on the security monitor, now
          displaying a view of the darkened driveway.  Maybe we
          think we see something move, maybe not.


  1010INT. SMITH HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

          Johnny pulls the cover off of the bulletin board with his
            articles, diagrams, and notes concerning the most important
          vision he's had... the vision of Armageddon.

          Johnny pulls up a chair and sits in front of the board,
          resting both of his hands on his cane.  He scans the board. 
          Pictures of Stillson, Purdy, the Washington Monument.

          Johnny's eyes rove past post-it notes like "Shady Pines -
          Need Witness", "Sonny Elliman," and "Satellite?" A
            patchwork of questions and media hieroglyphics, all leading
          to the very declarative photo of a MUSHROOM CLOUD.

                                        HOMELESS MAN (O.S.)
                        That's a sick hobby you've got
                        there.

          The is voice right behind his ear.  Johnny's chair KNOCKS
          OVER as he SPRINGS UP, whirling around and holding his
          cane like a bat, ready to swing...

          The Homeless Man is standing on the upper landing of the
          basement stairs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Get the hell out of my house!

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        So this is where you study the
                        end of the world.

          Johnny tenses as he sees the man's hand in his coat pocket,
          possibly concealing a gun or a knife.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want?

          Johnny has backed to his tool bench.  He scoops up a wicked
          looking Black and Decker POWER DRILL with 12 inch bit,
          pointing it at the Homeless Man. 

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        I want you to get in your car.  I
                        want you to drive to New York. 
                        White Plains.  Thirteen-fifty-six
                          Primrose Lane.  Blue House.  Before
                        it's too late.

          The Man nods to the Armageddon board, and Johnny's eyes
          flick over to it.  Then, the Man turns and begins to walk
          up the stairs. 

          Johnny hurries up the stairs after him, drill in hand.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT ONE - 06/25/03 - GREEN        9.


  1111INT. SMITH HOME - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny stalks through his house, fear having released
          adrenaline and anger.  He's done with crackpots breaking
          into his home.  He moves deliberately, power drill leveled
          like a Magnum.  He reaches the front door.

          Not only is it locked, it's chained and dead-bolted.


  1212KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          He checks the security system.  All lights are green. 
          Triggers a system check.  No reported breaches.

          Johnny stands there, baffled.


  1313INT. SMITH HOME - BASEMENT

          Johnny descends the last few steps.  Crosses to the board. 
          He stands in silence for a beat, mind spinning.  Then, he
          takes a marker, and writes something on the board, right
          across the photo of the mushroom cloud.  

          He stands back to stare at what he's done. We see a sort
          of confusion creep into his eyes, followed by a dawning
            realization.  PER-LAP sound of a RINGING PHONE...

                        leave a message.

          Stock Shot flying over the hilly terrain surrounding the
          wealthy town of White Plains, NY.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Hey, it's me.  Listen, I'm heading
                        out of town, tonight.  Bruce, I
                        saw him again.


  1616EXT. PRIMROSE LANE - DAY

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        He came to my house.  I think he
                        knows what I've seen, about
                          Armageddon.  He told me to drive
                        to New York... and I don't know
                        why, but I feel I've got to be
                        there.  Call you from the road...

          Johnny's jeep pulls up next to the street sign.  Nice,
          upper middle class homes line the street, and it looks
          like nothing bad could happen here.  Johnny gets out.


          TRACKING WITH JOHNNY'S CANE

          As it keeps pace with him.  He approaches...


          JOHNNY'S POV - A MAILBOX

          The old-fashioned kind with a red flag.  This one has a
          white cursive "1356" on it.  The name "WEY" is on the
          door.  The door opens as a LITTLE GIRL runs up and pulls
          it down, taking out a big handful of mail.  She smiles at
          Johnny and runs back to her HOUSE.     

          It's a blue House - white and light blue, that is.  Classy,
            inviting, not obnoxious. 

          A WOMAN (MADELEINE)is walking across the lawn toward the
          girl.  Mid-thirties, beautiful but not overdone. 

                                        MADELEINE
                        Let's see.
                                (the mail)

                                        LITTLE GIRL
                        I want to bring it in!

          The girl runs past her Mom, up to the porch steps.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT ONE - 06/23/03 - BLUE        11.


    16CONTINUED:16

          She slips on the second step, not seriously, and the mail
          flutters to the ground.  Madeleine shakes her head, and
          starts to pick it up.  She catches Johnny watching from
          the street, and gives him a polite smile. 

          Johnny returns the smile, but is disturbed by the scene:
          why was he told to come here?  Just then, he hears, then
          SEES a BLACK MERCEDES SPORTS CAR humming down the street
          toward him.

          He steps closer to the curb to let it pass.  It slows as
          it approaches, pulling into the driveway, DRIVER looking
          at Johnny through the side window.

          It is the HOMELESS MAN.  Except he has no burns on his
          face, and is wearing a clean, short sleeved polo shirt!

          Johnny tenses up as the car parks in front of the garage,
          and the Man gets out, looking back at Johnny. 

          The girl stops helping Mom pick up mail, and runs to...

                                        LITTLE GIRL
                        Daddy!

          She jumps into the Man's arms.  He kisses her, and moves
          on, glancing at Johnny as he carries her down the walk.
          He passes his Wife, as he heads up the steps, saying
            something to her as he heads in.  She follows up the steps,
          glancing back at Johnny before she closes the door.      

          Johnny hesitates, not sure what to do.  He tentatively
          takes a step toward the house, and soon finds himself at
          the front door.  Rings the doorbell. 

          A beat later, Madeleine answers the door.  Johnny misses
          the beat to introduce himself; this is just too strange.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Hi.  Can I help you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Um, yeah.  I was looking for your
                          husband.  I think.

          He winces at himself.  She looks suspicious.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Can I ask what this is regarding?

          The little girl, JULIA, precociously pokes her head between
          her Mom's legs, and looks up at Johnny.

                                        JULIA
                          Bonjour.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bonjour.  Comment allez vous?

                                        JULIA
                        Va Bien, Merci.

          This gets a smile out of Madeleine, relaxing her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry, I've been on the road
                        for over ten hours, and I'm a
                        little out of it.  My name's Johnny
                        Smith, I just drove down here
                        from Maine.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Maine?

          The Man, who's name is CHRISTOPHER, shows up.

                                          CHRISTOPHER (O.S.)
                        Maddy?

          He looks out the door, gives Johnny the once-over.  Johnny
          stares into his eyes.  It's definitely the same guy. 
          Without the burns he's actually handsome.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        What's going on?

          She looks back and forth between Johnny and Christopher.

                                        MADELEINE
                        You don't recognize him?

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        No.  Listen, we're not interested.

          He moves to close the door.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait a minute, you have nothing
                        to say to me?

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Excuse me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is all this?
                                (beat)
                        What's your name?

          Christopher bristles at Johnny's tone.

                        my porch, that's my name.

            MADELEINE tries to keep the peace.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Mr. Smith, I think maybe you've
                        got the wrong address.  This is
                        1356 Primrose Lane, we're the
                        Weys.  W-E-Y.  I'm Madeleine,
                        this is Christopher, you've met
                          Julia...

          Johnny does not know what to make of this.  Chris does.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Like she said, you have the wrong
                          address.

          His forceful tone draws a curious glance from Madeleine.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's wrong, I'll give you
                        that.

          Christopher gives Maddy a "get inside" look.  She does so
          with reluctance, taking Julia with her.  Christopher stares
          Johnny down, speaking in a lower, more intimate tone.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Who're you with?  Frank's guys? 
                        The 309?  Alright, I get the
                          message.  Now, you listen to me. 
                        My daughter lives here, you
                          understand?  Maybe that's the
                        point; you can get to me.  Just
                        know that I can get to you.  I'm
                        not talking about your boss, I'm
                        talking about you.  Okay, "John
                        Smith?"

          He punctuates this with an aggressive PAT on the shoulder.

          Bruce is with a client/patient, a YOUNG WOMAN who is doing
          provocative stretches, all in the name of nursing her
          Achilles tendon (which is in a support bandage) back to
          health.  He grimaces, on the phone with Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        You need more than my help, man.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        I'm serious.  Bruce, I met a woman,
                        and a little girl, and saw them
                          murdered in a vision.

          Bruce's mood shifts, he whispers into the phone.

                                        BRUCE
                        By your stalker guy?

                        That's where it gets weird.  If
                        it's the same guy, then he's not
                        exactly a stalker.

                        Unless it's not the same guy, but
                        I'm pretty sure it is.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're actually making negative
                        sense.

                        you get off work?  Please?

          In his room, Bruce turns back to the young woman, who
          manages a smile, even though she's vaguely in pain.

                                        YOUNG WOMAN
                        Think that's as far as I can go
                        without a massage.

          Now it's Bruce's turn to feel pain.  He grips the phone.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll head out after lunch.

                        Thanks, Man.  Call me when you
                        get here.  I've gotta check
                          something out...

          Johnny hangs up and gets out of his Jeep.  He slips through
          the fence, into the site. 

          Johnny passes by Christopher's sports car.  As he touches
          it.  RAMP INTO JOHNNY'S FACE...


  23A23AINT. BLACK MERCEDES SPORTS CAR - NIGHT (VISION)

          Parked.  Christopher is in the driver's seat, which is
          reclined all the way back.  A HOT WOMAN, not his wife, is
          on top of him, her blouse undone.  They're going at it
          and JOHNNY watches from the back seat, a trapped voyeur.


  23B23BOUT OF VISION AND BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny pulls his hand away from the car, surprised.  He
          crouches down behind the Mercedes, and watches as Chris
          moves away from the Foreman.

          A WOMAN approaches Christopher.  The same woman from his
          vision, probably his SECRETARY.  Chris grins and pats her
          on the tush.  She reports something to him, and his smile
          disappears.  He asks her a question, and her answer makes
          him swear.  He moves off toward the market site.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT TWO - 06/24/03 - PINK        17.

          Johnny enters and looks up.  Several beams and girders
          are already in place, with plywood ceilings that cut the
          sun off and make things a bit darker in here. 

          Johnny follows the sound of VOICES, proceeding as quietly
          as he can.

          He peeks around a beam and sees Christopher arguing with
          three men from the local construction union. 

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Frank, I'm not ignoring you, and
                        you know I would never disrespect
                        you, but I need you to trust me,
                        okay?  What I don't need, is for
                        you to send guys to my house. 
                        That won't solve anything.

                          Alright, whatever his real name
                        is.  Blonde guy with a cane.

          Suddenly Johnny FEELS something, like the hairs rising on
          the back of his neck.

          He turns to see a familiar SILHOUETTE watching him,
          standing at the end of a double row of steel beams.  The
          figure steps behind one of them. 

          Instead of heading directly there, Johnny moves a different
          way, toward an area where he hopes to cut the man off.

          Johnny gets there, and finds no one here.  Then...

                        are important to you, aren't they?

          The Man glares down at Johnny, starts to pace up there.

          to head off any violence.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Look, what do you want?  Money?

          Christopher is nervous now, thinking Johnny is trying to
            blackmail him.  Johnny looks away, toward the market site,
          where he just talked with the mysterious rag man.  Chris
          follows Johnny's look, curious.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.  You're right.
                                (looks back at Chris)
                        I've made a mistake...

          Christopher looks anxious as Johnny turns to walk away.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

  3333INT. WESTCHESTER POLICE STATION - DAY

          Bruce enters the station, which is quiet but rather busy
          at the same time.  He looks around, apprehensive, then
          spots Johnny, sitting in front of a desk in the bullpen.

          Johnny sees Bruce, waves him over.  Bruce shakes his head,
          and goes.

          He's about to say something when a COP with a slight paunch
          returns to his desk, LT. SANDOWSKI.  He moves with a
          purposeful absence of haste.  He eyes Bruce as he sits.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Who's this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is my friend, Bruce.  Bruce,
                        this is Lieutenant Sandowski.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hi.

            Sandowski nods, writes something down on a pad.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Mind if I get your last name?

                                        BRUCE
                        Lewis.

            Sandowski nods, writes that down.  Bruce looks
            uncomfortably at Johnny.

                        Okay, I'll just go over this again,
                        stop me if I miss a detail.  You
                        claim to have had a psychic
                          premonition that Madeleine Wey
                        and Julia Wey are going to become
                        victims of an assault resulting
                        in murder sometime in the near
                        future, you don't know when, and
                        the perpetrator is most likely a
                          Caucasian male between the ages
                        of 35 and 45, who, with the
                          exception of burn marks on his
                        face, is the spitting image of
                          Christopher Wey.

          Bruce does a slow, what-the-fuck-have-you-been-up-to take
          toward Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I know you can't investigate
                        a crime that hasn't happened, but
                        I feel it's important you know
                        what I've seen. 

            Sandowski taps a pencil against his lips.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        You did the right thing coming in
                        here.  If you have any more
                          premonitions, such as the name of
                        the suspect, let us know.  Until
                        then, I suggest you let us handle
                        this.

          Johnny realizes he's getting the send off.  Sandowski
          looks down at his slip of paper.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Mr. Lewis, would you mind if I
                        got your contact information as

                        How do you always manage to find
                        the most insane situation possible,
                        and then get me stuck in the middle
                        of it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        'Cause I need someone to believe
                        the most insane situation is
                          something that could really happen.

          Johnny rings the doorbell.  Waits.  No answer.  He turns
          to Bruce, who shrugs.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe no one's home.

          Johnny turns back to the door, and knocks.  On his THIRD
          KNOCK, WE SHOOT INTO THE DOOR, THROUGH THE PEEP-HOLE --

          To reveal MADELEINE on the other side, watching.

          Johnny realizes she's watching.  He looks directly into
          the peep-hole, nods to her, and turns to leave.

          He's down the porch steps when the door opens.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Wait.

          Johnny turns around.

                        I probably should've called first.

                                        MADELEINE
                        That's okay, I think I know why

          Johnny and Bruce sit on the couch, a little awkward. 
            Madeleine calls out from the kitchen.

                                        MADELEINE (O.S.)
                        Do you take ice, Bruce?

                        Uh, no thanks.

          She comes out with two glasses of water.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Okay, let's talk.

          She hands a glass to Bruce first, then to Johnny.  As he
          touches it...

          CAMERA 360's around the glass of water, and Madeleine's

            Madeleine is made visibly uncomfortable by his tone.

                                        MADELEINE
                        I just need to know who she is.

          absorbs this while trying not to show it.

                        I've been thinking a lot about

                        Let me take a guess, and tell me
                        how close I am.  My husband is
                          cheating on me, and he's having
                        an affair with someone close to
                        you.  Maybe your wife, or
                          girlfriend.

                        Wow.

          Bruce and Johnny are momentarily caught off guard. 
            Madeleine mistakenly believes that she's hit home.

                                        MADELEINE
                        The last time this happened, I
                        thought it was my fault.  I was
                        working full-time, and so was
                        Chris, and with Julia starting
                        school, I didn't have time to
                        take care of him...

                        to tell you, but, first, I have
                        to explain something about myself,
                        about who I am.  It may be...
                        hard to believe, but I hope you'll
                        hear me out.

                        About seven years ago, I was
                          involved in a car accident.

          Madeleine's demeanor shifts.  She tightens, visibly.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Wait, I'm sorry, does this have

          But he already has.  And she's wondering, why did I let
          these strangers into my house?

                        What I have to tell you, is for
                        your own safety.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Are you saying that I'm not safe

                        Au revoir, Johnny.

          As Johnny is about to reply, as Madeleine takes Julia's
          hand, Johnny looks past her and sees THE HOMELESS MAN
          staring through the back window.

          Johnny drops his glass.  The Man, who we now see has tears
          in his eyes, moves out of sight.  Bruce follows Johnny's
          look to the window.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's on the porch.  He's there,
                        he's right there!

          Bruce jumps into action, running for the French doors
          that lead to the back porch.  Johnny moves to follow.


  3939EXT. PORCH AND BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

          Bruce bursts out onto the porch.  No one here.  He scans
          the backyard, which butts up next to a heavily wooded
          ravine area.  Johnny comes onto the porch beside him.

                                        BRUCE
                        The woods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Told you he's fast.

          Bruce jumps off the porch, powers across the backyard and
          into the woods.  Johnny turns back to a stunned Madeleine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stay inside, lock your doors!

          He runs off after Bruce.  Madeleine shuts the doors and
          locks them, as afraid of Johnny as anyone else, now. 


  4040EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

          Bruce tears through the trees, stops and listens.  Hears
          a faint rustling in the distance.  Runs off that way.

          JOHNNY

          Enters the woods, moving slower than Bruce.

                                        HOMELESS MAN (O.S.)
                          Shouldn't have done that.

          Johnny stops in his tracks, turns to see the Man standing
          there.  Left hand in his pocket.  Right hand at his side.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        You scared her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        At least she's still alive.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        You're making a mistake.  All I
                        wanted to do was to see my family.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your family?

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        Yes.  And I can only look at them,
                        when you look at them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who the hell are you?

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        My name is Christopher Wey.  Or
                        at least, it used to be.  It
                        doesn't matter anymore. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't understand...

                                        WEY
                        What if I told you I wasn't really
                          standing here?  That you were
                        having a vision of me standing
                        here.  And that I am really
                          standing somewhere else, several
                        years into the future...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd say that you don't know how
                        my visions work.  I need to be
                          touching something. 

          Wey takes his hand out of his pocket.  Fingers open to
          reveal a small silver knob.  Johnny's heart catches as he
          recognizes it.  IT IS THE HEAD PIECE OF HIS CANE.

                                        HOMELESS MAN
                        So do I.

    40CONTINUED: (2)40

          Johnny brings up his cane, and stares in shock at the
            identical twin handle.  He DROPS HIS CANE and Wey suddenly
          VANISHES into thin air!  Johnny is alone in the woods. 

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

  4141EXT. WOODS - JOHNNY'S POV OF WEY - DAY

          It is quiet now in the woods.  Johnny calls out...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce!

          No answer back.  After a beat, Johnny kneels down, and
          tentatively touches his cane.  Nothing happens.  He reaches
          up and carefully picks it up by the shaft.

          Nothing happens.  He grips the silver head... and we hear
          the crackle of a DZ SOUND EFFECT.  Our angle adjusts to
          show WEY, standing in the same exact spot as before.  He
          looks agitated.

                                        WEY
                        You see?  I knew the truth would
                        scare you.  That's why I couldn't
                          approach you directly.  I knew
                        you wouldn't understand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me try.  I'm seeing the future,
                        while you're seeing the past.
                        We're sharing a vision.

          Wey looks surprised.  Johnny rises to his full height.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Believe it or not, this has
                          happened to me before.  Once.
                                (re: cane top)
                        Where did you get that?

          Wey regards the iron sphere in his hand.

                                        WEY
                        It's a long story... though it's
                        missing a big piece.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

          Wey holds out his hands, one with the cane head in it.

                                        WEY
                        See for yourself.

          Johnny is wary, but Wey remains still.  Waiting.  Johnny
          steps forward.  He reaches out, slowly, and takes hold of
          the cane head in Wey's hand.  He can feel it.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/23/03 - BLUE      32.


    41CONTINUED:41

            Suddenly, Wey's other hand shoots out and grips the top
          of Johnny's cane, forming a CIRCUIT between them and
          shooting us into a MAJOR VISION SEQUENCE:


  4242EXT. 1356 PRIMROSE LANE   NIGHT (VISION)

          WEY morphs into CHRISTOPHER (losing the burns, etc.) as
          he walks up his porch steps, unlocks his front door.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        The last thing I remember, was
                        walking into my house.  It was
                        August, I don't remember the day...

          He disarms the security code inside.  Flips the keys in
          his palm.  Takes a step inside...  A BLACK SHAPE moves
          behind him, and a blunt object SMASHES into the back of
          his head. 

                                                                      WHITE FLASH TO:


  4343INT. HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY (VISION)

          Johnny is in the brain trauma ward.  Utter SILENCE except
          for the intermittent beep of life support equipment.

          Johnny approaches a bed, and an eerily familiar sight:
          Christopher Wey, eyes closed, trapped within a coma.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were in a coma.

            Suddenly, the lighting in the room changes dramatically. 
          Johnny looks out the window, sees the sun setting at a
          time-lapse rate.  He walks toward the window.

          VFX SHOT   Johnny framed by the window, slowly approaching
          it as the sun continues to rise and set, ever faster. 
          Days ticking by and accelerating into months.  Faster...

          ON JOHNNY S FACE   As the breathtaking acceleration of
          time strobes across his eyes, faster than he can process...


    4444JOHNNY S POV OUT THE WINDOW   VFX EXTRAVAGANZA

          Months flying by.  Years.  The cityscape changing under
          the blurring cycle of day and night, and then all of a
          sudden BOOM!  It only lasts a few frames but we know what
          it is.

          FIRE.  Then --

          BLACKNESS.  Fade In...          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/24/03 - PINK      33.


  4545CLOSE ON WEY

          Sleeping outside, face covered by GREY SOOT.  He looks
          like a hibernating gargoyle.  His eyes blink open.  Then
          immediately shut as light stabs them.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        Like I said, the last thing I
                          remember, was walking into my
                        house.  The next thing, was that
                        I couldn't see...

          It is SO BRIGHT he can't even squint.  Wey tries to lift
          himself out of the rubble he's lying in, and fails.  He
          tries again... and falls again.  He tries again... 

                                                                      WHITE FLASH TO:


  4646EXT. NOWHERE - MORNING

          Wey is upright now, stumbling against a bright, overexposed
          background.  Still in hospital gown, IV tubes and EEG
          wires dangle from his arms and head like exposed nerves. 

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        There was nothing to see...

          He trips on something, and falls down.  He pats the surface
          of what he tripped on.

          CORPSES caked with ash, choked to death.  Wey, completely
          dazed and out of it, feels their faces and clothes.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                          I thought I was in a nightmare...

          He liberates a pair of SUNGLASSES from the flannel shirt
          of one of the corpses.


  4747ANGLE   HAZY WHITENESS

          Wey, out of the field of focus, stumbles closer and closer
          toward us.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        I would come to know that I was,
                        in fact, in Baltimore, Maryland...

          He walks into CLOSE UP, squinting.  He puts on the dark
          sunglasses.  His mouth slacks open as his eyes adjust,
          seeing what we can see in their reflection...

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        Or, what was left of it.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 07/02/03 - GOLD      34.

                        At first, I didn't know I was

                        Every night, I had the same dream.

                        My visions were leading me.

          REVERSE the pull-back, flying down the wall of the monument
          to the base, where we find...

                        They were leading me to you.


  6161WEY

          Digging through ash at the base of the Monument.  It is
          there that he finds the head of Johnny's cane.  As he
          takes it, we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


  6262CLIP FROM  THE STORM 

          Wey appears, looking at Johnny.  We quickly cycle through
          the OTHER INSTANCES in which the "Future Man" appeared to
          Johnny.

                                        WEY (V.O.)
                        At first, I didn't know you.  But
                        when I learned who you were, I
                        knew what I had become.


  6363EXT. WOODS - PULL OUT FROM WEY'S EYE

          Johnny pulls away from him, breaking the circuit, but
          still holding his cane.

                                        WEY
                        Now, every time that I hold this,
                        and you hold that...

          The potential of all this begins to dawn on Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We can see each other. 


          ANGLE ON BRUCE

          Trudging back through the woods after not finding anyone. 
          He spots Johnny and calls out to him. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny!  There's...

          He sees Johnny is busy talking to NO ONE.  Open air.

          WITH JOHNNY AND WEY

          Johnny hasn't noticed Bruce yet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen.  I need to know.  The
                        war.  Is it a war?  When exactly
                        does it...  How?  How does it
                        start?

                                        WEY
                        You don't know?
                                (beat)
                        Of course... not yet...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is it Greg Stillson?  I know he's
                        connected.

          Wey holds up a hand to silence him.

                                        WEY
                        You've got questions, and I've
                        got answers.  But first I need
                        you to tell me what happens to my
                        family.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        WEY
                        You said I hurt them.  I don't
                          remember that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How can you not remember...

                                        WEY
                        I told you, I'm missing a big
                        piece.  The last thing I remember
                        was walking into my house.  The
                        next thing was that I couldn't
                        see.  I risked talking to you
                        because I want to see my wife and
                        my daughter again.  And I need to
                        know what happened that night.

          Johnny is reluctant to tell Wey his gruesome vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you're like me, why haven't
                        you already seen it?  In a vision?

                                        WEY
                        Where I'm from, there's nothing
                        left to touch.

          Wey holds up the cane head like the Greek Witches held
          out their one eye.

                                        WEY
                        This is all I've got.  You are
                        all I've got.  And I can only see
                        as far as you can.

                                        JOHNNY
                        When I touched you, the old you,
                          yesterday... I saw Madeleine and
                        Julia dead.  They were murdered. 

          Wey is hit hard by this.  Bruce has gotten closer, realizes
          Johnny is in a vision.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny?

                                        WEY
                        I'll make you a deal.  You change
                        that... you save them... and I'll
                        tell you everything you want to
                        know. 

          Wey, overcome with despair, lets the cane head drop...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait, you have to tell me --

          Wey DISAPPEARS.  Johnny, upset, throws his cane down.  He
          now becomes aware of Bruce next to him.  Bruce picks up
          Johnny's cane, offers it back to him.

                                        BRUCE
                        No.  You better tell me.  After
                        we get out of here.  C'mon.           DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/25/03 - GREEN     39.


  63A63AEXT. 1356 PRIMROSE LANE - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce are halfway across the front lawn (coming
          from around the side of the house) toward the street,
          when Madeleine steps out onto her porch, calling out.

                                        MADELEINE
                          I called the police!  They're on
                        their way.

          She means it as a warning, as well.  Johnny turns back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good!  Stay inside till they get
                        here!

            Madeleine is not sure what to make of Johnny; is he
          dangerous, or is he really trying to help her?  Did he
          really see someone in back of her house?

                                        MADELEINE
                        What do you want?

          Johnny turns back again, and sees WEY, standing halfway
          across the lawn, in between him and Madeleine.  Although
          he's fifty feet away, it sounds like he's whispering in
          Johnny's ear.  

                                        WEY
                          Remember, Johnny.  Either you
                        save her, or I'll see us both in
                        hell. 

          Johnny looks from Wey to Madeleine.  She looks confused;
          what is Johnny staring at?  

          Wey turns around, and sees his wife.  He moves toward
          her, almost as if on reflex.  Walking across the lawn...

          Johnny lets his cane drop out of his hand, and Wey
          DISAPPEARS.  We can hear POLICE SIRENS in the DISTANCE.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry, I can't tell you right
                        now.  Just stay close to Julia. 
                        I'll be back, I promise.

                                        BRUCE
                        Um, Johnny?  Time to go...

          Johnny picks up his cane by the wood, and heads out.          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 07/02/03 - GOLD     39A.

  6565INT. MOTEL DINER - NIGHT

          Johnny has drawn a diagram for Bruce on some motel
          stationery.  It's a TIMELINE, with TICKS for dates.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Alright, we're here...
                                (makes tick)
                        The end of the world is here.

          He makes another tick, a little ways down the timeline.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm not liking this so far.

          Johnny makes another tick right after his first one.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Very soon, something's going to
                        happen.  Wey's gonna get knocked
                        out, and fall into a coma.

                        He stays in the coma, and wakes
                        up after...
                                (best word he can

                          Armageddon...

                        That's where he finds the cane
                        head... my cane head.

          They both look at the cane, resting against the desk.

                                        BRUCE
                                (sighs)

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't believe me.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's not that I don't believe
                        you, it's just... this one's pretty
                        far out, John.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, you better get ready 'cause
                        this is just the start.  Think of
                        this; if I save Wey, if I prevent
                        him from getting knocked out --
                                (points to timeline)
                        Here, he's not going into a coma,
                        or coming out of one, and he's
                        not going to have visions of me.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's a bad thing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce, this is the one person who
                        can tell us what starts Armageddon. 
                        What causes it.  He's the one
                        person who can help us stop it.

                                        BRUCE
                        So... you're not gonna help him? 
                        What about his Madeleine, and
                        Julia?

          Johnny, frustrated, picks up the cane next to him.

          WEY appears in the room, pacing, holding the cane head in
          his hand.  It's obvious that he's been waiting for it to
          "work."  Meaning he's been waiting for Johnny to pick up
          his end.  He assesses his surroundings, glares at Johnny.

                                        WEY
                        Where were you?

          Johnny stands.  Bruce cannot, of course, see Wey.

                        I need to know exactly what happens
                        to your family.  And when.

                                        WEY
                        I can only see what you see.

                        It happens in your house.  I need
                        to get in there.

                                        WEY
                        Then take me with you.

          Johnny nods.


  6666EXT. 1356 PRIMROSE LANE - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce approach the front door.  Johnny turns
          back to WEY, who is standing at the bottom of the porch
          steps, hands in his pockets.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where's the key?

                        Flower pot.

          Johnny kneels down, lifts the flower pot; there's the
          KEY.  Bruce looks back toward Wey.  Through him, actually,
          since he sees no one there.  It weirds him out.

                        I don't know if this is such a
                        good idea.  Maybe we should wait
                        'till she gets home.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And say what?  Mind if we come
                        in, and try to figure out how you
                        get killed?

          He unlocks the door, opens it.  The security alarm panel
          starts to beep a warning.  Johnny looks to Wey, who is
          now suddenly beside him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you remember the code?

                                        WEY
                        One, three... one... seven.

          Johnny punches it in.  The panel beeps acceptance.  Wey
          smiles to himself, sadly.

          ANGLE - FROM THE STREET

          We see a familiar car edge into frame. 

          LANCE FOSTER watches from behind his wheel as Johnny and
          Bruce enter the house.


  6767INT. 1356 PRIMROSE LANE - CONTINUOUS

          Wey reacts, overcome with being inside his old house. 
          Johnny recognizes the doorway now from his visions.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is where you get hit.

                                        BRUCE
                        Me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, him.

          Johnny gestures to Wey, who is staring at the threshold. 
          Bruce nods in that general direction.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh.  Hey.  By the way, name's
                        Bruce.  Nice... to meet...

          Bruce realizes what he's doing and stops himself.  Wey
          barely notices Bruce's attempt to address him.

          Johnny spots the wall where he saw Madeleine slumped dead
          in his vision.  He kneels beside it, touching and tapping,
          trying for a vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw her here...

          Wey's attention is focused on Johnny.  Johnny's not getting
            anything.  He moves along the living room wall, reaches
          the fireplace.  Feels the mantle, the glass cover, and as
          soon as he touches the FIRE POKER, we swing around...


  6868INT. 1356 PRIMROSE LANE - NIGHT (VISION)

          Suddenly a MAN wearing black duds and a black ski mask is
          taking the fire poker and walking over to the front door. 
          The PHONE is ringing.  The Man hides behind the front
          door, fire poker held down.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/24/03 - PINK      43.


    68CONTINUED:68

          We do a jump-cutty DEAD ZONE PUSH IN to him as time passes. 
          He reaches over and resets (re-arms) the security alarm.


  68A68ABACK TO SCENE

          Johnny looks toward the door.  Bruce follows his gaze.

                                        BRUCE
                        What do you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Someone.  Maybe a burglar.

          Johnny walks to the door.  Holding the fire poker in one
          hand, he concentrates as he feels around the door hinges. 
          SUDDENLY...


  68B68BINT. 1356 PRIMROSE LANE   NIGHT (VISION)

          The door opens, and Christopher walks in, disarms the
          security code.  He flips the key in his palm...

            Suddenly, the burglar steps from behind the door and
          STRIKES with the fire poker, bashing Christopher.  JOHNNY
          AND WEY are third person observers to this vision, and
          Wey is horrified as he watches Christopher hit the floor.

          The burglar brings down the iron rod AGAIN.  WEY flinches,
          watching himself get bludgeoned.  The burglar removes his
            ski-mask.

          LANCE FOSTER.  Johnny turns to Wey, who is bewildered. 

                                        WEY
                        Who is he?

          Foster stares down at Christopher, vindicated.

                                        FOSTER
                        How's that feel, you son of a
                        bitch?  Bet not as good as this.
                                (clubs him AGAIN)
                        You don't know what you had.  You
                        had something great.

          He drops the fire poker.  Bends down, and starts to drag
            Christopher's body into the house.

                                        FOSTER
                        But guys like you, got the whole
                        world eatin' out of your hand,
                        you never seem to care...

          Suddenly the front door opens, and outside on the porch
          stands JULIA.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT THREE - 06/24/03 - PINK      44.

          She sees her Dad being dragged by another man, and her
          jaw drops.  WEY reacts, screaming out.

                                        WEY
                        Julia, RUN!

                                        FOSTER
                        Julia wait...

          Of course, Julia can't hear Wey, but she barely hears
          Foster.  She backpedals and TRIPS on the porch steps. 
          FALLS out of sight.

                                        WEY
                        No!

          Foster runs onto the porch.  Johnny follows him, knowing
          what he will see: Julia crumpled at the bottom of the
          porch steps, dead. 

                                        MADELEINE (O.S.)
                        Julia!

            MADELEINE runs up the walk, having seen her daughter fall. 

                                        FOSTER
                        She's okay.  She's okay.

          He scoops Julia up into his arms and tries to carry her
          back inside.  Madeleine panics, reaching for Julia.

                                        MADELEINE
                        What are you doing?  Get away
                        from her!  Get away!

                                        FOSTER
                        She's okay...

          He stumbles back into the house.  Madeleine stops clawing
          at him when she sees CHRISTOPHER on the floor.  Her hand
          flies to her mouth, stifling a shriek.  Frozen.

          Foster sets Julia down, and slams the door.  Desperate. 

                                        FOSTER
                        Maddy, it's okay...

                                        MADELEINE
                        No!

          She moves to her daughter.  Foster intercepts her, grabbing
          both of her arms.  She struggles.  He pushes her back,
          against the living room wall.

          Johnny watches, heart pounding but trying to keep calm.

          Wey is panicked, reaching out, spectral hands passing
          through Lance Foster in vain.  Unable to protect his wife.

          Foster has a hand over her mouth, his other arm pressed
          against her chest, pinning her to the wall.

                                        FOSTER
                        Shhhh, it's okay.  It's okay.  I
                        didn't know you were here...

          She tries to scream.  He presses harder, her scream becomes
          muffled through his gloves.  Foster babbles, desperate.

                                        FOSTER
                        Madeleine.  Listen to me.  Listen
                        to me.  Stop.  I took care of
                        him.  I took care of that son of
                          a bitch, he's never going to hurt
                        you again.  Listen.  Listen.  We
                        can work this out, we can make
                        this work...

          She struggles, he presses against her even harder,
          restricting all movement.  Wey falls to his knees.

                                        FOSTER
                        Listen to me.  You deserve better. 
                        You deserve better than him.  You
                        just have to open your eyes. 
                                (she stops struggling)
                        Madeleine.  Do you hear me? 
                        Madeleine?  Maddy...

          He realizes he's pressing too hard, and slacks off.

          She sinks to the ground, heavy.  He follows her, realizes
          he's gone too far, has strangled her. 

          Her eyes are open, dull and lifeless.  Foster reaches out
          to touch one, and the lid closes.  He shrinks back, stares
          at the three bodies around him, then gets up and makes
          his way to the door.  He gives one more horrified look
          behind him, and then SLAMS THE DOOR, which --


  6969ENDS THE VISION

          with the door closed as it is now.  Johnny falters, dazed.

                        John, are you alright?

          Bruce helps him to a chair.

          Johnny leans forward on his cane, both hands on the grip.


          JOHNNY'S POV - WEY

          Sitting against the wall where Madeleine will die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Someone she knows.

          Wey slowly looks up with bloodshot eyes.

                                        WEY
                        She was having an affair...

                        No, you were.  And that man was
                        who she paid to prove it.

                                        WEY
                        How do you know that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        First you tell me what you know.

          Wey, miserable, shakes his head no.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We had a deal.  If we save her,
                        it won't matter.  Everyone is
                        going to die, and you know it.

                                        WEY
                        If you had the chance to go back
                        to June 5th, 1995, and stay with
                        Sarah Bracknell, and not have to
                        see what's coming... you'd know
                        why I don't care...

          He lets the cane head drop from his hand.

          Wey is GONE.  Suddenly, the sound of a key hitting the
          lock.  Bruce and Johnny turn to see the door open,
            revealing LT. SANDOWSKI and a UNIFORMED COP, both leveling
          police pistols.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI

            NEIGHBORS watch as Johnny and Bruce are ushered into the
          back of a police car, cuffed.  REVEAL Madeleine pulling
          into her driveway, Julia in the backseat.  LANCE FOSTER
          greets her as she gets out.

                                        MADELEINE
                        What's going on?

                                        FOSTER
                          I called the cops as soon as I
                        saw them breaking in.

          She looks over to the cop car, sees JOHNNY turning to
          look at her through the back window.  He freaks out when
          he sees her standing next to Foster. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Madeleine!  That's him!  That's
                        him!  He's gonna kill you!

          Johnny's voice is muffled by the cop car.  He thrashes in
          the backseat as the car pulls away.  Madeleine shudders.

                                        FOSTER
                        You recognize him?

                        He's been by the house before.

                                        FOSTER
                        He's also been to see your husband.
                                (off her look)
                        I was coming over to show you
                        these.

          He hands her an envelope, photos inside.

                                        FOSTER
                        He's in a few.  But the ones you
                        can use in court are...

          She's found them.  Photos of Christopher and his Secretary,
          making love in his Mercedes.  Foster watches as Maddy
          nods to herself, tears welling in her eyes.

          He reaches out slowly for her, almost touching her hair. 
          His touch snaps her back to the moment.  She shakes off
          being creeped out.

                                        MADELEINE
                        I, I'm sorry, it's just now people
                        are breaking into my house...

          Foster fidgets, nervously, his eyes never leaving her.

                                        FOSTER
                        If you don't want to stay here,
                        you're free to bring Julia, and... 
                        I have a spare room.

                                        MADELEINE
                        That's kind, thank you.  You're
                        right, I can't stay here.  I think
                        I'm gonna take Julia to my Mother's
                        house.  Tonight.

                                        FOSTER
                        Yeah, that's a good idea.  Tonight.

          Off Foster, we --

          FADE IN:

  7373INT. WESTCHESTER POLICE STATION - DAY

          Bruce cradles a phone in his cuffed hands as the Uniformed
          Cop breathes down his neck.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hi, I need to speak to Sheriff
                        Bannerman, please.  Yeah, it's
                        urgent.
                                (beat)
                        Yeah, I'll hold...

          Move off him to find Johnny seated at Lt. Sandowski's
          desk, one hand cuffed to the steel chair he's in.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Well, that's an extremely detailed
                        statement, Mr. Smith.  Makes about
                        as much sense as your last one.

          The phone on his desk rings.  He picks it up.  Listens. 
          Then looks at Johnny while giving his answer.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Good.  Bring him over.

          His glance moves over Johnny's shoulder.  Johnny turns to
          see Christopher Wey being led over by another cop.  He
          doesn't look happy as Sandowski stands to shake his hand.

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Hi, I'm Lieutenant Sandowski. 
                        Sorry to meet you under such
                          circumstances.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        It's been quite a day.  I come
                        home to find a squad car parked
                        in my driveway, and the officer
                          searching my house tells me there's
                        been a break-in, and that my wife's
                        taken our daughter to her Mother's
                        house, who, when I called, said
                        she didn't want to talk to me.

          Johnny grunts in the key of "that doesn't surprise me."

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Pipe down.

          Christopher walks around to look Johnny in the eyes.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        Who the hell are you?


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT FOUR - 06/24/03 - PINK       50.


    73CONTINUED:73

          His earnest inflection echoes Johnny's question to Wey. 
          Johnny holds his gaze, speaking deliberately.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm the guy who could've had the
                        life you take for granted.
                                (leans forward)
                        Difference between us is I lost
                        it all in one night, where you...
                        you're just pissing yours away.

          Christopher looks like he's about to hit Johnny, and
            Sandowski looks like he's about to let him.  Christopher
          opens his mouth, but Johnny cuts him off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Shut up.  Just shut up and listen,
                        for once.  Your wife's hired a
                        private investigator to prove
                        you're cheating on her.  He's...

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Here we go again with the P.I.
                        His name is Lance Foster, he's
                        the one who reported the break-
                        in. 
                                (to Johnny)
                        I think we've heard about enough
                        out of you.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        This is true, about my wife...
                        hiring this guy?

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                                (evasive)
                        That would be her business.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Whatever you do, do not go home
                          tonight.  Go to your family and
                        stay with them.  Understand?

          Chris turns to Sandowski.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        If you need me to testify, press
                        additional charges, whatever's
                          necessary...

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        I'll let you know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dammit, listen to me.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT FOUR - 06/24/03 - PINK       51.

                          I warned you to stay away.

          Christopher walks off.  Johnny yells after him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't go home!

                                        LT. SANDOWSKI
                        Keep your voice down.

          The CAPTAIN opens the door to his office.

                                        CAPTAIN
                        Sandowski, could I see you for a
                        second?

            Sandowski grudgingly heads over to the Captain's office,
          passing BRUCE, who is being sat down at another desk. 
          Bruce gives a confident nod to Johnny.


  7474EXT. MOTHER-IN-LAW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Christopher knocks on the door.  It's opened by a 65 year
          old woman, his MOTHER-IN-LAW.  He looks down, wordless,
            withering under her gaze for a beat.  She closes the door. 

          He waits outside.  We hear muffled VOICES from inside the
          house.  The voices escalate sharply.

          The door opens suddenly, Madeleine standing there.  They
          stare at each other for a long beat.

                                        MADELEINE
                        I said not to come here.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        You said not to call.
                                (beat)
                        I just came from the police
                          station.  They say we've got
                        nothing to worry about.

                                        MADELEINE
                        They're wrong.

                                          CHRISTOPHER
                        I know that everything that's
                        going on... is my fault.

                                        MADELEINE
                          Christopher.  I'm not going to
                        forgive you.

          Julia comes running down the hall, followed by her
            Grandmother, who fails to stop her as she runs past
            Madeleine and into Christopher's arms, where she buries
          her head and begins to cry.

          He holds her close, mouthing softly to Madeleine:

          Maddy and Chris lock eyes, Julia between them.  She closes
          her eyes, and nods. 


  7575INT. WESTCHESTER POLICE STATION - NIGHT

            Sandowski begins to remove Johnny's handcuffs, and walks
          him to the booking desk.

                        You got friends in all the right

                        I'm sure in your argument to keep
                        me here, you left out the fact
                        that there was no breaking and
                          entering to support your breaking

                        No forced entry doesn't mean you
                        were invited.  I'll encourage the
                        family to press whatever charges
                        they feel appropriate.  I'll even
                        suggest a few.

          Johnny turns to the other Cop, who has just released Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need my cane.

          The Cop leads him to the front desk, pulls out the cane
          and hands it to Johnny. 

          As he TAKES HOLD, our angle adjusts to see WEY, who takes
          in the police station, and then stares at Johnny, confused.

                                        WEY
                        Where is this?  What happened?

          Johnny closes his eyes.  Bruce sees he's disturbed.

          On the kitchen counter PHONE as it begins to ring.  We
          hold on it, ringing, as no one answers.

          We then reveal FOSTER, dressed in black.  He ignores the
          phone, putting on his black ski mask.  It continues to
          ring as he heads to the fireplace, grabs the iron poker,
          and walks over to take his place behind the front door. 


  7777INT. JOHNNY'S JEEP - TRAVELING - NIGHT

          Bruce downshifts and guns it.

            Christopher's car pulls into the driveway.  He gets out
          as Madeleine's car pulls off the street behind him. 
          Christopher looks at his house, thinking.

                        Let me check something out first.

          He walks up the walk.  Just like in the vision.  He ascends
          the porch steps.  Unlocks the front door.


  7979INT. 1356 PRIMROSE LANE - CONTINUOUS

          Christopher steps in.  Disarms the security panel.  Flips
          his keys in his palm.  Foster stirs behind him...

            Madeleine also gets out as Julia runs past, up the walk.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Honey, wait a minute.

            Suddenly, Madeleine reacts to a sound behind her.  She
          turns in SLOW MOTION as a BRIGHT LIGHT blinds her eyes.

          Foster has begun to drag Christopher's body when the front
          door opens, revealing Julia, who stops short, stunned. 

                                        FOSTER
                        Julia wait...

          Julia backpedals and TRIPS on the porch steps.  She FALLS
            backwards in slow motion...

          AND IS CAUGHT IN JOHNNY SMITH'S ARMS before she hits the
          stairs.  Foster runs to the door, looks down to see Johnny
          holding Julia, and Bruce jogging up the stairs toward
          him.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hi.

          Bruce DECKS Foster across the face.  He stumbles back in
          the house, trips over Christopher, and hits the floor on
          his back.  Bruce continues his forward motion, kneeling
          on Foster's chest and PUNCHING him again.

          Johnny sets Julia down.  She runs into her Mother's arms. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Get her out of here!

                                        JULIA
                                (holding Maddy tight)
                        Daddy's hurt...

            Madeleine looks into Johnny's eyes, and moves up the
          stairs, passing him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Madeleine, don't...

          She keeps going, setting Julia down at the threshold. 
          She is speechless as she sets eyes on Christopher. 

          Johnny walks up the porch steps, and moves through the
          door.  He looks to Bruce who moves out of the way to show
          Foster.  Out cold.

            Madeleine falls to Christopher, cradles him in her arms. 
          Julia crawls forward, shaking her Dad's arm, and then
          just holding on to it.  Madeleine looks up at Johnny.

                                        MADELEINE
                        Call 911.  Help... get help.

          Johnny looks at Bruce, who runs into the living room and
          picks up the phone.  Madeleine begins to cry. 

                                        MADELEINE
                        Help him...

          Johnny stands where he is, staring at Christopher,
            unconscious, in the arms of his Wife and Daughter.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

  8383INT. SMITH HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

          Johnny sits, both hands on the cane top, waiting, slowly
          scanning his giant cork board.

          We PAN across it, settling on the latest addition: a
            newspaper clipping from the "Westchester Post."  Column
          titled "Local Man in Coma Following Assault."

          Underneath is a FAMILY PHOTO of the Weys: Christopher,
          Madeleine, and Julia in happier times.

          Johnny's expression shifts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was wondering when you'd show.

          ANGLE ADJUST to reveal Wey, on the landing of the basement
          stairs.  He is dressed as always, hands in pockets.

                                        WEY
                        So was I.

          Johnny stands as Wey descends the stairs to stand face to
          face with Johnny.  A tense beat passes between them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I tried to stop...

          Wey cuts him off with a gesture.

                                        WEY
                        This is what's happened.  It's
                        what was meant to happen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know if that's true.

                                        WEY
                        And now we'll never know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why are you here? 

                                        WEY
                        Why else?  I'm here to make you a
                        deal.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How did I know you were going to
                        say that?

          Wey begins to circle Johnny, studying him, like he's trying
          to figure something out, like Johnny is a puzzle to him.

                                        WEY
                        All I'm asking is that you look
                        after my family.  So I can know
                        they're safe.  And so I can look
                        in on them, until --

          Johnny cuts him off.  He's had enough.

                        Until what?  The nukes hit? 
                        They're still not safe,
                          Christopher.  And you haven't
                        kept up your part of the deal.

          Wey looks toward the Armageddon board.

                                        WEY
                        I can help you stop it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You keep promising that, but I
                        don't see any proof.  You know
                        why?  I think you're lying.  I
                        don't think you know anything.

                                        WEY
                        Maybe I don't trust you!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Trust me?  You don't trust me?  I
                        saved your daughter's life.  I
                        did everything you asked.  Now
                        tell me what you know!

          Wey looks down, ashamed.

                                        WEY
                        I... I lied.  I don't know what
                          happened.  I was asleep, remember?

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you don't know, you can find
                        out. 

                                        WEY
                        You don't know what it's like out
                        there.  You can't trust anyone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can trust me.

          Wey reaches into his coat, and pulls out a crumpled, singed
          paper of faded black and red.  He holds it out for Johnny
          to see.  His hand is shaking slightly.

                                        WEY
                        I'm not sure...

          CLOSE ON THE PAPER - THE COVER OF NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE

          Dated September 2010.  On the cover is a headshot of Johnny
          Smith, staring into the camera with intense eyes.  The
          headline is bold and clear:


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VISIONS - ACT FOUR - 06/23/03 - BLUE       58.

          "WILL THIS MAN DESTROY THE WORLD?"

          Johnny is unable to do anything but stare at the future
            artifact, experiencing a sinking feeling of doom.  

          Johnny blinks, and the magazine, and Wey, are GONE.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
