CREDIT SEQUENCE:
When the credit sequence is finished, we
FADE TO BLACK:
Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony.
Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
ASS, through traffic.
Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
ELSE SAY:
SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.
Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:
SOMEBODY (OS)
I'm sorry.
I can't believe
she killed me.
Who would've
fuckin thought that?
CUT TO:

Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.
He has
a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
MAGNUM in the other.
If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
just knocks them down.
We DOLLY at the same speed, right
along side of him.
FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.
We DOLLY with
them.
We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.
ROLLERGIRL
is plugged into a walkman.
We hear the song she's
listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.
She's twirling and
skating backwards to the beat of the song.
Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.
The
man and woman CRASH to the ground.
Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
him.
7
DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.
Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.
The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.
Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
the Cops.
Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.
Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.
Cops FIRE.
9
Three cars are parked out front.
Mr. Blonde is walking
towards the car he drove.
Mr. White and Mr. Pink are
walking behind.
The Camera is HANDHELD following behind
them.
MR. PINK
We still gotta get out of here.
MR. BLONDE
We're gonna sit here and wait.
MR. WHITE
For what, the cops?
MR. BLONDE
Nice Guy Eddie.
MR. PINK
Nice Guy Eddie?
What makes you
think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a
plane half way to Costa Rica?
MR. BLONDE
Cause I just talked to him.
He's
on his way down here, and nobody's
going anywhere till be gets here.
MR. WHITE
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?
Why
the fuck didn't you say that in
the first place?
MR. BLONDE
You didn't ask.
MR. WHITE
Hardy-fuckin-har.
What did he
say?
MR. BLONDE
Stay put.
Okay, fellas, take a
look at the little surprise I
brought you.
Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car.
A handcuffed,
uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.
MR. BLONDE
So while we're waitin for Nice Guy
Eddie, what say we have a little
fun finding out who the rat is.
INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".

WAREHOUSE - DAY
Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
the warehouse.
Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse.
He gets out of
the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.
EDDIE
(to himself)
Fucking assholes.
Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open,
and steps inside the warehouse.
21
We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...
...to his car.
He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can
of gasoline.
He walks back inside the warehouse...
24
DENNY'S - NIGHT
We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
into the booth across from Holdaway.
Freddy's doing a lot
of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.
27
PARKING LOT - DAY
Another empty frame, except obviously outside.
Freddy
enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
previous scene, finishing his sentence.
When we move to a
wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
Holdaway in a parking lot.
Holdaway sits on the hood of
his beat-up car.
Freddy paces back and forth as he
performs his story.
FREDDY
...but then that got to be a pain
in the ass.
People called me on
the phone all the fuckin time.
I
couldn't rent a fuckin tape
without six phone calls
interrupting me.
"Hey, Freddy,
when's the next time you're gettin
some?"
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin
to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
some, I'll let you know."
And
then these rinky-dink pot heads
come by--there's my friends and
everything, but still.
I got all
my shit laid out in sixty dollar
bags.
Well, they don't want sixty
dollars worth.
They want ten
dollars worth.
Breaking it up is
a major fuckin pain in the ass.
I
don't even know how much ten
dollars worth is.
"Well, fuck,
man, I don't want that much
around.
If I have that much
around I'll smoke it."
"Hey, if
you guys can't control your
smokin, that's not my problem.
You motherfuckers been smokin for
five years, be a adult about it."
Finally I just told my connection,
count me out.
But as it turns
out, I'm the best guy she had, and
she depended alot on my business.
But I was still sick to death of
it.
And she's trying to talk me
into not quitin.
Now this was a very weird
situation, 'cause I don't know if
you remember back in '86, there
was a major fuckin drought.
Nobody and anything.
People were
livin on resin and smokin the wood
in their pipes for months.
And
this chick had a bunch, and was
beggin me to sell it.
So I told
her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
Man anymore.
But I would take a
little bit and sell it to my
close, close, close friends.
She
agreed to that, and said we'd keep
the same arrangement as before,
ten percent and free pot for me,
as long as I helped her out that
weekend.
She had a brick of weed
she was sellin, and she didn't
want to go to the buy alone...

COPS' POV
From inside an unmarked car across the street, the TWO
COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and
up to Eddie's parked car.
COP #1 (OS)
There goes our boy.
COP #2 (OS)
I swear, a guy has to have rocks
in his head the size of Gibraltar
to work undercover.
COP #1 (OS)
Do you want one of these?
COP #2 (OS)
Yeah, gimme the bear claw.
Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.
Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.
41
Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.
The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.
43
Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
little league baseball field.
HOLDAWAY
Okay, we're gonna station men
across the street from Karina's
Fine Jewelry.
But their orders
will be not to move in unless the
robbery gets out of control.
You
gotta make sure they don't have to
move in.
You're inside to make
sure that everything goes
according to Hoyle.
We have men
set up a block away from the
warehouse rendezvous.
They got
complete visibility of the
exterior.
So as soon as Joe Cabot
shows up, we'll see it.
FREDDY
What's your visibility of the
interior?
HOLDAWAY
We can't see shit on the inside.
And we can't risk gettin any
closer for fear they'll spot us.
FREDDY
This is bullshit, Jim.
I get all
the fuckin danger of having you
guys in my back pocket but none of
the safety.
HOLDAWAY
What's the matter, Newendyke?
Job
too tough for ya?
No one lied to
you.
You always knew we'd hang
back until Joe Cabot showed up.
FREDDY
Oh this is great.
You ain't
giving me no fuckin protection
whatsoever.
But you are giving me
an attitude.
HOLDAWAY
Since when does an undercover cop
have protection?
Freddy, you came
into this thing with your eyes
wide open, so don't start screamin
blind man now.
I understand
you're nervous.
I wish the
warehouse had more visible
windows, but it doesn't.
We have
to make do with the cards we're
dealt.
FREDDY
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
I'm just remarking on how shitty
the situation is!
HOLDAWAY
I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
but I've found tough love works
best in these situations.
We have
to get Joe Cabot in the company of
the thieves and in the same
vicinity as the loot.
We don't care about these other
bastards.
We're willing to offer
them good deals to testify against
Cabot.
FREDDY
Isn't this risk unorthodox?
HOLDAWAY
What?
FREDDY
Letting them go ahead with the
robbery?
HOLDAWAY
The whole idea behind this
operation is to catch Joe Cabot
red-handed.
We bust these hired
hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
Letting them go through with the
heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
are very clean.
We got people
surrounding the perimeter.
We got
a guy and a gal on the inside
posing as a couple shopping for
rings.
We could replace the
employees with cops, but we'd run
the risk of tipping 'em off.
FREDDY
That's out.
They know the faces
of who works what shift.
HOLDAWAY
These guys are professionals.
We're professionals.
It's a risk,
but I think it's a calculated
risk.
45
We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.
CUSTOMERS coming and going.
STORE CLERKS waiting on
customers through the windows.
While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.
White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Let's go over it.
Where are you?
FREDDY (VO)
I stand outside and guard the
door.
I don't let anybody come in
or go out.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Brown?
FREDDY (VO)
Mr. Brown stays in the car.
He's
parked across the street till I
give him the signal, then he pulls
up in front of the store.
MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
FREDDY (VO)
Crowd control.
They handle
customers and employees in the
display area.
46
It's the moment of the robbery.
The alley is empty.
In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.
Guns
FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,
glass BREAKING...
A car whips around the corner, into the alley.
The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.
Freddy opens the driver's side door.
A bloody SCREAMING
Mr. Brown FALLS out.
MR. BROWN
(screaming)
My eyes!
My eyes!
I'm blind, I'm
fucking blind!
FREDDY
You're not blind, there's just
blood in your eyes.
Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.
He RUNS to the
end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.
FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
patrol car.
Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.
White's ambush in shock.
Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.
MR. BROWN
Mr. Orange?
You're Mr. Orange,
aren't you?
By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
is dead.
Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.
MR. WHITE
Is he dead?
Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.
MR. WHITE
Did he did or not?
Freddy, scared.
FREDDY
I'm sorry.
MR. WHITE
What?
Snap out of it!
Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as
he RUNS.
They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.
A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.
Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.
He points
his jun at her.
MR. WHITE
Get us outta here!
Mr. White climbs into the backseat.
Freddy starts to climb in.
The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.
MR. WHITE
The bitch's got a gun!
She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.
On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
face.
C.U. ON FREDDY
as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened
to him and what he's done.
SLOW MOTION.
Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.
He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.
