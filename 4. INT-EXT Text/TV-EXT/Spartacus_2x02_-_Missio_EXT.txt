  A glaring, oppressive sun fills the frame. Muddled, 
  INDISTINCT SOUNDS echo as if from a great distance.

  CAMERA TILTS DOWN

  away from the sun, SWAYING and REELING. Glimpses of the 
  bustling morning market fall in and out of frame. MERCHANTS 
  gawk at us, voices muted as if underwater. A WOMAN gasps. A 
  FRIGHTENED CHILD stares and points. As SOUND RUSHES into 
  full clarity, reverse to REVEAL we are in the POV of

  BATIATUS

  Bloody and severely beaten. Disoriented. Lurching through 
  the streets. As he winces in pain...

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  FLASHES OF THE VIOLENT BEATING from the end of HB1. BLOOD, 
  DIRT, FISTS, PISS. VETTIUS and his MEN rain blows on 
  Batiatus, TULLIUS looming over him.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  Batiatus staggers, desperately groping for assistance. He 
  keels sideways, losing consciousness. Just as his face is 
  about to connect with the ground --

                                                                            SMASH TO:



  TULLIUS walks with VETTIUS. THERON, Tullius' bodyguard, 
  trails. Tullius smiles and nods at MERCHANTS and 
    TOWNSPEOPLE. A man indeed much beloved.

                                          TULLIUS
                                to Vettius)(
                      My dealings with the Magistrate 
                        take precedence tomorrow. I would 
                        have you greet Varus in my stead.

                                          VETTIUS
                        The honor would be mine. The man 
                        pisses wine and shits gold.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Varus is but a stream leading to an 
                        ocean of coin. One I would see 
                        break wave upon our steps.

                                          VETTIUS
                      He comes to choose men?

                                          TULLIUS
                        For the games of the Vinalia, to 
                        ensure his vines bear fruit in the 
                        coming year.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I will present only our finest 
                        gladiators.

  Tullius spots SOLONIUS with a WINE MERCHANT.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I would enrich our stock, and offer 
                        him Gannicus as well...

    A calculating smile bends his lips.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

  ON SOLONIUS

  as he argues with the Merchant over an AMPHORA of wine.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  re: wine jug)(
                        This had best be the Falernian 
                        promised. If I find you have 
                        foisted your usual swill, we will 
                        have words.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S)
                        Put mind to ease.

  Tullius appears at his elbow with Theron, sans Vettius. 
  Solonius tenses, forces a smile.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Tullius.

  Tullius points to the SEAL on the wine jug.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Note sun and mountains etched in 
                        the amphora. Proof of its 
                          authenticity.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Oh. Yes, of course.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I was unaware you had an 
                        appreciation for such tastes, 
                        Solonius.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A gift for a friend recovering from 
                        unfortunate injury.

  Tullius smiles knowingly, fishes coins from purse.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Please. Allow me.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Appreciated, but unnecessary.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I believe it is.

  Solonius acquiesces.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                        Gratitude.

                                          TULLIUS
                      To be returned in kind.

  Solonius eyes him uncomfortably.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I have done nothing to deserve it.

                                          TULLIUS
                        A matter shortly to be rectified. 
                        Come. I would discuss message to be 
                        delivered with our gift. Better 
                        received from your tongue than 
                        mine.

  Solonius reluctantly moves off with Tullius, WIPING US TO:



  GLADIATORS and RECRUITS trade bone-jarring blows with 
  practice swords. GANNICUS spars with BARCA and AUCTUS, 
  taking both men on with a grin and a laugh. ASHUR, DAGAN, 
  and INDUS run drills under the watchful eye of DOCTORE.

  A BLOODIED CRIXUS

  spars with OENOMAUS. Crixus attacks with a roar, swinging 
  wildly.

  BALCONY

  Gaia sips wine. Naevia and DIONA attend her.

                                        GAIA
                        The Gaul is quite the beast.  What 
                        name does he take?

                                        NAEVIA
                        Apologies. I do not know.

                                        DIONA
                        His name is Crixus. He trains in 
                        the style of Murmillo.

  Gaia catches the excitement in Diona's eyes.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.
  CONTINUED:

                                        GAIA
                        You have an interest in the games. 
                      Or does it land only upon the men 
                        who play them?

  Diona flushes, embarrassed. Gaia laughs.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                      So easily made to blush. A sign of 
                        tragic inexperience. I have not 
                        turned such a color since before 
                        you were born.

  Gaia eyes Diona and Naevia with a wistful smile.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                        How I envy your youth. And all the 
                        wonders you have yet to discover.

  Gaia brushes a stray lock of hair from Diona's face. A 
  gesture loaded with underlying sensuality.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                      Do not be afraid to pursue every 
                        delight this world has to offer.

  Diona stands mesmerized. Naevia interjects nervously.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Melitta cautions patience. Plucking 
                        flowers too quickly will bruise the 
                        petals.

                                        GAIA
                        Words from a mouth that has only 
                        known her husband's cock.

  Her eyes dance as she glances back down to the

  TRAINING SQUARE

  where Oenomaus fends off a vicious attack by Crixus. 
  Oenomaus counters, smashes him to the ground.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You charge like a crazed goat, 
                        absent thought. When faced with 
                        stronger opponent, draw him to you 
                        and counter. Again!

  Oenomaus attacks. Crixus defends, driven back. Oenomaus 
  thrusts at his midsection. Crixus sidesteps and counters, 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.
  CONTINUED:

  spinning to crack Oenomaus across the face. A tense beat. 
  Oenomaus spits blood, grins.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Words at last find way through 
                        thick skull.

  Doctore takes notice.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Crixus. Join the recruits and 
                        continue your training.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Yes, Doctore.

  Crixus grins, hustles over to Ashur, Dagan, and Indus.

                                        INDUS
                        The mighty Gaul returns.
                                (eying blood and 
                                  bruises)
                      Or is it his corpse, too stubborn 
                      to fall to grass?

                                        DAGAN
                        Kusita ze'irta Hareta. [Shitty 
                        little cunt.]

                                        ASHUR
                        Dagan expresses his joy at finding 
                        you yet among us. We feared you 
                        fated for the mines, with all the 
                        sand you have been eating.

  Ashur attacks. Crixus counters, sends him face first into 
  the ground. Ashur spits sand. Crixus laughs good-naturedly.

                                        CRIXUS
                      An acquired taste. Come. I would 
                        serve you more.

  Ashur laughs as Crixus offers a hand to help him up. Doctore 
  nods in approval to Oenomaus, who takes a cup of water from 
  the rain barrel.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You have done well with the man.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Crixus is undisciplined. But not 
                        without promise.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    9.

  WHAM! Gannicus sweeps Barca and Auctus off their feet in one 
  fluid move. They crash to the ground, dazed. Gannicus 
  laughs, calling to Doctore.

                        Doctore. I require a more worthy

  Oenomaus grins. He moves to meet Gannicus, WIPING US TO:

                        Towards what purpose?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He comes with word and gift from 
                        Tullius, yet seeking Gannicus to 
                        swell his ranks.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        After what he fucking did to you?

  Lucretia shoots Solonius a surprised, disappointed look.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let us sweep such petty grievances 
                        aside in service of reason and 
                        reward! Tullius offers twice the 
                        sum refused. And what, I wonder, 
                        does good Solonius receive for 
                        convincing me to spread cheeks and 
                        accept deeper ramming?

  Solonius squirms.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would share equal position in the 
                        games.

  Batiatus laughs in disgust.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You are in remarkable condition, to 
                        claim my reflection.

                        Tullius' offer, and I shall join 
                        you in exclusion from the arena.

                        With exacting clarity.

  Batiatus softens a bit.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I did not mean to see you burdened 
                        so.

  Batiatus wrestles with what to do. Gives a little ground.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I will think upon the matter.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Tullius requires answer.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And I require a fucking moment!

                      He wishes to present your man to 
                        Quintilius Varus tomorrow.

  Gaia perks up.

                        Without them, I fear we shall both 
                      go hungry.

  Solonius places a warm hand on Batiatus' shoulder.

                        Think upon it. And know that I

                        decision.

  Solonius nods to Lucretia and Gaia, exits.

                        I have witnessed more rigid spine 
                        within a snail.

  Batiatus moves to the railing, looking out at his men. His 
  eyes fall on Gannicus as he playfully spars with Oenomaus.

                        What are your thoughts?

  He doesn't answer, the conflict roiling in his eyes.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Indus crashes to the ground. Dagan is on him in a flash, 
  practice sword to his throat. Indus holds up two fingers. 
  The missio, a sign of surrender. Batiatus erupts.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Doctore! Send that man to the 
                        fucking mines!

  The men react in surprise. Doctore attempts to intervene.

                        Dominus --

                      We do not surrender in this fucking 
                        house! I will see these walls fall 
                      to ruin before missio is given!

  Doctore barely holds his tongue, nods to the Guards. Indus 
  is led off. A forboding sight for Crixus, Ashur, and Dagan. 
  Gaia considers Batiatus with increasing appreciation.

                                        GAIA
                      It appears decision is made.

                        Tullius but brokers interest. If a 
                        man of wealth and position such as 
                        Varus requested my men, even he 
                        would be unable to refuse.

                        But he meets with Vettius. You 
                        expect that fucking child to make 
                          introduction?

                                        BATIATUS
                        No. I expect him to bleed, as I rip 
                        Varus from his grasp.

  OFF Batiatus, reveling in the thought...



  The streets are a crush of activity. FIND Barca standing 
  sentry at the mouth of an alley. Behind him Batiatus 
  instructs Ashur, Dagan and Indus, all in robes with hoods.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Each of you know your part. See the 
                        act to successful completion, and 
                        earn the Mark of the Brotherhood.

  Indus grins, cheered by this reversal of fortune.

                                        INDUS
                        Without proving ourselves in the 
                        test?

                                        BATIATUS
                        This is your test. But turn 
                        thoughts toward escape or fail in 
                        your charge... and I will see you 
                        parted from your cocks and 
                        crucified.
                                (pointedly, to

  Ashur, Dagan, and Indus raise their hoods and disappear into 
  the crowd. Barca scowls.

                                        BARCA
                        I do not trust the Syrians.

                        they will appear as common thieves. 
                        Absent my brand upon fucking arm.

  Batiatus heads out into the market with Barca, WIPING US TO:



  The nearly completed arena looms in the distance at the end 
  of the street. ADJUST TO FIND Gaia and Lucretia approaching, 
  attended by Melitta and ATTENDING SLAVES. Lucretia eyes the 
  scene nervously.

                      Of course it will. Look at you.

  Gaia takes her in with appreciation, adjusts a bit of fabric 
  at Lucretia's breast.

  She looks out across the crowd, searching for their prey.

  Gaia adjusts her ample cleavage. OFF Lucretia, her concerned 
  doubled now that Gaia has revealed an agenda of her own...



  Batiatus glances at a MERCHANT's wares, keeping half an eye 
  on the crowd. He spots VETTIUS walking with purpose, flanked 
  by two huge BODYGUARDS. Batiatus nods to

  INDUS

  across the square, indicating Vettius. Indus nods, his 
  target acquired. Batiatus fades into the crowd with Barca 
  before Vettius can spot him.

                        Varus is honored guest. As such, I 
                      am but humble servant.

  Vettius indicates for Indus to lead the way. OFF Indus' 
  grin, the plan working...



  Indus leads Vettius and his Bodyguards down an alley removed 
  from the crush of the marketplace.

                                        INDUS
                        Apologies for the inconvenience. 
                        Dominus will be most pleased that 
                        you have accompanied me.

  Vettius stops, frowning at his surroundings.

                                          VETTIUS
                        You have turned yourself about. 
                        This is not the direction of the 
                        fucking arena.

                                        INDUS
                                  with a smile)(
                        No. It is not.

  WHAM! Indus suddenly kicks Vettius hard in the balls. 
  Vettius crumples in agony. His Bodyguards start for Indus.

  ASHUR AND DAGAN

  emerge from the shadows behind them, hoods raised. They set 
  upon the men with daggers, brutally stabbing them to death.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.

                        continues kicking until Vettius is 
                      an unconscious, bloody mess. Ashur 
                        finishes his grim work, pulls Indus 
                        off.

                                        ASHUR
                      We are to leave this one alive, you 
                        simple fuck!
                                (to Dagan, in 
                                  Aramaic)
                        'Aved-leh. [Do it.]

  Dagan grins as he reaches down OUT OF FRAME, parts his 
  robes, and PISSES on Vettius' battered face. Indus laughs in 
    adrenaline-fueled relief.

                                        INDUS
                        Our charge is met. I will not see 
                        the mines.

                                        ASHUR
                        I fear they would have been a 
                        blessing.

  Ashur suddenly SLITS INDUS' THROAT. Indus gurgles in shock. 
  Ashur catches him, gently easing him to the ground.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Apologies, brother. Vettius saw 
                        your face. Dominus gave 
                        instruction.

  The life fades from Indus' eyes. Ashur and Dagan raise their 
  hoods and disappear down the alley, WIPING US TO:



  QUINTILIUS VARUS, 40s, glowers by his litter. He is a high-
  class Roman, adorned in colorful robes and jewelry. Carries 
  himself as if the rest of the world is steeped in shit. He 
  frowns at the crowd, growls to an ATTENDING SLAVE.

                                        VARUS
                        Where the fuck is Vettius?

  Varus turns to find Gaia approaching. Gaia beams at their 
  "chance" meeting.

                        A visit to see dearest friend. 
                        Lucretia!

  She motions Lucretia over, who has busied herself pretending 
  to examine a MERCHANT'S JEWELRY.

                        are the saving grace of this ill-
                        bred town.

  Lucretia joins them. Gaia introduces her.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                        This is Quintilius Varus, an

                        His wine is the toast of Rome.

                        I fear it shall be tragically one 
                        sided.  The sun threatens to bake 
                      me senseless.

  Gaia looks to Lucretia, a subtle smile bending her lips.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My husband's villa is but a little 
                        ways from here. You are more than 
                        welcome --

                                        VARUS
                        Gratitude. But I would seek Vettius 
                        out, and place foot to ass for his 
                        delay.

  Varus motions for his Slaves to prepare the litter. Lucretia 
  shoots Gaia a nervous look. Varus slips from grasp.

                        Lucretia's slaves know the man. 
                        They can just as easily bring him 
                      to her villa when discovered. It 
                        would give us much needed pause to 
                        reacquaint ourselves.

  She produces an irresistible smile. He laughs, gives in.

                                        VARUS
                      It would be ungrateful, to refuse 
                        such kind offering.
                                to Lucretia)(
                        Your villa, then.

                        receive you.

  OFF Lucretia's smile of relief and victory...



  Practice swords CLASH as the men train. Gannicus and 
  Oenomaus spar. Gannicus lands a blow, laughs.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Bested me in training, did you?

  Oenomaus rears back to attack, but is interrupted by 
  Batiatus appearing on the balcony with Varus, Gaia, and 
  Lucretia. Naevia accompanies.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Doctore! Call the men to form.

  Doctore CRACKS his whip.

  Varus takes them in, considering. Melitta enters with Diona, 
  carrying more wine.

  Oenomaus feels the sting of that, shares a pained look with 
  Melitta.

  He gives Gaia an unhappy look. She responds with a disarming 
  smile, impervious to such things.

                        The House of Batiatus is humbled by 
                        the attentions of Quintilius Varus.

                      It is the tradition, when blood is 
                        not the purpose.

                      So they are to fight as children? 
                        Not men?

  Batiatus squirms. Gaia gives him a veiled look, urging him 
  to acquiesce. Batiatus smiles, nods.

  Doctore barely holds his tongue, not caring for this at all. 
  He barks to the LUDUS SLAVE.

                        The gods must have heard you. They 
                        present opportunity to become 
                        champion.

  Crixus licks his lips, pushes his doubt aside. Gannicus is 
  right: this is his chance. Gaia tenses with excitement. 
  Batiatus raises his fist, brings it down.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  Crixus CHARGES with a whirlwind of blows. Gannicus laughs, 
  impressed as he blocks each one.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Oenomaus has trained you well.

  Gannicus counters, draws blood.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        Yet you are pale imitation of the 
                        man.

  Crixus snarls, redoubles his assault. They trade thunderous 
  blows, but Crixus is obviously outmatched.

  ASHUR AND DAGAN

  emerge from the ludus barracks, returned to proper attire. 
  Ashur registers surprise -- and sadness -- at the fight.

                                        ASHUR
                                (in Aramaic, re: 
                                  Crixus)
                        Nasha Hrena minnan nafel yawma 
                        dena. [Another one of us falls this 
                        day.]

  Gannicus drives Crixus back, hacking and slashing. Batiatus 
  glances over to Varus to gauge the man's interest. And is 
    disappointed to find him barely watching, instead whispering 
  to Gaia. She laughs, playfully swatting at him.

                                        GAIA
                        You lie! I did no such thing!

  Batiatus shoots Lucretia a sour look. What the fuck is that 
  woman doing?


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.
  CONTINUED:

  GANNICUS

  presses his attack, laughing. But Crixus suddenly sidesteps 
  and spins around, as Doctore taught him. Lucretia gasps in 
  surprise as Crixus draws blood. The Gladiators are just as 
  shocked as Gannicus.

  CRIXUS

  surges, pressing his advantage. He catches Gannicus across 
  the jaw with his shield, sending him to a knee.

  TIME SLOWS

  as Crixus leaps, sword swung high, ready to sever Gannicus' 
  head from his body. Melitta's eyes widen in horror. Batiatus 
  constricts, the impossible happening.

  TIME RESUMES

  as Crixus descends -- and Gannicus CATCHES the strike with 
  his swords crossed in front of him. A frozen moment.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  sincerely)(
                        A fine attempt.

  WHAM! Gannicus disarms Crixus and sends him crashing to the 
  sand. Crixus reaches for his sword but Gannicus is on him in 
  a flash, his weapon at the Gaul's neck. Gannicus looks to 
  Batiatus for instruction. Batiatus laughs, delighted.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Now that is demonstration unlike 
                        any before it! What say you, good 
                        Varus? Should the Gaul live or die?

  Varus glances down, only marginally interested.

                                        VARUS
                        Gaia chose the man. The choice is 
                        hers.

  Gaia considers Crixus, smiles.

                                        GAIA
                        Let him live. He may yet find his 
                        use.

  Batiatus nods to Gannicus. Gannicus grins, offers Crixus a 
  hand up. He takes it, relief washing across his face.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

                        What of my man Gannicus? Did you 
                        find --

                                        GAIA
                        The man is weary from his travels. 
                        Let us not press him with further 
                        business.
                                to Varus)(
                        Come. See yourself inside, to 
                        sample other indulgences. Some 
                        delights from Cyprus, perhaps...?

  Varus smiles, his interest returning.

                                        VARUS
                        A region I am most fond of.

                                        GAIA
                      As I recall.

  Gaia motions him in. Batiatus stops her before she can 
  follow.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  hissing)(
                        What the fuck are you doing?

                        What I do best. Varus is a man of 
                        particular appetites. Which grow 
                        large under influence of wine and 
                        opium. See your man Gannicus oiled 
                        and scented, to be presented as the 
                        hour passes.

  She slips into the villa to join Varus. Batiatus seethes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I risk all to lure Varus to our 
                        house, only to find I am no longer 
                        the master of it.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        She knows the man more intimately. 
                      We must lend our trust.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And pray it is not soiled upon 
                        return.

  Batiatus exits. OFF Lucretia, increasingly uncertain of 
  where exactly Gaia's true intentions lie...                                                                                    37.



  TIGHT ON a HOT BRAND brought to bear on flesh. WIDEN TO 
  REVEAL Doctore roughly applying it to a kneeling Dagan. A 
  small crowd of Gladiators has gathered to watch. Crixus 
  stands at the back. Dagan grunts in pain.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Welcome to the fucking Brotherhood.

  He kicks Dagan to the ground, stabbing the brand back into 
  the fire. Ashur, kneeling beside Dagan, eyes it in 
    trepidation. Oenomaus appears from the barracks, surprised.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                to Crixus)(

                        The Syrians receive the mark.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Absent the test?

  CONTINUED:

  Doctore removes the red hot brand, descends on Ashur.

                                        ASHUR
                        Wait. Are we not to recite the 
                        oath?

                                          DOCTORE
                        I will not see more shit heaped 
                        upon sacred rites.

  Doctore brands him, grinding the hot metal into his forearm. 
  Ashur half screams in pain.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        You may bear the mark, but do not 
                        think yourself a gladiator, you 
                        little cunt.

  Doctore raises the brand to club Ashur with it. Oenomaus 
  steps forward.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Doctore --

                      Do not fucking speak to me in such 
                        tone!

  Oenomaus is taken aback by Doctore's rage.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Apologies --

                        You believe yourself my equal, 
                        Oenomaus?

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  confused)(
                        No, Doctore.

                        Gladius!

  The men MURMUR. The ludus Slave hesitates.

                        Bring fucking swords!

  The ludus Slave scampers to comply. Doctore pins Oenomaus 
  with a deadly glare.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                        I have to teach.

  OFF Doctore's confusion and shock...



  Swords CLASH as Doctore unleashes his fury on Oenomaus. 
  Oenomaus defends himself, but does not return the attack. 
  Crixus and the other men watch the battle in silence, 
  trading uncomfortable glances.

                                          DOCTORE
                      Is this what I taught you? How to 
                        turn upon heel?

                                        OENOMAUS

                        Fight, you fucking coward! Prove 
                        yourself worthy!

  Doctore slices Oenomaus across the chest. Oenomaus grunts in 
  surprise. His own eyes fill with pain and rage as he 
  unleashes a vicious assault. Doctore counters, slamming him 
  to the ground.

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:



  The blood flows as Doctore and Oenomaus trade blows. A 
  battle of the titans.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  Doctore relentlessly attacks, driving Oenomaus back to the 
  edge of the cliff. At the last second before tumbling off 
  the edge Oenomaus counters, driving his blade through the 
  lower left side of Doctore's leather chestplate.

                                                                            SMASH TO:                                                                                    45.



  Oenomaus stands frozen, his sword deep within Doctore's gut. 
  Oenomaus' own guilt and shame well in his eyes. But the rage 
  fades from Doctore's. He grins in love and appreciation, 
  blood dripping from his mouth.

                                          DOCTORE
                                  soft)(
                        I have taught you well.

  Doctore slides to the ground, dead. OFF Oenomaus' shock...



  SLOW MOTION. The Gladiators watch in silence as GUARDS carry 
  Doctore's body away. Oenomaus holds Doctore's chestplate at 
  his side, eyes filled with pain and regret. The Guards move 
  past, WIPING US TO:                                                                                    48.



  SLOW MOTION. Gannicus stands at the cliff, looking out at 
  the valley below. He turns to see Melitta being escorted by 
  Guards, heading for Oenomaus' cell. She meets his eyes, then 
  looks away, unable to bear the guilt. Gannicus turns back to 
  the valley, TRANSITIONING US TO:
