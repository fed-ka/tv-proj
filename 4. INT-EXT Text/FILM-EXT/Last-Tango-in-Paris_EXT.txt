PAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE.
He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a
train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD.
He BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS.
PAUL
(ENGLISH)
FUCKING GOD!!!!
As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a
private WORLD OF PAIN.
Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered
hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's).
As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a
HINT of EMPATHY on her face.
He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter.
She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long
walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.
We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING.
Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as
he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.
CUT TO:
Jeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1
RUE JULES VERNE. She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door frame.
She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL. She checks her watch.
She SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs.
She goes into a BAR.
CUT TO:
Paul comes out the FRONT DOOR. He puts on his TRENCH COAT.
Jeanne LAGS behind, trying to fix herself also.
8.
Paul takes the FOR RENT sign off the DOOR FRAME as Jeanne
heads off, still STUPEFIED.
He watches her descend the stairs and throws the CRUMPLED UP
sign on the sidewalk.
PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - CONTINUOUS
They go their SEPARATE WAYS. Jeanne crosses the street while
Paul takes the RAISED WALKWAY.
CUT TO:
Jeanne RUNS through the crowd IN A PANIC dodging people. She
finds who she is LOOKING FOR, her boyfriend TOM (30's). She
runs into his arms like LONG LOST LOVERS.
All of the sudden, a FILM CREW appears, filming their every
moment.
They KISS PASSIONATELY.
Tom tries to UNTANGLE HER from the cords.
TOM
Watch out!
JEANNE
Have they taken us for someone
else?
TOM
We're in a film.
He walks her and EXPLAINS.
TOM (CONT'D)
We're in a film. If I kiss you...
He KISSES HER...
TOM (CONT'D)
... it might be cinema. If I stroke
your hair, it might be cinema.
They walk on as the SOUND ENGINEER pokes a MICROPHONE in
their faces.
JEANNE
What's going on? Do you know them?
9.
TOM
It's a long story. In short,
Portrait of a Girl. It's been
accepted for television! And the
girl is you. It's you!
JEANNE
You're mad! You might have asked me
first.
TOM
Yeah, but I wanted...
Jeanne SMACKS THE MICROPHONE out of their faces.
TOM (CONT'D)
I wanted to start with shots of
Jeanne at the station meeting her
fianc. Yes, I know them. They're
my crew.
JEANNE
So you kissed me, and you knew it
was being filmed. You're a bastard!
Traitor!
TOM
No, you'll see. It will be a love
story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling.
What did you do while I was away?
JEANNE
I thought of you day and night, and
I cried. Darling, I can't live
without you!
TOM
Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect!
He is THRILLED. He tries to kiss her but she won't let him.
She is still MIFFED. But she finally GIVES IN. They have a
PASSIONATE EMBRACE.
CUT TO:
Formerly known as the Passy Viaduct. We see a great shot of
the DOUBLE-DECKER ROAD-AND-RAIL BRIDGE and PAUL'S NEW
APARTMENT BUILDING.
CUT TO:
... A DOVER OF LIVE DUCKS QUACKING --
Tom and his FILM CREW record the ducks for b.g. SOUND CLIPS
while they WAIT FOR JEANNE.
This includes ROOSTERS, PIGEONS and annoyed NAIL FILING by
one of the CREW.
FINALLY, Jeanne opens the gate door, sheepishly. She is LATE
and has a DIFFERENT HAIR STYLE.
Tom is MIFFED, for continuity sake...
DIALOGUE IS FRENCH
TOM
You shouldn't have done that to me.
She is much more EXCITED about the NEW PERM.
JEANNE
It's not a wig, it's my hair.
She CLOSES THE GATE.
Doesn't it suit me? Tell me, don't
you like it? Tell me.
24.
TOM
Of course I like it. Listen, you
know... I don't know. You have
changed, and yet you haven't. I can
see the shot now.
He twirls around, setting up the shot between his hands and
his MINDS EYE...
TOM (CONT'D)
The camera is up high. It descends
slowly and follows you. You come
forward, and it moves in on you.
There's music, too. It gets closer
and closer to you.
JEANNE
I'm in a hurry. Let's start.
She MOSEYS OFF.
TOM
But... can't we talk a little
first?
JEANNE
Tonight we improvise. You follow.
He does.
FAMILY PET GRAVE-YARD - CONTINUOUS
Jeanne kneels in front of a HEAD STONE that reads "Mustapha".
JEANNE (CONT'D)
He was my childhood friend. He used
to watch me for hours and hours. I
think he understood me.
A VOICE from behind Jeanne pipes in.
OLYMPIA'S VOICE
Dogs are worth more than people.
Much more.
Jeanne smiles, FAMILIAR.
JEANNE
Meet Olympia, my nanny.
OLYMPIA
Mustapha could always tell the poor
from the rich.
(MORE)
25.
OLYMPIA (CONT'D)
If someone well-dressed came in, he
never stirred. But if someone
scruffy came in, you should have
seen him! What a dog!
The colonel trained him to
recognise Arabs by their scent.
JEANNE
Olympia, open the front door.
OLYMPIA
Give me a kiss.
Jeanne stands and KISSES HER on the cheek through the gate.
JEANNE
Go and open it.
(TO TOM)
Olympia is a compendium of domestic
virtues. Faithful, admiring, and
racist.
We watch Olympia walk to the MANOR HOUSE as Jeanne WAXES
NOSTALGIC. Slowly, the rest of the property is revealed to
us.
JEANNE'S VOICE
After Papa died, we moved back to
the family home for a while. My
childhood was made up of smells.
Musty smells, the smell of walls
and rooms.
A GROUP OF KIDS runs into the yard.
Children used to come and play in
my jungle, all day long. Growing
old is a crime.
CUT TO:
Jeanne and Tom walk BUNDLED TOGETHER as Jeanne REMINISCES...
JEANNE'S VOICE
Sitting at the piano... His fingers
would skim the keys.
The FILM CREW follow them, filming.
30.
Olympia stumbles behind, watching.
JEANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
He played for hours and hours. At
the bottom of the garden, there
were two big trees. A plane tree
and a chestnut tree. After mass on
Sundays, we used to sit there, each
under our own tree. It was
wonderful. We sat gazing into each
other's eyes.
All WANDER THE GARDEN.
JEANNE
Aren't my trees beautiful? They
were my jungle.
They come upon the CROWD OF KIDS again. One KID is squatting
behind some thatch, doing his business.
JEANNE (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
KID 1
Having a shit.
The boy pooping stops and PULLS UP HIS PANTS.
KID 2
No, we're doing a poo.
Jeanne SCOLDS THEM.
JEANNE
Shame on you, doing it in my
jungle!
KID 1
Watch out!
KID 2
Run for it!
They SCATTER towards the STONE WALL with Olympia and Crew
CHASING AFTER THEM.
OLYMPIA
Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go
and shit in your own country!
The kids CLIMB THE WALL for escape from the CRAZY ADULTS.
31.
TOM
Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't
stop, whatever you do!
Tom wanders back over to Jeanne while Olympia and the Crew
continue to SCARE OFF THE KIDS in the b.g..
JEANNE
Did you get it?
TOM
Everything.
JEANNE
Olympia was great. It'll give a
good idea of race relations in the
suburbs of Paris.
TOM
It's a real jungle here. So, tell
me about your father.
JEANNE
I thought we'd finished.
TOM
Five minutes.
JEANNE
I'm meeting someone for work.
TOM
But the colonel... the colonel!
But Jeanne is OFF.
AND WE CUT TO--
CUT TO:
A TRAIN ROARS by on the TRAIN BRIDGE.
CUT TO:
Another couple of TRAINS go by.
CUT TO:
HIPPIE MUSIC CONTINUES
Tom and Jeanne sit, ROMANTICALLY ENTWINED on a SEA WALL while
his FILM CREW films in the b.g.
They sit FACE TO FACE, he holds her shoulders and stares into
her eyes.
TOM
Do you know why I sent the others
away?
JEANNE
Because you're angry, or you want
to be alone with me?
60.
TOM
And why do I want to be alone with
you?
JEANNE
You have something really serious
to tell me.
He plays with her hair.
TOM
I have something really very
serious to tell you.
JEANNE
Is it happy or sad?
TOM
It's a secret.
JEANNE
So it's happy. What sort of secret?
TOM
A secret...
As his FILM CREW dolly around them in the b.g., his SOUND
PERSON yells at them.
SOUND PERSON
Speak up! I can't hear anything.
TOM
...between a man and a woman.
JEANNE
Is it dirty or is it about love?
TOM
About love. But that's not all.
JEANNE
A secret about love, but which
isn't love. What is it?!
He puts a LIFE PRESERVER over her.
TOM
Voila. That in a week I'm marrying
you.
JEANNE
What?
61.
TOM
I'm marrying you.
JEANNE
What?!
TOM
I'm marrying you!
JEANNE
You're marrying me?
TOM
Yes!
JEANNE
We're getting married?
TOM
Yes we're getting married.
JEANNE
No.
TOM
Yes.
JEANNE
No!
TOM
Yes.
JEANNE
Yes?
TOM
Yes.
JEANNE
No.
TOM
Yes.
JEANNE
Yes?
TOM
No. Are we getting married or not?
JEANNE
I don't know.
62.
TOM
So, yes, then?
JEANNE
Yes!
TOM
No!
JEANNE
Yes!
TOM
Yes.
JEANNE
No.
TOM
Yes or no?
She take the life preserver off and THROWS IT IN THE WATER.
Together, they WATCH IT SINK.
CUT TO:
JEANNE'S MOTHER beats the dirt off her LATE HUSBANDS MILITARY
JACKET.
JEANNE'S MOTHER
Of course, I'll send everything to
the country. What do you think,
Jeanne?
Tom and his FILM CREW film Jeanne trying on wedding dresses.
He COUNTS DOWN to the shot.
TOM
Five... two!
He does the CLAPPER with his hands.
Jeanne and her HOST OF DRESSERS is lost in her fittings.
TOM (CONT'D)
Move into shot! We're shooting!
They move into the center of the shop.
We get another look at Jeanne's LEFT BREAST as it slips out
of the dress being fitted.
Tom fires off QUESTIONS for film purposes.
TOM (CONT'D)
So,... how do you see marriage?
JEANNE
Marriage?
TOM
Yes.
Jeanne gives her upbeat EXTISTENTIAL RESPONSES as her fitting
continues.
JEANNE
I see it everywhere. All the time.
66.
TOM
What do you mean, everywhere?
JEANNE
On walls. On buildings.
TOM
Walls and buildings?
JEANNE
Yes, on advertising hoardings.
TOM
What are they selling? Cars. Tinned
meat. Cigarettes.
JEANNE
No. They're all about young
couples. Before marriage, no
children. Then the same couple,
married with children. In short,
marriage. The perfect, ideal,
successful marriage. It's no longer
the preserve of the Church. The
husband was burdened with
responsibilities and the wife
nagged. Now, weddings in
advertising smile!
TOM
They smile. On posters.
JEANNE
On posters, of course. But why t
take poster marriage seriously?
Marriage... Pop marriage!
Tom comes out from under a DRESS.
TOM
Pop? That's the formula. For pop
youth, pop marriage! But... what if
the pop marriage doesn't work?
JEANNE
Then you have to fix it like you
would a car. The spouses are two
workers in overalls bending over an
engine to fix it.
TOM
And in case of adultery what
happens to the pop marriage?
67.
JEANNE
In that case, there are three or
four workers.
TOM
What about love? Is love pop?
JEANNE
No. That's not. Love isn't pop.
TOM
Love isn't pop. So what is it?
JEANNE
The workers retire to a secret
flat, take off their overalls
and become men and women again
and make love.
The fussing on the dress is finished. Jeanne slowly, PUTS ON
HER GLOVES, relishing them.
She STRUTS slowly for all to stare and LAVISH her in her
dress.
Tom is CAPTIVATED.
TOM
You're wonderful.
JEANNE
It's the dress that makes the
bride.
TOM
You're better than Rita Hayworth.
He wanders out into the street. It is RAINING HEAVILY.
Better than Joan Crawford! Better
than Kim Novak! Better than Lauren
Bacall! Better than Ava Gardner
when she was Mickey Rooney's lover!
Hes FILM CREW scatters for cover.
TOM (CONT'D)
What are you doing? Stop! Stop, but
keep filming! Why aren't you
filming in the rain?
CREW 1
You're crazy!
68.
They huddle underneath the DOOR of the FILM TRUCK.
Tom has lost Jeanne in all the HUBUB. He is disgusted with
his CREW.
TOM
You're all fired!
He goes back to the SHOP.
TOM (CONT'D)
Where's Jeanne?
DRESSER 1
She must have run off.
TOM
When? ln the rain?
He runs down the street in the rain looking for her.
JEANNE
Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!
CUT TO:
The JOHN figures he has gotten away. He reverses his TRENCH
COAT to the appropriate side.
Paul comes around the corner. The John doesn't see any
HOSTILITY coming. But it DOES.
JOHN
Oh,... please don't tell her you
found me. I don't fancy it any
more. Did you see her face? Once,
my wife satisfied me. But now she's
got a skin disease. It's like
snakeskin. Put yourself in my
place.
Paul grabs him by the tie and drags him.
PAUL
Come. Come with me.
The man FIGHTS BACK.
JOHN
But... Let go of me!
Paul doesn't like that. He ROUGHS HIM UP, throwing him from
WALL TO WALL.
JOHN (CONT'D)
You're crazy! Let go of me! Let go!
He ends up on the ground MINUS HIS COAT. Paul KICKS HIM IN
THE ASS like a dog.
PAUL
Get the fuck out of here!
82.
The man RUNS OFF.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Faggot!
Paul heads back up the ALLEY as the man CONTINUES OFF in the
f.g.
CUT TO:
We watch Jeanne come out of the APARTMENT BUILDING. She
climbs the stairs to the RAISED WALKWAY. She is back where it
all started. We watch her a bit.
RAISED WALKWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Jeanne walks, in her own world. A somewhat MORE CONTENT world
now. Back to HERSELF.
We suddenly see Paul. He watches her for a moment before
TRAILING HER. He is more DRESSED UP then we have seen him
previously.
As she walks, he RUNS UP BEHIND her and playfully taps her on
her SHOULDER.
She turns, SURPRISED.
DIALOGUE IS ENGLISH
PAUL
It's me again.
She stops and stares at him, DISGUSTED by his GALL and over
him.
JEANNE
It's over. It's over.
He doesn't get the hint. He doesn't care what she says. He
presses on PLAYFULLY.
PAUL
It's over, then it begins again.
JEANNE
What begins again? I don't
understand anything any more.
PAUL
There's nothing to understand. We
left the apartment. Now we begin
again with love and all the rest of
it.
JEANNE
The rest?
PAUL
Yeah, listen.
He puts his arm around her as THEY STROLL.
89.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I'm 45. I'm a widower. I've got a
little hotel, a kind of a dump. But
it's not completely a flophouse.
And... I used to live on my luck,
and I got married. My wife killed
herself.
AND WE...
CUT TO:
She is RUNNING on the sidewalk past crowds of people, the
OFFICE OF TOURISM and stores. He is in HOT PURSUIT.
She stops and turns to have a EMPHATIC SILENT CHAT with him.
He still finds this to be VERY HUMOROUS. She grows more and
more SERIOUS and SCARED.
She starts RUNNING again. But she TIRES OUT in a ...
PARKING LOT
She tries to GET THROUGH TO HIM.
JEANNE
Stop! Stop!
PAUL
Hold it!
He still DOESN'T GET IT.
JEANNE
It's over!
He tries to EMBRACE HER.
PAUL
Hey, cool it!
She THROWS HIM OFF.
JEANNE
Stop it! We're finished.
He still tries to GRAB HER PURSE. She is ADAMANT.
JEANNE (CONT'D)
Go away! Go away! Go away!
He keeps trying to grab her purse.
JEANNE (CONT'D)
Let go! Go away!
He FEIGNS GIVING UP as she walks on.
PAUL
I can't win. Give me a break!
She JETS OFF AGAIN and we round a corner...
SIDE STREET
98.
He keeps his distance on the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET but
still doesn't get that SHE IS SERIOUS. She tries to explain
it to him.
JEANNE
I'll call the police!
He BLOWS IT OFF.
PAUL
Aha! I smell the henhouse.
She needs to GO WHERE HE IS. She starts toward him TIMIDLY.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Well, shit, I'm not in your way.
He feigns a GRAND GESTURE ushering her free travel.
PAUL (CONT'D)
After you, mademoiselle!
She TENTATIVELY walks on as he PRETENDS TO ALSO.
PAUL (CONT'D)
So long, sister. Besides, you're a
crummy-looking broad. I don't give
a damn if I never see you again.
Shit.
She MAKES A BEE - LINE to her MOTHERS APARTMENT BUILDING.
He TAKES OFF after her.
