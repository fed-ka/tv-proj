                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - DAY11

      In a stunned daze, Scott stares out to the now empty road in *
      front of the school. Having just said goodbye to Allison. *
      Having recognized her father as the leader of the hunters. 
      And having realized his entire life is now an unmitigated 
      disaster.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAYA2A2*

      Scott slowly drops his bag in front of his locker. The gloves *
      fall to the floor next to it. He seems to be moving in a *
      trance. He slowly turns, back against the locker, eyes *
      staring in shock.*

      Stiles leans his head out from the corner.*

                                    STILES*
                    You apologize to Allison?*

                                  SCOTT*
                    Yeah.*

                                    STILES*
                    So she s giving you a second *
                    chance?*

                                  SCOTT*
                    Yeah.*

                                    STILES*
                    Then everything s good?*

                                  SCOTT*
                    No.*

                                    STILES*
                    No?*

                                  SCOTT*
                    Remember the hunters? Her dad is *
                    one of them.*

                                    STILES*
                    Her dad?*                      TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/111-2A.

      CONTINUED:A2A2

                                  SCOTT*
                    Is one of the hunters.*

                                    STILES*
                    Allison s father?*

                                  SCOTT*
                    Shot me. With a crossbow.*

                                    STILES*
                      Allison s--*

                                  SCOTT*
                    YES. HER FATHER!*

      Scott snaps out of the daze and into a full on panic.*

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)*
                    Oh my God, what am I going to do?*

                                    STILES*
                    Okay, okay--did he recognize you?*

                                  SCOTT*
                    No, I don t think so--*

                                    STILES*
                    Does she know about him?*

                                  SCOTT*
                    I--I don t know.*

                                    STILES*
                    All right, okay, we ll figure it *
                    out. Just--just concentrate on *
                    practice. On lacrosse. Scott?*

                                  SCOTT*
                          (nodding)*
                      Lacrosse.*

      And Stiles slams the door shut as--*

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - DAY22

      Players slam into each other during practice.*                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/113.

        CONTINUED:22

      Coach Finstock tosses the ball to the first player, a kid *
      named GREENBERG. But Jackson is on him in seconds, smashing 
      his stick down on the poor kid s gloves, sending the ball 
      flying out of the pocket.

                                  COACH
                    Nicely done, Jackson. Greenberg, 
                    that was a pathetic display of 
                    amateur ability. Do a lap.                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/114.

        CONTINUED:22

      As Greenberg takes off into a run, the next Player charges. A 
      moment later he lands on the ground with a sickening THUD.

      Scott, gazing off with far too many thoughts swirling in his 
      head, doesn t notice the other players backing up behind him.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    McCall, let s go!

      He snaps to attention, realizing he s at the head of the 
      line. Coach tosses the ball. Scott goes for the shot. But 
      Jackson comes at him with a volley of SLAP CHECKS.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Watch the slashing, Jackson!

      As the ball is knocked out of his grasp, Scott winces in 
      pain. He cradles his forearm where Jackson s stick came down 
      especially hard between glove and elbow pad.

                                    JACKSON
                    Still want to be first line, 
                    McCall?

      Gritting his teeth in anger, Scott looks up to reveal his 
      brown eyes are rapidly brightening to YELLOW.

                                  COACH
                    McCall, my grandmother can move 
                    faster than that and she s dead! 
                    Can you move faster than the 
                    lifeless corpse of my dead 
                      grandmother, McCall?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yes, Coach!

                                  COACH
                    Then do it again!

      The WHISTLE BLOWS and Scott shoots forward again as Coach 
      tosses the ball to him.

      Stiles steps away from the rest of the team, noticing the 
      change in Scott. His speed, the extraordinary agility with 
      which he moves.

      An oblivious Jackson goes for a CROSS CHECK, heading for 
      Scott with his stick horizontal even as the smaller boy 
      hurtles toward him with ferocious speed.

      They COLLIDE like two goats locking horns. Both go down, 
      Jackson HOLLERING as he hits the ground.                           TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/115.

        CONTINUED:22

      The sickening SOUND of bone dislodging from socket sends a 
      cringe through Coach. 

      While everyone else runs over to check on Jackson, Stiles 
      hurries to Scott s side.

                                  STILES
                    Are you okay?

      But Scott won t lift his head, won t reveal his face to 
      Stiles underneath the helmet.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Scott?

      His head tilts up to reveal the sharpened teeth jutting out 
      from his lower jaw.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s happening. I can t control it. 
                    It s happening.

      Grabbing him by the shoulder pads, Stiles pulls him up.

                                  STILES
                    Come on. Before anyone sees. Come, 
                    on, come on!

      As Stiles drags him off the field and toward the lockers, 
      neither of them notice someone watching from the sidelines...

      Derek Hale.

      INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY33

      The door to the darkened locker room CLANGS open, Stiles 
      dragging a hunched over Scott inside.

                                  SCOTT
                    Get back.

                                  STILES
                    I m just trying to help--

                                  SCOTT
                    Get away from me.

      His VOICE comes out with a frighteningly demonic rasp, head 
      snapping around as if to rip out the other boy s throat.

      Stiles retreats, almost stumbling over his own feet at the 
      sight of Scott s EYES. The sounds coming from him are 
      painful, animalistic and frighteningly aggressive.                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/116.

        CONTINUED:33

      Turning back, Scott doubles over in pain. He tears off his 
      lacrosse gloves to reveal his SHARPENED CLAWS.

      Stiles keeps stepping away in fear, accidentally backing into 
      a FIRE EXTINGUISHER against the wall.

      THE CLANG OF METAL causes Scott to whip his head around. But 
      it s no longer Scott under that helmet or behind those rage-
      filled yellow eyes.

      He hurtles toward Stiles, rounding the corner of the lockers, 
      jumping onto the wood bench and up as--

      Stiles lifts the FIRE EXTINGUISHER and pulls the trigger, 
      BLASTING CO2 from the nozzle. Scott s clawed hands come up to 
      shield his face, PLUMES OF WHITE surrounding him.

      Darting around another corner, Stiles backs against the 
      lockers, waiting for the next attack.

                                  SCOTT (O.S.) (CONT D) 
                    Stiles?

      Slowly, Stiles peers around the locker row to see Scott on 
      the floor, chest heaving with each difficult breath. He pulls 
      the helmet off to reveal--

      He s back to normal. Face drenched with sweat.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    What happened?

                                  STILES
                    You tried to kill me.

      Stiles drops the extinguisher to the floor. Still shaking and 
      unable to conceal his anger at his friend.                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/117.

                    It s like I told you. It s the 
                    anger, your pulse rising. They re 
                    all triggers.

                                  SCOTT
                    But that s lacrosse. It s a pretty 
                    violent game if you hadn t noticed.

                                  STILES
                    A lot more violent if you end up 
                    killing someone. You can t play 
                    Saturday. You have to get out of 
                    the game.

                                  SCOTT
                    But I m first line.

                                  STILES
                    Not anymore.

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT44

      An emotionally and physically exhausted Scott tosses his 
      school bag on the floor and falls face first onto the bed. 
      Melissa McCall looks in.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Late shift again for me, but I m 
                    taking a night off to see your

                                  SCOTT

                    I can and I will. One shift won t 
                    break us. Not completely. And 
                    what s wrong with your eyes?

      Scott glances up in alarm.

                    You look like you haven t slept in

                    Kind of? Nothing else? You re not 
                    on drugs or anything?

                                  SCOTT

                    What do you mean right now? Have

                                  SCOTT
                    Have you?

      A question she clearly doesn t want to answer.

                    Get some sleep.

      Car keys in hand, Melissa leaves. 

      Scott drags himself up from the bed and hits the mouse on his 
      computer. The moment it WAKES, a web chat INVITATION from 
      Stiles pops up. Scott hits ACCEPT and Stiles appears in the 
      window.

                                  SCOTT
                    What d you find out?

                                  STILES
                    It s bad. Jackson s got a separated 
                    shoulder.

                                  SCOTT
                    Because of me?

                                  STILES
                    Because he s a tool. It s not your 
                    fault.

                                  SCOTT
                    Is he going to play?

                                  STILES
                    They don t know yet. But now 
                    they re all counting on you for 
                      Saturday...

      Stiles pauses mid-sentence. Then comes closer to the web cam 
      window, squinting his eyes at it. He seems to be looking at 
      something in Scott s room.                          TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/119.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

      A TEXT WINDOW pops up on Scott s screen. Stiles types: 

      It looks like--

      The cursor turns into a SPINNING WHEEL, the computer 
      momentarily hung up. Stiles s web cam image freezes.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                          (impatient)
                    Looks like what?

      A moment later, the cursor finally stops spinning and the 
      rest of the text appears: 

      It looks like someone s behind you.

      Scott stops breathing. He doesn t turn around. Staying very 
      still, his eyes move to his OWN IMAGE in the bottom corner of 
      the web cam window. He slowly clicks the mouse, re-sizing the 
      window, making it larger and larger until--

      He sees his own reflected face, an expression of pure fear on 
      it. And behind him--

      A STRANGE SILHOUETTE. Someone is standing there in the 
      shadows of his room.

      Scott spins around and Derek grabs him, yanking him away from 
      the desk, sending the laptop clattering to the floor. 
      Dragging him up, he slams Scott face first to the wall.

      Derek comes terrifyingly close, right next to Scott s ear.

                    I ll kill you myself.

      He pulls Scott from the wall and sends him tumbling across 
      the room. When Scott looks up from the floor--

      Derek is gone.

      The bedroom window lies open where he must have leapt with 
      incredible speed, leaving Scott alone in his room. 

      And shaking in fear...

      INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY55

      Scott follows Coach into the locker room before classes.

                    Listen, McCall. Part of playing 
                    first line is taking on the 
                      responsibility of being the first 
                    line in the game. If you can t 
                    shoulder that responsibility then 
                    you re back on the bench until 
                    you re ready.

                    Play the game, McCall.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY66

      Stepping back into the corridor and into the rush of 
      students, Scott jumps when his phone RINGS in his pocket.

      He takes it out to read a text message from MOM: Got the 
      night off! Coming to see you play! So excited!!                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1113.

      Scott breathes a sigh of frustration. His phone BUZZES again 
      with a second text from Mom: What does LMFAO mean?

      He s about to type back when he notices someone coming down 
      the corridor to find him--

      Allison Argent. She walks through the crowd, every teenage 
      male eye seeming to follow her. But her perfect smile is 
      reserved for Scott.

                                    ALLISON
                          (nodding to the phone)
                    Hey, you busy?

                                  SCOTT
                    No. It s just my Mom. She s 
                    nothing. I mean it s nothing. I m 
                    never busy. For you.

                                    ALLISON
                    I like the sound of that. I have to 
                    run to French class but I wanted 
                    you to know I m coming to see you 
                    play tomorrow.

                    to be great. And bring Stiles too. 
                    Save me a seat at lunch. Gotta  go.

      Scott barely has a chance to nod as she hurries off. But just 
      before she disappears into the rush of students, she smiles 
      at him again. With a quick wave, she s gone.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1114.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/ADJACENT CORRIDOR - DAY77

      Down the adjacent hall, Allison stops at her locker, quickly 
      spins the combo, grabs her French book and--

      Stops when she notices something strange inside. Slowly, she 
      pulls an item out, one that shouldn t be there... Her JACKET 
      from the party.

      As she eases the locker shut, she notices how very alone she 
      is in the corridor. She gazes down one end of the hall and 
      then the other.

      Not a soul. Not a sound. Until--

      THE SECOND BELL RINGS, startling her. Breathing a short laugh 
      at herself, she hurries off to class.

      At the chalkboard with other students solving algebra 
      problems, Lydia whispers to Scott.

                    Like Derek.

                    Your friend?

                                  SCOTT
                    He s not my friend. How much did 
                    you talk to him when he drove you 
                    home?

                                    ALLISON
                    Not much at all.

                    What did you say?

                    Sorry, but I have to get to my next

                    I really have to go.

      She hurries off, leaving Scott ruminating on the jacket. But 
      then he turns, moving with focus, faster and faster--

      EXT. ROAD/HALE PROPERTY - DAY1111

      On his bike and pedaling at top speed, Scott charges down the 
      road. Finally, he whips onto a driveway leading to the 
      rundown Hale house.

                                  SCOTT
                    Derek!

      He lets his bike clatter to the ground, school bag with it. 
      In a flash he s on the porch, looking in each window. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Derek!

      Still no response. Scott slips around the side of the house 
      and to the back. Then something catches his attention--

      At the edge of the woods, he sees FRESH DIRT covering the 
      ground. As if something had been dug up. Or buried.

      But before he can approach, a sound stops him in his 
      tracks... A HEARTBEAT. At first it s a tiny rhythm in the 
      distance. But then it rapidly gets louder, stronger. Scott 
      starts to back away, moving for the front of the house again 
      and for his bike when--

      Derek steps out of the woods. No sudden appearance, no 
      theatrics. He just calmly walks out of the shadows.

      Scott tries to stand strong.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Stay away from her. She doesn t 
                    know anything.

                                  DEREK
                    What if she does?

      Derek keeps coming, backing Scott away from the house.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1120.

                    You think your little buddy Stiles 
                    can Google werewolves and now 
                    you ve got all the answers?

      Reaching down to Scott s school bag, Derek picks up the 
      LACROSSE STICK, playfully turning it over in his hands.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    You don t get it yet, but I m 
                    looking out for you. Think about 
                    what could happen. You re on the 
                    field. The aggression takes over. 
                    And you shift in front of everyone. 
                    Allison, your mother, your 
                      friends...

      Derek s hand comes up and the CLAWS are out. Scott flinches 
      back, both in fear and surprise at his display of mastery 
      over his abilities.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    And when they see you--

      He rakes his claws over the net.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                      Everything falls apart.

      The slashed threads flutter away from the head of the 
      lacrosse stick, the net now in tatters. Derek tosses the 
      ruined stick. Scott catches it. When he looks up--

      He s alone, Derek having vanished yet again.

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT1212

      Stiles bursts through Scott s door and into his room.

                                  STILES
                    What did you find? How did you find 
                    it? Where did you find it? And 
                    yeah, I ve had a lot of Adderall.

      At his desk, Scott works on something, concentrating on it 
      with exacting focus.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1121.

                    That s awesome. I mean that s

                    That s what I need you to help me

                    going to help me figure out how to 
                    play lacrosse without changing.

      Scott stands, revealing what he s been working on so 
      intently: his LACROSSE STICK. Now perfectly re-laced, he 
      spins it in his hands with a look of pride.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT1515

      The doors of BEACON HILLS HOSPITAL slide open. Stiles and 
      Scott casually walk past the front desk trying not to be 
      conspicuous in front of waiting patients, nurses and 
      orderlies. 

      Stiles nods to a set of double doors and a sign pointing to 
      MORGUE. Scott quickly pushes through the doors as Stiles 
      heads to a WAITING AREA.

      INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE FREEZER ROOM - NIGHT1616

      Scott steps inside the almost pitch black freezer room. He 
      lights the display on his phone using it to search the labels 
      on the drawer.

      He locates one marked: JANE DOE - partial. Police Evidence Do 
      Not Tamper.

      Scott takes a breath and yanks it open.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT1717

      Standing outside in the corridor, Stiles looks to the waiting 
      area and does a double take.

      Lydia Martin sits in one of the chairs. 

      It s a moment of opportunity he simply cannot pass up. 
      Leaving his post, he tentatively approaches her.

                                  STILES
                    Hey, Lydia. You probably don t 
                    remember me, but I sit behind you 
                    in Biology. And I know you re 
                    dating Jackson and all that, but I 
                    always thought we had a kind of 
                      connection. Unspoken, of course. 
                    But I sort of think it would be 
                    cool to get to know you. Sort of.

                                  LYDIA
                    Hold on. Give me a second.

      Stiles looks at her, quite confused. But then she pulls out a 
      BLUETOOTH headset that was covered by her hair.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    I didn t get any of what you just

                                  STILES
                    Uh... No. Sorry.

      As she gives an irritated sigh, Stiles takes a seat far away 
      from her, head falling into his hand.

      INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE FREEZER ROOM - NIGHT1818

      Scott covers his mouth while gazing down at the lower half of 
      the body. He slowly pulls the drawer open to where the sheet 
      finally flattens out just above the severed hip.

      Removing his hand from his mouth, Scott pulls the sheet up to 
      reveal the decayed and rotted feet. Then, unable to stand 
      anymore, the sight or the smell, Scott covers up the body and 
      slides the drawer shut.

      INT. HOSPITAL/WAITING AREA - NIGHT1919

      Jackson comes around the corner to find Lydia. He s massaging 
      his shoulder.

                                  LYDIA
                    Did he do it?

                          (nodding)
                    He said it s not a good habit to 
                    get into but one cortisone shot 
                    won t kill me.

                                  LYDIA
                    You should get one right before the 
                    game too.
                          (off his look)
                    What? The pros do it all the time. 
                    You want to be a little high school 
                    amateur?
                          (teasing him now)
                    Or do you want to go pro?

      She pulls him into a kiss that s all tongue. 

      As they walk off, Stiles watches with a jealous gaze from 
      behind the pages of a hospital pamphlet. It s titled: All 
      About Your Menstrual Cycle.

      Scott yanks it out of his hands, surprising him.

                    So he did bury the other half of

                                  STILES
                    Then I say we use it.

                    Tell me something first. Are you 
                    doing this because you want to stop 
                    Derek? Or because you want to play 
                    the game Saturday and he said you

      Derek s black Dodge Challenger roars out from the long 
      driveway leading to the dilapidated house. In its wake, 
      Stile s Jeep slowly pulls forward.

      EXT. HALE PROPERTY - NIGHT2222

      Now carrying a shovel and pick, Scott and Stiles head for the 
      house. But Scott pauses, glancing around.

                    Let s get this over with.

      Unnerved now as well, Stiles follows him around the house to 
      the edge of the woods. Waving him over, Scott kicks at the 
      dirt on the ground. It s loose, gravelly.

      They start digging. Piles of dirt landing on the grass 
      nearby. They work fast, Scott pulling up his sleeves as sweat 
      starts to drip down his forehead.

                    You run one way. I run the other.

                    I hate that plan.

      They dig faster, harder. Muscles burning, Scott keeps 
      throwing nervous glances to the driveway.

                    Stop, stop, stop!

      Dropping the shovel, Stiles clambers down into the hole. He 
      feels around and finds a dark FABRIC in the dirt. Both of 
      them now digging with their hands they finally uncover--                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1128.

      Both of them claw at the drawstring, almost frantically 
      trying to get the knot to come undone. And then finally it 
      loosens. The black bag flutters open to reveal the body 
      inside--

      Except it s not a dead girl. It s the body of a WOLF. Stiles 
      and Scott both HOLLER, jumping back.

                    I can see that. I thought you said 
                    you smelled blood? As in human

                    I told you something was different.

      Scott pulls back the edge of the bag to get a better look. 
      The remains of the wolf peer through, a tangle of legs and 
      blood-crusted fur.

      Stiles reaches for the shovel when he notices A PURPLE FLOWER 
      in the ground. It sticks out of the dirt as if it had only 
      recently been planted there.

      Stiles kneels next to the flower, gently feeling around the 
      stem. He pulls it up, revealing that the flower has sprouted 
      out of what appears to be a very thin but strong twine 
      interlaced from its stem and root.

      While Scott takes several cautious steps back, Stiles 
      continues unearthing the purple-flowered rope. Soil falling 
      around his shoes, he walks in circles around the grave.

      LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE - As Stiles continues, the Wolfsbane 
      rope leads back to the grave in an almost perfect spiral.

      Finally, at about ten yards out, Stiles reaches the end of 
      the rope. With a pile gathered into his arms, he turns to 
      Scott who is staring back at the grave.

      It s the upper half of the girl.

      Morning. The Hale property is now a crime scene. Handcuffed,

      on by Stiles s jeep.

      Scott quickly types a TEXT into his phone: Ok, go.

      Derek glances up from the backseat behind the cage as Stiles 
      slips into the front passenger side.

                    She was a werewolf. But she was a 
                    different kind, wasn t she?

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    She could turn herself into an

      THROUGH THE JEEP S WINDOWS - Scott on the other side. His 
      body a silhouette except for his EYES. Yellow and bright 
      through the dirty windows.

      Slowly, but purposefully, Scott moves left. Stiles takes a 
      step right, trying to keep the Jeep between them.

                                  STILES
                    Like an odd person or... dog-like 
                      individual... roaming the streets?

                    I m hanging up on you now.

                                  STILES
                    No, wait, wait--

      But the line dies. With a sigh of frustration, Stiles drops 
      the cell phone onto the passenger seat on top of--

      PRINTOUTS from his most recent werewolf research. One in 
      particular is a drawing of a ferocious werewolf, a beautiful 
      young woman fainting in its arms.

      EXT. ARGENT HOME/INT. ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT2828

      Through the open second-floor bedroom window, Allison can be 
      seen sitting down at her desk with an open box. She pulls out 
      a simple UNFRAMED PHOTO, looking at the words on the back:

      Philly Girls 4eva. We ll miss you!

      She turns the photo back around, smiling at the picture of 
      her with her friends from her last home. Then she slips it 
      into the corner of her mirror while never noticing--

      THE FIGURE perched in the tree just a few feet from her 
      window... Scott, still a werewolf.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1137.

      CONTINUED:2828

      In the shadows under the setting sun, his breathing becomes 
      more hollow and ragged as Allison comes to the window.

      Scott moves forward, creeping out of the darkness as if in 
      another second he could leap into her room and--

      Allison pulls the window shut, the glass revealing a sudden 
      REFLECTION to Scott.

      Himself. The face of a monster staring back at him. 

      Scott retreats back into the shadows, frightened by his own 
      appearance. He jumps down from his perch on the tree, darting 
      away from the house and into the street just as--

      HEADLIGHTS appear. A car SCREECHES to a halt. Scott SLAMS 
      into the hood, rolling over it and toppling to the pavement. 
      Argent hops out of the driver s side.

                                  ARGENT
                    Oh my God...

      He has his phone out, already dialing 9-1-1 as he crouches 
      over Scott. But the boy s hand comes up, gripping the man s 
      arm. When Argent looks down at him, he's back to normal.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m okay.

                                    ALLISON (O.S.)
                    Dad? What the hell are you doing?

      Allison comes rushing out the front door to Scott.

                                  ARGENT
                    He came out of nowhere--

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you trying to kill him?

      Scott glances up at the ironic question.

                                  ARGENT
                    Of course not. He ran out into the 
                    street--

                                  SCOTT
                    I m sorry. It s my fault.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1138.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you okay?

      She kneels over him, tenderly brushing dirt from the road off 
      his brow. Argent looks on, a different kind of concern on his 
      face now as Scott and Allison gaze into each other s eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m fine. I swear.
                          (to Argent)
                    I m sorry I hit your car. I was 
                    just coming to say hi.

      Allison helps him to his feet.

                                  ARGENT
                    You re sure you re okay?

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah, completely. I should go. I ve 
                    got a lacrosse game to get to. 
                    You re still coming? Right?

                                    ALLISON
                    Of course, I m coming.

      Her hands linger on him as Argent peers in between them.

                                  ARGENT
                    We both are.

      Scott and Allison turn to him, each with a look of surprise. 
      This is news to both of them. And neither seems to like it.

      INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT3030

      Pulling his locker open, Scott notices Jackson whispering to 
      another player. He tries to use his hearing to listen in...

      But the SLAMMING of lockers masks Jackson's VOICE and instead 
      causes Scott to wince in pain. As the sound subsides into a 
      slightly unbearable RING--

      The player gives a nod and then heads out while Jackson moves 
      to whisper in the ear of another team member.

      Stiles wanders into the locker room, pulling his own uniform 
      over his pads. He notices Scott on the bench. Then takes a 
      breath and approaches.

                                  SCOTT
                    You going to try to convince me not

                    Allison s not going anywhere. And 
                    it s one game which you don t have 
                    to play--

                                  SCOTT
                    I want to play. I want to be on the 
                    team, I want to go out with 
                    Allison. I want a semi-freaking 
                    normal life. Do you get that?

      Stiles goes quiet. Then gives an understanding nod.

                                  STILES
                    I get it.

      Scott grabs his gear, Stiles following him out.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Just try not to worry too much 
                    while you re out there, all right?

                    Or that you might kill someone. If 
                    a hunter doesn't kill you first.

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT3131

      Scott walks out onto the field, Stiles following. With an 
      anxious breath, he turns to--

      THE BLEACHERS - where Melissa McCall stands up waving. She 
      made it. Then Allison and her father, Mr. Argent, appear, 
      walking up to find a good seat.

                                  SCOTT
                    Oh God...

      And then Lydia walks down the bleachers past her.

                    Scott.

      She snakes two fingers into his chest plate and pulls him 
      very, very close.

      Scott nods and turns back to the field with a heavy sigh. 
      Coach passes by him on the way to Jackson.

                                  COACH
                    How s the shoulder?

                    If I took a ball-peen hammer... 
                    Forget that. I don t know where I

                    That s my boy.

      The WHISTLE BLOWS sending Jackson, Scott and the team 
      charging off the bench and on to the field. 

      Stiles remains with the other bench warmers, nervously 
      chewing the fingers of his gloves.

      ON THE LACROSSE FIELD - Scott walks out to take his position. 
      He pulls his helmet down and briefly closes his eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                          (a whispered prayer)
                    Please, let this go okay.

      Glaring at him from underneath his own helmet, Jackson walks 
      confidently on to the field. Then turns his back to Scott.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1144.

                    Action? Definite possibility.

      ON THE FIELD - Jackson moves to face the opposing team member 
      at the draw. The Ref places the ball on the grass. Sound 
      drops out around Scott. Just his uneasy breath and his always 
      POUNDING HEART.

                                  SCOTT
                    Please... please...

      The Ref slowly brings the whistle to his lips. Jackson 
      tightens his grip on his stick, teeth clenched down on his 
      mouth guard as--

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS.

      Jackson scoops up the ball before the opposing player even 
      has a chance to blink. 

      Scott moves fast, darting around the others, getting open for 
      a pass as quickly as he can but--

      Jackson tosses the ball to another teammate. 

      SLAP CHECKS come down hard on Beacon Hills and the ball rolls 
      across the grass, loose for anyone to grab.

      Scott hurries forward to take it, but Jackson is there first. 
      It s almost like he s stealing the ball from Scott.

      Whipping his stick around, Jackson hurls a shot toward the 
      opposing goal. The ball hits the net.

      The crowd on the bleachers CHEERS, shouts for Jackson 
      erupting among them.

                    This is not going to be good.

      THE WHISTLE BLOWS AGAIN - But as fast as Scott moves, the 
      ball never seems to find its way into his pocket. He keeps 
      trying, one play after another.

      FROM THE BLEACHERS - The disappointment on Melissa McCall s 
      face comes like a punctuation mark to every missed pass, 
      every missed opportunity.

      But then as Scott adjusts his helmet, he hears something, 
      VOICES coming into his head. Jackson talks to DANNY, the 
      goalie.

                                    JACKSON

                    But what if he s open?

      Scott holds still, head cocked while finally hearing what 
      Jackson has been whispering to the other players.

                                    JACKSON
                    Who s the captain, Danny? You or

      Jackson raps him on the helmet and gets moving to his 
      position right past--

      Scott. Standing with his gloves twisting around the stick, he 
      looks like he s about to snap it into little pieces.

      When the WHISTLE BLOWS again, he looks up and through his

      His eyes turning yellow.

      At the start of the next quarter, the Ref comes walking past 
      the players with the ball but pauses when A STRANGE NOISE 
      comes from behind him.

      Scott McCall stands hunched-over, face masked in shadow under 
      his helmet.

                                  REF
                    You okay, kid?

      Scott nods very slowly, not seeing that Jackson is also 
      looking back as the Opposing Player approaches for the draw.

                                  REF (CONT D)
                    Set!

      Both teams prepare for the draw. But strange NOISES can now 
      be heard on the field. Low growling. Animalistic gasps. 
      Scott s body seems to rise with each breath, as if he s about 
      to launch off the ground to attack.

      Unnerved, the other players take tentative steps back.

      Lydia pulls up the sign again and flips it over.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Allison? Little help here?

      She reluctantly helps Lydia hold up the sign. The backside 
      reads: JACKSON IS #1!!

      Head turned to the stands, Scott sees it. And that does it. 
      He breathes a furious SNARL between his teeth as--A CRACK 
      snakes its way up the side of his helmet.

                                    JACKSON
                    What the hell we waiting for?

      The Ref blows the WHISTLE. The sound tears across the field, 
      going off like a FIRE ALARM in Scott s head.

      Jackson and the Opposing Player grapple for the BALL, sending 
      it flying up into the air where--

      Scott leaps up, snatching it with uncanny precision. The 
      crowd issues a WHOA in response as he lands and charges back 
      down the field right past--

      Jackson, whose uniform billows up in Scott s wake.

      With a sudden WOOSH, the ball goes flying. Right past the 
      goalie and into the net.

      ON THE BLEACHERS - both Melissa and Allison jump up, 
      HOLLERING. Lydia is knocked in the shoulder. Only mildly, but 
      her look is one of pure annoyance.

      ON THE SIDELINES - Stiles follows Coach, clutching one of his 
      gloves in his hand, chewing the index finger.

      A furious Jackson turns to his teammates. One of them shrugs, 
      pointing to the scoreboard. Beacon is down by one now, a mere 
      minute left on the clock.

                                  REF
                    Set!

      SCOTT S POV - shaky, wavering. Like that of a killer. The 
      other team takes a few frightened steps back as if sensing 
      they're on the field with something very, very dangerous.

      The WHISTLE BLOWS and Scott's off again.

      He moves for the ball but it s captured by the other team. 
      Scott goes for a slap check. The opposing player is so 
      freaked out he just tosses the ball to Scott.

                                  COACH
                    Did the opposing team just 
                      deliberately pass the ball to us?

                                  STILES
                    I believe so, Coach.

                                  COACH
                      Interesting. Helpful, but 
                      interesting.

      Charging past the other players like a lightning bolt, Scott 
      FIRES ON THE NET. The Goalie twists, lacrosse stick coming up 
      to make the catch. But--

      THE BALL TEARS RIGHT THROUGH THE POCKET OF HIS STICK.

      Fans in the bleachers CHEER as the ball hits the net. The 
      Goalie lowers his stick to see the busted pocket.

      Scott backs away as both Coaches surround the REF, shouting 
      and arguing with TWENTY SECONDS left on the clock.

                                  REF
                    Goal!

      The Beacon Hills crowd cheers, the game now tied. While the 
      opposing team changes up goalie sticks, Jackson looks back to 
      Scott who keeps his head down.

      CLOSE ON - Scott breathing hard, mouth full of fangs, eyes 
      yellow. Trying desperately not to let anyone see him.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1150.

                    Set!

      Jackson reluctantly takes his position for the draw.

                                  OPPOSING PLAYER
                    What the hell s up with your 
                    teammate, dude? What s he on?

                                    JACKSON
                    I don t know. Yet.

      THE WHISTLE blows and both Jackson and the Opposing Player go 
      for the ball which tumbles out of their grasp. Jackson SLAPS 
      down trying to grab it.

      The ball spins into the air as--

      Scott WHIPS past, grabbing it right in the middle of its 
      flight again. He charges for the goal and something happens--

      His eyes BURN brighter, yellow tint turning to a YELLOW GLOW, 
      the pure animal taking over. With the other players closing 
      in on him, he falters, as if not knowing where to go.

                                  STILES
                    Scott, no...

      And for a moment it s almost as if Scott is no longer 
      charging at the goal, but charging toward the closest player, 
      charging toward prey. 

      Until out of the chaos of sound, one VOICE comes through--

                                    ALLISON
                    Come on, Scott. You can do it.

      He blinks, the glow in his eyes simmering back down, 
      Allison s voice pulling him from the brink of animal fury.

      Then, as the opposing team advances, Scott shoots on the 
      goal. And despite the Goalie s desperate dive--

      THE BALL HITS THE NET.

      CHEERING THUNDERS around him. Breathing hard, Scott takes a 
      few steps back.                         TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1151.

      Everyone is coming toward him, people jumping off the bench 
      to congratulate him. His mother, Allison and Lydia stepping 
      down as well. And worst of all... Argent. 

      Retreating back, Scott yanks one of his gloves off to reveal 
      the CLAWS at the tips of his fingers.

                                  SCOTT
                    No, no...

      Allison hurries onto the field. All she can see is a swarm of 
      lacrosse players in the same uniform. They each pull their 
      helmets off but none of them is Scott.

      Stiles collapses onto the bench, still a nervous wreck. 
      Behind him, his Dad gets off his cell phone. Stiles notices.

      INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT3333

      Scott slams through the door of the locker room. He comes to 
      the MIRROR, pulling the helmet off to look at his face.

      He s still a werewolf. Still a monster.

      Crying out in frustration, he sends a clawed fist into the 
      mirror, SHATTERING IT. Millions of fragments rain down below 
      him, reflections of his face fracturing into pieces.

      As one shard of mirrored glass wobbles to a standstill on the 
      floor, the locker room door swings open again.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      She steps in, but pauses when SCOTT S LACROSSE HELMET rolls 
      eerily to a stop in front of her on the floor. 

      She approaches. Turns the corner. But stops again at the 
      sound of GLASS CRUNCHING beneath her shoes. She glances 
      around at the shards.

      Then, just as she looks up, a SHADOW slips across the floor. 
      She doesn t notice it. Or THE DARK SHAPE above her on the top 
      of the lockers moving stealthily back.                        TEEN WOLF EP#102   SALMON DRAFT3/7/1152.

                    Scott, are you here?

      She steps around a corner to face an empty aisle of lockers. 
      Retreating back, she stops when she hears an odd SHUFFLING. 

      Pressing her back to one of the lockers, she s now clearly 
      frightened. She swallows visibly and--

      Reaching up with her fingers she touches the steel lockers 
      and slowly steps around to find--

      Scott. But his back is to her and she can t see his face.

                    Hey. Are you okay? Scott?

      He doesn t move. Just the rise and fall of his torso as he 
      draws deep breaths. Allison keeps approaching, reaching a 
      hand up and out when--

      He turns around. And is back to normal.

                    kind of nervous.

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe you do.

      And then he does. By kissing her. Stepping toward her, he 
      presses his lips softly against hers. Surprised, she holds 
      still at first. But then moves into him, kissing him back. 
      And for a brief second, Scott's life is utterly and totally 
      perfect.

      Until Stiles rushes in to find him. He skids to a halt, 
      though, when he sees them together. 

      But while hanging back, he can t help but watch as Scott and 
      Allison pull away from the kiss, smiling at each other with 
      the kind of sweetness known to first love.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    I need to get back to my Dad.

      Scott nods. And with that perfect smile she steps away.

      of his lacrosse gloves.

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT3434

      Alone on the field, and still fuming, Jackson s eyes focus on 
      something left in the grass...

      Scott s LACROSSE GLOVE.

      Slowly, he picks it up, noticing odd tears at the fingertips. 
      They re perforations. Like holes were poked through with 
      something sharp and jagged.

      Jackson turns to find someone watching him from the 
        sidelines...

      Derek.

      With a strange smile, he gives the mystified boy a nod as if 
      to say hello. And then Derek turns, walking away from the 
      field, striding right into camera--

      INTO BLACK.
