The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty
Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At
the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The
girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting
in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs,
motions for her to go inside.
Trees ring the edge of a field.
CUT TO:
Buildings lit against the night sky.
Truman sits with his coffee, reading the New York Times. An
article catches his eye. He sits up straight, folds the paper
over, reads it.
A train barrels toward us, its headlight bright. The train
roars past, away from the city.
TRAVELING SHOTS of harvested FIELDS, grazing LIVESTOCK,
solitary FARMHOUSES.
The TRAIN chugs across the Kansas flatlands.
SHOTS of SIGNS outside Garden City: "World's Largest Free
Swimpool" and "Howdy, Stranger! Welcome to Garden City. A
Friendly Place. "
Truman and Nelle rent a car. People stare.
I/E. RENTAL CAR - DAY
Nelle drives past the main square, Truman in the passenger
seat. Truman looks at a photo in THE GARDEN CITY TELEGRAM.
TRUMAN
Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of
Investigation. KBI.
Truman and Nelle trot up the COURTHOUSE STEPS.
Nelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which
fronts the CLUTTER FARM. We recognize the FARMHOUSE as the
one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead. A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
(20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway.
CRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman
and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the
driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse.
FADE OUT.
A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many
are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some
look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth.
TRUMAN
Hello.
Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up
to a group of THREE GIRLS.
NELLE
Morning.
GIRL #1
Hi.
NELLE
Can any of you tell me where I'd
find Laura Kinney?
GIRL #1
Oh, um...
The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY
(who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall,
17).
NELLE
(gently)
Is that her? With the tall boy?
GIRL #2
Yeah. With Danny Burke.
NELLE
Danny Burke?
(Girl #2 nods)
Thank you.
As Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend:
GIRL #2
Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.
Nelle sees Truman on his way toward Laura, calls out --
NELLE
Truman. Truman --
Truman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura
backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman,
looks at him for several moments.
NELLE
These folks live their lives in a
particular way. You need to consider
adapting yourself to that fact.
TRUMAN
What --
NELLE
-- I'm gonna find out where those
two kids live. Maybe you'll let me
do that alone?
Nelle leaves. On Truman, as the bell rings and the mass of
teenagers starts to enter the school.
CUT TO:
Truman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home. He removes
his hat, slips past the few people standing outside.
A SHOPKEEPER sweeps the sidewalk. There are THANKSGIVING
DECORATIONS in his shop window.
A SCHOOL BUS picks up a SMALL BOY at the intersection of a
DIRT ROAD and the paved COUNTY ROAD.
A SMALL BRIDGE over the Arkansas river. Below them, men are
sifting the riverbed with nets, moving slowly downstream.
CUT TO:
Danny Burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his
shoulder. Nelle approaches him, Truman keeps his distance.
NELLE
Danny?
(Danny stops)
Would you mind terribly if I walked
with you for a bit?
He shrugs. They walk together.
CUT TO:
Laura opens door to Truman and Nelle.
Nelle and Truman walk quickly back to the hotel. Nelle has
the diary open.
NELLE
"Danny here tonight and we watched
TV. So nice just having him sit with
us. Left at eleven. P.S. -- He's the
only one I really love."
She turns the page. The rest of the book is blank.
NELLE
And that was that.
TRUMAN
The end of a life.
CUT TO:
Ding Dong. We see the FRONT DOOR open. Reveal MARIE DEWEY --
pretty, 35, dressed primly -- and her two boys: ALVIN JR.
(9), and PAUL (6), lurking behind, curious. Marie smiles.
MARIE
You came.
Reverse onto Nelle... and Truman, dressed in a DARK SUIT,
hair neatly combed, like an Exeter schoolboy attending a
funeral. Nelle smiles.
NELLE
Hi.
Nelle nudges Truman, who hands over his gifts: a BOTTLE OF
J&B;, and a PACKAGE of GOURMET SPICED NUTS.
TRUMAN
(soberly)
Thank you for having us.
MARIE
(mock serious)
Thank you.
(then:)
Get yourselves in here.
(turns and walks into
the house)
Alvin! Get your pants on. They're
here.
On Nelle and Truman, surprised.
Truman and Nelle are leaving. Alvin and Marie stand in the
front door. Nelle kisses Marie.
NELLE
Thank you.
MARIE
So many of my friends would love to
meet you.
NELLE
That'd be fine --
TRUMAN
(to Dewey)
You don't have to worry. I'm not
going to write about this until
everything's over.
DEWEY
I'm not worried. I know what room
you're in at the hotel. And I know
where you live in Brooklyn.
Truman smiles.
CUT TO:
MUSIC: "Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas..." Main
Street, CHRISTMAS LIGHTS in the TREES.
The HARDWARE STORE, with Santa Claus DECORATIONS in the window
and a "ONE WEEK LEFT TO BUY YOUR GIFTS..." sign.
CUT TO:
Truman and Nelle walk with PETE HOLT (70, very frail) on the
Clutter property. Apples rot on the ground, the trees are
bare, signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house.
HOLT
(re the apples)
I'd of picked them up but I haven't
been myself. Mind you, I make the
walk out here every day, check the
house, make sure the pipes don't
freeze -- that sort of item. The
least I can do for Mr. Clutter.
NELLE
How long have you worked here?
HOLT
1940 -- a lotta years. The wife too,
cleaning the house. Cooking.
NELLE
Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was
wonderful.
HOLT
(ignoring this)
She had a hard job after what all
happened. Cleaning. I burned most of
the rest -- mattresses -- too far of
a mess.
(then, looks at them)
I've asked around some -- if anyone's
looking for a strong hand.
They don't know what to say. Finally, he looks away.
HOLT
I don't think they'll be able to
sell the place till they catch the
ones that did it.
(beat)
That's what I hear anyhow.
Silence as the three of them look out over the barren fields.
Through the front window we see a Christmas tree in the lobby.
Tasteful Christmas lights strung on the BUSHES. A WREATH on
the FRONT DOOR.
OVER BLACK SCREEN we hear the voice of a RADIO ANNOUNCER.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
...This is KERG radio, Garden City.
A friendly broadcast from a friendly
place. Our lead story:
Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.
FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front
seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people.
Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the
headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob."
The CAR RADIO is on.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
...newsmen from six states have joined
scores of Kansans as they await the
arrival of confessed killers Perry
Smith and Richard Hickock. KBI
officers have been driving the Clutter
family's brutal killers nonstop
from...
Truman moves from the car into the large crowd. Old ladies;
ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists
INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom
of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as
we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a
MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in
an overcoat CRYING silently.
Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together
at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the
photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --
NELLE
Hey.
We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A
CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to
the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the
lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens
the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers
get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and
lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.
Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence.
They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG,
ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American
Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As
he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as
if they are arthritic. Truman stares.
MARIE
(whispers to Truman)
Motorcycle accident. He broke them
and they never healed right.
(Truman looks at her)
Alvin told me.
Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of
the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd.
His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look
at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the
steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.
FADE OUT:
MORNING
FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and
a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says "SHERIFF'S
RESIDENCE - PRIVATE". Dorothy Sanderson opens the door.
DOROTHY
Truman Capote.
TRUMAN
Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd
be left alone this morning by that
hard-working husband of yours.
(holds up bag)
So I have breakfast.
(holds up paper)
I have news.
(book)
And I have literature. My friend
Jack mailed me the book you wanted.
He presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the
inscription inside.
DOROTHY
"For the maiden of the Midwest, the
priestess of the plains, the queen
of the kitchen: my first novel.
Truman."
It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of
it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily
on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS.
DOROTHY
You're too much. Go on into the living
room, lemme grab that -- it's been
ringing all morning.
Truman knocks. He holds a PIE. Dorothy answers.
DOROTHY
Mr. Capote.
TRUMAN
(offers pie)
Madame Sanderson.
DOROTHY
Is that for the two of us to share?
Or for me to eat alone while you
talk to our guest?
Truman is caught. He smiles.
Jack and Truman walk.
TRUMAN
Perry's decided to appeal. He claims
their attorney was incompetent --
that he never raised the issue of
temporary insanity.
JACK
So you find them a new lawyer.
TRUMAN
They're facing execution in six weeks,
Jack. They need someone to argue
whether or not that's right.
JACK
Okay.
TRUMAN
I'd also like to see them alive,
yes, thank you very much. I need to
hear their story.
They walk in silence for a few moments.
TRUMAN
If you met him you'd understand.
It's as if no-one's ever asked him a
single question about himself. He's
so... damaged -- and strange --
unexplored...
(then)
I don't trust this Hickock fellow.
Perry's the only person who can
describe to me what happened that
night. I need to hear him say it.
JACK
Just be careful what you do to get
what you want.
TRUMAN
I'm finding them a lawyer.
JACK
Truman. You're finding yourself a
lawyer.
CUT TO:
A turreted, Civil War-era fortress an hour's drive from Kansas
City. Truman pulls up to the GUARDHOUSE.
Truman drives through the KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY gate,
waves to the Guard.
Truman walks quickly to his car, holding Perry's DRAWING and
NOTEBOOKS. At the car, he looks back at the dark jailhouse.
CUT TO:
Truman on the street outside the club at a PAY PHONE. He
talks with Jack in Brooklyn.
TRUMAN
I'm just missing this one piece,
Jack. Be patient with me.
JACK
How long is that gonna take? Why
don't you try leaving him alone for
a while? Come to Spain. You can always
visit him later.
TRUMAN
I don't know.
JACK
Well, I'm off. I've got my own writing
to do.
TRUMAN
Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.
JACK
Too many people around.
(beat)
I'll leave the address on the kitchen
table. Truman, what do you do there
when you're not with him? -- It must
be awful.
Truman's watching a YOUNG GUY standing outside the bar,
looking at him.
JACK
Think about what I said. Join me
when you can.
TRUMAN
I will. I will. Bye.
Truman follows the YOUNG GUY into the bar.
A young drifter stands alone on an empty street corner. He
checks a pay phone for a coin. It's empty.
CUT TO:
FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls. Ocean, sand,
cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach.
The house Jack rented. Jack types on the upstairs deck. Truman
pulls up in an OLD TAXI. Jack looks out over the railing to
the street. Jack emerges on the FRONT PORCH as Truman walks
up the path with his bags. They look at each other. Then
Truman looks around at the incredible garden, the ocean in
the background, and starts to LAUGH.
FADE OUT.
Title up:
"January, 1962"
Sound of a MANUAL TYPEWRITER over black.
FADE IN on the peaceful outside of the house. Sound of TYPING.
Truman, Jack and Nelle. A BONFIRE, a wind-up Victrola playing
Ella Fitzgerald, bottles of wine. Jack and Nelle dance. Truman
toasts Jack drunkenly.
TRUMAN
My man, my hero, my talented... My
man...
JACK
You said that.
TRUMAN
You are the hardest worker, the most
unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes
by on her way to London to sell her
book which needs no selling, may a
little of her success rub off on
both of us.
Jack laughs.
JACK
Here, here!
Nelle tries to smack Truman but can't catch him. The song
changes to a slow one. Jack and Truman dance sweetly together.
Nelle sits on the sand and watches.
CUT TO:
Breakfast. Truman and Nelle are sitting -- Nelle has a small
envelope in her hand. Truman is obviously uncomfortable. As
Jack delivers a platter of omelettes to the table:
NELLE
(to Truman)
When was the last time you wrote
back to him?
TRUMAN
I don't know.
JACK
What's this?
NELLE
A letter for your boyfriend I was
asked to deliver.
TRUMAN
From Perry.
JACK
Let's have it.
Jack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads:
NELLE
"Dear Friend Truman. Where are you?
Read this item in a medical
dictionary: "Death by hanging is
caused by asphyxia, by fracture of
the cervical vertebrae, by laceration
of the trachea." Not too comforting
as we lost our appeal. Missing you --
alone and desirous of your presence.
Your amigo, Perry."
Pause.
TRUMAN
Mr. Shawn told me about the court
decision yesterday.
JACK
I was wondering why you were in such
a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's
not because I finished my little
book.
TRUMAN
That's a terrible thing to say.
Jack looks out at the ocean.
TRUMAN
(to no one in
particular)
I used to write him all the time.
I've been so focused lately on the
book.
CUT TO:
Truman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a
waiting TAXI.
TRUMAN
Jack says I'm using Perry, but he
also thinks I fell in love with him
when I was in Kansas. How both of
those things can be true is beyond
me.
NELLE
Did you? Fall in love with him.
Silence as they load the bags into the trunk.
NELLE
Truman? --
TRUMAN
I don't know how to answer that...
It's as if Perry and I started life
in the same house. One day he stood
up and walked out the back door while
I walked out the front. With some
different choices, he's the man I
might have become.
NELLE
Are you kidding me?
Truman shrugs, doesn't answer. Nelle kisses him.
NELLE
Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think
he's what I like about you best.
TRUMAN
(smiles)
I'll see you at the reading in New
York.
NELLE
The sixteenth.
Nelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window.
NELLE
Truman. Honestly. Are you going back
to Kansas because you care about
Perry or because you need information
before he's killed?
TRUMAN
Can't it be both?
NELLE
No. I don't think it can be.
She drives away. Truman watches her go. He turns back up
toward the house, stops a moment to pick a FLOWER from the
bushes at the front gate.
CUT TO:
A FRONT-LOADER TRACTOR drives into the warehouse. A PRISON
POLICE CAR parks outside the warehouse. Guards get the
enormous Lowell Lee Andrews, shackled, from the back seat,
walk him inside.
We see the outside wall with Perry and Dick's faces peering
out through their tiny windows.
The TRACTOR emerges through the warehouse doors. It carries
in its FRONT SHOVEL the enormous, dead BODY of ANDREWS covered
by a BLACK CLOTH.
The TRACTOR rolls the body into the BED of a waiting PICK-UP
TRUCK.
Perry watches through his window.
Truman is hung over but immensely gratified. He's with Shawn.
SHAWN
Everyone was there.
TRUMAN
Tennessee loved it.
SHAWN
Of course he did.
TRUMAN
Should we do more? I was terrified,
but --
SHAWN
No, Now we get to withhold while
everyone else talks. Let them do the
work.
Truman is barely able to suppress his excitement.
SHAWN
This book is going to change
everything. It'll change how people
see you as a writer. It'll change
how people write. You'll finish by
October?
TRUMAN
I think so. You know they're scheduled
for next month?
SHAWN
Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many
issues as it takes to publish. Three.
As many as it takes.
TRUMAN
I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll
get Perry to talk --
SHAWN
Honestly, what's he got to lose?
Truman smiles at the joke, then stops himself.
TRUMAN
It really is too awful.
Institutionalized sadism.
Shawn nods.
SHAWN
You'll be able to finish now.
TRUMAN
As strange as it may sound to you,
I'm going to miss him.
FADE OUT.
Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then
passing.
Truman slows for a moment as he passes Hickock's cell.
TRUMAN
Hello handsome.
Hickock just stares at him. Truman, unnerved, moves on to
Perry's cell.
Truman walks with his TRAVEL BAG on his shoulder. He takes
out his KEYS and turns up the steps to his house.
Truman, obviously drunk, preens and poses on the red carpet
for the CAMERAS. Jack watches from the side.
CUT TO:
FADE UP on a PAPER BOY riding his BIKE down the street. New
buds are on the trees. It is SPRING. The BOY wears a NEW
YORK TIMES bag slung over his chest and is tossing copies of
the paper. One of them lands on Truman and Jack's stoop.
A PLANE takes off.
OUTSIDE LIGHTS switch on as it gets dark.
TAXICAB pulls up to the prison gates. Perry's VOICE:
PERRY (V.O.)
I have become extremely affectionate
toward you both. But, harness time.
Adios amigos. Your friend, Perry."
