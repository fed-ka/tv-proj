Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly
nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow
grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First
Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down
17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth
jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a
wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early
childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,
through an open window to the library, we see her mother
and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.
MRS BENNET
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?
We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear
her parents' conversation.
MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
Do you not want to know who has taken it?
MR BENNET
As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have
any choice in the matter...
2.
Jane rides through the countryside, A distant rumble of
thunder. She looks up...
An open book. Plop plop! Raindrops fall on it. Drawing
back, we see Lizzie walking through a field, reading. She
looks up to the sky...

Mrs Bennet stands at the kitchen door. A boy is
delivering meat. It starts to rain. She puts out her
hand, to check.
MRS BENNET
(smiles, satisfied)
Ah, good...
The housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who is with her, looks bemused
at her mistress's reaction.
A louder rumble of thunder. A washerwoman hastily pulls
clothes from a line...it's bucketing down heavily now...
In the local.village people run for cover; shopkeepers
cover up their wares...
Mr and Mrs Bennet look out at the pouring rain.
MRS BENNET
Excellent. Now she will have to stay the
night. Exactly as I predicted.
MR BENNET
Good grief, woman. Your skills in the art
of match-making are without question.
ELIZABETH
Though I don't think, mama, you can
reasonably take credit for making it
rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her
death before she gets there.
Elizabeth strides across vast muddy fields, slipping as
she goes. Netherfield is in view on the horizon. She
stops to take it in, then carries on down an even more
muddy track.
Mr Bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the
hedge. Mrs Bennet bustles up. She looks very pleased with
herself.
MRS BENNET
Well, my dear, its all going according
to plan. He's half in love with her
already!
MR BENNET
(a touch disingenuously)
Who, my sweetest?
MRS BENNET
Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she
hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the
two of them.
Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia
are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed
up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face
lights up.
 MRS BENNET
Wait for me!
20.
And she's gone. Mr Bennet gazes at their departing
 figures.
Mrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street
into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a
regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese
scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two
Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs
Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them.
Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the
soldiers stands on it. She is appalled.
Darcy gallops through the countryside.
Darcy, exhausted, rides into the stable yard. In the
corner is a trough and pump. He strides up to the pump,
puts his head under it and douses himself with cold
water.

24.
From a window Elizabeth looks out at Darcy.
Darcy looks up and for a second catches Elizabeth looking
down at him. She turns from the window. Jane is waking
up.
ELIZABETH
Jane, do you think you might feel well
enough to leave today?
The Bennet's carriage awaits. The Bingley's are gathered
to see the Bennet's off. Jane is radiant - in the peak of
health.
JANE
(to the Bingley's)
Really, I don't know how to thank you.
Bingley beams bashfully. He can't take his eyes off her.
BINGLEY
Really, you're welcome anytime you feel
the least bit poorly.
ELIZABETH
(TO CAROLINE)
Thank you for such stimulating company.
It has been most instructive.
CAROLINE BINGLEY
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.
Elizabeth looks at Darcy, who does not say anything. She
gets in the carriage.
ELIZABETH
Mr Darcy.
DARCY
Miss Bennet.
They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the
Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley
waves enthusiastically to Jane.
BINGLEY
Goodbye. Goodbye.
The Bennet's carriage is stopped in its tracks by the
Militia who are marching en masse through town.
27.
Elizabeth and Jane are walking towards the house when,
across the moat, they see Mr Collins come out of the
house and advance towards them.
ELIZABETH
Oh no!
Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the
garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them.
ELIZABETH
Quick! This way!
She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat,
through the house and out the front.
Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house.
The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around,
puzzled.
 Elizabeth and Jane arrive in the village. Jane, forever
the dutiful daughter, looks uneasy- Elizabeth is flushed
and reckless. She looks behind them-
32.
ELIZABETH
(LAUGHS)

We've lost him.
They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the
milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are
chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted
earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled
hair. The perfect romantic hero.
ELIZABETH
Kitty? Lydia!
She and Jane join them.
LYDIA
We just happened to be looking for some
ribbon, didn't we, Kitty?
(KITTY NODS)
And we met Mr Wickham.
KITTY
He picked up Lydia's gloves!
LYDIA
He's a lieutenant!
Wickham bows.
WICKHAM
I'm enchanted. Shall we all look at some
ribbons together?
LYDIA
Oh yes!
The girls emerge from the shop with Wickham.
ELIZABETH
You're too generous.
WICKHAM
I know. Fivepence halfpenny!
ELIZABETH
It all adds up.
 LYDIA
I'll pay him back.
34.
WICKHAM
Oh yes. I'll make sure of that.

They laugh. Elizabeth is really rather taken with him.
They walk down the street.
ELIZABETH
Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr
Wickham?
WICKHAM
That depends on what the French have in
mind. Of course I look forward to
action...
(smiles at her)
But on the other hand
JANE
Lizzie - look!
They stop. Jane's face lights up.
JANE
Mr Bingley !
It is indeed Bingley, riding towards them. He is
accompanied by Darcy.
 Bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to Jane. His
open, friendly face is filled with delight.
BINGLEY
I was on my way to your house.
LYDIA -
Please Mr Bingley, when are you going to
give a ball?
JANE
Lydia!
BINGLEY
I was just waiting until your sister was
quite well.-
LYDIA
She is!
Elizabeth pays no attention to the following
conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in
turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously
recognize each other and look very uncomfortable.
KITTY
- when, then?
35.
MR BINGLEY

As soon as they have made the white soup.
LYDIA
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
Darcy turns and rides off without a word.
JANE
Lydia, you can't just say that -
MR BINGLEY
Will you excuse me ladies? Mr Wickham.
Enjoy the day.
Elizabeth looks at Wickham, puzzled.
Elizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses
someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has
followed her as she had hoped.
38.
ELIZABETH
 I hope your plans in favor of Meryton
will not be affected by your difficult
relations with the gentleman we were just
speaking of.
WICKHAM
Oh no - it is not for me to be driven
away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he
must go not I.
Pause.
ELIZABETH
I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the
manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?
WICKHAM
Do you really want to hear?
Lizzie nods.
WICKHAM
He ruined me.
She stares at him.
ELIZABETH
How so?
WICKHAM
My father managed his estate. We grew up
together, Darcy and I. His father treated
me like a second son. Oh he was the
kindest of men and bequeathed me the best
living in his gift, for I had my heart
set on joining the church. But when he
died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave
the living to another man.
LIZZIE
Why did he do that?
WICKHAM
Out of jealousy, for his father loved me
more than he loved him.
LIZZIE
How cruel! Are you sure?
WICKHAM
(NODS)
And out of pride, for he considered me
too lowly to be worth his consideration.

Pause. Lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy.
39.
Bingley, Caroline and Darcy sit grimly in a carriage
which drives off.
Jane is in a carriage. Mrs Bennet kisses her goodbye
through the window as all the Bennets look on.
MRS BENNET
Give my love to my sister. And try not to
be so much of a burden, dear.
Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet
talks to Elizabeth.
MR BENNET
Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then. It gives
her something to think of, and a sort of
distinction among her companions.
ELIZABETH
(DRYLY)
I'm sure that will cheer her up,Papa.
MR BENNET
It's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've
turned down Mr Collins you're free to go
off and be jilted yourself. What about Mr
Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and
would do the job credibly.
ELIZABETH
Thank you, but a less agreeable man would
satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's
good fortune.
MR KENNET
Still, it's a comfort to know that
whatever might befall you, you have an
affectionate mother who will be sure to
make the most of it.
A small smile from Elizabeth.
0
The militia are leaving Meryton. Hundreds of soldiers and
officers in the red coats marching out of the village to
the sound of pipes and drums. The villagers are out to
bid them farewell. Lydia and Kitty run through the crowds
very distraught. They find Elizabeth coming in the other
direction.
LYDIA
It's too dreadful! They're leaving for
Brighton.
ELIZABETH
All of them?
KITTY
They got the call this morning.
LYDIA
Not a word of warning!
Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for
Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she
gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty
chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone.
She walks into the post office.

58.
Elizabeth comes out of the post office to reveal...
Time has passed, the now deserted village is covered in a
thick blanket of snow. A lonely Elizabeth walks away
totally despondent.
Charlotte's new home is a smallish but charming rectory
in Kent. Charlotte greets Elizabeth, kissing her warmly.
 Mr Collins bows as he ushers her in.
MR COLLINS
Welcome to our humble abode...
There is a coop containing hens of various
descriptions ...a.pig-stye...a vegetable patch...a rose
bower. Charlotte and Mr Collins are showing Elizabeth
round the place.
MR COLLINS
(POINTING)
And from here we have a good view of
Rosings Park, where we are honoured to
dine at least twice a week. Her
ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered
for us. I should say, one of her
ladyship's carriages, for she has
several.
CHARLOTTE
My dear, I think our guest is tired after
her journey. Come on, Lizzie, let's get
some tea.
T
59.
MR COLLINS
 My wife encourages me to spend as much
time in the garden as possible, for the
sake of my health.
A beat. Lizzie glances at Charlotte, who remains
impassive.
MR COLLINS
I plan many improvements, of course.
(points to house)
I intend. to throw out a bow there, and
plant a lime walk.
(sharp look at Lizzie)
Oh yes, I flatter myself that any young
lady would be happy to be the mistress of
such a house.
A tiny nod from Elizabeth. She understands perfectly.
Elizabeth, Charlotte and Mr Collins walk hurriedly across
the lawns towards the great house. Beyond the toparied
hedges the grey building looms ominously above them. It
is grand without being elegant.
COLLINS
One of the most extraordinary sights in
all Europe, is it not. The glazing alone
cost upwards of twenty thousand pounds.

61.

Sunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the "
church. Mr Collins, in his vestments, obeises himself to
Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable-
looking daughter and downtrodden governess. Elizabeth
joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path
together.
ELIZABETH
How long do you plan to stay in Kent,
Colonel?
FITZWILLIAM
As long as Darcy chooses. I am at his
disposal.
69.
ELIZABETH
I do imagine your cousin brought you down
with him chiefly to have someone to order
around. I wonder he does not marry and
secure a lasting convenience of that
kind.
FITZWILLIAM
She would be a lucky woman.
ELIZABETH
Really?
FITZWILLIAM
Darcy is a most loyal companion. From
what I heard, on our journey here, he
recently came to the rescue of one of his
friends just in time.
Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the
church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with
Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up
to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops,
at the churchyard gate.
ELIZABETH
What happened?

FITZWILLIAM
He saved the man from an imprudent
marriage.
ELIZABETH
(FALTERING SLIGHTLY)
Who was the man?
FITZWILLIAM
His closest friend. Mr Bingley.
A silence.
ELIZABETH
Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for
this interference?
FITZWILLIAM
There were apparently strong objections
to the lady.
ELIZABETH
What kind of objections? Her lack of
fortune?
FITZWILLIAM
I think it was her family that was
considered unsuitable.
70.
ELIZABETH
So he separated them?
FITZWILLIAM
I believe so. I know nothing else.
Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is
joined by his aunt.
ELIZABETH
I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well
in finding partners suitable to their
very high standards. Good morning, Col.
Fitzwilliam.
76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76
parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a
distance.
Lizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly
cares. She is in a turmoil of misery and fury. How could
Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain.
CUT TO:
 A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now
bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and
sits down, heavily, on a bench.
Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain-
lashed landscape.
A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer.
It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards
her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house.
He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to
notice her upset face.
DARCY
Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but
I can bear it no longer ... . The past
months have been a torment...
He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in
astonishment. He struggles on.
DARCY
I came to Rosings with the single object
of seeing you...I had to see you...
ELIZABETH
 Me?
71.
DARCY
 I've fought against my better judgement,
my family's expectation...
(PAUSE)
The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank
and circumstance...
(STUMBLINGLY)
all those things.. .but I'm willing to put
them aside... and ask you to end my
agony...
ELIZABETH
I don't understand...
DARCY
(WITH PASSION)
I love you. Most ardently.
Elizabeth stares at him.
DARCY
Please do me the honour of accepting my
hand.
A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful
confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.
ELIZABETH
(VOICE SHAKING)
Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have
been through, and I am very sorry to have
caused you pain. Believe me, it was
unconsciously done.
A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet.
DARCY
(STARES)
Is this your reply?
ELIZABETH
Yes, sir.
DARCY
Are you laughing at me?
ELIZABETH
No?
DARCY
Are you rejecting me?
ELIZABETH
(PAUSE)
I'm sure that the feelings which, as
you've told me, have hindered your
regard, will help you in overcoming it.
72.
A terrible silence, as this sinks in. Neither of them can
 move. At last, Darcy speaks. He is very pale.
DARCY
Might I ask why, with so little endeavour
at civility, I am thus repulsed?
ELIZABETH
(trembling with emotion)
I might as well enquire why, with so.
evident a design of insulting me, you
chose to tell me that you liked me
against your better judgement. If I was
uncivil, that was some excuse -
DARCY
Believe me, I didn't mean -
ELIZABETH
But I have other reasons, you know I
have!
DARCY
What reasons?
ELIZABETH
Do you think that anything might tempt me
to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps
for ever, the happiness of a most beloved
sister?
Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the
face.
ELIZABETH
Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you
separated a young couple who loved each
other, exposing your friend to the
censure of the world for caprice, and my
sister to its derision for disappointed
hopes, and involving them both in misery
of the acutest kind?
DARCY
I do not deny it.
ELIZABETH
(BLURTS OUT)
How could you do it?
DARCY
Because I believed your sister
indifferent to him.
ELIZABETH
 Indifferent?
73.
DARCY
 I watched them most carefully, and
realized his attachment was much deeper
than hers.
ELIZABETH
That's because she's shy!
DARCY
Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded
that she didn't feel strongly for him.
ELIZABETH
Because you suggested it!
DARCY
I did it for his own good.
ELIZABETH
My sister hardly shows her true feelings
to me!
(pause, takes a breath)
I suppose you suspect that his fortune
had some bearing on the matter?
DARCY
(SHARPLY)
No! I wouldn't do your sister the

dishonour. Though it was suggested -
(STOPS)
ELIZABETH
What was?
DARCY
It was made perfectly clear that-an
advantageous marriage...
(STOPS)
ELIZABETH
Did my sister give that impression?
DARCY -
No!
An awkward pause.
DARCY
There was, however, I have to admit...
the matter of your family -
ELIZABETH
Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't
vex himself about that!

DARCY
No, it was more than that.
74.
ELIZABETH
How, sir?
DARCY
(pause, very uncomfortable)
It pains me to say this, but it was the
lack of propriety shown by your mother,
your three younger sisters - even, on
occasion, your father. Forgive me.
Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.
DARCY
You and your sister -- I must exclude from
this...
Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth
glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery.
ELIZABETH
And what about Mr Wickham?
DARCY
Mr Wickham?
ELIZABETH
What excuse can you give for your
behavior to him?

DARCY
You take an eager interest in that
gentleman's concerns!
ELIZABETH
He told me of his misfortunes.
DARCY
Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very
great indeed!
ELIZABETH
You have ruined his chances, and yet
treat him with sarcasm?
DARCY
So this is your opinion of me! Thank you
for explaining so fully. Perhaps these
offences might have been overlooked, if
your pride had not been hurt -
ELIZABETH
My pride?
DARCY
- by my honesty in admitting scruples
about our relationship.
(MORE)
75.
DARCY (CONT'D)
Could you expect me to rejoice in the
inferiority of your circumstances?

ELIZABETH
And those are the words of a gentleman?
From the first moment I met you, your
arrogance and conceit, your selfish
distain of the feelings of others, made
me realize that you were the last man in
the world I could ever be prevailed upon
to marry.
Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.
DARCY
Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much
of your time.
He leaves, abruptly.
Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What
has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears.
Darcy rides off.
DARCY (V.0.)
Mr Wickham's prime objective was her
inheritance of thirty thousand pounds but
hope of revenging me was a strong
inducement. I was lucky enough to
persuade my sister of her folly. I hope
this goes someway to mitigating my
behaviour in your eyes. If you doubt my
word please have it confirmed by my

cousin Fitzwilliam.
78.
Elizabeth riding in a carriage through Cheapside, reading
the letter.
DARCY (V.0.)
P.S. As we shall never meet again, I wish
you all happiness in the future.
Elizabeth looks out at the high warehouse building and
the bustle of trade. There is no horizon.
CHEAPSIDE - THE SAME.
Elizabeth and Jane sit together in the small walled
garden.
79.
Jane is all smiles, but behind her eyes is a sadness
unseen before. Elizabeth is desperate to unburden herself
 but feels unable.
JANE
I am quite over him, Lizzie. If he passed
in the street I would hardly notice.
London is so diverting...
ELIZABETH
oh Jane...
JANE
Its true! What with the theatre and...
But tell me, what news from Kent?
ELIZABETH
Nothing. Everything as you might imagine.
Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the
Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the
garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and
Mrs Bennet.
KITTY
Lizzie, tell mama, tell her!
LYDIA
(SMUGLY)

Mrs Forster has invited me.
KITTY
(WAILS)
Why didn't she ask me as well?
ELIZABETH
Kitty, what's happened?
LYDIA
- because she likes me better.
KITTY
I've just as much right as Lydia -
MRS BENNET
Oh, if I could but go to Brighton -
KITTY
- and more so, because I'm two years
older!
Elizabeth looks to Jane.
JANE
Lydia has been invited to Brighton with
the Foresters.
80.
MRS BENNET
 A little sea-bathing would set me up very
NICELY-
LYDIA
I shall dine with the officers every
night!
An anguished wail from Kitty.
MRS BENNET
I'm sure I cried for two days when
Colonel Millar's regiment went away.
thought I should have broke my heart.
LIZZIE
Mother! Are you all mad?
She glares at them, deeply upset -- by them, by
everything.
A ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty -
scudding clouds, mountains, wild rocky outcrops.
Elizabeth is walking freely, the wind in her hair. As she
nears the peak of a promontory, Mr and Mrs Gardiner are
below making their way towards her. They smile at her.
She strides off determined to reach the very top. When
she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched, her
head back laughing into the wind. The view is
magnificent. She breathes deeply.
An establishing shot of Lambton, a charming market town.
Through the window of an inn we see Elizabeth and Mr and
Mrs Gardiner at a table.
The carriage enters the gates of Pemberley.
MRS GARDINER
I'm so glad you changed your mind.
Elizabeth is alert, her eyes bright with curiosity. The
parkland is wild and rocky. Deer graze; rooks wheel in
the sky. A sense of freedom and liberation. As the
carriage drives over the top of a hill, close on
Elizabeth's face. She gasps. The Gardiners gasp.
A huge, wide shot of Pemberley House. It's vast,
breathtakingly beautiful, set in great boulder-strewn
park lands. A mansion built of golden stone, glowing in
the sunlight.
Elizabeth walks through the magnificent grounds.
MRS GARDINER
Imagine being mistress of all this. It is
as big as all Cheapside.
Elizabeth is lost in admiration.
85.
Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being
unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth
recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played
earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She
follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets
 closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she
is outside the room where the music is being played.
87.
She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the
better of her and she discretely peeps in.

Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful
fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and
fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After
sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly
hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind
Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.
Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She
stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.
It is Darcy.
Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him
there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.
For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with
surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,
Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.
DARCY
Miss Bennet!
Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches
up with her. They both blush, deeply.
ELIZABETH
I thought you were in London.
DARCY
(STUPIDLY)
No... I'm not.
ELIZABETH
No.
Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.
DARCY ELIZABETH
I came here a day early - We wouldn't have come -
DARCY ELIZABETH
-- some business with my I'm so terribly sorry -
STEWARD -
They stop. He gazes at her with great emotion.
ELIZABETH
I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and
aunt.
DARCY
(trying to recover)
And are you having a pleasant trip?
ELIZABETH
Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
88.
DARCY
 Tomorrow?
(DISAPPOINTED)
Are you staying at Larnbton?
ELIZABETH
Yes. At the Rose and Crown.
Another pause. She extends her hand.
ELIZABETH
I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the
house was open for visitors. I had no
idea...
She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.
DARCY
May I see you to the village?
ELIZABETH
Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.
DARCY
Yes.
ELIZABETH
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

She hurries away. He gazes after her.
CUT TO:
A wood. Now she is out of sight Lizzie collapses on a
log. She is utterly undone. Around her, the birds sing.
Darcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to
Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful
and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with
Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit
comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly
at two large fish that lie beside him.
ELIZABETH
It is so beautiful up here. I will be
sorry to leave.
Darcy smiles at her.
ELIZABETH
You have been a most gracious host. I'm
sure my aunt and uncle will talk of
nothing else for days.
 DARCY
I have recently thought a great deal
about how I appear and act to others.
92.
She smiles softly at Darcy.

ELIZABETH
It does you credit, sir.
The Gardiner's carriage racing through the night.

Were looking directly down onto a London street. Mr
Bennet stands still against the passing pedestrian
traffic. He tries to address a passer by.
MR BENNET
Excuse me.
They ignore him. He tries again
MR BENNET (CONT'D)
Excuse me, I'm looking for...
Mr Bennet takes out a piece of paper.
We're looking through a window to the stairwell of a
seedy looking boarding house. An anonymas pair of mens
boots appear climbing up the stairs. We move across the
exterior wall of the building to find an open window
through which Lydia and Wickham can be seen.
Lydia and Wickham sit, snuggled close beside the fire in
their room in a humble lodging house. They're eating a
meal with relish. Giggling, Lydia feeds him a mouthful.
A knock at the door. They freeze, like naughty children.

The girls have a letter. Kitty grabs it from Jane, Mary
grabs it from Kitty, before she has a chance to open it
Jane grabs it from Mary.
JANE
It's to Daddy. It's in uncle's writing.
Mr Bennet snatches the letter.
MR BENNET
As it is addressed to me...
He tears it open and begins to read, squinting because he
has forgotten his glasses.
MR BENNET (CONT'D)
He's found them.
KITTY
Are they married?
MR BENNET
(squinting at the letter)
Just wait. I can't make out his script.
97.
Elizabeth snatches it.

ELIZABETH
Give it to me. (she reads)
KITTY
Are they married?
ELIZABETH
They will be, if father will settle a
hundred pounds a year on her. That is
Wickham's condition.
KITTY
A hundred pounds!
ELIZABETH
You will agree to this, father?
The letter is passed around the other girls.
MR BENNET
Of course I will agree. But how much your
uncle has laid on this wretched man
already is anybody's guess.
KITTY
What do you mean, Father?

MR BENNET
No man in his senses would marry Lydia on
so slight a temptation as a hundred a
year.
ELIZABETH
Ah, I see.
JANE
See what?
MR BENNET
Your uncle is very generous.
ELIZABETH
Do you think it a large sum?
MR BENNET
Wickham's a fool if he takes her for less
than ten thousand pounds. I should be
sorry to think so ill of him in the very -
beginning of our relationship.
JANE
Ten thousand! Heaven forbid!
98.
Lydia, croquet mallet in hand, drags her new husband
across the lawn. Kitty follows.
LYDIA
Come on, Wickham! You've got to play.
KITTY
Yes, come on!
Wickham looks slightly abashed - a trapped man. What has
he let himself in for?
Lizzie comes into the garden, looking for her younger
sister. Wickham detaches himself and comes over to her. A
rueful smile.
WICKHAM
I hope we can be even better friends, now
we're brother and sister.
An attempt at a twinkling smile, but Elizabeth is now
immune to his charm. She nods, briefly.
WICKHAM
I hear you visited Pemberley. My dear old
home.
ELIZABETH
(NODS)
I met Mr Darcy's sister.
WICKHAM
(A BEAT)
Did you like her?
ELIZABETH
Very much.
(looks at him)
We found a great deal to talk about.
102.
A beat. Wickham looks deeply uneasy. He bows and leaves.
Lizzie watches him pick up a mallet and take his turn.
She can't bear it; she hurries up to Lydia and draws her
aside.
ELIZABETH
(LOW VOICE)
Why was Mr Darcy there?
LYDIA
I'm not supposed to tell.
Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand.
ELIZABETH
Please, Lydia!
LYDIA
Because he paid for it.
ELIZABETH
(STARES)
For what?
LYDIA
(CARELESSLY)
The wedding, Wickham's commission.
Everything.

ELIZABETH
Everything?
KITTY
(CALLS)
Lydia! It's your turn!
Lydia moves to go.
LYDIA
People kept saying Wickham owed them
money, it was so tedious. So Darcy
settled his debts but I don't really like
him, do you?
Lizzie pulls her back.
ELIZABETH
But why did he do it?
LYDIA
(SHRUGS)
I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to
tell because it's supposed to be our
uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have
 minded paying, either, because I'm his
favorite.
103.
 She leaves. Giggles and shrieks from the croquet lawn.
Elizabeth looks blank with shock.
Close on Darcy's grimly determined face. Drawing back, we
see that he is walking down a street in Mayfair. He
arrives at a house, pauses, and rings the bell. The door
is opened.
BUTLER
Mr Darcy.
DARCY
I have some business with Mr Bingley.
Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes
slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor
window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and
bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley
looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We
witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has
wronged Jane Bennet.
IS
Lydia and Wickham are leaving. Mr Bennet stands at a
distance. Mrs Bennet sobs as Lydia climbs onto the
carriage.
MRS BENNET
Write to me often, my dear'.
Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth.
WICKHAM
Please relay my affections to the Darcy's
on your next acquaintance. I am sure he
will be pleased to hear things have
worked out so well.
He joins Lydia.
LYDIA
(through the window)
Married women never have much time for
writing. My sisters may write to me!
They'll have nothing else to do.
The Mrs Bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives
away.

104.
MRS BENNET

Oh there is nothing so bad as parting
with ones children! One seems so forlorn
without them.
ELIZABETH
That is the consequence of marrying a
daughter. It must make you better
satisfied that your other four are
single.
Elizabeth and Jane are out shopping with their mother and
sisters. Their housekeeper, Mrs Hill, comes out of the
butchers shop.
MRS HILL
Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley
is returning to Netherfield.
A stunned silence. Lizzie glances at Jane. She blushes.
MRS BENNET
Mr Bingley?
Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.
MRS HILL
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork,
for she expects him tomorrow.
MRS BENNET
Tomorrow?
(RECOVERING)
Not that I care about it. Mr Bingley is
nothing to us and I'm sure I never want
to see him again.
(MOVES AWAY)
No, we shall not mention a word about it.
(comes back to Mrs Hill)
Is it quite certain he is coming?
MRS HILL
Yes, madam. I believe he is alone; his
sister remains in town.
MRS BENNET
Huh! Come along, girls.
Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at
the threshold.

105.
JANE

It's all right, Lizzie. I'm just glad
that he comes alone, because then we
shall see less of him.
(BLUSHING)
Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I
dread other people's remarks.
A brave smile. Lizzie, of course, is not convinced in the
slightest. They go into the shop.
Mr Bingley rides towards Longbourn, a look of slight
trepidation in his eyes. Darcy now comes into view riding
along side him. They cross the moat bridge.
 Bingley is pacing backwards and forwards in despair
muttering to himself. Darcy looks at him in extreme
frustration.
108.
BINGLEY
Oh damn, damn, buggery, damn.
DARCY
What were you thinking of?
It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and
down.
BINGLEY
Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn.
Elizabeth is sat under a tree crying.
Darcy looks down at Longbourn.
Elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around
through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to
rise.
Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists
are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the
distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She
is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy.
ELIZABETH
Mr Darcy!
DARCY
What are you doing out here so early?
ELIZABETH
I could not sleep.
DARCY
Me neither. I have been up.most of the
night.

Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected
meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy.
ELIZABETH
Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your
unexampled generosity to both my sisters.
I know what kindnesses you have done for
poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the
happy resolution for Jane also.
DARCY
I am alarmed that you know of what I have
been so in earnest to keep silent. But
you must know that your happiness was one
of my prime inducements.
Elizabeth looks at Darcy.
DARCY (CONT`D)
I know you are too generous to trifle
with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt
last night, and it has taught me to hope
as I had scarcely allowed myself before.
If your feelings are still what they were
last April, tell me so at once. My
affections and wishes are unchanged, but

one word from you will silence me
forever.
116.
Elizabeth is silent.

DARCY (CONT'D)
If, however, your feelings have
changed...
Elizabeth gazes at him.
DARCY (CONT'D)
I would have to tell you, you have
bewitched me body and soul and I love and
love and love you. And never wish to be
parted from you from this day on.
Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is
staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's
cheek.
ELIZABETH
I am very happy to inform you that not
only have my sentiments changed there are
no other words which could give me
greater pleasure.
Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very,
very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her
eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the
kiss becomes passionate.
Darcy, in an agony, paces up and down the lawn. He looks
at the library window.
CUT BACK TO:
We move through a vast wedding party, following Elizabeth
and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham
are missing. Let everyone have an end.
Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off
into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.
Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy
and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades
as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past
the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to
Elizabeth and smiles.
DARCY
Allow me, Mrs Darcy.
He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the
rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by
side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.
ELIZABETH
How did it begin?
DARCY
I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or

the look. It was too long ago and I was
in the middle before I knew it had begun.
ELIZABETH
Now be sincere, did you admire me for my
impertinenc?
DARCY
For the liveliness of your mind, I did.
ELIZABETH
You may as well call it impertinence,
though make a virtue of it by all means.
My good qualities are under your
protection, and you are to exaggerate -
them as much as possible. And, in return,
it belongs to me to find occasions for
teasing and quarrelling with you as often
as maybe... and I shall begin directly...
We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and
smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter
and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...
135 FADE TO BLACK... 135

THE END.
