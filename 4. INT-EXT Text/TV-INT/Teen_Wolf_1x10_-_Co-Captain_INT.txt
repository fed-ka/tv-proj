      Doors burst open and the still chanting crowd fills the 
      hallway. Scott pushes through, searching for--

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles? Has anyone seen Stiles?

      He turns and unexpectedly find himself facing Allison. 
      Pressed together in the mob, they look at each other for an 
      awkward second. Scott opens his mouth to speak and--

                                  BRIAN
                    State! State! State!

      His teammate, Brian, screams between them. They both stare 
      blankly at him in annoyance until he finally decides to chant 
      in someone else s face.

                                    ALLISON
                    You were pretty awesome out there.

                                  SCOTT
                    Thanks, you too. I mean--that s not 
                    what I meant.

                                    ALLISON
                    No, I did some pretty awesome 
                    cheering. You can thank me.

                    to  Defense, Defense  without a 
                    breath. I brought my A game.

      The commotion seems to fade around them as Scott can t help 
      but smile at her effort charm him. Until Brian pops back in 
      between--

                                  BRIAN
                    State! State! State!

      Scott shoots a murderous glare at him. Brian shrinks away, 
      allowing Scott to return his attention to Allison. But she s 
      down the hall now, Argent with his arm around her shoulder, 
      gently guiding her out with the rest of the dissipating 
      crowd.

      Gazing after them, Scott doesn t notice Jackson stepping up 
      to whisper in his ear.

                                    JACKSON
                    That s heartbreaking, man. I bet

                    of tissues--

      Eyes narrowing, Scott resists responding to the taunts.

                    You know what, though, McCall? I

      He backs away, letting the words sink in.

      Stepping out of the steam-filled shower, a deeply troubled 
      Scott pulls a towel around his waist. He passes by Danny who 
      changes into his street clothes at his locker.

      Bag slung over his shoulder, Danny heads out. Noticing he s 
      the only one left in the locker room, Scott quickly starts to 
      get dressed. But he s barely zipped up his jeans when--

      He HEARS FOOTSTEPS.

                                  SCOTT
                    Danny?

      No response. Scott peers around the corner, then breathes in 
      relief when he sees Derek.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Thank God. Where the hell have you

      He stops when he notices Derek s odd demeanor. Then slowly 
      turns to find SOMEONE standing silhouetted in the darkness. 

      A hand reaches into one of the open lockers to withdraw a 
      LACROSSE STICK.

                                  PETER
                    I don t really get lacrosse. When I

                    But, I read somewhere that lacrosse 
                    comes from Native American tribes 
                    and that they sometimes played it 
                    to resolve conflicts. Am I right 
                    about that?

      He raises the stick. Breath held, Scott waits for him to snap 
      it in half or send it smashing against the lockers. But Peter 
      just carefully sets it down again.

                                  PETER (CONT D)

      His hand moves like a cobra striking, latching onto Scott. 
      Fingernails rapidly extending to CLAWS, they sink right into 
      the back of the boy s neck.

      For a brief second, Scott s eyes FLASH YELLOW. Then Peter 
      yanks his hand back, letting him tumble to the floor. 
      Blinking furiously, strange IMAGES FLASH into Scott s head--


      A dark room fills with black smoke, men and women trying to 
      cover their mouths, coughing and screaming as--

      Reddick and Unger, visible through a dirty basement window, 
      toss liquid from five gallon jugs onto the house. They douse 
      the windows, their images BLURRING as--

      Hands desperately grab for a door, trying to push it open 
      while black, roiling smoke covers everything--


      Nurses gently lay Peter back onto a hospital bed. One 
      undamaged eye blinks out from a face covered in white gauze 
      bandages.

      Light seeps over his face, the brilliant white glow from a 
      FULL MOON. 

      A now un-bandaged Peter sits up in bed, the moon almost 
      seeming to pull at him, drawing him up to his feet. At the 
      door stands his nurse, Jennifer, watching in astonishment as--


      Down through a ceiling into the locker room where Scott lies 
      on the floor, eyes snapping open as he GASPS for air.

      Main Title: TEEN WOLF


      Stiles slams through the door, tearing around the corner to 
      find a weary Scott slumped on a bench.

                                  STILES

      Slivers of moonlight stretch across the dark room to 
      Allison s bed where she lies wide awake on her stomach, 
      completely and utterly unable to get to sleep.

      The moment she lets her eyes close a shadow falls over her 
      back. Scott eases up behind her, gently moving her hair aside 
      to softly kiss the nape of her neck when--

      Allison turns over, rolling to her side, once again alone in 
      her room. Until fingers begin tracing lightly up her arm. 
      Next to her, Scott draws his hand up over her shoulder and-- 

      Allison turns again, this time onto her back. She squeezes 
      her eyes closed, trying to shut him out of her imagination.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/117.

      But a moment later, Scott slips on top of her again, softly 
      touching his lips to her neck, then to the edge of her chin 
      making his way to her lips. She rises to meet his kiss and-- 

      Sits up in the dark, alone and exasperated. Her fingers move 
      to her neck where she imagined him touching her and then...

      She feels around her throat as if something is missing. 
      Something like a necklace.

      Standing, she crosses to her desk to find the book that was 
      holding her necklace lies empty.

      She clicks on the light and begins searching her room, 
      pulling open drawers and looking under pillows, moving more 
      and more frantically. But it s nowhere to be found.


      Allison opens her car door and slips behind the wheel. She 
      feels around the seats, checks the glove compartment. Still 
      nothing.

      THE GARAGE DOOR begins RUMBLING open, surprising her. She 
      yanks the car door closed and slides down out of view.

      Argent and Kate step out of the SUV in mid-conversation.

                    All I m saying is firing those

      Argent holds up what looks like small pieces of SCRAP METAL.

                    Not. Yet.

      Her lingering at the workbench causes Argent to crane his 
      neck, trying to see what she s doing.

                    You coming?

      He s about to step back to her when she turns with a smile 
      and follows him inside the house.

      When the door eases closed behind them, Allison waits a 
      moment, then slips out of her car.

      AT THE TRASH CAN she delicately extracts one of the items her 
      father tossed in. 

      It s a METAL CASING, blown out, surface blackened. Allison 
      turns it over in her hand, no idea what it is. Until she 
      looks over at the workbench where Kate lingered.

      Lying right in the middle of it is a cone-shaped FLASH BOLT. 
      Allison matches the spent casing up to compare it to an 
      unused bolt. 

      They re the same.

      Slowly holding the conical FLASH BOLT up to her eyes, she 
      never notices that the door to the kitchen is actually still 
      slightly ajar.

      Standing in the darkness beyond it, Kate watches, clearly 
      pleased to see her niece picking up the clues on the path of 
      discovery to which she s so carefully guiding her.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Jackson roars down a desolate stretch of road with HEAVY

      literally rattles the windows. Too loud for him to hear the 
      engine SPUTTER.

      She takes a firing position in front of a TARGET pegged to a 
      tree in the distance. Setting the arrow just under the sight, 
      she expertly pulls back on the nocking point of the 
      bowstring. 

      Lydia tenses up as Allison aims. Then lets the bolt SOAR. It 
      EXPLODES AGAINST THE TREE with a BRILLIANT FLASH, strange 
      WHORLS OF LIGHT spinning into the air.

                    Pouring me an ounce of whiskey 
                    would be nice.

      Setting a BOTTLE and a GLASS on the table, Stiles tries to 
      get a glance at the files.

      Stiles tilts the bottle of whiskey to pour.

      Pausing, Stiles glances from his father to the case files. 
      Then to the bottle in his own hand. A devious plan forming...

      Eyes still on the files, Stilinski lifts up the glass to sip, 
      not noticing that it s almost COMPLETELY FULL. 

      When he sets it back down it s EMPTY, paperwork now spread 
      haphazardly all over the table.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1122.

      The photos show attempts at taking Derek s mugshot thwarted

      Scott and Allison sit on the edge of his bed, not talking. Or

                                    ALLISON
                    That s what I thought. But then I 
                    found glass on her car. Like the 
                    window had been smashed in.

      Scott nods slowly. Trying not to react.

                    And then I ve been overhearing 
                    these strange conversations.

      Scott shifts next to her, knowing exactly where this is going 
      but unable to stop her.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    And I think some of it has to with 
                    Derek.

                    Are you sure?

                                    ALLISON
                    Yeah. And this is where it s going 
                    to really start sounding 
                      unbelievable. And you have to 
                    promise not to laugh or look at me 
                    like I m crazy. Because I think...

                    Scott! Coming home late tonight!

      The door swings open. Scott and Allison both jump to their 
      feet. Almost like they ve been caught at something. But 
      Melissa smiles in at them until Scott notices that she s in 
      heels and a very flattering dress.

                    A medical rep who came into the 
                    hospital today. We just started 
                    talking. Next thing I know I m 
                    saying yes to dinner. And then

                    What medical rep?

      Scott glances up as the DOORBELL RINGS.

                    That medical rep. Oh God, I m not

                    One minute, okay?

      She nods.


      Charging into the foyer, Scott approaches the door, hand 
      reaching out to the knob. But then, just as he s about to 
      grasp it, he slows, his hand hovering over the knob.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1131.

      beginning to tremble. He takes a step back.

      The KNOB slowly turns on its own. Scott reaches for the 
      deadbolt to lock the door. But just as he s about to grasp it 
      THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN TO REVEAL--

      Nothing. The porch lies empty. Scott turns back to see his

      As she disappears into the house, Scott grabs the knob again, 
      moving to yank it closed. But Peter puts a hand on the door.

      Thundering HEAVY METAL blasts from an iPod sitting docked in 
      a speaker. Just a few feet beyond the rattling lockers,

      Racking it, he immediately gets up and grabs two dumbbells 
      for hammer curls. Pushing himself as hard as he can, he grits 
      his teeth on the last rep. Muscles straining through his tank 
      top, he struggles to get the dumbbell up to his chest.

      The MUSIC stops. Jackson blinks, the weight coming down. He 
      drops both dumbbells to the floor.

                    What the hell, dude?

      No response comes. He leans back, trying to see around the 
      locker to his iPod speaker and whoever turned it off.

      Derek presses PLAY. When he turns around he finds Jackson 
      holding a lacrosse stick like a bat, ready to defend himself.

      MUSIC hammering through the locker room, Derek slowly 
      approaches.

      turns back around, eyes meeting Derek s.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    There s no one else here.

                                  DEREK
                    No.

                                    JACKSON
                    And no one else coming.

                                  DEREK
                    No.

      Lower lip beginning to tremble, Jackson bites it back. But 
      when he looks up he can t hide the fear.

                                    JACKSON
                    Please, don t. I ll shut up. I 
                    won t say anything ever again.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1141.

      Derek starts forward. But he seems to be having trouble 
      holding Jackson s gaze as if his resolve is weakening.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    I ll leave Scott alone. Please 
                    don t do this. Oh my God, please.

      Jackson begins backing toward the entrance. He doesn t see 
      the stairs behind him and stumbles into them.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Come on, please don t. I don t 
                    deserve this. I don t deserve it.

                                  DEREK
                    I think you do. Because wouldn t 
                    there be someone trying to save 
                    you? Look around, Jackson. There s 
                    no one. No one cares that you drive 
                    an expensive car. No one cares 
                    about your perfect hair. And no one 
                    cares that you re Captain of the 
                    lacrosse team.

                                  SCOTT
                    Excuse me.

      Derek s head snaps up to see Scott perched at the top of the 
      stairs. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                      Co-Captain.

      He LAUNCHES himself down the stairs, TRANSFORMING in mid-
      flight, SNARLING through sharpening fangs and dragging Derek 
      to the floor right in front of a stunned Jackson. 

      Rolling to his feet, Scott takes a protective stance in front 
      of Jackson who looks on him in his transformed state with a 
      mixture of fear and awe.

      Derek looks up, now also transformed and baring his fangs.

                                  DEREK
                    Move.

                                  SCOTT
                    No.

      Jackson cowers back in the shadows, moving to the side of the 
      stairs as the two werewolves circle each other until--

      They both stop, both seeming to sense something. They hear 
      it. A strange WHISTLING SOUND. Something SOARING through the 
      air.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Cover your eyes--

      A FLASH BOLT blasts inside the house and explodes with a 
      BLINDING LIGHT.

      It s followed by a volley of GUNSHOTS. Jackson SCREAMS out as 
      both Scott and Derek take hits.

      Scott tumbles to the FLOOR hollering in pain. As he rolls 
      over onto his back he looks at his stomach in terror. SMOKE 
      WAFTS UP from the wound. He s been hit with a wolfsbane 
      bullet.

      He blinks up at Derek who has taken cover behind a column.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Go.

      Then, without another word, Derek spins into a new round of 
      GUNFIRE and goes right out the door to face the hunters 
      himself.


      Sitting there in Scott s room, still waiting and ever 
      patient, Allison checks the time on her cell phone.


      Finally, Allison stands, pulling her jacket back on. Slowly, 
        reluctantly, she walks out the door.


      Scott jolts awake. He squints, blinded by the FLORESCENT 
      LIGHT blazing down on him. Then hears the CLINK of METAL.

      Nearby, a BULLET SLUG now lies at the bottom of a steel tin. 
      His boss, Dr. Deaton, steps over to smile down at him.

                                  DEATON
                      I wouldn t try to get up just yet.

                                  SCOTT

                    something that should speed up the 
                    healing process.

                                  SCOTT
                    But... you re a vet.

                                  DEATON
                    Very true. And ninety percent of 
                    the time I m mostly treating cats 
                    and dogs.

                                  SCOTT
                    Mostly?

      Deaton turns to him with a knowing smile.

                                  DEATON
                    Mostly.


      A time-worn heavy steel door swings open into a damp corridor 
      marked with more disgusting dirt and grime than a New York 
      subway tunnel. Kate steps inside, followed by a very hesitant 
      Allison.

                                    ALLISON
                    What is this place?

                    how every family has its secrets? 

      Kate yanks open another door.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Ours are a little different.

      Allison gazes past her to where Derek stands shackled to a 
      grid of pipes, his head bent low. When he raises his eyes, 
      they re GLOWING an ice-cold blue.

      Fully transformed and chained up like a dog, Derek opens his 
      mouth wide and ROARS THROUGH HIS FANGS at the two female 
      Argents.

      Kate looks back to her terrified niece with the disturbed 
      grin of a pure sadist.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1145.
