We are close on a young man, Anthony Adams (Corleone),
in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy
at Annapolis. We are pulling back as the speaker --
who is Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of State --
continues, his accent faintly Scandinavian.

to which we can each legitimately
aspire. And now, as an unpopular war
is ended in East Asia and we set our

We continue to pull back to discover that we are at
the Navy and Marine Corps stadium. It is a late Spring
day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies. The
Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered
for- the graduation ceremonies.
