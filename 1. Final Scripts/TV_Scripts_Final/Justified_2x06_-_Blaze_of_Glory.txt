      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - ELEVATOR - DAYC1C1

      WINONA, arms full of files, watches the numbers tick down.  
      RAYLAN stands beside her.  They ve obviously just gotten into 
      work -- Winona is still carrying her various bags. 

                                  WINONA
                    I missed you last night.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    I didn t get back till late.

                                  WINONA
                    You could have called.  I was up 
                    half the night staring at the 
                    ceiling.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (sly smile)
                    Thinking about anything in 
                      particular?

                                  WINONA
                    You think any time I m lying in bed 
                    alone all I m doing is thinking 
                    about you?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not necessarily.

                                  WINONA
                    Bet I had a good five-six minutes 
                    in there when I didn t think about 
                    you once.  

      The elevator DINGS.  The doors open.  Winona exits (we stay 
      on Raylan so as not to show the view through the elevator 
      doors).

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                          (O.S.)
                    Plenty of other things on my mind.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Like?

      He follows her into--    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    1A.


      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUSDc1Dc1

      As Winona answers--

                                  WINONA
                    Oh, I don t know -- fact my soon-to-
                    be second ex-husband just re-
                    mortgaged the only asset we have 
                    left to buy a horse.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Gary bought a horse?

                                  WINONA
                    Without telling me.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You want me to have him killed?  
                    Gary.  Not the horse.

      Raylan uses his key to let them into-- 

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - EVIDENCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUSDd1Dd1

      An industrial-looking room with an empty desk on which we may 
      be able to see the nameplate  DEPUTY MARSHAL CHARLES WEAVER. 

                                  WINONA
                          (as she enters)
                    No, I just want you to tell me 
                      everything s gonna be okay.

      She heads straight for the back of the room, stops in front 
      of a barred metal door that looks into the evidence cage, 
      waits.    

      She turns when she realizes Raylan hasn t followed her (and 
      hasn t answered her).

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    Something wrong?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t have a key to that.
                          (off her stare)
                    Weaver and Art are the only ones 
                    with access to the cage.








                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    1B.

        CONTINUED:Dd1Dd1

                                  WINONA
                    I came to find you in your office 
                    just now, asked if you could let me 
                    into the evidence room -- maybe 
                    that would have been the time to 
                    tell me you didn t have the key. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    I didn t know you meant the cage -- 
                    since when do files go in the cage?

                                  WINONA
                          (re: files)
                    They re my transcripts from that
                    coal flyrock case.  Judge Reardon s 
                    worried  cause of all the coverage, 
                    tempers running hot-- 

                                  RAYLAN
                    So he has you putting them in a
                    lockbox guarded by an armed man? 
                    Seems excessive.

                                  WINONA
                          (deadpan)
                    Judge Reardon, excessive?

      Raylan makes his way over to her. 

                                  RAYLAN
                            (reassuring)
                    So we wait.  I m sure Weaver ll be 
                    in shortly.

                                  WINONA
                    Don t you have work?

                                  RAYLAN
                    It s a circus upstairs.  Happy to 
                    avoid it.

      They re face-to-face now.  Raylan reaches out, takes her bags 
      from her, sets them on the floor.  As he s doing this, he 
      inadvertently brushes his hand against her skirt. 

                                  WINONA
                    You know what that makes me think 
                    of, you touching me that way?  
                    Night Gary was waiting for you 
                    outside the motel.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    1C.

      CONTINUED: (2)Dd1Dd1

                                  RAYLAN
                    Me touching you makes you think of 
                    Gary?

                                  WINONA
                    Makes me think of that night -- the 
                    pregnant girl you had to take back 
                    to prison -- you remember I finally 
                    got you to tell me?

                                  RAYLAN
                      I remember.

                                  WINONA
                    Got me wondering if we had changed.  
                    Like maybe this time it wouldn t 
                    have to end the same way.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Matching rocking chairs on the 
                    porch?

                                  WINONA
                    Buncha little Raylans running 
                    around with toy sixguns.

      That freezes Raylan--

                                  RAYLAN
                    Aren t you the one who always said 
                    it wouldn t be fair to have a kid 
                    when every morning I walk out the 
                    door there s a chance I never walk 
                    back in?  

                                  WINONA
                    Well, what if there wasn t that 
                    chance?  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Meaning what?

                                  WINONA
                    Meaning what if when you left the 
                    house in the morning it wasn t to 
                    come here?

      Raylan doesn t have an answer.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    And once again we re back to

                    so different after all.

                    I don t know.  Don t you ever

      A charged moment, broken by the SOUND OF THE ELEVATOR and 
      then FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall.

                    That ll be Weaver.  I oughta get 
                    back upstairs.

      Off Winona--

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - EVIDENCE LOCKERS - DAYE1E1

      WEAVER (50s), the older deputy responsible for this storage 
      purgatory, escorts Winona, who still carries her files and 
      her various bags.

                                  WEAVER
                    Main lockboxes are full up.  It s 
                    all right -- we got some old ones 
                    in the back don t get used anymore.  
                    Just means I ll have to move some 
                    stuff around. 

      They ve reached what looks like a bank of big safe deposit 
      boxes, which is blocked by stacks of dusty file boxes.  
      Weaver, with some effort, starts dragging heavy boxes out of 
      the way, COUGHS from the dust.  He s interrupted as his cell 
      phone starts RINGING.

      He glances at the caller ID, answers--

                    How  bout now?...  Damn it.  Let me 
                    call you back in a minute.

      He hangs up, goes back to his work.

                    You heard the ATF s coming here?

                    You believe security at their 
                    office is such a mess, they want us 
                    to start playing host to their 
                      interrogations?  Personally, I 
                    think Art should ve told them to go 
                    to Hell, but I guess that 
                      decision s above my pay grade.

      He clears the last box out of the way, pulls out the keys 
      he s brought, hands them to Winona.

                                  WEAVER (CONT D)
                    You mind taking it from here?  I

                    I have any problem, I ll yell.

                                  WEAVER
                    I ll come in shooting.

      He hurries toward the door.  She sets down her bags, scans 
      the bank of lockboxes until she finds 242, opens it with the 
      key.  Huh.  There s a shoebox-sized evidence box inside.  She 
      turns to call to Weaver, stops when she sees he s already 
      through the door and on his way upstairs.

      Annoyed, Winona turns back to the locker.  She sets her files 
      on the floor next to her bags, pulls out the evidence box, 
      opens it.  Her breath catches--

      The evidence box is full of cash.  Twenty bound stacks of 
      $100 bills.  $200,000.  We should notice that the bills are 
      old-style, pre-1996 $100 bills (the most glaring difference 
      being the much smaller size of Ben Franklin s portrait).

      Off her face--

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT ONE

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY11

      TWO ATF AGENTS -- KEATON (40s, supervisory) and STARKE (30s), 
        identifiable by their windbreakers -- sit at the conference 
      table across from BOYD CROWDER.  The bulletin boards are 
      jammed with items relevant to the mine heist (205) 
      investigation, including PHOTOS of the explosion s aftermath 
      that show twisted metal and the charred remains of several 
      $100 bills.  The table is strewn with PHOTOS of KYLE, PRUITT 
      and MARCUS (mugshots, plus employee photos from the mine).

      Starke slides Kyle s mugshot toward Boyd.

                                  STARKE
                    And it was during that conversation 
                    that Kyle made his first threats 
                    against yourself and Mrs. Crowder? 

                                  BOYD
                    Ms. Crowder.

                                  STARKE
                          (annoyed)
                    --against yourself and Ms. Crowder.

                                  BOYD
                    I told you--

                                  KEATON
                    Tell us again.

                                  BOYD
                    They showed up at the house that 
                    morning--

                                  STARKE
                    At Ms. Crowder s house.

                                  BOYD
                    They showed up, said they were on 
                    their way to rob the mine, needed a 
                      powderman.  Said if I didn t go 
                    along they d put me and Ava in the 
                    ground.  

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY22

      The same cast of characters, except that Boyd is now replaced 
      by AVA.  The ATF Agents wear the same clothes as before.  
      This is clearly the same day.

        CONTINUED:22

                                  STARKE
                    So you didn t actually hear Kyle 
                    make these threats? 

                                  AVA
                    Like I said, I was already gone to 
                    work.  

                                  STARKE
                    Meaning Boyd told you what Kyle 
                    said.  Just like Boyd told you that 
                    morning was the first time he d 
                    heard about the plan to rob the 
                    mine.
                          (off Ava s silence)
                    So for all you know, Boyd could 
                    have been in on the heist from the 
                      beginning, could even have helped 
                    plan it.  Then afterward, he could 
                    have made up a story about Kyle 
                      threatening the two of you -- who s 
                    left alive to contradict him?

                                  AVA
                    Right after the explosion, he raced 
                    back home  cause he was afraid Kyle 
                    had a guy waiting to kill me if the 
                    job didn t come off. 

                                  KEATON
                    It s not possible he lied to you?

      Ava tries a different tack--

                                  AVA
                    If he was planning something like 
                    that, I would have picked up on it.  
                    When I left that morning he didn t 
                    have a care in the world.

      Back to Boyd--

                                  BOYD
                    Why would I lie?

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY44

      Back to Ava as Starke answers--





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    8.

                                  STARKE
                    Because if he can prove he was 
                    coerced, couldn t call the police 
                    out of fear for his life, then he s 
                    not criminally responsible.

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYA5A5

      Boyd--

                                  BOYD
                    The second they left the trailer I 
                    told Shelby if either one of us was 
                    to have a shot at staying alive, 
                    he d have to play along with me.  
                    Then I had him help me switch the 
                    money with the explosives.

                                  STARKE
                    What if we told you Shelby told us 
                    something different?

                                  BOYD
                    I d know you were lying.  Because 
                    the story I just told you is the 
                    truth and Shelby is a trustworthy 
                    man.  I believe he was a sheriff s 
                    deputy at one time.

                    Ms. Crowder, I think we re all 
                    growing tired of this babe-in-the-
                    woods act.  I want you to tell us 
                    right now where the rest of the

                                  KEATON
                    Some of it burned up.

                                  STARKE
                    Where s the rest of it?

                                  BOYD
                    There is no  rest of it. 

                                  STARKE
                    Mr. Crowder, the power of the blast 
                    makes it impossible to say for sure 
                    how much money there was in the 
                    truck, but our lab guys say it 
                    could have been as little as a few 
                    thousand.  That d leave about 
                    twenty unaccounted for. 




























                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    9.

                                  STARKE
                    That s right.

                                  BOYD
                    So it could have been a few 
                    thousand or it could have been all 
                    of it.

                                  KEATON
                    Given your history, you can imagine 
                    which way we re leaning. 

                                  BOYD

                    I can.  Just like I can imagine it 
                    was you who told my employers not 
                    to believe my version, which led 
                    them, in their wisdom, to let me

      Boyd uses all the strength he has to keep his cool.

      RAYLAN enters, nods to ART, who stands sipping coffee.  Art 
      nods back at Raylan, jerks his head in the direction of Boyd, 
      who sits in a chair in the bullpen, waiting.  Ava s still in 
      the conference room with Starke and Keaton.  

      Raylan makes his way over to Boyd.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I miss all the excitement?

                                  BOYD
                    Seems so.

                          (to Boyd)
                    Guess the fact you re not in cuffs 
                    means they believe your story about 
                    being coerced.

                                  BOYD
                    I m sure it doesn t hurt that you 
                    yourself told them you saw me that 
                    morning in the company of three men 
                    who struck you as armed and

                    Wonder if you saving his life might

                      convictions about my nature?

      Ava rises, heads out.  Starke and Keaton stay behind.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Honestly, Boyd, until you re a 
                    Federal fugitive again, I really 
                    don t care.
                          (to Ava)
                    Ava.

      Ava doesn t appear to hear him, doesn t slow down, just walks 
      ahead of him into the lobby, presses the elevator button.

                                  BOYD
                          (glances at Ava)
                    When someone s threatening a woman

                    to the lengths you ll go to keep 
                    her safe -- wouldn t think I d have 
                    to explain it to you, seeing s I 
                    can remember you being in that 
                    situation once or twice yourself.

      The elevator arrives.  Ava gets on, holds the door.  Boyd 
      nods to Raylan, starts moving away through the bullpen, then 
      has one last thought--

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Come to think of it, I think you 
                    may even have been in the same 
                    situation with the same woman.  
                    Ain t that something?

      Boyd steps onto the elevator.  Ava stops holding the door, 
      which immediately begins to close.

                                  RAYLAN
                    It s something.

      EXT. LEXINGTON STREET - DAYA16A16

      We re looking at a car parked at a meter.  The distance and 
      the BLUR OF PASSING TRAFFIC keeps us from being able to see 
      inside.

      As we PUSH IN CLOSER on the car, we can make out Winona, 
      sitting frozen in the driver s seat.  As we get even CLOSER, 
      we see she s staring down at something in her lap as though 
      hypnotized.   

      INT./EXT. WINONA S CAR - CONTINUOUSB16B16

      We now see that the thing she s staring at is an old-style 
      $100 bill, clearly one of the bills she just found in the 
      evidence cage.

      As we watch, Winona appears to snap out of her trance.  She 
      tosses the bill on the seat beside her, starts the car...  
      but then, instead of putting the car in gear and pulling out 
      into traffic, she turns it off again.  

      She yanks the keys out of the ignition, grabs the bill from 
      the seat, shoves the door open, slides out.

      INT. MID-SIZED BANK - DAY1616

      Winona waits in line for the TELLER, keeps fidgeting with 
      something in her hand that we REVEAL to be an old-style $100 
      bill we recognize from the evidence box.  The line of PEOPLE 
      includes TWO AMPED-UP YOUNG GUYS (20s) a few spots behind 
      her, who might set off her alarms if she weren t so 
      distracted.

      PAPPAS (30s), the bank security guard, has noticed the young 
      guys, watches them closely from his post by the front door.  
      Next to him, FRANK REASONER (60s, gray, tough but tired), a 
      cannula in his nose and an oxygen bottle dragging behind him, 
      stands still, apparently trying to catch his breath. 

      Winona has reached the front of the line.  A TELLER finishes 
      with his CUSTOMER, looks up at the waiting line.

                                  TELLER
                    Next in line.

      Winona doesn t move, stares at the bill in her hand.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    13A.

                    Next.

      An OLDER WOMAN, thinking Winona hasn t realized she s next, 
      leans forward, touches Winona s arm. 

                                  OLDER WOMAN
                          (to Winona)
                    That s you, honey.

      Winona gives her a nervous smile, but instead of walking over 
      to the open teller, she turns around and heads for the door.

      The two young men (BOBBY GREEN and CARTER HAYES) notice 
      Winona s distress, shoot each other a look.  Then suddenly-- 

      ...Bobby slides over the counter, pulls out a small sub-
      machine gun, levels it at the TELLERS...

      ...Carter draws his own sub-machine gun, aims at the 
        customers...

      ...Pappas, the security guard, reaches for his own gun...  
      WHAM! he goes down from a heavy blow to the head...  looks 
      up, bleary-eyed, to see standing over him... 

      Frank, the older man with the cannula in his nose, who is now 
      holding a gun in the hand not holding the oxygen bottle.

                    somebody else s money.

      ...as simultaneously behind the tellers  counter--

                                  BOBBY
                          (to the tellers)
                    Back away from the counter.  Anyone 
                    tries to trip the silents gets a 
                    bullet for himself and one for the 
                    guy next to him.

      ...and in front of the counter--

                                  CARTER
                    Everybody on the floor!  Do it 
                    right now!

      Winona and her fellow customers comply, as do the tellers. 

      Frank disarms Pappas, forces him to sit on the floor, zipties 
      his hands.  

                                  FRANK
                    You move, you get shot.

      Pappas nods.  With the guard now out-of-commission, Frank 
      comes around the tellers  counter to help Bobby who is 
      opening up a big duffel bag.  Frank pulls out a cheap alarm 
      clock, puts it on the counter, sets the timer for two 
      minutes.

      Carter, still aiming his machine gun with one hand, now 
      brings out his own duffel bag.

                                  CARTER
                          (to the customers)
                    Hands flat on the floor in front of 
                    you.  Keep them away from your 
                    pockets.

      He starts making his way down the row of CUSTOMERS, going 
      through their pockets, taking their wallets and jewelry and 
      dropping it all in the bag.  The customers stare at the 
      floor, careful not to meet his eyes.  He s obviously getting 
      off on the menace he and his gun bring.  

      Winona eyes him nervously, fingers her radioactive $100 bill.

      Behind the counter, Frank expertly unloads one of the cash 
      drawers into Bobby s duffel bags.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    15.

      CONTINUED: (3)1616

      Carter continues down the row.  Winona s getting desperate.

      Frank empties another cash drawer.

      Carter is now two people away from Winona.  She makes a 
      decision, crumples the bill, tries to hide it inside her 
      clenched fist.

      Frank empties another cash drawer.

      Finally, Carter stands over of Winona.  Looks her up and 
      down.

                                  CARTER (CONT D)
                          (nudges her with his boot)
                    Mmm-mmm, if you ain t a piece!  
                    Flip over, honey.  Let s see what 
                    you got for me.

      He takes her wallet, watch, necklace, drops them all into his 
      duffel bag.  

      Instead of continuing down the line of people, Carter stays 
      in front of Winona, grins.  

                                  CARTER (CONT D)
                    Let s see now -- you got anything 
                    else worth taking? 

      He runs his gun barrel slowly up her leg.  The front sight 
      hooks under the bottom of her skirt, starts to lift it up.  
      Almost involuntarily, she uses her unclenched hand to hold it 
      down.  Carter s gun stops moving.  He stares at her hard.

      RRRIIING!!!  Winona jumps as Frank s alarm clock sounds.  
      Carter doesn t react, holds his predatory stare.

      Behind the counter, Frank and Bobby stop what they re doing, 
      zip the duffel bag closed.  Frank grabs his alarm clock, 
      steps back around the counter as Bobby vaults back over it.

      Carter still hasn t moved--

                                  CARTER (CONT D)
                          (to Winona)
                    Open your hand.

      Frank and Bobby notice that he s not following them out.

                                  FRANK
                          (to Carter)
                    Let s go!  It s time!

                          (to Winona)
                    I won t ask again -- I ll just

                          (to Carter)
                    Come on, man!  Gotta go!

      Winona, out of options, opens her hand, shows Carter the bill 
      she was trying to hide.  His grin widens as we hear...

      SIRENS, distant but getting closer.

                                  BOBBY (CONT D)
                          (to Carter)
                    NOW NOW NOW!!!

      Carter reaches out, grabs the bill, shoves it in his pocket, 
      starts to turn away, then...

      WHAM! he stomps Winona in the face. 

      Carter races across the lobby toward his partners.  On the 
      way, he passes Pappas, the security guard, still sitting 
      ziptied on the floor.  Carter slows, raises his gun, shoots 
      Pappas in the leg.

      Pappas SCREAMS--

      Carter reaches his partners, who look to him for an 
        explanation.

      The SIRENS are close now.

                                  CARTER
                    Come on, fellas -- gotta go.

      The robbers jam out the door.

      Off Winona on the floor, hands pressed to her bruised face--

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - BULLPEN - DAY1717

      Jam-packed.  ND MARSHALS and ND FBI AGENTS interview the 
      tellers and bank customers.  Winona sits at Raylan s desk, 
      holds an ice pack against her head. 

      In the b.g., we can see Raylan, Art and FRANKEL (From 103, 
      the FBI Agent-in-Charge), talking animatedly, watching video 
      of the robbery from the bank security cameras.

      Winona looks up as Raylan comes out of the conference room, 
      makes his way toward her--

                                  RAYLAN
                    Sorry about that.

      Raylan looks at Winona s bruises, gently touches her face.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I don t get it -- all the times I

                    What to do when a guy breaks into

                    tries to grab you on the street.  
                    What to do-- 

      Winona wants to change the subject.

                          (re: the conference room)
                    Looked like there was some drama in 
                    there.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Guy with a gun wants your shit, you 
                    hand it over double-quick and just 
                    make sure not to look him in the 
                    eye.

                                  WINONA

      Raylan pulls himself together enough to sit down across from 
      her.  Winona tries her question again--

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    Art looks spun up -- he see 
                    something on the video?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He recognized one of them.

                                  WINONA
                    Which one?

                                  RAYLAN
                    The old guy with the oxygen tank -- 
                    name s Frank Reasoner.  Turns out 
                    thirty years ago he was on the Ten-
                      Most-Wanted.

                                  WINONA
                    How come I ve never heard of him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You have any idea how many people 
                    have been on that list?

                                  WINONA
                          (shrugs)
                    He was robbing banks back then?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Lots of them, apparently.  Had a 
                    house in Miami, one in the Bahamas, 
                    used to fly himself back and forth 
                    on his own King Air.

                                  WINONA
                    And what s he been doing for the 
                    last thirty years?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He s been doing thirty years.

      This stops her--

                                  WINONA
                    You re kidding.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Got compassionate parole June of 
                    last year.  Emphysema.  Wasn t 
                    expected to make it six months.

                    No shit...  I figured the oxygen 
                    was just for show.  Get the guard 
                    to turn his back.
                          (thinks a moment)
                    How about the other two?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Haven t ID d them yet.

                    hours, all I can think is what I d 
                    like to do to that man.

      Raylan s clearly been thinking about the same thing--

                                  RAYLAN
                    Yeah.

                                  WINONA
                          (quietly, half-joking)
                    You get the chance, shoot him in 
                    the nuts.

      They re distracted as TIM and RACHEL enter with JENNY (60s, 
      pretty), who looks nervous and bewildered.  They bring her 
      straight to the conference room.  Raylan stands. 

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Winona)
                    Sit tight.  I oughtta hear this.

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS1818

      As Raylan enters, Jenny is sitting at the table with Art and 
      Frankel, watching the surveillance video.  She s horrified.

                                    FRANKEL
                    Mrs. Reasoner, I hope you re not 
                    trying to deny that your husband is 
                    the man in that video.

                                  JENNY
                    No, I m not -- I mean, it looks 
                    like him -- I just...  I don t see 
                    how it s possible.

                                    FRANKEL
                    You don t see how it s possible a 
                    guy could get out of prison and go 
                    back to committing the same crime 
                    he went away for?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    20.

                    But Frank was a model inmate,  
                    preached in the prison church-- 

                                    FRANKEL
                    Mrs. Reasoner, we read the parole 
                    report.

                                  ART
                          (more gently)
                    What about since his release?  
                    What s he been like?

                                  JENNY
                    We ve been living the quiet life.  
                    Frank s a deacon at Calvary 
                    Baptist.  When he s not there, he s 
                    mostly on his computer -- his 
                    condition doesn t allow much 
                    physical exertion -- playing video 
                    games, searching the Interwebs for 
                    news about his old friends.  Even 
                    taught himself to use the Skype, 
                    lets us talk to the grandkids.  

      Frankel rolls his eyes.  Art looks at Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Mrs. Reasoner, do you recognize 
                    either of the other men?

                                  JENNY
                    I don t think so.
                          (has an idea)
                    Is it possible they forced him to 
                    join them, like in that movie?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Sorry to say, ma am, the man on 
                    that video looks like a willing 
                      participant.

                                  ART
                    Did Frank have any debts you know 
                    of, any big expenditures -- Medical 
                    bills, maybe?

      Jenny shakes her head  no.  

                                  JENNY
                    What if his brain was...  you know, 
                    messed up...  from lack of oxygen?

      Off the faces of the lawmen, skeptical to say the least--

      INT. BANK ROBBERS  MOTEL ROOM - DAY1919

      Our stick-up crew has just arrived.  While Frank sits on a 
      chair, inhales deeply from his cannula, Bobby and Carter dump 
      their duffel bags onto the bed.  The young men are clearly 
      both still in the grips of their adrenaline high.  Bobby 
      stacks the cash from the drawers, gives a WHOOP of delight at 
      the size of the haul.  Carter rips through the customers  
      wallets, pulls out cash and bank cards, tosses the empties on 
      the floor.

                                  BOBBY
                      Sonofabitch!  This is more than we 
                    thought even.  Add in what we ll 
                    get from the Versailles job--

                                  FRANK
                    We re not doing the Versailles job.

      This gets Bobby and Carter to stop counting, look up.

                                  BOBBY
                    You said always pull a second job.  
                    Doubles your money and keeps the 
                    law scrambling.

                                  FRANK
                    I also said only shoot when you got 
                    no other choice.

                                  CARTER
                    Hey, I heard you tell that old boy 
                    move and get shot.  Well, he moved.

                                  FRANK
                    And that woman you buttstroked? 

                                  CARTER
                    She tried to hold out on us.  Lucky 
                    I didn t shoot her in the face.

                                  FRANK

                    himself.

                          (to Bobby)
                    Hey, you ain t gotta beg him for 
                    shit.  You and me can handle the 
                      Versailles job.  Might even be a 
                    blessing not having some old lunger 
                    along--

      Carter is cut off as Frank stands up from the bed, grabs him, 
      slams him against the wall, presses a forearm against his 
      throat.

                                  FRANK
                    Now, I figure you did most of your 
                    growing up in those juvie-detention 
                    gladiator schools, never had anyone 
                    around to teach you manners.

      Carter doesn t answer.  With Frank s forearm pressed against 
      his windpipe, he can barely make a sound.

      Bobby stands next to Frank, careful not to touch him.

                                  BOBBY
                          (quietly)
                    Frank, you know Carter don t mean 
                    harm.  He just talks sometimes.

                                  FRANK
                          (to Carter)
                    I guess Bobby told you I used to 
                    preach at Lewisburg.  What he 
                    didn t tell you is before he got 
                    there I held the prison bench press 
                    record for my weight class. 

      Carter is starting to pass out.  Bobby changes tacks--

                                  BOBBY
                    Hey, Frank -- shouldn t you rest up 
                    a little before you make your call.

                                  FRANK
                          (to Carter)
                    Now, I don t know how close I could 
                    come to matching that record today.  
                    I do know every time I take a deep 
                    breath it feels like someone s 
                    pounding a red-hot rail spike into 
                    my chest, so--



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    23.

      He finally glances at Bobby for the first time.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                          (to Carter)
                    --next time you make me raise my 
                    voice, I m gonna take this oxygen 
                    tank and beat your ass to death 
                    with it.  Sound fair?

      Frank steps back.  Carter crumples to the floor, barely 
      conscious.  Bobby kneels to help him.

      Frank sits back down on the bed, takes a couple deep inhales 
      from his cannula, trying to catch his breath.  Then he 
      dissolves in a horrible coughing fit.  He covers his mouth 
      with his sleeve, endures spasm after choking spasm.

      When the coughing finally stops, Frank takes another deep 
      inhale from his cannula, looks down at his sleeve -- it s 
      flecked with blood. 

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY2020

      Tim comes in, sets down several pages full of serial numbers 
      on the table in front of Rachel.

                    You really expect to catch them

                    Nah.  Lag time s too long.  Most 
                    places don t scan more than once a 
                    day.  By the time we get a hit,

                    is a waste of your valuable time.

      They walk out of the conference room.  Winona takes a moment 
      to consider her options, fights to hold down her panic.  
      Then, she stands, steps out into--

      Raylan, at his desk, looks up as Winona makes her way over.

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - LOCKER ROOM - DAY2222

      As soon as Raylan locks the door behind them, Winona drops 
      her calm facade, lets her desperation show.  Raylan checks 
      the rest rooms to make sure they re alone. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    I keep hoping some boy-band reject
                    with a video camera s gonna jump 
                    out of one of the lockers, tell me 
                    I just got served.

                                  WINONA
                      I didn t...  I just wanted to see 
                    if it was real before I raised the 
                    alarm.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (trying it on for size)
                    You wanted to see if it was real?

                                  WINONA
                      Otherwise, it s not worth the 
                      headache...  paperwork...  Besides, 
                    I was just about to put it back--

                                  RAYLAN
                    So let me just...  you took one of 
                    the bills so you could make sure 
                    it s real...
                          (he lets that trail off)
                    Then you re in line at the bank, 
                    suddenly come to your senses.  But 
                    before you can leave to put the 
                    bill back where you found it, Frank 
                    Reasoner and his friends stick the 
                    place up, take it off you.  

                                  WINONA
                    Look, Raylan, I don t need you to 
                    tell me I did something stupid -- I 
                    know I did something stupid -- I 
                    just need you to tell me how big a 
                    deal it ll be when you catch these

                          (considering)
                    One bill?  They might assume it s a 
                      bookkeeping error.  Worst case, it 
                    pops, they come looking--

                    Who s  they,  Secret Service?  I

                          (off Raylan s nod)
                    You really think there s a chance 
                    they ll just ignore it?

      Before Raylan can answer, they re interrupted by the RATTLE 
      of someone trying the locker room doorknob, followed 
      immediately by the sound of someone POUNDING on the door.  A 
      voice comes through the door--

                      Reasoner s trying to get hold of

                    I have to go.

      INT. MARSHAL S OFFICE - BULLPEN - DAY2323

      Marshals, FBI agents and ND IT GUYS huddle around the desks, 
      staring intently at the computer screens.  In the b.g., in 
      Art s office, Jenny sits alone at the desk, stares at Art s 
      computer.  Across the desk from her, a young IT guy -- CHRIS, 
      20s -- kneels on Art s floor, fiddles with a cable he s run 
      between the bullpen and Art s mainframe.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    28.

      Raylan stands at his desk between Tim and Art.  Art is 
      distracted, watches Jenny and Chris, the kneeling IT guy, 
      scans the bullpen to make sure everyone is set up.  Raylan 
      tries to get Art s attention, tries to ignore Tim, who is 
      talking into his other ear--

                    You believe Art never learned how 
                    to program a VCR?  Now it s too 
                    late -- anyone under thirty s never 
                    even heard of a VCR.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Art, I need a word.

                                  ART
                    Raylan, you may have noticed things 
                    are a little busy at the moment.

                                  RAYLAN
                    When we get a line on these guys, I 
                    want to be first through the door.

                                  ART
                    Why, just  cause of the whack that 
                    punk gave your ex-wife?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Yes.

      Raylan s forthrightness gives Art a moment of pause.  He and 
      Raylan lock eyes.

                    Three seconds.

      Chris furiously makes one last adjustment.  Art notices that 
      Raylan is still staring at him.

                                  ART
                    Raylan, for Chr...  There s no way 
                    I m letting you on the entry team, 
                    but you can be there when it goes

                    smacks his head when you put him in

                    You know I am.

      But he doesn t sound certain.  Chris finishes his last tweak--

                    Ready, Chief.

      As Jenny answers, streaming video of Frank in the motel room 
      appears on all the Marshals  computer screens.  During the 
      following, we ll cut between Jenny talking and the Marshals 
      watching, but our only view of Frank will be on the screens.

                    I assume we re talking Marshals 
                     cause of me violating my 
                      compassionate parole.  Guess it 
                    could be FBI.  Anyway, whichever 
                    one of you s in charge, I need you 
                    to get on the line.

      Art walks into his office, stands next to Jenny where he can 
      be seen by the camera.

                    Frank, I--

                                  FRANK
                    No explanation needed, darlin .

                                  JENNY
                    I love you, Frank.  Please come 
                    back to me.

                                  FRANK
                    I love you, too, Jenny.  But now I 
                    need you to go on outside, let me 
                    have a word with the Chief.

      Jenny stands up uncertainly, walks out into the bullpen, 
      where Rachel guides her to a chair.

      Back in Art s office, Art takes Jenny s place behind his 
      desk.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)

                    Mr. Reasoner, let s talk about how 
                    we can end this business without 
                    anyone else getting hurt.

                                  FRANK
                    First of all, you saw the video -- 
                    saw I never meant for anyone to get 
                    hurt in the first place.

                                  ART
                    We saw it was the kid who stomped 
                    the woman and did the actual 
                    shooting, but you brought him 
                    along.  

                                  FRANK
                    Not my first choice, I promise you.

                    So, he s a friend of Bobby Green s?

                    don t have the best taste in

                    way I m coming in is if you ll 
                    promise to go easy on him.

                    Attorney, but I m sure we can work 
                    something out.  What about the

      Bobby and Carter check their weapons while Frank finishes 
      making what appears to be a  bomb vest  (although it will 
      later turn out to be made of road flares and not explosives).

      Frank attaches the last flare, appraises his handiwork.

                    be your ticket to a Paradise full 
                    of virgins.

      He slings the  bomb vest  over his shoulder, picks up his 
      oxygen tank, heads for the door.  Bobby zips up the duffel 
      bag, hoists it off the bed.  He and Carter start to follow 
      Frank out.  Suddenly--

      Frank brings the oxygen tank up hard into Carter s gut...  

      As Carter sags to his knees, Frank swings the tank around to 
      whack Bobby in the jaw.  Bobby goes down.  From his knees, 
      Carter looks up to find Frank pointing a gun in his face.

      Frank grimaces as though he s about to pull the trigger... 
      but instead, his arm appears to go numb.  He drops the gun, 
      starts flexing his hand.  Then he clutches his chest, doubles 
      over in agony.  

      Bobby and Carter stagger to their feet.  Carter looks down at 
      Frank, who s lying face-up on the floor, eyes wide open.

                    to death or leave you here drowning 
                    in the air like a landed fish.

      He raises his boot to start stomping.

                    I guess I ll see can we meet in the 
                    middle.

      But before he can bring his boot down, Bobby is pulling him 
      toward the door.

                    Let s go, man.  We let that armored 
                    car beat us to Versailles, they ll

                    time lock, have us shit-outta-luck.

      Carter let s himself be pulled away.  He and Bobby scoop up 
      the duffel and the guns and the  bomb vest.   Carter spits on 
      the floor next to Frank, then he heads out the door.  Bobby 
      looks down at Frank for a long moment, then he follows Carter 
      out.

                                        ACT FOUR

      EXT. VERSAILLES BANK - DAY3030

      Out of sight of the front of the bank, Raylan pulls up in his 
      car, gets out.  Without drawing his gun, he starts to slowly 
      approach the bank, eyeing the blind spots and all the parked 
      cars in case the bank robbers have a look-out outside.  He 
      looks through the bank window -- the distance and the angle 
      make it impossible for him to see the whole room, but he sees 
      enough CUSTOMERS standing in line or filling out deposit 
      slips to know there s no robbery in progress.

      In his peripheral vision, he sees another car pull up next to 
      his, sees TWO FBI AGENTS -- DAVI (40s) and BURNES (30s) -- 
      get out.  He goes to meet them. 

                                  DAVI
                          (to Raylan, quietly)
                    You re Givens?
                          (off his nod)
                      Special-Agent Davi, Special-Agent 
                    Burnes, FBI.

      They shake hands.  Davi looks at the bank.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (re: bank)
                    I took a look.  Couldn t get a 
                    visual on the whole room.  Patrons 
                    I could see looked calm, though. 

                                  BURNES
                    Maybe the call s bogus.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Last job, they waited in line for a 
                    while, cased the place first. 

                                  DAVI
                    So basically, someone needs to go 
                    in there, casual, take a look.

                                  RAYLAN
                    The old man s our fugitive.  I ll 
                    go in.

      Burnes and Davi share a look.

                                  BURNES
                      I understand your ex-wife was in 
                    the bank this morning, one of these 
                    guys tuned her up.

                                  DAVI
                    Maybe one of us should go.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Look, last few hours all I ve been 
                    doing is watching the security tape 
                    over and over.  If they re in 
                    there, I ll spot them soon s I step 
                    through the door.  You sure you can 
                    do that, make them before they make 
                    you?  
                          (off their silence)
                     Cause if you don t it s  Dog Day 
                      Afternoon. 

      The FBI men look at each other for a long moment.  Then--

                                  DAVI
                    We ll cover the perimeter, case 
                    they have back-up.

      Off Raylan--

      tells us he s not finding what he s looking for. *

      The entire Marshal s office is empty, except for JIMMY, a *

      INT. VERSAILLES BANK - DAY3131

      As Raylan enters, trying to look casual, gun holstered, not 
      wanting to set off a powder keg.  He looks around at the 
      customers, sees AN OLD MAN (70s) -- FRANK?

      No.  No oxygen tank.  Not him.  Raylan keeps looking...

      ...spots Carter Hayes and Bobby Green leaning against the 
      deposit slip counter. 

      Raylan catches the eye of the bank s ELDER SECURITY GUARD -- 
      HOWARD (60s), pulls back his jacket flap slightly to show 
      Howard his Marshal s badge.  We see Raylan cut his eyes 
      toward Bobby and Carter.  Without moving his head, Howard 
      follows Raylan s look, sees them, nods almost imperceptibly.  

      Raylan moves in toward Bobby and Carter, still doesn t draw.  
      As soon as they notice him--

                                  RAYLAN
                    Marshals Service, fellas.  Keep 
                    your hands where I can see them. 

      The customers freeze.  Bobby and Carter stare at Raylan. 

                                  CARTER
                    You all by yourself, Marshal? 
                          (re: Howard)
                    Hope you re not counting on your 
                    grandpa there for back-up.  Make me 
                    send him to Hell slightly before 
                    his time.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hands where I can see them and get 
                    down on your knees.  I won t tell 
                    you again.

      Carter opens his jacket, shows Raylan his  bomb vest. 

                                  CARTER
                          (grins)
                    I don t think so, Marshal.  We re 
                    waiting for the armored car from 
                    the Keeneland racetrack -- appears 
                    to be running a few minutes late.  
                    When it gets here, we ll take our 
                    money and be on our way.  
                      Otherwise, I m gonna have to huff 
                    and puff.

                                  BOBBY
                    Left him at the motel, dying.  He

                    Then who tipped us you were in 
                    here?

      Bobby thinks about this for a moment, takes a peak out the 
      window.

                                  BOBBY

                    Carter, don t be stupid -- Frank s 
                    alive!  Sonofabitch must ve faked 
                    the attack.

      Raylan s eyeing Carter s  bomb vest .

                                  RAYLAN
                    Carter, you know before I joined 
                    the Marshals, I worked down a mine?

                                  CARTER
                    How nice for you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Point is, I have some experience 
                    with explosives -- enough to know 
                    the difference between dynamite and 
                    road flares.

      Raylan takes a couple steps toward Carter.  They re almost 
      nose-to-nose.

                                  CARTER
                    What if you re wrong?

                    Marshal, sounds like you might be a

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not so violent I ever kicked an

      Carter drops his weapon.

                                  CARTER
                    She your girl?  Your wife?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Used to be.

                                  CARTER
                    Tell me something -- she taste as 
                    good as she looks?

      WHAM! -- Raylan punches Carter in the nose, slams him to the 
      floor, starts throwing cuffs on him.

      Agents Davi and Burnes rush in with ND KENTUCKY STATE COPS.

      Still sitting on Carter, Raylan turns to Bobby--

                                  RAYLAN
                    The money from this morning s

                    Frank must have it.  It was in the

      EXT. SMALL AIRSTRIP - DAY3434

      Frank stops his car at the edge of the runway.  He gets out, 
      oxygen bottle in one hand, duffel bag full of cash in the 
      other, starts painstakingly making his way toward a Cessna 
      parked next to a maintenance shed, maybe a hundred feet in 
      front of him.  He s about three-quarters of the way there 
      when he has to stop to catch his breath.  He takes a couple 
      deep inhales, starts walking again, stops again when he sees--

      ART step out from behind the maintenance shed.  He has a gun 
      in his hand but doesn t aim it, lets it hang by his side.

                                  FRANK
                    Guess you didn t believe I was 
                    giving myself up.

                                  ART
                    No one did.  But I also didn t 
                    believe that blaze-of-glory 
                    bullshit.  Then I found all those 
                    flight simulators on your computer, 
                      remembered you used to own a plane 
                    back when, figured you might be 
                    getting re-familiarized. 

                                  FRANK
                    Guess I would ve been better off 
                    with the young hotshot.

                                  ART
                    Guess so.

      Frank s hand wanders toward the gun in his waistband.  Art 
      notices--

                                  ART (CONT D)
                      I wouldn t,  less you re changing 
                    your mind about the blaze of glory.  
                    I used to teach firearms at Glynco.

                                  FRANK
                    That why you came here all by your 
                    lonesome  cause you wanted to give 
                    me the chance to  High Noon  it?

                                  ART
                    I came here by my lonesome,  cause 
                    the whole office is out trying to 
                    deal with Bobby Green and his 
                    friend with the bomb vest.  Isn t 
                    that why you sent them in there in 
                    the first place, dimed them to us?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    EPISODE 206 - "BLAZE OF GLORY" - 3RD WHITE REVISIONS - 2/08/11    44.

      Frank nods.  His hand stops moving.  He glances over his 
      shoulder at the car. 

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    Reasoner, my knees can t handle a 
                    foot chase -- you try to run, I m 
                    putting a bullet in that tank.  You 
                    remember the end of  Jaws ?

      Frank yanks the cannula out of his nose.

                                  FRANK
                      I remember.

      He drops the oxygen tank and makes a run for his car.

                                  ART
                    Aw, damn it!

      He starts hobbling after Frank.

      By the time Frank reaches his car, he s so winded and weak he 
      doesn t even have the strength to open the door.  He sits 
      down against the door, coughs blood, struggles to get his 
      breath.

      After what seems like a long time, Art catches up.  He s 
      brought Frank s oxygen tank with him.  He reaches down, takes 
      Frank s gun out of his waistband, then hands him the tank.

      Frank nods his thanks, puts the cannula back in his nose, 
      takes several deep breaths.

                                  FRANK
                    You try glucosamine supplements for 
                    those knees, Chief?

                                  ART
                    For a while.  Doctor made me stop.  
                    Worried it d give me diabetes.

                                  FRANK
                    And then you get side effects from 
                    treating the side effects -- no 
                    free rides in nature.

      Art agrees, but doesn t answer.

                                  ART
                    This was the plan from the jump, 
                    huh -- steal some cash, then dump 
                    your partners and fly off somewhere

      INT. RAYLAN S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT3838

      Winona paces, ice pack still against her head.  When she 
      hears a car pull in, she rushes to the window, looks out, 
      opens the door for Raylan.

                                  WINONA
                    How are we?

      He nods, opens his jacket, takes out three $100 bills.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Fifteen years ago, the Fed 
                      redesigned the hundred, changed the 
                    colors, made Franklin s portrait 
                    bigger.  If your bill was in the 
                    cage twenty years, means it was 
                    printed before all that.  

      He hands the bills to Winona. 

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    I went through every hundred in the 
                    bag.  These are the only ones where 
                    the portrait s still small.  

                                  WINONA
                    I...  don t know what to say.

      She throws her arms around him, starts planting kisses on 
      him, squeezes herself against him...  then GASPS in pain as 
      her bruised face presses into his chest.

      He steps back to get a look at the bruise.  Then he leans 
      down and kisses it softly.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hurts bad?

                                  WINONA
                    Only when I breathe.

                    It s not terrible, long s I stay on 
                    top of the Motrin.

      They stare at each other for a long moment.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You know we re gonna have to talk 
                    about it.  Sooner or later.

                                  WINONA
                    I know.  Can we sleep first?  Whole 
                      afternoon, I haven t been able to 
                    stop pacing.

                                  RAYLAN
                    All right.

      Raylan takes off his boots and then they climb into bed 
      together, both exhausted.  Raylan holds Winona from behind, 
      spooning her.
