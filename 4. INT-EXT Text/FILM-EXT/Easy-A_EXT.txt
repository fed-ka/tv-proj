Olive, uncomfortable, and Rhiannon, bored, sit around a
campfire with the Abernathys.
The couple stare at the fire with the same creepy smile
plastered on their faces.
There is an excruciatingly long and painful silence.
MR. ABERNATHY
Would you like a marshmallow, Olive
Oil?
5.
Mrs. Abernathy squeaks out a meek titter that is annoyingly
high-pitched.
MRS. ABERNATHY
Olive oil. That's funny. Very,
very funny.
OLIVE
(POLITELY)
No thank you, Mr. Abernathy.
MR. ABERNATHY
You can call me Mortimer, Olive
Branch.
Mrs. Abernathy titters again. Rhiannon rolls her eyes.
There is another awkwardly long silence, while the Abernathys
grin away at their fire.
Rhi sits, bored and uncomfortable, while her parents smile at
the campfire for an, again, awkwardly long moment.
8.
The Abernathys smile at the campfire, roasting WEINERS.
Rhiannon would rather be anywhere other than there.
MR. ABERNATHY
Wienie, Rhi?
Rhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie.
Rhiannon, excitedly, approaches Olive - dying to talk to her.
RHIANNON
Please tell me the rumors are true.
OLIVE
Yes, I'm a big whore.
RHIANNON
Not that one. The one where you
called Nina Howell a cunt and then
socked her in the nose.
OLIVE
It's not entirely true.
(Beat.)
Look, there's something I need to
tell you.
Rhiannon ignores her sincere attempt to confess.
RHIANNON
Yeah. Like the exact moment you
turned into such a BAD ASS? I
think I'm in LOVE with you.
(MORE)
28.
RHIANNON (CONT'D)
Please tell me you at least left a
mark on that scrunched-up face of
hers. POW! The cunt goes down for
the count!
OLIVE
(FRUSTRATED)
Never mind.
Rhiannon pulls her keys from her purse and they walk to her
car.
OLIVE (CONT'D)
I want a car.
RHIANNON
Please. It's my only perk. Trust
me.
They get into her car.
Marianne gives Micah a strictly PG-rated kiss against his
car. They're nauseatingly wholesome.
Olive is sitting in the office, dressed just as slutty as the
day before. A RED "A" sewn onto her top.
Marianne is behind the desk, sharpening pencils. After each
one, she observes the point with a scary satisfaction.
They exchange a few hateful glances at each other.
Mrs. Griffin pokes her head out of her office.
MRS. GRIFFIN
Hey Olive. Wanna come in?
67.
Olive, in no mood for this, drags herself up dramatically and
follows Mrs. Griffin into --
The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school,
with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on
wooden stakes that say things like:
EXPEL OLIVE!
EXODUS 20:14
SCHOOLS ARE FOR LEARNING, NOT FOR WHORING
OLIVE PENDERGHAST IS A WHORE
Rhi is among them, as riled up as any.
OLIVE (V.O.)
So, I guess I shouldn't be too
shocked that these people wanted my
diseased, home-wrecking ass out of
there.
The scene is a maelstrom of anger and piety.
Olive, upset at herself, gets into her car and drives off.
But just a few blocks down the street to --
She parks her car and gets out to try a different
denomination.
Micah's on his cell phone, anxiously talking to someone -
checking every few seconds to see if his mom is on her way
out.
MICAH
(Into the cell phone)
I didn't know what to say! I
panicked! I said I got it from
Olive Penderghast.
(Pause.)
I know, but what was I supposed to
say?! And then my mom called her
mom.
(Pause.)
No, not Olive's. Marianne's!
(Pause.)
I already tried to blame it on
their divorce, but my mom's not
buying it. I have to tell them.
(Pause.)
Okay. But I love you. I don't
care if you gave me chlamydia. I
LOVE YOU and I want to be with you
and no one can stop us. Not my
mother, not Marianne, not --
There's a dial tone.
Two LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD GIRLS (Olive and Rhiannon) chase a
LITTLE BOY all over the playground, desperate to kiss him.
They plot and plan to corner him, but he's just too fast.
OLIVE (V.O.)
It was really Rhiannon who had a
crush on him. She has since we
were kids.
Rhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the cheek.
Repulsed, he wipes his face.
Rhiannon and Olive high five each other.
As we saw before --
The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school,
with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on
wooden stakes that say things like:
EXPEL OLIVE!
EXODUS 20:14
SCHOOLS ARE FOR LEARNING, NOT FOR WHORING
OLIVE PENDERGHAST IS A WHORE
Rhi is among them, as riled up as any.
102.
Olive steps out of the school to see the demonstration. her
jaw drops.
OLIVE
Oh fuck me.
Things have gotten WAY too out of hand.
Olive runs out of the house and tackles him, kissing him -
in the front yard,
in broad daylight,
for the world to see.
FADE OUT.
OVER THE END CREDITS...
The basketball game is going on to an almost empty gymnasium.
MONTAGE
We see, from the perspective of their computer screens,
various reactions to Olive's webcast --
-- A proud Brandon watches from a hotel room. A MUSCULAR
BLACK GUY in a towel comes up behind him and kisses his neck.
-- The Abernathys watch with the same demented glee they
derive from watching anything.
-- Mrs. Griffin watches with the face of a person who's been
found out and who's days are numbered. They are.
110.
-- Rhi seems contemplative. Maybe it's because she's been in
love with Olive since grade school. Duh.
-- Evan, the fat kid, is doing jumping jacks while watching.
-- Melanie Bostic (the host of the party) watches with a
group of girls.
MELANIE
(SATISFIED)
Told you guys. Pay up.
-- Marianne feels regret. But a little bit impressed.
-- Mr. Griffin is proud of her.
-- Micah watches in his dark bedroom.
MICAH'S GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
Micah? What are you doing in
there?
(STERNLY)
You had better not be on the sin-
ternet.
-- Rosemary and Dill are too busy making out to watch.
-- Anson has a jar of vaseline and is ready to jerk off, but
is upset that she isn't `exposing herself' in the
aforementioned way.
ANSON
(TO HIMSELF)
I thought she was going to take her
clothes off.
Olive and Todd are still kissing on the lawn underneath the
stars.
FADE OUT.
