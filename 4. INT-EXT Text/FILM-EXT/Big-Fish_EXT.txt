A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES
as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.
EDWARD
Now, I'd tried everything on it:
worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut
butter-and-cheese. But on that day I
had a revelation: if that fish was
the ghost of a thief, the usual bait
wasn't going to work. I would have
to use something he truly desired.
Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.
LITTLE BRAVE
(confused)
Your finger?
Edward slips his ring off.
EDWARD
Gold.
While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks
bored. He's heard this story before.
EDWARD
I tied my ring to the strongest line
they made -- strong enough to hold
up a bridge, they said, if just for
a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.
We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.
Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more
heated. Both men are a little drunk.
EDWARD
What, a father's not allowed to talk
about his son?
WILL
(disbelieving)
I am a footnote in that story. I am
the context for your great adventure.
Which never happened! Incidentally!
You were selling novelty products in
Wichita the day I was born.
EDWARD
(shaking his head)
Jesus Christ.
WILL
Friend of yours? Did you help him
out of a bind?
EDWARD
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that
story.
WILL
No Dad, they don't. I do not like
the story. Not anymore, not after a
thousand times. I know all the
punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as
well as you can.
(closer)
For one night, one night in your
entire life, the universe does not
revolve around Edward Bloom. It
revolves around me and my wife. How
can you not understand that?
A long beat, then...
EDWARD
(low)
Sorry to embarrass you.
Will won't let him get the last word.
WILL
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.
ANGLE ON Edward. Fine. A hand to wave, enough of you.
He walks away.
ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger. It's then
we FREEZE FRAME.
WILL (V.O.)
After that night, I didn't speak to
my father again for three years.
Edward swims laps in the family pool. He's born to the water.
WILL (V.O.)
The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father, and I don't
think he saw anything of himself in
me. We were like strangers who knew
each other very well.
Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.
WILL (V.O.)
In telling the story of my father's
life, it's impossible to separate
the fact from the fiction, the man
from the myth. The best I can do is
to tell it the way he told me.
We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught
in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something
changes.
Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM,
20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not
just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world
had conspired to create him.
WILL (V.O.)
It doesn't always make sense, and
most of it never happened.
Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water,
grabbing hold of
THE BEAST.
He brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the
eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.
WILL (V.O.)
But that's what kind of story this
is.
Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back
into the water with a splash.
TITLE OVER:
BIG FISH
The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive. The moon hangs
low, casting long shadows.
Five kids walk past in silhouette. Four have flashlights on.
The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).
EDWARD
Zacky, turn your flashlight on!
ZACKY
I don't got any batteries!
Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10. His brother DON PRICE is 12,
and a lot bigger than the others.
DON PRICE
Then why'd you bring it?
ZACKY
I don't want to be in the swamp with
a witch and no flashlight.
WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a
sharecropper. Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to
be there.
EDWARD
Is it true she got a glass eye?
WILBUR FREELY
I heard she got it from Gypsies.
EDWARD
What's a Gypsy?
ZACKY
Your momma's a Gypsy.
DON PRICE
Your momma's a bitch.
RUTHIE
You shouldn't swear. There's ladies
present.
DON PRICE
Shit.
ZACKY
Damn.
WILBUR FREELY
Screw.
EDWARD
(whispering)
Turn off your flashlights! She'll
see 'em.
MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates
of...
ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
Now, it's common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch,
if only to eat misbehaving children
and the occasional puppy who wanders
into her yard. Witches use those
bones to cast spells and curses that
make the land infertile.
We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically
creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie
gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to
fly over it.
In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows
what is lurking in the shadows?
ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
Yet of the all the witches in Alabama,
there was one who was the most feared.
For she had one glass eye, which was
said to contain mystical powers.
We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.
WILBUR FREELY
I hear if you look right at it, you
can see how you're gonna die.
EDWARD
That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's
not even a real witch.
DON PRICE
You're so sure, why don't you go in
and get that eye? I heard she keeps
it in a box on her nighttable.
Edward looks back at the spooky house.
DON PRICE
Or are you too scared?
EDWARD
I'll go in right now and get that
eye.
DON PRICE
Then do it.
EDWARD
Fine, I will.
DON PRICE
Fine, you do it.
EDWARD
Fine, I'm doing it.
He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.
RUTHIE
Edward, don't!
WILBUR FREELY
She'll make soap out of you!
(to Ruthie)
That's what she does, she makes soap
out of people.
Edward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told,
Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.
Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement.
They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don
holds him by the collar.
Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front
door. Anything could jump out of them.
He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he
continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker.
Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.
The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look
like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and
closer before he finally
RINGS THE DOORBELL.
Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with
a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead
for years, but too stubborn to lie down.
EDWARD
(calm and
straightforward)
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and
there's some folks'd like to see
your eye.
Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more
convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the
gate.
DON PRICE
You get the eye?
EDWARD
I brought it.
DON PRICE
(dubious)
Let's see it.
The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping
up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left
eye, it shines with a hellish glow.
We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.
CUT TO:
An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing
a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls.
Dead.
We RUSH IN on Don Price.
CUT TO:
Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears
in his eyes.
ZACKY
I saw how I was gonna die. I was
old, and I fell.
DON PRICE
I wasn't old at all.
The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old
Woman, Edward smiles.
Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but
curiosity gets the better of him.
EDWARD
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.
The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.
EDWARD
I mean, on one hand, if dying was
all you thought about, it could kind
of screw you up. But it could kind
of help you, couldn't it? Because
you'd know that everything else you
can survive.
The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.
EDWARD
I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.
The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his.
And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks
into The Eye.
This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he
witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and
amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys.
His future has something strange in store.
EDWARD
Huh. That's how I go?
The Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns
and leaves.
ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
From that moment on, I no longer
feared death. And for that, I was as
good as immortal.
As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.
MATCH CUT TO:
The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the
porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53),
surprised and a little annoyed.
SANDRA
How did you get here?
WILL
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that
big really.
SANDRA
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up
at the airport.
WILL
We rented a car.
SANDRA
(simply)
You didn't need to do that. You just
didn't.
A beat. Starting over...
WILL
Hi, Mom.
He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son
tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth --
strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.
SANDRA
I'm so glad you're here.
That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-
in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --
SANDRA
You shouldn't have flown. But...
They hug.
JOSEPHINE
It's good to see you. You look
beautiful.
It's not flattery. It's the truth.
SANDRA
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
JOSEPHINE
Yes.
SANDRA
Down the hall on the right. The door
sticks. You have to really pull it.
Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice.
Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra
follows him.
Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the
first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for
the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are
playing on the street.
WILL
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
SANDRA
He's up with your father.
Heading back to the house...
WILL
How is he?
SANDRA
He's impossible. He won't eat. And
because he won't eat, he gets weaker.
And because he's weaker, he doesn't
want to eat.
WILL
How much time does he have left?
SANDRA
You don't talk about those things.
Not yet.
The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run. The
crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds
the bases.
Although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first
real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we'll follow from
roughly the ages of 18 to 30.
EDWARD (V.O.)
As soon as my bones had settled in
their adult configuration, I set
upon my plan to make a bigger place
for myself in Ashton.
SINGLE SHOTS: Football hero Edward leads his team to victory.
On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret
love:
GIRL
Edward Bloom!
The other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement. Don Price looks over,
glowers.
SINGLE SHOT: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We LOOK UP
to see who's pushing it, but it's not Edward. It's one of
his teenage EMPLOYEES.
Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, "Bloom
Landscaping." He has workers on every lawn.
He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.
Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.
Edward accepts his diploma. The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.
EDWARD (V.O.)
I was the biggest thing Ashton had
ever seen. Until one day, a stranger
arrived.
As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a
massive hole punched through the side of a barn. It's roughly
the shape of man, but no human could be that large.
Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them. They
BLEAT in panic as
TWO OVERSIZED HANDS
reach in and scoop them up. Their protests continue as they're
carried away, one under each arm. We still haven't seen the
full stranger.
A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns.
Amid the crowd we see Don Price.
SHARECROPPER
He ate an entire cornfield!
LITTLE GIRL
He ate my dog!
HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER
If you ain't gonna stop him Mayor,
we will!
MAYOR
I won't have mob violence in this
town. Now, has someone tried talking
to him?
SOME FARMER
You can't reason with 'im!
SHEPHARD
He's a monster!
Agreement from the crowd. And then...
A VOICE (O.S.)
I'll do it.
Everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal
none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers.
EDWARD
I'll talk to him. See if I can get
him to move on.
MAYOR
Son, that creature could crush you
without trying.
EDWARD
Trust me, he'll have to try.
Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching
the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the
remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked
clean.
In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:
EDWARD
Hello!
There's no answer.
EDWARD
My name is Edward Bloom! I want to
talk to you!
From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:
VOICE (O.S.)
GO AWAY!
The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair
back.
EDWARD
I'm not going anywhere until you
show yourself.
A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming. Edward
braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's
going to take.
As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake. Even
Edward starts to worry. Just how big is this guy?
EDWARD (V.O.)
Armed with the foreknowledge of my
own death, I knew the giant couldn't
kill me. All the same, I preferred
to keep my bones unbroken.
Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.
Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. Hunched over, he slams
into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.
KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen. Not
just tall, but massive. He's completely feral, with a beard
to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains
of his clothes are ragged and muddy. God knows what's living
in his matted hair.
Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his
rock, but it just bounces off. The giant didn't even notice
it.
KARL
Why are you here?
Edward ponders the best response, settling on...
EDWARD
So you can eat me. The town decided
to send a human sacrifice, and I
volunteered.
Karl's eyes narrow, confused. Edward stands up.
EDWARD
My arms are a little stringy, but
there's some good eating on my legs.
I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them
myself.
(beat)
So I guess, just, if you could get
it over with quick. Because I'm not
much for pain, really.
Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten.
Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.
After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see
what the giant is doing. Relieved to see he's not licking
his chops --
EDWARD
Look, I can't go back. I'm a human
sacrifice. If I go back, everyone
will think I'm a coward. And I'd
rather be dinner than a coward.
Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.
EDWARD
Here, start with my hand. It'll be
an appetizer.
Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth. But
the giant spits it back out.
KARL
I don't want to eat you. I don't
want to eat anybody. It's just I get
so hungry. I'm too big.
And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak --
a giant man, but in the end, just a man.
Edward takes a seat beside him.
EDWARD
Did you ever think maybe you're not
too big? Maybe this town's just too
small. I mean, look at it.
Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town
in a tiny valley.
EDWARD
Hardly two stories in the whole place.
Now I've heard in real cities, they've
got buildings so tall you can't even
see the tops of 'em.
KARL
Really?
EDWARD
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got
all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat
a lot, can't you?
KARL
I can.
EDWARD
So why are you wasting your time in
a small town? You're a big man. You
should be in the big city.
Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion --
KARL
You're just trying to get me to leave,
aren't you? That's why they sent you
here.
EDWARD
What's your name, Giant?
KARL
Karl.
EDWARD
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do
want you to leave, Karl. But I want
to leave with you.
(closer)
You think this town is too small for
you, well, it's too small for a man
of my ambition. I can't see staying
here a day longer.
KARL
You don't like it?
EDWARD
I love every square inch of it. But
I can feel the edges closing in on
me. A man's life can only grow to a
certain size in a place like this.
(beat)
So what do you say? Join me?
Karl thinks a moment. Then --
KARL
Okay.
EDWARD
Okay.
They shake on it.
EDWARD
Now first, we gotta get you ready
for the city.
IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers,
while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.
Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the
good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and
Karl.
There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.
MAYOR
(loudly, for the crowd)
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton,
it's with a heavy heart we see you
go. But take with you this Key to
the City, and know that any time you
want to come back, all our doors are
open to you.
Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his
neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start
walking, waving as they go.
Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward
go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he
could crush Edward.
Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or
shake his hand.
EDWARD (V.O.)
That afternoon as I left Ashton,
everyone seemed to have advice.
VARIOUS TOWNFOLK
Find yourself a nice girl! Don't
trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your
pride, Edward Bloom!
EDWARD (V.O.)
But there was one person whose counsel
I held above all others.
As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with
THE OLD WOMAN.
The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been
cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper
something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear
her voice.
EDWARD (V.O.)
She said that the biggest fish in
the river gets that way by never
being caught.
The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.
EDWARD
(to the Old Woman)
Okay. Thanks.
Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off,
somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.
KARL
What did she say?
EDWARD
Beats me.
We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking
out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly
possessions.
EDWARD (V.O.)
There were two roads out of Ashton,
a new one which was paved, and an
older one that wasn't. People didn't
use the old road anymore, and it had
developed the reputation of being
haunted.
Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers
left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road
is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.
EDWARD (V.O.)
Since I had no intention of ever
returning to Ashton, this seemed as
good a time as any to find out what
lay down that old road.
Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.
KARL
You know anyone's who's taken it?
EDWARD
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He
was going to Paris, France. He must
have liked it, because no one ever
heard from him again.
(beat)
Tell you what. You take the other
way and I'll cut through here. Meet
you on the far side.
A little paranoid...
KARL
You're not trying to run away?
EDWARD
Just to be sure, you can take my
pack.
Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.
The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is
still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.
Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's
a day meant for whistling.
The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight
break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the
air. Still, Edward WHISTLES.
Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny
vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time,
he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is
dead quiet.
He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It
would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on.
He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch
on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR.
FURTHER ALONG
A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING
BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at
them.
Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right
out of his hands.
EDWARD
You stupid sonofa...
He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The
stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm
roars out.
Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.
Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.
A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up.
Reads it:
WARNING!
JUMPING SPIDERS!
Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with
thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.
EDWARD (V.O.)
There comes a point where a reasonable
man will swallow his pride and admit
he's made a terrible mistake. The
truth is, I was never a reasonable
man.
Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.
EDWARD
And what I recalled of Sunday School
was that the more difficult something
became, the more rewarding it was in
the end.
Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs
off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in
his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he
still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.
At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty
and comforting.
Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton --
with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling
from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their
laces tied together.
He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"
It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy,
Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is
old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group
of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach.
Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy.
What's more, all of these people are barefoot.
MAN'S VOICE
Friend!
A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store
to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest
thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard.
BEAMEN
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
EDWARD
Edward Bloom.
Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips
forward a few pages. Still looking...
BEAMEN
Bloom like a flower?
EDWARD
Yes.
BEAMEN
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom.
We weren't expecting you yet.
Still confused...
EDWARD
You were expecting me?
BEAMEN
Not yet.
A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:
MILDRED
You must have taken a shortcut.
EDWARD
I did. It nearly killed me.
BEAMEN
Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And
truthfully, the long way is easier,
but it's longer.
MILDRED
Much longer.
BEAMEN
And you're here now, and that's what
matters.
Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering
around to look at the handsome stranger.
EDWARD
What is this place?
BEAMEN
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret
in Alabama. Says here you're from
Ashton, right? Last person we had
from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
EDWARD
The poet? What ever happened to him?
BEAMEN
He's still here. Let me buy you a
drink. I'll tell you all about it.
Hell, I'll have him tell you.
EDWARD
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm
already running late.
He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's
laughing.
BEAMEN
Son, I already told you. You're early.
As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching
the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the
power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever
getting them down.
The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is
confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his
hand.
Still focused on his shoes...
EDWARD
Wait! I need those!
NORTHER WINSLOW
There is no softer ground than town.
MILDRED
That rhymes!
BEAMEN
He is our poet laureate.
The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward...
EDWARD (V.O.)
Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit
places that seem instantly familiar,
filled with friends you've never
met.
Edward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out.
Thousands of them.
EDWARD (V.O.)
A man might travel his entire life
and never find a place so inviting.
My journey had scarcely begun, and I
had arrived.
Norther hands him his noteboook.
NORTHER WINSLOW
I've been working on this poem for
12 years.
EDWARD
Really.
NORTHER WINSLOW
There's a lot of expectation. I don't
want to disappoint my fans.
A beat.
EDWARD
It's only three lines long.
Norther grabs his notebook back.
NORTHER WINSLOW
This is why you don't show work in
progress.
EDWARD
Norther, do you ever regret not making
it to Paris?
NORTHER WINSLOW
I can't imagine any place better
than here.
EDWARD
You're a poet. You oughta be able
to. And maybe if you'd seen more,
you could.
Norther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook.
By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the
water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City
dangles around his neck.
He stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles.
It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.
No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming
underwater. We never see her face.
She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward,
squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his
presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's
seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he
frighten her away.
Then he sees the snake.
It's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water,
its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.
There's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward
dives in. He swims as hard as can,
GRABBING THE SNAKE
just as it's about to strike.
The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified
that a man is coming at her.
EDWARD
No, it's okay! I got it. I got the
snake.
As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in
his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common
stick. And a non-threatening one at that.
While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover
that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her
face.
EDWARD
Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?!
Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she
never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what
tricks his eyes are playing on him.
A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
There's leeches in there!
Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching
him.
EDWARD
Did you see that woman?
JENNY
What did she look like?
EDWARD
Well, she... uh...
JENNY
Was she nekkid?
Embarrassed to admit it...
EDWARD
Yeah.
JENNY
(matter-of-fact)
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No
one ever catches her.
Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow
up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank.
JENNY (CONT'D)
Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent
people. My daddy said it looked like
the coon dog he had when he was kid,
back from the dead.
Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He
pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging
to his skin.
EDWARD
Shoot.
He starts to work pulling them off.
Edward and Jenny walk back.
JENNY
How old are you?
EDWARD
Eighteen.
JENNY
I'm eight. That means when I'm
eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm
28, you'll only be 38.
EDWARD
(a little wary)
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
JENNY
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And
that's not much difference at all.
Eager to get off this subject...
EDWARD
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?
As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown"
has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables
across the street, and a small stage has been built at one
end to hold FIDDLERS.
The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen,
Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed
him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.
The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and
complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants
to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a
stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast.
Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.
Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.
Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear
over the MUSIC.
MILDRED
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.
EDWARD
(not hearing)
What?
MILDRED
I said you're quite a catch!
Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of
the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.
EDWARD
I have to leave. Tonight.
BEAMEN
Why?
EDWARD
This town is everything a man could
ask for. And if I were to end up
here, I'd consider myself lucky. But
the fact is, I'm not ready to end up
anywhere.
BEAMEN
No one's ever left.
JENNY
How are you gonna make it without
your shoes?
EDWARD
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople
stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.
Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.
BEAMEN
(calling after him)
You won't find a better place!
EDWARD
I don't expect to.
Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could.
JENNY
Promise me you'll come back.
EDWARD
I promise. Someday. When I'm really
supposed to.
It's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps
walking.
VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet.
It's horrible. Almost unendurable.
And then it gets worse.
The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be
the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood
CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying
to block him.
Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for
his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab
another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now
all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes
towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.
EDWARD (V.O.)
As difficult as it was to reach
Spectre, I was fated to get there
eventually. After all, no man can
avoid reaching the end of his life.
As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the
City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally
breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud.
Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees
have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush
him.
He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.
EDWARD
And then I realized, this wasn't the
end of my life.
With a sudden calm...
EDWARD
(aloud)
This isn't how I die.
Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back
where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn
in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING.
His bare foot steps onto asphalt.
A DEEP VOICE
Friend!
Edward turns to see
KARL
to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.
KARL
What happened to your shoes?
Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.
EDWARD
They got ahead of me.
With that, the men start walking down the larger road.
CROSSFADE TO:
...where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment
in an Alabama field. To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish,
halfway through a bag of peanuts. He's still carrying the
backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip
through Spectre.
EDWARD (V.O.)
I had just left Ashton, and was on
my way to discover my destiny. Not
knowing what that would be exactly,
I explored every opportunity that
presented itself.
Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.
Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his
fated love. Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running
down the rows.
CROSSFADE TO:
THE EMPTY LOT
Colossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops
and lets him climb in back.
As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll
never find that girl, the love of his life.
His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling
amusement park ride.
EDWARD (V.O.)
The only thing that kept me going
was the promise of meeting the girl
who would be my wife.
Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the
spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the
gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the
air.
Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords,
falling in the mud.
His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he's
unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds.
To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles. He dodges
four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.
He catches his breath, lucky.
Then a half-blind OLD WOMAN pulls her trigger, hitting him
in the shoulder.
Karl the Giant bandages Edward's arm as well as he can. Amos
is walking past.
EDWARD
Mr. Calloway! It's been a month today.
Amos stops, looks at the young man. Finally...
AMOS
This girl, the love of your life.
Her favorite flower is daffodils.
He walks away. We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the
concept.
EDWARD
Daffodils.
(to Karl)
Daffodils!
Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper,
and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot.
Not just that, there's MOANING coming from inside.
But Edward KNOCKS anyway.
EDWARD
Mr. Calloway! It's Edward Bloom. I
need to talk to you.
Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the
door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck.
Edward turns the knob.
Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a
massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green
glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.
Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his
throat.
Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but
the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold
on tight.
Entwined, they roll across the dirt. The other nearby CARNIES
scatter for cover. Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of
his clown suit. Loads a silver bullet.
Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls
to his feet.
The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready
for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming
the revolver at the dog.
At the last moment...
EDWARD
No, wait!
Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches
Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.
The carnies GASP.
Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward,
who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of
weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog,
ready to strike it.
Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces
excitedly, ready to play fetch.
Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he
can. The dog bounds after it,
SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.
It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it
drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth.
EDWARD
It was that night I discovered that
most things you consider evil or
wicked are simply lonely, and lacking
in the social niceties.
Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new
direction.
TRANSITION TO:
Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the
stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's
gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes
concerned.
He follows it into the woods.
Edward shakes Karl's giant hand. They hug.
EDWARD (V.O.)
After saying my goodbyes, I hopped
three trains to get to Auburn that
afternoon.
We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking
his head in the fountain.
He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out
of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative
dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era.
Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-
open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG
WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't
see.
Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the
woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's
effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.
He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs,
nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on.
EDWARD
You don't know me, but my name is
Edward Bloom and I am in love with
you. I've spent the last three years
working to find out who you are.
I've been shot and stabbed and
trampled a few times, had my ribs
broken twice, but it's all worth it
to see you here, now, and to finally
get to talk to you. Because I am
destined to marry you. I knew that
from the first moment I saw you at
the circus. And I know it now more
than ever.
ON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say
is...
SANDRA
I'm sorry.
EDWARD
Don't need to apologize to me. I
mean, I'm the luckiest person you're
going to find today...
She puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger,
we see a diamond.
SANDRA
No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be
married.
ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress
the reaction, put on a brave front.
EDWARD
Oh.
SANDRA
But you're wrong. I do know you, at
least by reputation. Edward Bloom
from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged
to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He
was a few years older than you.
FLASHCUTS TO:
Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward.
VARIOUS H.S. ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS 93
Recapping earlier football, baseball and basketball
highlights, we find Edward beats Don every time.
THE STREET CORNER / ASHTON PARADE
A smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves
town.
BACK TO:
Edward is dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster...
EDWARD
Well. Congratulations. I'm sorry to
have bothered you.
He turns and walks down the front steps.
She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely
horrible for what's happened. But eventually she goes back
inside. We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters
get to the bottom of this.
SANDRA
Stop it. It's not funny. That poor
boy.
We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form.
EDWARD (V.O.)
Fate has a cruel way of circling
around on you. After all this work
to leave Ashton, the girl I loved
was now engaged to one of its biggest
jerks.
He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the
background.
EDWARD (V.O.)
There's a time when a man needs to
fight, and a time when he needs to
accept that his destiny is lost,
that the ship has sailed, and that
only a fool would continue.
A beat. Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority
house.
EDWARD (V.O.)
The truth is, I've always been a
fool.
We CIRCLE as he shouts:
EDWARD
Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I
am going to marry you!
Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving.
We look up to the blue sky, where a giant sky-written heart
floats in the wind.
At her Sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the
second-story window to find the lawn filled with
TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS.
Edward stands amid the sea of flowers. He's waited there six
hours.
Sandra walks out to him. She's smiling, confused, joyful and
scared. All down Greek Street, STUDENTS are coming out to
see the display.
SANDRA
Daffodils?
EDWARD
They're your favorite flower.
SANDRA
How did you get so many?
EDWARD
I called everywhere in five states
and explained this was the only way
I could get my wife to marry me.
Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek. She wipes
it off.
SANDRA
You don't even know me.
EDWARD
I have the rest of my life to find
out.
From down the street...
A MAN'S VOICE
Sandra!
SANDRA
It's Don. Promise me you won't hurt
him.
EDWARD
If that's what you want, I swear to
it.
The adult DON PRICE arrives. He's 230 pounds of football-
playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle. And he's
pissed.
A gang of his BROTHERS walk behind him.
DON PRICE
Bloom!
EDWARD
Don.
DON PRICE
What the hell are you doing? This is
my girl. Mine!
EDWARD
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Don Price decks him, knocking him down. Edward gets right
back up, but makes no move to defend himself.
Unfazed, Don slugs him again.
SANDRA
Stop it!
DON PRICE
(ignoring)
What the matter, Bloom? Too scared
to fight back?
EDWARD
I promised I wouldn't.
A beat. Don shrugs, fine. Then proceeds to kick Edward's ass
nine ways to Sunday.
EDWARD (V.O.)
While I took the beating of a
lifetime, it was Don Price who was
ultimately defeated.
As the ass-whupping continues, we
INTERCUT WITH:
The same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected
in The Eye.
RETURNING BACK TO:
The thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back
to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.
SANDRA
Don!
Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.
Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible
AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don's brothers.
SANDRA
I will never marry you.
A beat. Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.
Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting
for the next punch. Where is it? What's going on?
DON PRICE
What. You love this guy?
SANDRA
He's almost a stranger and I prefer
him to you.
She hands him the ring. Another beat, then Don storms off.
But not before decking Edward one last time.
Sandra leans over Edward's broken body. His head lies on the
daffodils.
SANDRA
How can I convince you to stop?
EDWARD
Go out with me.
He smiles, his teeth bloody.
SANDRA
Okay.
As the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP
above the flowered battlefield.
EDWARD (V.O.)
As it turned out, Sandra was able to
keep her same date at the chapel.
Only the groom had changed.
As the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly...
CUT TO:
A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the
equivalent of a U.S.O. show.
A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet.
We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every
act is fundamentally the same.
The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's
finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in.
The Emcee makes a "shoot him in the neck" motion to one of
the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.
We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage.
He can't steer. He's helpless.
But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage.
The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. It's just enough
cover for Edward to remain unseen.
He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage.
He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the
curtain goes up. Edward looks out at the sea of excited
soldiers. Every one of them would kill him. He's the legless
cricket left on the anthill.
The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's
as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see.
She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a
knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their
feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.
UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER.
The two men begin to SCUFFLE.
MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song. Ping sings melody while an
off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.
PING
Sometimes a girl can feel so alone
Without a lover to call her own.
Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to
explode.
Wants to grab the first man she sees
and tear off his clothes.
A ROAR from the soldiers. She knows what they want.
Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of
the catwalk, sliding down it to end up
BACKSTAGE.
His determined opponent follows him down.
PING (CONT'D)
But she won't.
No, she can't.
She needs a special special different
unusual man.
Because that girl,
Who looks like me,
She has wants, but she has needs.
PING
(speaking)
Any of you got needs?
The soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers.
Backstage, the two men are still fighting.
PING
(chorus)
I've had twice the adventure,
Cried double the tears.
Two times the bad times in half the
years.
I need a strong man, because I've
got
Twice the love to give.
For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was
standing in profile. Ping is one-half of
SIAMESE TWINS.
Her identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all
this time. They are two separate women who join at the waist,
one set of perfect legs beneath them.
Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take. It
costs him a punch to the jaw.
PING
Say hello, Jing.
JING
Hello Jing.
PING
(to the crowd)
I'm Ping. She's Jing. She's the good
one.
(closer)
I'm the bad one.
As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the
fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.
As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final
pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches,
their backs forming the curves.
Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.
The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving.
The curtain slowly lowers, revealing
EDWARD'S PARACHUTE.
The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE. The Emcee
yells for the Guards to search.
ON STAGE
Ping has no idea what's happening. Jing reaches into her
cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses.
Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.
EDWARD (V.O.)
And so the twins and I began our
arduous journey halfway around the
world. Unfortunately, there was no
way to send a message back to America.
A black car pulls up. Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.
EDWARD (V.O.)
And so it was no surprise that the
Army believed I was dead.
Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. The pain of her shout
makes church bells RING.
Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a
tunnel of fabric.
EDWARD (V.O.)
After four months, Sandra had gotten
over the worst of the nightmares.
When the phone rang, she didn't think
it was somehow me calling her. When
a car drove past, she didn't get up
to check out the window.
Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see
A MAN'S SILHOUETTE
on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow
ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the
breeze. She knows it can't be him. He's dead.
She turns away. With all the strength she can gather, she
hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.
Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing
before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real.
It is destiny.
Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him.
CROSSFADE TO:
BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
filters through soft sheets. We're under the covers, where a
man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. A beat,
then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be
JOSEPHINE.
She blinks slowly, just waking up. Will is watching her.
He's been up for a while. We are actually...
With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out
of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long
since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface,
slime covering the cemented rocks.
Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's
surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which
disappears into the murky water.
A beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He
casually walks away.
On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to
the crowd.
EDWARD
I've travelled from Tennessee to
Timbuktu, and if there's one thing
people have in common, is we could
all use a hand around the house.
Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a
metal lava lamp. Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five
fingers and a thumb. This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)
EDWARD
Why, with this product you can...
QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:
EDWARD
Open a jar. Open a letter. Scratch
yourself while wearing mittens. Hold
a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog
away from kittens. It's strong enough,
you can do a handstand with no hands
at all.
Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his
entire weight on it. The crowd APPLAUDS.
EDWARD
You can use it to point out important
information. Or dangers. Or beautiful
women.
The hand points a finger at an HEAVYSET MAN IN OVERALLS.
EDWARD
We're still working on that one.
The crowd LAUGHS.
Edward drives, his hand out in the wind.
EDWARD (V.O.)
Soon I added other products, and
other cities, until my territory
stretched from the coast to western
Texas.
Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as
ever.
EDWARD (V.O.)
I could be gone for weeks at a time.
But every other Friday, I'd put all
the money I'd made into an account
set aside for a proper house with a
white picket fence.
Establishing this Texas institution, we come...
Norther leans in the driver's side window.
NORTHER WINSLOW
I should go to Wall Street. That's
where all the money is.
Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.
EDWARD (V.O.)
I knew then that while my days as a
criminal were over, Norther's were
just beginning.
The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the
last moment, Norther calls out:
NORTHER WINSLOW
Edward, thank you for the hand!
He's talking about his Hand Around the House. We HOLD ON
Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.
EDWARD (V.O.)
When Norther made his first million
dollars, he sent me a check for ten
thousand. I protested, but he said
it was my fee as his career advisor.
Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to
greet Edward, just returned from another trip.
EDWARD (V.O.)
Ten thousand dollars is no fortune
to most men. But it was enough to
buy my wife a proper house with a
white picket fence.
We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood.
Edward kisses his wife.
EDWARD (V.O.)
And for that, it was all the riches
a man could ever want.
Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.
TRANSITION TO:
Will's rental car drives past a sign reading, "Ashton, 10
miles."
Will talks to the ATTENDANT, who points him in a direction,
then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights.
Will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar. And
then we realize why: a roadsign reads "Welcome to Spectre!"
Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels
lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through
the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches.
As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He
checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded
by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's.
Will notices this.
Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside. Badly.
Re-checking the number on a form he's carrying, Will KNOCKS.
The piano stops.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Go back to the start. Right hand
only.
The piano starts again. FOOTSTEPS.
The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50's -- the
woman from the grocery store. Her name is Jenny Hill.
She and Will are startled to see each other.
JENNY
Oh. Oh.
WILL
Hello.
JENNY
I wasn't expecting you.
Confused, Will checks the name on the form.
WILL
Are you Jenny Hill?
JENNY
I am. And you're Will. I've seen
your picture, that's how I recognize
you. I almost said something at the
store, but it would have been awkward.
(a beat)
Like this.
The PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped. He's
watching the conversation at the door. Speaking of awkward...
JENNY
(to the student)
Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the
lesson today? We can go again next
week.
She hands him five dollars out of her pocket.
STUDENT
Do I have to give it back to my Mom?
JENNY
I won't tell her if you won't.
You don't have to tell him twice. He's out the door in a
flash.
-- the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road,
but where there used to be air is water.
Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.
It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees
drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain.
Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his
suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from
HIS CAR,
which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. As
Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny
piece of metal sticking out of the dirt. He pulls it out,
rubs it off.
It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago.
JENNY (V.O.)
Fate has a way of circling back on a
man, and taking him by surprise.
Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a
one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign...
"Welcome to Spectre."
Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the
road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to
find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line,
along with the rest of the town's.
JENNY (V.O.)
A man sees things differently at
different times in his life. This
town didn't seem the same now that
he was older.
We look around the town, on and off Main Street. There are
"FOR SALE" signs in many of the windows
JENNY (V.O.)
A new road had brought the outside
world to Spectre, and with it, banks,
liens and debt. Almost everywhere
you looked, people were bankrupt.
We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward
watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among
the bidders.
JENNY (V.O.)
Two different corporations were
looking at buying the town, if they
could get the price low enough. One
wanted to open a chicken processing
plant. The other, a municipal dump.
Either way, Spectre would be
destroyed.
Edward raises his hand.
EDWARD
Fifty-thousand!
Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.
JENNY (V.O.)
And so Edward Bloom decided to buy
the town, in order to save it.
VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward
talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.
JENNY (V.O.)
Most of them had never seen Spectre --
they only had Edward's words to
describe it. That's all they needed.
He sold them on the dream.
JING
You can structure it as a historical
trust. But you'll need every
contiguous piece of property. It's
all or nothing.
As Edward takes notes...
JENNY (V.O.)
So first he bought the farms. Then
he bought the houses. Then he bought
the stores.
Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally
stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the
trees' thick canopy.
JENNY (V.O.)
Within six months, his trust had
purchased the entire town. With one
exception.
In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen.
He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around
his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.
We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS
on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.
Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for
the first time.
BACK TO:
Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it
breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping
for.
Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.
Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they
SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.
EDWARD
I'm sorry.
He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps
slipping.
JENNY
It's okay, just leave it.
EDWARD
I can get it. I can just...
He leans the door a different way. It holds for a beat then
falls in, SMASHING a small table.
EDWARD
Lord, I'm sorry I...
JENNY
Please. Go. Just go.
EDWARD
I'll...
JENNY
Go.
She's dead serious. Weighing the scales of chivalry, he
finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.
We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's
something more in her feelings for him. Something softer.
JENNY (V.O.)
Most men in that situation would
accept their failure and move on.
But Edward was not like most men.
With Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door
from a pickup truck.
While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries
to set the door square. Karl pushes against the side of the
house until it fits.
Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.
Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to
see the shack is now
THE LOVELY HOUSE
we saw before. It's tiny and white, with black shutters and
a steep roof. A white picket fence. In every detail it is
impossibly charming.
Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town.
JENNY (V.O.)
One day, Edward Bloom left, and never
returned to the town he'd saved.
He climbs in his car and starts the engine.
As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house,
swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.
Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes
slither through the marsh.
Day becomes night.
JENNY (V.O.)
As for the girl, the common belief
was that she'd become a witch, and
crazy at that. She became something
of a legend herself.
We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty
iron gate with flashlights. A beat, then they run away.
JENNY (V.O.)
And the story ended where it began.
Will walks up the front steps. There's a subtle change to
his expression, a dark cloud lifted. He unlocks the door.
Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the
Chevrolet.
AT THE CAR
Will lifts his father out of the chair.
WILL (V.O.)
I pick you up and you hardly weigh
anything. I can't explain it.
Will sets him in the passenger seat.
EDWARD
Water. I need water.
Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead. Hands
it off. Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it,
he douses himself. Soaks the blanket.
Will pops the trunk. Starts to fold up the wheelchair.
EDWARD
Leave it! We won't need it.
TIRES SMOKE as the car peals out.
BACK TO:
The Chevy slaloms through the Sunday-morning traffic.
WILL (O.S.)
Where are we headed?
WILL (V.O.)
You say...
The same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of
more than 100 waiting.
WILL (V.O.)
As we get closer to the river, we
see everybody's already there. And I
mean everybody.
Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr.
Soggybottom. We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the
Mayor, and many others from along the way. No one has aged a
day since we saw them last.
While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend,
Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.
PING
He's here!
The crowd CHEERS. The Ashton marching band PLAYS. Jenny Hill
smiles. So does the Old Woman.
We PUSH IN on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see...
YOUNG EDWARD
reflected. This is what he saw.
Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd.
Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up. Karl
comes just after that.
Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out.
Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily.
Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. He
hands them to Josephine. She throws them up at the powerline.
They loop over. APPLAUSE and CHEERS.
The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river. As
he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the
cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.
WILL (V.O.)
And the strange thing is, there's
not a sad face to be found. Everyone's
just so glad to see you, and send
you off right.
Will walks into the river, up to his knees. He turns back so
his father can face the crowd. Edward waves.
EDWARD
Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu!
THE CROWD (VARIOUS)
Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We'll
miss you!
But one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra. Will turns
to see she's already standing in the river beside them.
The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an
unearthly glow. She's more tranquil and more beautiful than
we've ever seen her.
EDWARD
My girl in the river.
She kisses him. He tweaks her chin. The crowd HOLLERS in
approval, but their moment remains strangely private. Only
Will is there to witness.
As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring.
But it's stuck. Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free
with his teeth.
A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold. Will takes the
ring out of his mouth.
Edward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a SPLASH. For
he's no longer a man, but rather
A FAT CATFISH
swimming at his feet.
We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water,
disappearing.
Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching
Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight. Josephine is back
on the shore, along with the entire crowd.
MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...
Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water,
cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. It then dives
back under with a SPLASH.
CROSSFADE BACK TO:
Will helps his mother out of a black sedan. She's well-
composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.
Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE.
The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than
expected.
As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see
an Oldsmobile parking.
CLOSE ON the license plates. Missouri.
The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely
visible over the door. He shuts it to reveal himself to be
70.
It's Amos Calloway. Will doesn't recognize him.
The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. We TILT
UP to see this man is huge.
This man is KARL, now 55. He's not 12 feet tall, but at least
six-eight.
CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.
As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother
to a seat near the grave.
Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN
(50) behind them. A beat later, an identical face with glasses
peers out -- the woman's twin sister.
It's PING and JING.
Josephine almost GASPS. She elbows Will, who turns to look.
From this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing
steps forward. They're really two separate people.
A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years:
BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.
After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups.
By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling
stories. They're telling Edward's stories.
We find Will watching them.
WILL (V.O.)
Have you ever heard a joke so many
times you've forgotten why it's funny?
But then you hear it again and
suddenly it's new. You remember why
you loved it in the first place.
Will joins in, laughing.
We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the
screen.
TRANSITION TO:
Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching
his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.
SON
(to the other boys)
So he said he'd fight the giant who
was fifteen feet tall.
KID
No way.
SON
(calling over)
Dad, that's right, isn't it?
WILL
Something like that.
SON
See. So he was a giant but my grampa
was going to fight him because he
wasn't afraid of anything because
he'd seen how he was going to die in
this old lady's glass eye...
Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES. Sandra
takes Will's hand in hers, just listening.
WILL (V.O.)
That was my father's final joke I
guess. A man tells his stories so
many times he becomes the stories.
They live on after him.
CROSSFADE TO:
A fat and happy catfish swims towards us.
WILL (V.O.)
And in that way, he becomes immortal.
The fish passes us with a SPLASH.
CUT TO BLACK.
THE END
Big Fish
