      INT. LAX - DAY11

      HANK and BECCA wait at the gate.  Hank enduring the sullen 
      treatment.  Boarding is announced.  Hank rises.  Tugs Becca 
      to her feet.

                                  HANK
                    Off you go, young lady.  Into the 
                    wild blue yonder.

                                  BECCA
                    Great.  Maybe I ll get lucky and my 
                    plane will explode in midair.

                                  HANK
                    Thank you for that lovely image.

                                  BECCA
                    You d be sad.

                                  HANK
                    That I would.

                                  BECCA
                    For sending me against my will.

                                  HANK
                    I don t get it, Becs.  What could 
                    possibly be so awful about visiting 
                    the woman who pushed you through 
                    her magnificent vagina?  In New 
                    York City.  In the fall, no less.  
                    You re gonna step off that plane 
                    into a Woody Allen movie.  I m 
                    pretty jealous right now.

                                  BECCA
                    Chelsea has Lakers tickets.

                                  HANK
                    You hate basketball.

                                  BECCA
                    You re missing the point.  It s a 
                    killer scene.

      Hank sighs, defeated.  He hugs and kisses his daughter 
      goodbye, but it s somewhat akin to handling a wet rag doll.   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 2.



                                  HANK
                    I know you re in there somewhere, 
                    baby girl.  Have a safe trip.

      Not much of a response from Becca.  He watches as she 
      surrenders her ticket and sulks onto the jetway.

                                  HANK
                          (muttering to himself)
                    Come on... look back.  At least 
                    once.  Then I ll know you still 
                    love me.  Please, God, just give me 
                    a sign from on high.

      Finally, just before she rounds a corner and disappears from 
      sight, she looks back.  Well, scowls is more like it.  But 
      it s enough.  Hank waves and grins like an idiot.

                                  HANK
                    That s right!  That s what I m 
                    talking about!

      Hank s happy rain dance takes us all the way to MAIN TITLES.


      INT. LAX - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY22

      Hank comes down an escalator.  Headed for a baggage carousel.  
      His phone out.  Making a call.

                                  HANK
                    Okay, she s up, up and away...

      Intercut with:


      INT. KAREN S PLACE IN NYC - SAME33

                                  KAREN
                    Great.  Can t wait to get my hands 
                    on that little peanut.

                                  HANK
                    Don t be too excited.  She hasn t 
                    been very pleasant lately.  Kind of 
                    a little shit, actually.

                                  KAREN
                    Stop.  Don t poison the well.  
                    We re going to have a great time, 
                    she and I.  I m sure of it.   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 3.



                                  HANK
                      Okus-dokus.  Just you wait and see.  
                    Something wicked your way comes.

                                  KAREN
                    Wish you could ve come with.

                                  HANK
                    Me too.  I m not looking forward to 
                    this weekend.

                                  KAREN
                    Hank.  He s your best friend.

                                  HANK
                    Was.  I haven t seen the guy in 
                    years.  Calls me out of the blue.  
                    Wants to come visit.  Says he has 
                    something important to tell me.  
                    Kinda weird, no?

                                  KAREN
                    Whatever.  Just have fun.  You ve 
                    been pulling Daddy Duty for months 
                    now.  Retreat into the man cave.  
                    Have yourself a lost weekend.

                                  HANK
                    I can do that.

                                  KAREN
                    I know you can.

                                  HANK
                    Call me when she lands.  Give her a 
                    kiss for me.

                                  KAREN
                    With pleasure.

      Karen hangs up.  So does Hank.  He looks around...

      Whereupon he is suddenly TACKLED.  And mock butt-fucked, too.

      His assailant is none other than his best buddy from 
      childhood, MIKE ZLOZOWSKI (40s), an Irish-Polack from working-
      class Long Island.  Henceforth known as ZLOZ.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Moody!  You handsome motherfucker.  
                    I just had to have me a piece of 
                    that ass.  How the fuck are you, 
                    buddy?!   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 4.



      Zloz pulls Hank to his feet.  Tugs him into a mammoth 
      embrace.  Hank gives Zloz a serious once-over.

                                  HANK
                    Jesus, where did that plane come 
                    from?  1987?  You look exactly the 
                    same.  And that smell... 
                      cigarettes, booze and Drakkar 
                    Noir... takes me right back.

                                  ZLOZ
                    What about you?  Ya look like half-
                    a-fag in that smoking jacket, but 
                    you smell pretty much the same -- 
                    like a cock dipped in shit.

      Hank looks at Zloz with a mixture of horror and bemused 
      affection.  

                                  HANK
                    It s good to see you, Zloz.  Been a 
                    long time, my friend.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Yeah, and whose fault is that?  Who 
                    never comes back to the Island?  
                    Fancy book writer Hank-fucking-
                    Moody, that s who.

                                  HANK
                    What can I say?  They won t let me 
                    back.  I divulged too many small 
                    town secrets, named too many names.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Well, here I am, man.  I finally 
                    made it.  LA, man.  L-fucking-A.

                                  HANK
                    So what s going on?  You sounded 
                    pretty mysterious on the phone.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Later.  There s plenty of time to  
                    shoot the shit.  First I wanna see 
                    Britney s vertical smile.

                                  HANK
                    I ll have to check the schedule.  I 
                    don t think she s showing this 
                    week.   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 5.



                                  ZLOZ
                    Then I wanna act like a millionaire 
                    and get properly  faced with my 
                    best buddy in the whole wide world.  
                    Whatta ya say?

                                  HANK
                    I say we shoot for the moon.  And 
                    if we only make it halfway there, 
                    so fucking be it.  Still better 
                    than working for the man...

                    fucking ossified.

      Off Hank, feeling the collision of past and present...


      INT. RUNKLE HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY44

      CHARLIE is atop MARCY, pumping away with youthful abandon.  
      He achieves fruition.  At the same time she does, actually.  
      Charlie rolls off.  A moment as they catch their breath.

                                    CHARLIE
                          (winded)
                    Wow.  Simultaneous cummage.  That 
                    never happens.  Like ever.  It must 
                    be a sign!

                                  MARCY
                    Not so fast, Runkle.  We ve thrown 
                    each other a few bangs.  So what?  
                    Just a couple of lonely hearts 
                    coming together to make the night a 
                    little less cruel.  In the whole 
                    scheme of things, don t mean shit.

                    But it s morning.  We just had 
                    morning sex.

                                  MARCY
                    Don t be dense, Charlie.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I ve got an idea.

                                  MARCY
                    I m scared.   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 6.

                    Go out with me.

      Hank and Zloz at the bar.  Zloz taking it all in.  He s a 
      long way from home and he s feeling it.

      A beat.  Zloz thinking this is something Hank should know.  
      He leaves it alone.  Waves the BEAUTIFUL BARMAID over with 
      his index finger.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Three.  Which is three too fucking

                    with the rest.

      Beautiful Barmaid rolls her eyes, annoyed.  Hank winces, 
        embarrassed.

                                  HANK
                    Jesus, Zloz.  That old chestnut?

      She goes.  Hank slaps Zloz upside the head.

      Another round of drinks arrive.  Hank reaches for his wallet.  
      Zloz beats him to the punch.

                    Fuck you.  I got this.

      Zloz throws a twenty down, turns away.  Beautiful Barmaid 
      shakes her head -- not quite enough.  Hank covers the rest.  
      Mouths  Keep it.

      She gives him a sweet little kiss and goes, leaving Charlie 
      unsure whether he should weep or vomit. 


      INT. COLLINI HOUSE - EVENING77

      Hank and Zloz wander into the Hollywood party of your 
      cinematic daydreams.  It should feel like we ve stepped into 
      another era.  A sweet spot somewhere between 1979 and 1985.

                                  ZLOZ
                      Fucking-A.  This is some serious 
                    Scarface shit right here.

      Hank quickly finds Charlie and Marcy in the crowd.

                    guys.  Thanks for taking good care

      Ad-libbed greetings are exchanged.  Zloz says to Hank:   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 15.

                    So this is your Ovitz?

                                  HANK
                    If by Ovitz you mean the man who 
                    does absolutely nothing to improve 
                    my professional life and only 
                    serves to amuse me, then yes, this 
                    is my Ovitz.

                          (to Zloz)
                    Let me ask you:  was he always such 
                    a prick?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Always.  It s a disease, really.  I 
                    had to hand him his ass on an 
                    almost daily basis.

      SUE COLLINI greets them, martini in hand...

                                    COLLINI
                      Welcome...

      Hugs and hellos and whatnot.

      A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR cruises up alongside Collini.  A 
      handsome, well-dressed older man.  Somewhat erudite.

                    This must be Runkle.  I see what

      Looks are thrown between Hank and the Runkles.  Hank chuckles 
      and gives Charlie a pat on the back.

                    Enjoy yourself, Cap n.

      Hank wanders off with Zloz.  Charlie pulls Collini aside.

                    I feel very strange about this.

                    You should give him a try sometime.

      Whereupon he wags his tongue and does a fancy little 
      wheelchair wheelie for emphasis.  Marcy starts to mutter:

                    Is your father a lumberjack?

                    Not porn, you simpleton.  A stag 
                    film is different.  Evokes a bygone

                                  WALTER COLLINI
                    Look around, my dear.  I buy and 
                    sell erotic art.  That s what gets 
                    this soldier hard.
                          (off their looks)
                    Not down there.  No sirree.  That 
                    thing s about as useful as a piece 
                    of string cheese.  But my tongue.  
                    That s where it s at.  When I get 
                    aroused, all the blood rushes to my 
                    mouth.  It s almost better than a 
                    penis.  It s a heat-seeker.

      He wags his tongue at Marcy, who cowers, grossed-out.

                                    COLLINI
                    He speaks the truth, my man does.  
                    Although I m still a penetration 
                    junkie at heart.  Which is why he s 
                    kind enough to let me shop 
                      elsewhere.

                                    CHARLIE
                    If you don t mind me asking, 
                    Walter, how d you end up in the 
                    chair?

                                  WALTER COLLINI
                    This one over here rode me so hard 
                    one night she broke my member.  It 
                    ballooned up.  Got all swollen and 
                    purple.  Like an eggplant.  I 
                    freaked out, thought I was never 
                    going to be able to make love 
                    again.  So I threw myself off the 
                    deck.  Broke just about every bone 
                    in my body.  But Sue Collini -- she 
                    stayed with me.  Through thick and 
                    thin.  To Hell and back.  I love 
                    her madly.

      Walter and Sue make out furiously.  Marcy elbows Charlie.  
      They try to sneak away.  No such luck.  Busted.

                                    COLLINI
                    Hey, where do you two think you re 
                    going?

      INT. COLLINI HOUSE - NIGHT1010

      Hank is shooting some pool when a flabbergasted Zloz races 
      in, soaking wet, pulling on his clothes.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Dude, she has a cock!

                                  HANK
                    Really?  Are you sure?  Maybe it s 
                    just an oversized clit.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Things were going really well.  Too 
                    well.  We were making out in the 
                    hot tub.  She said she wanted to 
                    tell me something.  I thought she 
                    had a boyfriend or something.  Next 
                    thing I know, she guides my hand 
                    down to her thin, bent dong.  

                                  HANK
                    So then what?  You gave her a 
                    handie?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Fuck you.  I fucking clocked her.  
                    Him.  Whatever.

                                  HANK
                    Zloz, you can t do shit like that.  
                    That s a human being.

                                  ZLOZ
                    What the fuck is wrong with you, 
                    Moody?  Have you been in LA so long 
                    that a chick with a dick means 
                    nothing to you?

      The Tranny enters, loaded for bear.  Hell-bent on kicking 
      Zloz s ass.  Hank intervenes.

                    I ve been telling him that for 
                    years now.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Hey, them s fighting words.  

                                  TRANNY
                    Asshole.  I thought you knew.  And 
                    then when I realized you didn t, I 
                    tried to break it to you gently.

                                  HANK
                    For what it s worth, I think you re 
                      beautiful.  You could totally pass 
                    for a lady.

                                  TRANNY
                    Thank you, sweetie.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Great, you two should get a room.

                                  TRANNY
                    I think he knew.  Deep down.  He 
                    was looking for a little meat.

      His sexuality challenged, Zloz does what comes natural -- he 
      takes a swing.  Pissed, Hank shoves Zloz.  They end up in a 
      retard-clumsy fistfight.  At which point Collini enters.

                                    COLLINI
                    Boys!  Enough!  There will be no

                    not be tolerated.

                                  HANK
                      I understand.  You re completely 
                    right, Sue.  We re deeply ashamed.  
                    Right?  Right, Zloz?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Maybe you are.
                          (off his look)
                    I m deeply ashamed.  That I touched 
                    a tranny s cock.

      Zloz look at each other.  Exeunt.


      INT. COLLINI HOUSE - PLAYROOM - NIGHT1111

      Marcy drags Charlie into the  playroom.   Collini wasn t 
      lying.  There s a videocamera on a tripod, and it s trained 
      on a dirty futon on the floor.

                    So what?  Your boss is a stone

                    approve of a quickie happening 
                    right under her very roof.

                    Nothing.  I guess I m just a little 
                      overwhelmed by the whiplash nature 
                    of our relationship.

                                  MARCY

      Marcy really does look like she s going to puke.  She s 
      doubled over, trying to catch her breath.  Charlie tries to 
      comfort her.

      She comes up for air.  Hauls off and PUNCHES HIM in the face.

      Absolute chaos.  Lights, music, girls galore... all captured

      the bar.

                    This is a strip club, Hank.  Not a

      Charlie, meanwhile, has a STRIPPER working one leg and a 
      LITTLE PERSON STRIPPER bouncing on the other.  He SHOUTS over

      And now we re with Zloz, who s in hog heaven.  Although he 
      can t help but ask:

                                  ZLOZ
                    Hey, you don t happen to have a 
                    dick, do ya?
                          (off her look)
                    No offense or anything.

      Busty Blonde Stripper looks at him for a moment, annoyed.

                                  BUSTY BLONDE STRIPPER
                    None taken.

      She takes his hand and places it firmly on her crotch.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Nope.  No dick down there.  No hair 
                    either.  Sorry I doubted you, 
                      sweetheart.

      Back to business.  She takes her top off.  Big boobs spill 
      out.  Zloz is beside himself.  Finds himself mesmerized.

      A moment.

      Too drunk to stop himself, he dives right in.  Like a hungry 
      baby, he latches onto a nipple and won t let go.

      Busty Blonde Stripper freaks out and SCREAMS for help.   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 26.



      A WWE-SIZED BOUNCER is there in no time.  Grabs Zloz in a 
      bear hug and heads for the door.

      Hanks sees what s going on and throws himself in between.

                                  HANK
                    What happened?  What d he do?

                                  WWE-SIZED BOUNCER
                    He was sucking her titties.  That s 
                    not cool.

                                  HANK
                    Shit, you got that right.
                          (to Zloz)
                    What were you thinking?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Hank, they were fucking epic.  I 
                    couldn t help myself.  She was like 
                    Mamie Van Doren meets Samantha Fox.  
                    You know what a tit man I am!

      Hank produces some cash, tries to smooth things over.

                                  HANK
                          (to bouncer)
                    Look, can we forget about this?  
                    You can take the boy out of Long 
                    Island... you know what I m saying?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Hey, that s fucking condescending, 
                    you prick.

                                  HANK
                    I m not the one who s still breast-

                    Forget it.  I m tossing working-
                    class here out on his ass...

      Zloz sees red, takes a swing.  The bouncer swings back.  
      Something akin to a western bar fight breaks out.  The whole 
      place goes shithouse.  Zloz looks at Hank with a crazy grin.

                                  ZLOZ
                    You with me, compadre?

      Hank sighs and joins the fray...   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 27.



      INT. HANK S BEDROOM - MORNING1414

      Which should resemble David Lee Roth s hotel room circa 1984.  
      It looks like a fucking bomb went off.  And much fun was had.  

      Next to Hank, tangled up in the sheets, SLEEPING BEAUTY.  All 
      blonde hair and dangerous curves.  We can t see her face.

      Hank gets out of bed.  Too fast.  Puts his hands out to stop 
      the spinning.  Courtesy of the night before, natch.

      He stumbles around the room, looking for something he can t 
      quite find.  Then -- a light bulb moment.  He lurches into:


      THE BATHROOM1515

      Where the sudsy remains of a bubble bath are still in the 
      tub.  He shoves a hand into the froth, comes up with various 
      and sundry articles of clothing.

      Tops, bottoms, lacy what-have-you s.  Finally producing his 
      sunglasses.

      He shakes off the suds.  Slides them on.  Looks in the 
      mirror.  Improvs some kung fu moves.  And then it s...


      INTO THE DINING ROOM1616

      It s a fucking mess in here, too.  Bottles of booze 
      everywhere.  A mushroom cloud of cigarette smoke hanging in 
      the air.

      Hank crosses paths with last night s Little Person Stripper, 
      who is exiting Becca s bedroom.  She gives him a nod and a 
      wink and heads for the kitchen.

      Hank watches as she opens the fridge and guzzles some OJ out 
      of the carton.  He turns, walks into...


      BECCA S BEDROOM1717

      Where another stripper is passed out in Becca s bed.

      A GNARLY PAIR OF MALE FEET poke out from under the covers 
      next to her head.

      Hank peeks under the covers down by the girl s feet.  Finds 
      an unconscious Charlie under there.  Sporting a nasty shiner.

      Hank puts the covers back over Charlie s face.  Leaves the 
      room...   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 28.



      IN THE LIVING ROOM1818

      Zloz is passed out on the floor.

      Hank sighs, looks at his old friend with equal measures 
      compassion and disgust.  He gets an idea.  Goes...


      INTO HIS BEDROOM1919

      Where he shakes Sleeping Beauty.  Turns out it s Jackie.  She 
      wakes up yawning.  All sleepy and cute.  Smiles at Hank.

                                  JACKIE
                    Morning, teach.  Our first 
                      sleepover.

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, wish I remembered a little 
                    more of it.

                                  JACKIE
                    Did we take a bubble bath?

                                  HANK
                    There is evidence to support that 
                    theory, yes.
                          (then)
                    Can you do me big favor?


      INT. HANK S PLACE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING2020

      We re CLOSE ON ZLOZ as he wakes up.

      Trying to remember where he is and how the fuck he got there.  
      He senses a body curled up next to him on the floor.  He 
      looks:

      It s Jackie.  Sound asleep.  He can t believe his good 
      fortune.  He peeks under the blanket.  Yep, she s naked.  
      Even better.  She wakes up.  All sleepy and cute.  Smiles.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Did we...?

                                  JACKIE
                    Oh fuck yeah.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Wow.  Was I any good?

                                  JACKIE

                                  ZLOZ
                    Good times...

      Hank comes out of the bedroom.  Yawning.  As if he just woke 
      up.  Zloz leaps to feet.  Runs into Hank s arms.  Big hug.  
      Hank pats his naked friend on the back.  Looks at Jackie.

                                  HANK

                    You re welcome...


      EXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY2121

      Hank and Zloz play catch on the sand.

                    Shit, I dunno.  I was pissed at 
                    you, I guess.  I didn t want to see 
                    you throw your life away.  We had a 
                    plan.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Yeah.  And I fucked it up.

                                  HANK
                    We were gonna make it out of there.  
                    The two of us.  Together.  I was

                    gonna be a rock star.  That s the

                    Couldn t have been more wrong.  You 
                    did a beautiful thing, Zloz.  You 
                    stepped up.  Married that girl.

                    last year?

                                  HANK
                    You re kidding me.  Guess it kinda 
                    proves his theory.  Maybe you 
                    really do die less than five miles 
                    from where you were born.

                                  ZLOZ
                    No worries.  Gives me plenty of 
                    time to get loaded and piss myself 
                    on the plane.

      Big hug.  Hank won t let go.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Are you crying again, you fucking 
                    faggot?

                                  HANK
                    Take care of yourself, okay?

                                  ZLOZ
                    I will.  I promise.  And thanks for 
                    showing me a good time.  What 
                    happens in LA... right, brother?   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 33.



                                  HANK
                    Hey, it s in the vault.
                          (then)
                    You think you ll be able to patch 
                    things up with the old lady?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Tell ya the truth -- she doesn t 
                    even know I m gone.  She was so 
                    pissed at me she went off to 
                    Atlantic City with a couple of her 
                      girlfriends.  For all I know, she 
                    made out with a tranny, too.

                                  HANK
                    You re a colossal pussy, you know 
                    that?

                                  ZLOZ
                    Pretty much, yeah.  You better come 
                    visit sometime.  I got a buncha 
                    kids who ve heard a shitload of 
                    Hank Moody stories and can t put a 
                    face to the name.

                                  HANK
                    That s no good.

                                  ZLOZ
                    No, it s not.

                                  HANK
                    Yeah, well... I love ya, Zloz.

                                  ZLOZ
                    Love you, too, Moody.  Ya fuckin  
                    homo.

      Zloz smiles, picks up his bag and goes, disappearing into the 
      terminal.  Hank watches him go.  But there s little time for 
      reflection.

      All of a sudden, BECCA blows past him.  Climbs into the 
      backseat with her bag.  Hank sighs.

                                  HANK
                    Wow.  Not even a hello?  Good 
                    times.  Hey, what am I, your limo 
                    driver?  Get in the front --

      Hank is on his way to the driver s side when a familiar voice 
      stops him:   CALIFORNICATION   EP.305   PRODUCTION DRAFT   5/11/09 34.



                                  KAREN
                    What, you re just gonna leave 
                    without me...?

      Hank looks.  And there she is.  KAREN.  Bag in hand.  
      Smiling.  And yes, his heart skips a beat.  Or two.  Is she a 
      mirage?

                                  BECCA
                    Merry fucking Christmas.  Can we go 
                    home already?

      Without missing a beat:

                                  HANK & KAREN
                    Shut up.

      Hank moves to Karen.  Pulls her into his arms.  She smells 
      like home.  Life is good in the Golden State.
