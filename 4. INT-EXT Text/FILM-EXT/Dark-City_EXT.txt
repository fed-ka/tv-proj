BUILDING
-
NIGHT
ANGLE ON WHITE
-
from outside the window, through blurry
glass.
A RAPID FLYING P.O.V. PULLS BACK in silence.
The window is a
SPECK on the side of a vast grey tower.
BACK IN THE BATHROOM
White shivers, cold.
He stares down at the puddle he drips on
the floor.
He looks at his feet and legs, covered with
numerous SMALL BITES.
He dries the bloody wounds with a towel.
He picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on.
Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with
HOLES in both soles.
In his trouser pocket he finds a key
-
a room number on a plastic tag.
He hears splashing in the bath-tub.
He steps over, looks into
the murky water.
Suddenly a SMALL SILVER FISH leaps from the
water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about.
He leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the
water.
Like a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the
shadows.
He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand
inches from the doorknob.
He leans down.
TIGHT ON HIS EYE
Blinking through the key-hole.
P.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM
-
A glimpse of motion
-
the door
across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.
BUILDING
-
NIGHT
A large faded BILLBOARD advertisement on a building facade.
A
portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "LUMP-
O"
-
a cereal box carton.
THE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY, rises upwards, CLOSER on the
womans face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her
PAINTED IRIS.
FLYING P.O.V.
-
NIGHT
A FLYING PERSPECTIVE past buildings.
An INSECT-LIKE BUZZING
O.S.
Way down BELOW, in a canyon of silent buildings, a LONE
FIGURE walks.
DOWN ON THE STREET
A breeze pulls at WHITEs hair and coat.
He takes out the
wallet
-
a few dollars.
HIS P.O.V. AS HE WALKS
The city is DEAD.
Empty.
Desolate.
Buildings hang down out
of black.
Day-time was never invented.
As he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a BUSINESS CARD he
hadnt noticed, flutters to the ground.
He stops, picks it up.
In simple print:
DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D., a phone number.
Scribbled handwriting on the back says:
Thursday 0930.
ON WHITE
-
he glances across the street.
HIS P.O.V.
-
A cafe.
A broken NEON FISH buzzes above the
doorway.
VARIOUS
TIGHT
-
rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding
speed.
The cylinder races around corners.
It clanks and
grinds.
HURTLES up the side of a building.
THEN PLUMMETS
underground.
Rushes through darkness.
BRIDGE
-
NIGHT
THE CAMERA MOVES along a bridge-like structure.
An enclosed
corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons.
Under the bridge,
pipes spew sewage into stagnant water.
ANGLE ON WHITE WALKING
-
seen through a series of illuminated,
dirty, windows.
He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds
before him.
INSIDE
TIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup.
ANGLE ON WHITE
-
He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of
clattering metal.
A pipe runs the length of the corridor
-
the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness.
Then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS
somewhere in the building.
White hurriedly moves towards the
source.
ANOTHER CORRIDOR
White rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE
in a wall.
ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now
-
He runs to the hole
in the wall and looks through.
HIS P.O.V.
A small, very ordered ROOM.
A fake fireplace bathes the room
in a warm glow.
White cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the
hole.
He can see into an adjoining room to his right
-
two
dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of
dark crimson.
The man looks up
-
its Fredrick
-
just as
both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.
He
doesnt scream this time, just gags on blood running from his
mouth.
Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whites neck,
traps his head in the hole.
He struggles, tries to free
himself.
Drops the bowl of soup.
It shatters on the hard
floor, makes a mess.
INSIDE THE BATHROOM
-
The killers look up at the smashing
noise.
BACK IN THE CORRIDOR
-
White pulls with all his strength.
The door gives and he stumbles backwards.
He is about to run
away but glances at the floor.
The fish is flapping about
-
still alive.
STREET
White darts from a doorway, trips and falls.
He sprawls at the
base of sweeping stone steps.
He looks at a building towering
above him.
Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance:
LIBRARY.
PLAZA
-
NIGHT
White walks under stone archways.
Across an empty plaza is a sign above a door:
DRUGS OPEN 24
HOURS and in smaller print, recently added beneath:
SHAVE &
HAIRCUT $5.00.
STREET
-
NIGHT
White steps out into a street, turns a corner, drops the empty
packet of cereal.
Now he sees TWO FIGURES APPROACH.
He hides
behind a wall before he is seen.
Suddenly a deafening RINGING
startles him.
He looks across a plaza.
HIS P.O.V.
-
A CHURCH.
A bell-tower, black against the sky.
White stares up into the night.
VARIOUS
-
MONTAGE
RAPID MOVE ACROSS MYSTERY MEN screaming.
Faces contort with
pain.
INTERCUT WITH:
Electricity ARCING between electrodes.
A building against the sky.
The windows EXPLODE.
Glass blows
out, raining down on the street.
A concrete wall SPLITS OPEN.
Slime oozes through the crack.
An old man, walks on a deserted street, looks up at the sky.
One of the lenses of his spectacles CRACKS without warning.
A chair falls over in a dark room.
A woman under a hair-dryer gossips on a phone.
Suddenly the
phone emits a high-pitched shriek.
Her ear spouts blood and
she screams.
A small transistor radio emits a high frequency and short
circuits with a spark.
BUILDING
TIGHT ON
-
a wristwatch spinning backwards rapidly
-
completely haywire.
INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD stands on a street corner staring blankly at
his watch.
Taps it several times, annoyed, then looks up at a
THREE STOREY BUILDING.
He holds a piece of paper in his other
hand
-
on it a number rapidly scrawled:
23.
HIS P.O.V.
The dilapidated building
-
arched windows only on the topmost
floor.
A faded number on the facade
-
also 23.
The windows
light up continuously with rapid bursts of white light.
INSIDE
The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room.
TWO FIGURES move about.
Bumstead glances at a UNIFORMED MAN,
standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival.
To the side, A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER flashes something swinging
back and forth, hanging from the ceiling.
It looks like...
Fredrick.
Dead.
His arms and legs missing.
A pool of blood
beneath the mutilated torso.
Bumstead looks at the cop.
BUMSTEAD
How long have you been here?
COP
Maybe ten minutes...
(looks at his watch)
Thats strange.
BUMSTEAD
Spinning backwards?
The cop is shaking his watch, tapping it with his finger.
He
looks up.
Bumstead indicates his own watch.
COP
Yours too?
Bumstead nods.
He removes a notebook from his pocket, walks
about the room, glances at objects, makes notes.
Bumstead steps over to a small RECTANGULAR HOLE in the wall.
He examines it carefully, then bends down and puts his head
through.
On the other side is a corridor snaking off into
darkness.
Just beneath the hole, is a broken dish and a
puddle.
Lying half in the puddle is the business card of
Doctor D.P. Schreber M.D.
Without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby
cop.
BUMSTEAD
I want prints over here...
Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteads head in it.
He
struggles.
The cop and the photographer run over to help.
BUILDING
-
NIGHT
MOVE IN ON a doorway.
Above it a small illuminated red sign:
DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D.
REVERSE ANGLE ON WHITE
He stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his
wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesnt have
anymore.
CITY STREETS
-
NIGHT
An old-fashioned BLACK SEDAN drives over a rusty suspension
bridge.
Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle.
It's
been raining.
Streets are empty.
INSIDE THE CAR
WHITE and the INSPECTOR drive silently.
Bumstead has appointed
his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home.
Hot thermos.
Note pad holder, complete with light.
Coat
hanger.
Gun rack.
A system for everything.
BUMSTEAD
Dammit!
(glances at his
watch)
I'm curious?
How many so far?
He shakes his watch, puts it to his ear.
WHITE (confused)
What?
I...
BUMSTEAD (counts on fingers)
Let's see, there's the little guy
with no arms or legs.
And the young
boy?
WHITE (disturbed)
Young boy?
CLOSE ON WHITE
-
frightened now.
BUMSTEAD
The six year old.
Sure, you
remember.
Bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard.
A SANDWICH,
carefully wrapped and prepared.
After glancing at his watch
again, he bites into it.
BUMSTEAD (chewing)
Y'know, the kid you left in the meat
packing plant, cut into pieces.
Packed into brown paper parcels,
wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.
No answer.
BUMSTEAD
You sure have demonstrated a great
deal of...
imagination.
The baby
was the best though.
Several cops
lost their lunch over that one.
Head
twisted off, spine pulled out,
yeech...
WHITE (cuts in)
Stop it.
You're making me sick...
BUMSTEAD
We count seven so far.
Anyone we
missed?
RADIO CRACKLE O.S.
-
A tinny voice cuts in.
VOICE
Inspector Bumstead...
Inspector...
Bumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it.
BUMSTEAD
What is it, Crenshaw?
CRENSHAW
Just reminding you...
your eight pee
em...
BUMSTEAD
Dammit.
(looks at watch)
Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw.
Remind me to give you my watch.
It
needs fixing.
CRENSHAW
Yes sir.
Bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a
SHARP CORNER as he finishes off the sandwich.
WHITE
Where are we going?
BUMSTEAD
Shut-up.
Burastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from
his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel.
White is silent
-
his wounds continue to bother him.
He
leans down to scratch through his trousers.
WHITE (quietly)
Shit!
BUMSTEAD
Gesundheit!
WHITE (looks up)
I didn't sneeze.
HOSPITAL ENTRANCE
-
NIGHT
The INSPECTOR's car pulls up and stops.
INSIDE THE CAR
WHITE
What are we doing here?
Bumstead grabs a bunch of flowers off the back seat.
BUMSTEAD
Get out.
STREET
-
NIGHT
BUMSTEAD pulls up in his car.
Across the street is DOCTOR
SCHREBER'S surgery.
He is about to get out of the car, when the SURGERY DOOR OPENS
and A FIGURE steps into the street.
Bumstead watches the
shadowy man for a moment.
Then gets out and FOLLOWS, assuming
it is Schreber.
ALLEYWAY
Bumstead follows inconspicuously.
Without warning, the figure
stops and TURNS.
Bumstead backs into a doorway to hide.
He
gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a MYSTERY MAN in the
dim light of the alley.
When Bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of
the Man
-
like he disappeared into thin air.
A SHADOW
crosses the wall beside Bumstead.
He spins, looking around
behind him.
Then he looks up into the air.
HIS P.O.V.
The shadow of a LEVITATING FIGURE crosses the face of a
building.
APARTMENT BUILDING FACADE
The CAMERA MOVES past flaking bricks
-
to a window.
Behind
the glass WHITE and SACHIKO sit across from the WOMAN who
attacked White.
She is talking, though nothing can be heard,
drying her eyes with a handkerchief.
INSIDE
The strange woman looks at White intently between sobs.
WOMAN
Please believe me.
It's me, John.
Your WIFE.
I wouldn't lie to you.
You told me I could come and see you
-
now you want to just send me away
again...
White looks AT THE FLOOR.
HIS P.O.V.
-
a crack in the floorboards
-
movement
underneath.
WHITE
I thought it would make more sense.
I'm getting the pieces, but when I
put it together it feels like...
Like you're telling me about somebody
else's life...
WIFE
It's the truth...
I need you.
I
know you're innocent.
WHITE
How do you know I'm innocent?
WIFE
Of course you are.
You couldn't do
those terrible things.
Come home with
me
-
maybe things will make sense
then...
WHITE
I can't do that.
It's dangerous.
What about my parents?
Do you know
where I can find them?
WIFE
They're dead, John.
He stands and walks to the window
-
looks out at the city.
WIFE
You have an uncle.
You were very
close.
She fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles
something on a piece of paper, hands it to White.
WIFE
This is where he lives. I'm sure he
would like to see you.
WHITE (taking paper)
Thanks.
WIFE (looks at him for a beat)
Don't you want me?
My body?
Remember how my skin feels?
Touch
it.
I...
She notices Sachiko
-
becomes self-conscious.
Sachiko
silently stands and leaves the room.
The wife puts her face in
her hands, overcome with tears.
WHITE
What's your name?
WIFE
(looks up
-
still sobbing)
Elizabeth.
White removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his
wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face
-
it
matches.
WHITE
(thoughtful)
Yes...
In the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple.
She
MOVES OFF.
ELIZABETH
I want to help...
WHITE
Alright.
Here...
He pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman
can see it.
WHITE
Know this place?
She looks at the card.
ELIZABETH
(stops crying)
Of course.
Your home town
-
where
you grew up...
White stands abruptly, startling the woman.
He glares down at
her intensely.
WHITE
How do I get there?
Tell me.
WIFE
That's easy.
You...
She trails off into silence.
Her hand, about to point in a
certain direction, freezes in mid-air.
ELIZABETH
...strange, I forgot.
White sits back down quietly.
WHITE
Yes.
Very strange.
ROOF-TOP
-
NIGHT
OTHER MYSTERY MEN are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna
device.
BACK DOWN IN THE DARK CHAMBER
The group of MYSTERY MEN have gathered once again.
One
addresses them all.
MYSTERY MAN
The line of junction between two
edges!
MEN
(unison)
YES!
MYSTERY MAN
We have located him.
Now is the
time, yes.
A switch is thrown.
Electricity sparks to life.
A hum is in
the air.
MYSTERY MAN
Let the tuning commence!
The congregation of MEN place ELECTRODES to their foreheads in
a trance-like manner.
They chant, quietly at first, steadily
building in volume.
The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to
some inner beat.
The CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.
A
representation of a man's legs.
Trousers rolled up above the
knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh.
Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion
-
the legends are an unknown language.
ON THE ROOF
The antenna glows with a ghostly green light.
O.S. SCREAMS
RISE UP FROM THE STREET.
BUILDING
BUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.
He gets out, stained here and there
with bile.
POLICE STATION
BUMSTEAD steps from the doorway and walks across to his car
briskly.
ALLEY
-
NIGHT
SCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an
alleyway.
Schreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall.
SCHREBER
In there.
BUMSTEAD
Just like that?
The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall.
Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the
foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.
He
unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.
He
waves the other men forward.
White and Bumstead step up to the door
-
Bumstead looks at the
mat
-
it says:
WELCOME on it.
A CORRIDOR
Through the door
-
AN ELEVATOR.
There is only a down button.
Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open.
They step inside.
The doors close, the lift descends.
BUMSTEAD
What is this place?
SCHREBER
You wouldn't believe me if I told
you, Inspector.
Have patience
-
you'll see for yourself.
When the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK
PASSAGEWAY.
LIBRARY
-
NIGHT
The PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base
of the building.
It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps
repeatedly.
It looks down and shrieks with a string of
mechanical obscenities.
ALLEY
BACK ABOVE GROUND, Bumstead, White and Schreber run from the
door at the end of the alley-way, tossing their masks away.
BUMSTEAD
Was that for real down there?
SCHREBER
I'm afraid so.
The inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him
back.
BUMSTEAD
What the hell is that?
At the end of the alley the PUPPET advances menacingly.
Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and
disappears.
BUMSTEAD
Quick.
My car.
Fortunately BUMSTEAD'S CAR stands nearby.
The two men leap in,
start it up.
Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the
glare of the headlights.
The puppet's head opens, a TINY PROPELLER pops out, spins,
lifting the puppet into the air.
The car passes beneath it at
speed.
Screeches off into a street, races along between tall
buildings.
INSIDE THE CAR
WHITE
What now?
BUMSTEAD
This ocean business...
I know where
I can find a map.
I need to go back
to the station.
Where will you be?
White thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him
from his pocket.
WHITE
I'll go see an uncle of mine.
(reading)
Five
-
one
-
eight
-
three
-
double
six
-
three...
Bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with
the wheel, driving at breakneck speed.
BUMSTEAD
Good.
(looks in rear
mirror)
Uh-oh...
White turns and looks behind them.
HIS P.O.V.
-
HEADLIGHTS gaining on them.
ON THE PUPPET
-
sitting AT THE WHEEL of a stolen car, driving
like crazy.
BACK IN BUMSTEAD'S CAR
White takes out his gun
-
AIMS at the rapidly approaching
car.
WHITE
(remembers)
It's empty.
BUMSTEAD
Take mine.
Bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat.
They swap.
The puppet PULLS ALONGSIDE, a mechanical arm extends towards
Bumstead's front tire.
A SPINNING BLADE extends from the end
of the mechanical arm.
PUPPET
ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...
HA-HA-HA-HA-
HA!!
TIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel.
White
fires.
Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows.
THE BLADE cuts into the tire
-
it pops loudly, goes flat,
metal SPARKS off the road.
White is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash.
Bumstead
fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other
vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans
flying.
The PUPPET'S car falls behind
-
then swerves off into a side-
street and disappears.
BUMSTEAD
(looks behind him)
Where did it go?
WHITE
(looks back also)
Don't know.
Both look FORWARD AGAIN
-
to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in
front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY.
Bumstead's car is going too
fast.
Slams the brakes.
TIGHT ON PUPPET
-
Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car
approaches like a bullet.
INSIDE INSPECTOR'S CAR
BUMSTEAD
Jump!
Bumstead rips the phone number from the pad.
The two men LEAP.
The car continues onwards.
CRASH!
KA-BOOM!
In the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves
up from different sides of the street.
Look at each other,
turn and head in OPPOSITE directions.
CAMERA MOVES IN on mangled metal
-
a MECHANICAL CLAW starts
to pull itself from the wreckage.
STREET
-
NIGHT
White steps up to a SMALL DOOR in the side of a building.
A
sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with
fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface.
Dominating
everything is a GREEN MAN with scales
-
a KING NEPTUNE-type.
INSIDE
White stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue
curtain.
In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth
hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window.
The
man wakes with a start.
TICKET SELLER
Yeah.
That's what I said!
(looks at White
-
rubs head)
What..?
WHITE
I'm looking for this address.
The man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily.
TICKET SELLER
Upstairs.
Through there.
He thumbs the blue curtain.
Curls up, shuts his eyes again.
BEYOND THE CURTAIN
A dark room full of BUBBLING NOISES AND WATER DRIPPING
-
an
aquarium.
Several corridors meander between large glass panels that look
into illuminated tanks of sea creatures.
White moves past a shadowy doorway.
He can barely make out
STAIRS.
CANAL
-
NIGHT
TIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE
His eyes are shut tight.
He opens them, slowly LOOKS AROUND,
curious why he isn't dead.
WIDER ANGLE
White floats in MID-AIR, hovering ten feet or so above a dark
body of water.
He looks amazed.
Shuts his eyes, rubs them,
opens them again.
Still floating.
He clenches his fists and TENSES his body.
Slowly he starts to
MOVE FORWARD, hovering at an even height over the water.
WIDER STILL
SEVERAL ANGLES feature the figure of White levitating across
the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships.
TIGHT ON WHITE
-
He comes to a stop.
Smiles in amazement.
Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has
opened beneath him.
ANGLE ON BUBBLES floating to the surface.
White's FACE rises
slowly out of the water.
WIDER
-
CITY SKYLINE
A SMALL OBJECT floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny
white parachute.
BACK ON WHITE
He swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself
silently through the still canals of the city.
HARBOUR
Oil tankers move silently through inky water.
White paddles the boat to the bottom of A PIER, climbs a rotten
ladder.
He runs off into the shadows.
BACK IN THE WATER
The PUPPET cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear
propeller.
It reaches the pier, climbs to the top.
The prop
retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a
concrete surface.
It looks around
-
it knows White is there
somewhere.
PUPPET'S P.O.V.
A trail of WET FOOTPRINTS on the ground.
It follows them, is
led to a crane cabin.
INSIDE THE CRANE'S CABIN
-
is White, a lunatic grin on his
face, at the controls.
A NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.
It looks up.
PUPPET'S P.O.V.
Follows the crane up into the air.
The crane is swinging around
against the dark sky.
A HUGE METAL CONTAINER dangles, stops
above the puppet.
ON WHITE
WHITE
Nice knowing you.
TIGHT ON WHITE'S HAND
-
It pulls a lever.
THE CONTAINER
-
Shakes and starts to fall.
THE PUPPET
-
Screams up at the plummeting container.
WIDER
The container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature.
Silence.
Dust floats in the air.
STREET
BUMSTEAD's running.
He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash
in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn
-
but he made it
out alive...
CUT TO:
BUMSTEAD sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing
heavily
-
he's losing a lot of blood.
He waits.
A NOISE O.S. startles him
-
A FIGURE in the shadows across the
roof.
BUMSTEAD
White?
It's too big to be White.
The man steps from the shadows.
STROMBOLI (walking forward)
Hello, Bumstead.
He's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector.
Bumstead lies
bleeding, against the wall.
He points his own gun at the
advancing man and pulls the trigger.
CLICK!
CLICK!
CLICK!
BUMSTEAD
Dammit.
Stromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away,
picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall.
Without
Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand.
STROMBOLI
Why do you always have to find things
out the hard way!
Couldn't you just
do your job, you idiot?
I told you,
didn't I?
These people are not
playing games, Bumstead.
They can do
anything they want, don't you
understand?
BUMSTEAD (a hiss)
You're one of them.
You bastard...
STROMBOLI (laughing)
In a way, we all are, inspector!
You.
Me.
Everybody!
Stromboli carries Bumstead towards the EDGE of the roof.
He
keeps laughing.
STROMBOLI
Time for that early retirement,
Bumstead.
Didn't bring the gold watch
I'm afraid.
BUMSTEAD (weakly)
No...
Please...
INSPECTOR'S P.O.V.
THE EDGE looms up
-
a long drop to the street.
STREET
White paces nervously through empty streets.
He stops, to get
his bearings, then turns and runs into:
A SILHOUETTED FIGURE in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels.
A skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm.
An inhuman
moan.
Terrorised, White pulls back.
FIGURE
Ahhh...
it hurts!...
The mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall.
A
streetlight reveals...
DOCTOR SCHREBER covered in blood, encased in a metal framework
covered in silver blades.
WHITE
What happened to you?
SCHREBER
I'm...
being...
punished.
The blades are connected to the wheels
-
they turn when he
moves forward, metal cuts into his flesh, slowly SKINNING HIM
ALIVE.
A torture machine.
Between screams of intense pain, the
doctor speaks.
SCHREBER
I had to
-
ahhhh
-
find you...
I..
I...
The doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his
face.
WHITE
What is it?
SCHREBER
We are...
living in their dreams...
Schreber turns and rolls off into the night, screaming
-
BLADES
SPIN furiously, peeling back flesh.
He glances at White one
last time.
SCHREBER
Insect...
dreams...
STREET
WHITE is running.
As he approaches the building he hears a
scream
-
looks up to see a figure PLUNGE OFF the roof.
He runs over.
Looks down at the twisted body.
THE INSPECTOR
moans
-
barely alive.
White kneels by his side.
BUMSTEAD'S hand moves across to an expanding POOL of red beside
him, traces an 'H' on the ground in the blood.
WHITE (reading)
Aitch?
The inspector seems to be dying, then revives momentarily, puts
A MAP in white's hand, looks up at him:
BUMSTEAD
Gesundheit!
His eyes roll up and he GOES LIMP.
White stares at the body,
then:
WHITE

CITY
-
NIGHT
All over the city things START TO FALL APART
-
a devastating
impact on the landscape.
MONTAGE
A street CRACKS OPEN.
Beneath the pavement are pulsating
intestine-like organs.
These burst open with pus...
A building vanishes...
A car on a street corner flies into the air...
A telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging
itself into the concrete.
Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the
hole left behind...
Geysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky...
BLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone
steps...
THE CITY is coming apart...
