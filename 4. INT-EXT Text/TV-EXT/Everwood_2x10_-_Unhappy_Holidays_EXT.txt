     TOMMY and AMY emerge from the store.  She carries a bag.    * 
     Happy, playful, but still feeling the newness of all this:    * 
 
                         TOMMY              * 
               You know, you don't always have to buy       * 
               something.  You could just come in and,       * 
               you know, say hi.               * 
 
                         AMY                * 
               No, I really needed these...          * 
 
     She has to peek in the bag to remember.          * 
 
                         AMY (CONT'D)            * 
               Thumb tacks.                * 
 
                         TOMMY              * 
                   (a wry smile)              * 
               Really?  For what?              * 
 
     They round a corner and come to a stop.  Stand close, partly   * 
     to keep warm, partly 'cause it's more fun that way.       * 
 
                         AMY 
               Well... I have a corkboard... and things      * 
               that need tacked... and very delicate        * 
               thumbs.                  * 
 
     So cute.  Tommy smiles and kisses her thumb...  Then,      * 
     delicately, her lips.                * 
 
                         TOMMY              * 
               My shift's over in twenty minutes.  If       * 
               you want, we can hang out the rest of the      * 
               day.                  * 
 
                         AMY 
               I wish.  My grandparents flew in from 
               Arizona today.  I was supposed to be home 
               half an hour ago.

                         TOMMY 
               That's cool.  What are they here for? 
 
                         AMY 
               Tomorrow's Thanksgiving, freak.  You 
               really need to invest in a calendar. 
 
                         TOMMY 
               Man, I totally forgot.  Well, that should 
               be fun, right?  Big family turkey thing. 
 
                         AMY 
               Oh, it's a party.  Three generations of 
               people who hate each other fighting over 
               who gets the white meat.  I guess it's 
               probably the same at your house, right? 
 
                         TOMMY 
               We don't really do holidays at my house. 
               Not so big on traditions. 
 
                         AMY 
               You're kidding.  So what are you gonna do 
               tomorrow night? 
 
                         TOMMY 
               I don't know.  Probably nothing. 
 
     Amy considers his plight, her ingenue mind gets to work. 
 
                         AMY 
               You have to come to my house. 
                   (before he can protest) 
               There's gonna be like a thousand people 
               there anyway.  It's not like one more is 
               gonna kill anyone.  And my mom makes this 
               awesome cranberry thing.  You'd love it. 
 
     Tommy tenderly pushes a strand of hair out of her eyes. 
 
                         TOMMY 
               You're really sweet, aren't you? 
 
                         AMY 
                   (embarrassed) 
               No.  I just... 
 
     They're about to kiss again, but then: 
 
                         EDNA (O.S.) 
               I don't believe we've met.

     Amy yanks her hand free.  Turns to find EDNA on the sidewalk 
     nearby.  Amy goes red as a Christmas ornament. 
 
                         TOMMY 
               Grandma... 
 
                         EDNA 
                   (extending her hand) 
               Edna Harper, Amy's favorite grandmother. 
 
                         TOMMY 
                   (shaking her hand) 
               Tommy Callahan. 
 
     Amy dies a little. 
 
                         TOMMY (CONT'D) 
               Well, I've gotta get back to work.  It 
               was a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Harper. 
               I guess I'll see you tomorrow at dinner. 
 
     Amy smiles at his acceptance of the invite.  Edna glances at 
     Amy, and clues in quickly. 
 
                         EDNA 
               I guess you will. 
 
     Tommy heads back inside.  As Amy studies the ground, 
 
                         EDNA (CONT'D) 
               So who's the new co-pilot? 
 
                         AMY 
               Nobody.  Just a guy. 
 
                         EDNA 
               Just a guy, my boots.  No granddaughter 
               of mine goes around holding hands with a 
               guy who's "just a guy." 
                   (Amy dies some more) 
               See you and your friend at the big turkey 
               day gorge-athon. 
 
     Edna gives her a reassuring wink and a smile, then leaves her 
     to bask.  Off Amy, wishing everyone was like Grama Edna. 
 
 
     Madison opens to find Ephram standing in the cold.  She 
     instantly shakes her head, "no."  A reflex by now. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Ephram, please... 
 
     But he's desperate to plead his case. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               You were right.  We should've told my dad 
               right away.  That was my mistake. 
 
                         MADISON 
               I don't think it would have made a 
               difference.

               Maybe, maybe not.  But it would have been 
               the more adult way to handle it.  And 
               from now on, I'm going to be more adult 
               when it comes to me and you. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Ephram... 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Look, you may have had a million 
               boyfriends already, but I've never had a 
               real girlfriend.  I've never liked 
               someone this much who actually liked me 
               back in the same way, at the same time 
               that I like them...   I think it's 
               something I have to fight for. 
 
                         MADISON 
               Fight how?  Your dad is not gonna change 
               his mind about us... 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               So what?  That's his problem.  End of the 
               day, my dad can't stop me.  He can't stop 
               this from happening.  Only you can. 
 
     Madison's defenses begin to melt. 
 
                         MADISON 
               So let's say we can convince your dad-- 
               What about everyone else?  Your friends 
               and my friends... the government. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Bush has his hands full.  And as far as 
               my friends go, I've got about two.  And 
               one of them is you.  So as my friend, how 
               would you feel about me dating Madison? 
 
                         MADISON 
               I dunno.  She is a pretty cool chick. 
 
     Ephram smiles.  He's winning.... He steps in closer. 
 
                         MADISON (CONT'D) 
               I guess I can always claim insanity if 
               anyone presses charges. 
 
     She finally opens the door to let him in.  They share a small 
     kiss then she spots DELIA in the car.  Her hopeful face 
     pressed against the window.

     FADE IN: 
 
 
     Andy and a giddy Delia make their way through a mini-forest 
     of displaced trees.  Delia beelines for the giants. 
 
                         DELIA 
               This one! 
                   (the next tree) 
               No, this one's bigger. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What was our deal? 
 
                         DELIA 
               "Nothing taller than the house." 
 
     Fine.  They walk, rounding another evergreen corner to find: 
     LINDA.  She smiles at Delia, who still doesn't like her much. 
 
                         LINDA 
               Hey there.  Find anything you like? 
 
                         DELIA 
               Not yet.  Dad, come on, we have to keep 
               looking. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               You look for awhile, okay?  Let me know 
               when you pick one. 
 
                         DELIA 
               But then we have to take it home fast. 
               Otherwise it'll die. 
 
     Delia clomps off. 
 
                         LINDA 
               The Browns celebrate Christmas? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Delia proudly identifies as Jewish until 
               it's time to pick the biggest tree on the 
               lot. 
 
     A beat.  There's a lot of awkward still left between these 
     two.  Andy blinks first.

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               No, I can't.  I need to apologize.  I've      *

               I noticed.

               It's a signature move.  But I couldn't       *

               reasons to steer clear of you spiraling      *

               kids will react.  And then there's always      *

               As you may remember, asking you out was a      * 
               pretty spectacular failure.  Your        *

     It starts to come down, making a pretty scene even prettier.   * 
 
                         LINDA 
               I used to have this obsession with the 
               first snowfall of the year when I was 
               young.  I don't know what it was...  I       * 
               just thought this is something so perfect 
               and pure, the start of something... 
 
     And he KISSES her.  Just like that, without prelude or     * 
     hesitation.  Long and deep and real under the freshly falling  * 
     snow and picture-perfect trees.  Couldn't help himself... 
 
     It's everything we want for both of them... 
 
     Until we REVEAL:  DELIA.  Hidden in the trees.  She saw the 
     whole thing.  And is not happy.  He promised.
