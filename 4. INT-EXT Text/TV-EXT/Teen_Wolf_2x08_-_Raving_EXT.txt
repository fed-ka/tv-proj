      The Porsche ROARS out of the darkness, HEADLIGHTS falling 
      over the paint-chipped walls of an old warehouse. 

      Jackson steps out and removes his phone from his pocket. With 
      the click of his thumb, detailed instructions appear in a 
      text message - Take NW door. Left to stairs. Down 2 flights.


      With Scott riding shotgun, Stiles pulls his Jeep into the 
      parking lot amid students hurrying for first period.

                                  SCOTT
                    There s got to be some other way to 
                    get tickets, right?

                                  STILES
                    It s a secret show. There s only 
                    one way. And it s a secret.

      At the bike racks, Matt notices them getting out of the Jeep. 
      Snapping his bike lock in place, he hurries to catch up.

                                  MATT
                    Hey, either of you know why 
                    nobody s getting suspended for what 
                    happened the other day?

                                  STILES
                    Forget about it. Nobody got hurt.

                                  MATT
                    I got a concussion.

                                  STILES
                    Nobody got seriously hurt.

                                  MATT
                    I was in the ER for six hours.

                                  STILES
                    You really want the truth, Matt? 
                    Your little bump on the head is 
                    about this high on our list of 
                    problems right now.

      While Stiles holds his hand as low as his arm will reach,  
      Scott steps in to give a more sincere response. 

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you okay?

                                  MATT
                    Yeah. Fine now. And I saw you 
                    didn t get tickets last night

                                  SCOTT
                    You know if they re still selling?

                                  MATT
                    No. I managed to find two online. 
                    You should keep trying. Sounds like 
                      everyone s going to be there.

      FIRST BELL RINGS and Matt heads off.

                                  STILES
                    You sure about this?

                                  SCOTT
                    Last time, whoever s controlling 
                    Jackson had to kill someone because 
                    he couldn t finish the job. So what 
                    do you think he s going to do this 
                    time?

                                  STILES
                    Be there to make sure it happens.


      Charging down the steps from the house, Stiles nearly 
      collides with Stilinski returning home.

                                  STILES
                    Can t talk, gotta  run.

      He heads for his Jeep. But as Stilinski starts up the steps 
      with his coat in his hands, Stiles skids back into view.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?

                                  STILINSKI
                    Nothing. What do you mean?

                                  STILES
                    You don t have your gun. You always 
                    have your gun.

      He points to the lack of sidearm underneath Stilinski s coat.

                                  STILINSKI

                                  STILINSKI
                    It s all right. We can talk about

                    Actually, no. But it s fine. Don t 
                    worry about it. We re going to be

                    Dad... Why aren t you angry at me?

      Stilinski looks at the coat in his hands as if the answer 
      might lie somewhere in its folds.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I don t know. Maybe right now I 
                    just don t want to feel any worse 
                    than I already do by having to yell 
                    at my son.

      He turns, heading for the door while leaving a guilt-ridden 
      Stiles standing alone at edge of the steps.


      Allison s car slides into a space outside the warehouse. She 
      and Matt step out while other cars drift in.

                                  MATT
                    Sorry I couldn t drive. My Dad 
                    usually lends me the car.

                    No problem. I m used to it. I mean 
                    I was.

                                  MATT
                    You mean Scott.

      She nods. An awkward moment that becomes even more awkward as 
      he holds out his hand for her. She reluctantly takes it. As 
      they disappear into the building--

      Stiles s Jeep swings around the corner and skids to a halt. 
      He and Scott jump out and move to the back of the Jeep where 
      TWO LARGE BAGS OF ASH lie.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1225.

                    This plan is starting to suck.

      But Scott doesn t hear him. Head turned up, he catches a 
      scent. Then begins to back away.

                                  SCOTT
                          (to himself)
                    No... Not here. Not now.

      Bag of ash in his arms, Stiles watches Scott racing for the 
      entrance to the building.

                                  STILES
                    Scott? Scott what am I supposed

      Doors open on each side of TWO BLACK SUVS. Argent s men step 
      out and fall into line behind him. They pass by Gerard who 
      stands between the HEADLIGHTS on one vehicle.

                                  GERARD
                    Careful, gentlemen.

      He glances up past the roof of the building where ominous 
      clouds gather above.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Something wicked this way comes.


      Turning the corner of the building, Argent and his men head 
      for the entrance. But they pause when TWO SILHOUETTES appear 
      standing just ahead of them.

      Derek and Boyd step into the light.

                                  ARGENT
                    Derek. Back off.

                    Back off? That s all you ve got? I 
                    was kind of hoping for a little 
                    more hard-edged tough guy talk from 
                    the veteran werewolf hunter.

                                  ARGENT
                          (with a smile)
                    Okay, then. How about... Didn t 
                    anyone ever tell you not to bring 
                    claws to a gunfight?

      A CHORUS OF METAL KA-CHUNKS and CLANGS fill the air as 
      shotguns and handguns come up. Boyd leans over to Derek.

                                  BOYD
                    That one sounded pretty good.


      A HAIL OF SOUND-SUPPRESSED BULLETS PUNCTURES the side of the 
      building as Boyd pushes up the arms of a gun-wielding Hunter. 

      Derek flips past them and kicks out, sending another Hunter 
      soaring across the pavement.

      BULLET CLIPS falling to the ground, Argent slips around a 
      corner to reload. 

      Fangs out for blood, Boyd s eyes flare YELLOW as he launches 
      toward a downed Hunter for the kill--

      But is DRAGGED BACK to the pavement by Derek who snaps his 
      head around to SNARL at him, sending his beta scrambling 
      back.

      When Derek turns again, PINS FIRE FROM A TASER INTO HIS RIGHT 
      SIDE with a burst of BLUE ELECTRICITY.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 208" WHITE2/7/1231.

      Another pair of PINS catch him on his left side, sending him 
      to his knees. He cries out in pain while--


      On the parking side of the building, Gerard cautiously 
      approaches the wall to discover something on the ground.

      A thin line of GRAY ASH.

      He kneels down to inspect it, fingers reaching out. But just 
      before touching it, he pauses. Hand hovering just near the 
      ash, he slowly draws back.

      Stepping into a retreat, he turns and quickly hurries off.


      Inching around the building, Stiles carefully spreads a thin 
      line of mountain ash on the ground from the plastic bag. But 
      then he pauses, lifting the plastic bag up to see there s 
      only a handful left inside.

      He whirls around. Over twenty yards away lies the other end 
      of the ash barrier. Stiles glances at the handful left in the 
      bag.

                                  STILES
                    No...

      He doesn t have enough to complete the barrier. Not nearly 
      enough.


      Scott slams out a door of the warehouse to finds himself in a 
      deserted alleyway. Just as he s reaching into his pocket for 
      his phone, HEADLIGHTS BLIND HIM.

      Tires BURNING UP the pavement, a BLACK SUV charges toward 
      Scott and SLAMS RIGHT INTO HIM.

      Scott s body LAUNCHES into the air. With a bone-smacking 
      CRASH, he tumbles across the pavement and lies still.

      The door to the SUV clicks open. And Victoria Argent casually 
      steps out to view her handiwork with a particularly pleased 
      smile.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      With the last bit of mountain ash clutched in his hand, a 
      panicked Stiles shouts at Scott through his phone.

                                  STILES
                    Scott, pick up. Pick up now. I ve 
                    still got like two hundred feet to

                    ass over here and help me because I 
                    don t know what to do. I m out here 
                    alone and I m hearing gunfire and 
                      werewolves and I m standing like an 
                    idiot with a handful of magic fairy 
                    dust and realizing I don t have 
                    enough.

      He hangs up, pocketing the phone while looking helplessly at 
      the pile of ash in his hand.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Okay, he said believe. Need to 
                    believe. Believe, Stiles. Picture 
                    it. Imagine it working. Imagine...

      He stops talking, noticing a car lined up with others. It has 
      a bumper sticker that reads: 

      Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Einstein

      Strangely calm now, Stiles looks back down to the ash in his 
      palm. With a breath, he slowly turns his palm and begins 
      walking, letting the last of the ash drift down--

      Where it connects with the other end of the barrier.

      Stunned, Stiles whirls around to find that somehow with no 
      more than a few steps and a handful of ash, he's crossed over 
      twenty yards and connected the two lines of ash.

      The barrier is complete.


      Argent s phone LIGHTS UP in his pocket, VIBRATING as he drags 
      one of his Hunters behind a dumpster for cover. Breathing 
      hard, he glances at Allison s text while a few yards away--

      Derek, also breathless, eases a bloodied Boyd against the 
      side of the building.

                                  BOYD

                    have to go. Take the car.

                                  BOYD
                    What about you?

                                  DEREK
                    I need to find Scott. Go.

      Keys in hand, Boyd begins to back away. Derek turns around, 
      allowing a flash of pain to fall over his face as his Beta 
      retreats behind him.


      Concert over, people begin streaming out the door, heading 
      for their cars. Stiles races from the crowd. His eyes 
      immediately land on Derek approaching.

                                  STILES
                    Jackson s still inside. We lost him 
                    but...

      He notices Isaac and Erica paused on the warehouse side of 
      the ash, looking frightened. They can t cross.

      But then a sound rises above the chatter of the crowd, 
      soaring into Derek s super hearing. A HOWLING.

                                  DEREK
                    Scott.

      Without even thinking, Derek bolts for the warehouse. But his 
      boots stop right in front of the ASH BARRIER. He can t move.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Stiles! Stiles, break the barrier!

                                  STILES
                    Are you kidding? It s working. For 
                    the first time ever one of our 
                    plans is actually working!

                                  DEREK
                    Scott s dying.

                                  STILES
                    What? How do you know--

                                  DEREK
                    I just know! Break the barrier. Do 
                    it now.

      His voice THUNDERS at him. Nearly shaken off his feet, Stiles 
      hurries toward the ash line. He kneels in front of it, brings 
      his hand up with the palm out, and swings down.


      A back door opens. Allison hurries out, glancing around. 
      Hearing SIRENS she turns and SCREAMS.

                                  GERARD
                    It s just me.

      Gerard reaches for her, pulling her away from the building.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    We better get you out of here.

                                    ALLISON
                            (distraught)
                    It didn t work. None of it worked.

      With a smile, he puts a protective arm around her.

                                  GERARD
                      I wouldn t say that. In fact, I d 
                    say the prognosis isn t nearly as 
                    dire as it seems.
                          (eyeing the ash barrier)
                    Not nearly.


      Boots crushing gravel beneath him, Argent rushes around the 
      corner of the building and into the dimly lit alleyway. Gun 
      in hand, he searches the shadows and then sees her.

      Victoria pushes herself off the side of the building and 
      starts toward him.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Chris...

      Stepping into the light, she pulls a hand from her shoulder 
      to reveal the aftermath of her confrontation with Derek. The 
      imprints in the blood are unmistakable. It s a bite mark.

      The bite of an Alpha.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
