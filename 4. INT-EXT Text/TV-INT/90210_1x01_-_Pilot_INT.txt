  HARRY MILLS (40, fun dad, but tough when he needs to be) is 
  driving with his wife CELIA MILLS (40, athletic, naturally-
  pretty) and their teenage children, ANNIE (16, pretty, level-
  headed, smart) and DIXON MILLS (African-American, 16, handsome, 
  a leader).

                                  HARRY
                    How cool is this?  Palm trees, Star 
                    Maps, Rodeo Drive...

                                  DIXON
                    It s going to suck.

                                  CELIA
                    How about a new word Dixon? Like 
                     this blows  because you ve been 
                    saying this sucks for the past 1800 
                    miles.  

                                  HARRY
                    Guys. This is where we re at. Look, 
                    your mother and I gave up a lot for 
                    this move too.

                                  ANNIE
                    Really?  Did you give up a 
                    boyfriend and the lead in a school 
                    play?

                                  HARRY
                    As a matter of fact I did.  His 
                    name was Joshua and the play was 
                     Fiddler on the Roof.   

  The kids start to laugh.

                                  DIXON
                    Such a dork. 

                                  HARRY
                    Look, we had no idea Grandma was 
                    going to get into trouble again.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    She s too old to be drinking and 
                    falling without any of us around to 
                    help. 

                                  CELIA
                    So let s just make the best of it, 
                    okay?

                                  DIXON
                    As I said.  It s going to--

                                  CELIA
                    Dixon!

                                  ANNIE
                    Suck.

  The U-Haul turns up Rexford into the Beverly Hills flats.



  HARRY is driving Annie and Dixon to school on their first day.      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           4.


                                  HARRY
                    Look, I know this isn t easy.  
                    You re not just the new kids, 
                    you re the new principal s kids. 

                                  ANNIE
                    A two-fer.  Yay for us!

                                  HARRY
                    And I m sorry you re coming into 
                    school a week after its already 
                    started. That can be hard too but-- 

                                  DIXON
                    Yeah, yeah.  Okay, Stop the car. 
                    Stop the car.

                                  HARRY
                    What?

                                  ANNIE
                    You just said it.  We re the 
                      principal s kids.  We can t drive 
                    into school with the principal!

                                  DIXON
                    We ll walk from here.

                                  HARRY
                    The lot is half a mile away, let me 
                    at least get a little clo--

                                  ANNIE
                    Stop it.

                                  DIXON
                    Pull over.

                                  ANNIE
                    Now.  Dad.  Please.  We know what 
                    we re doing



  Harry Mills walks with KELLY TAYLOR (you know her, you love 
  her), a teacher.

                                  HARRY
                    So what year did you graduate?

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    All I ll admit to is that I m 
                    younger than you.  So tell me, how 
                    weird is it being the principal at 
                    your old high school?

                                  HARRY
                    Probably about as weird and 
                    stressful as you teaching at it. 

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    Nah, not even close.  The last two 
                      principals both had heart attacks. 
                    Anyway, have a great first day.



    Rehearsals are underway for the fall musical, SPRING AWAKENING.  
  On stage, girls in skimpy half-shirt dance-wear are watching as 
    good-looking boys are performing the upbeat  The Bitch Of 
  Living.   They are very good.  Annie approaches the stage to 
  watch the performance, in shock at the talent level.

                                  ANNIE
                    Hi.  Excuse me. I m Annie Mills. 
                    I m new and--

                                  MISS AUSTIN
                    Yes, yes. Welcome! Your father told 
                    me you were a theater nerd. That s 
                    awesome.  He said you had a DVD of 
                    your show from last spring.  I d 
                    love to see what they do in 
                    Wichita.

  WE HARD FLASH CUT TO:

  BACK TO REAL TIME

  Annie fumbles with her pack.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    You know, I can t find that DVD 
                    right now but I love  Spring 
                      Awakening ... Or what I saw of it 
                    on YouTube and the Tonys.

                                  DRAMA TEACHER
                    Well, unfortunately all of the 
                    roles are filled.  We audition 
                    before school starts so we can hit 
                    the ground running.  But you should 
                      definitely sign up for drama class.  
                    It s fun and we definitely need 
                    help with the scenery.

  Annie sighs...



  Dixon enters. The class skews a bit  nerd.  They glance up, eye 
  Dixon in his Kansas City Chiefs jersey. Definitely not a nerd. 
  They shoot furtive glances at each other.  There s a bit of 
  whispering.

  Dixon takes one of the many available seats away from the 
  others, but he s very aware of the consternation he s causing. A 
  TRACY Flick-Type, finally pipes up.

                                  TRACY FLICK-TYPE
                    Uh... Are you in the right place? 
                    Because this is quiz bowl.

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    This is the quiz bowl team.  We do 
                    quizzes.

  On Dixon, so this is how it s gonna be.

                                  DIXON
                    This isn t bowling? Cuz that s why 
                    I signed up.  Easy  A.      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           8.


                                  TRACY FLICK-TYPE
                    No. We don t bowl.

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    I can t believe he just said that.

  The TARDY BELL RINGS and a NERD OF A TEACHER enters and closes 
  the door. He also reacts when he sees Dixon.

                                  QUIZ BOWL COACH
                    Uh, hello there, son. Are you sure 
                    you re in the right place? This is 
                    quiz bowl.

  Dixon sighs. 

                                  TRACY FLICK-TYPE
                    I tried to tell him.

  Suddenly, we hear standard NEWS INTRO MUSIC.

                                  NAVID
                    Can we settle the who s-supposed-to-
                    be-where thing after the news? I 
                    produced this package.

  This is NAVID SHIRAZI. In this nerd universe, he is king. 

  ANGLE ON THE TV mounted in the room. Impressive (by high school 
    standards) graphics fly across the screen.

  ANGLE ON THE TALKING HEAD ON-SCREEN.

                                  HANNAH (ON TV)
                    Good morning. I m Hannah Zuckerman- 
                    Vasquez, and this is your Blaze 
                    morning report for Thursday, 
                    September fourth. Today s top 
                    story, West Beverly today welcomes 
                    a new principal.



  We are now with Annie in her class watching the monitor.  The 
  teacher, RYAN MATTHEWS (25, cool, sarcastic, think Ryan Gosling) 
  turns the TV off.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Alright, so obviously let s give a 
                    warm West Beverly welcome to our 
                    newest student, Annie Mills.

  There is a smattering of applause.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           9.


                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    Come on. You guys can do better 
                    than that.

  The class claps louder.  They love their teacher.  GEORGE EVANS, 
  lacrosse rich boy and general asshole coughs out...

                                  GEORGE EVANS
                    Narc. 

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Good job, George.  Now there s 
                    another girl who will never go out 
                    with you.  

  The class laughs at George.  ANNIE appreciates the rescue.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    And who knows? Maybe you re the 
                    narc trying to pin it on someone 
                    else.

  The class chants  Narc  at George.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    Anyway, since Annie is coming in 
                    after the first week, I thought we 
                    would help her get acclimated by 
                    assigning her a friend.  A Beverly 
                    Buddy if you will.

  At that moment, NAOMI BENNETT, (16, West Beverly Hills High 
  icon) enters.  She s dressed to the nines and loves an entrance.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    Whoa.  What a surprise.  Hi Naomi.  
                    Glad you could join us because I 
                    think you would be a great Beverly 
                    Buddy for Annie.

                                  NAOMI
                    Is that one of those Special Ed 
                    kids again?  If so. Not interested. 
                    That kid broke my purse.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    I warned you about keeping 
                    chocolate in there.  Look you re 
                    the queen of the school and you can 
                    show Annie the ropes, maybe even 
                    invite her to that big birthday 
                    bash of yours this weekend so she 
                    can make some friends.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           10.


  Naomi glares at Mr. Matthews.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS (CONT D)
                    Oh and how s that paper coming 
                    along?

                                  NAOMI
                    Oh I m all over it.

  The class laughs.



  Naomi walks up to Annie.

                                  NAOMI
                    Look, I m sure you re really nice 
                    and all that, but you can find your 
                    way around without me.

                                  ANNIE
                    Totally, I don t need a Beverly 
                    Buddy.

                                  NAOMI
                    And the party, that s not going to 
                    happen either.  No offense, I just 
                    don t know you.

                                  ANNIE
                    Of course.  That was just the 
                    teacher trying to be nice.

                                  NAOMI
                    That was the teacher being a dick.  
                    He hates me, he s trying to pile 
                    work onto me when he knows I have 
                    my party this week.  But my mom and 
                    dad are going to get his ass fired.  
                    My mom used to date the new 
                    principal in high school before she 
                    dumped him for my dad. 

                                  ANNIE
                    Your mom dated the new principal?

                                  NAOMI
                    Oh yeah.  Total dork.  

  Naomi exits around the corner and Annie sees the SIGN UP SHEET 
  for SPRING AWAKENING stagehands.  She moves to sign up.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           11.

                    That s not going to be an easy  A  
                    ya know...Adrianna will make you 
                    her slave. 

  Annie turns around and sees Ethan.  She blushes.

                                  ANNIE
                    Oh, I... Just--

                                  ETHAN
                    I m Ethan.

                                  ANNIE
                    Annie.  Who s Adrianna?

                                  ETHAN
                    I think you know her.  Adrianna, 
                    she s going to help out with the 
                    play.

  Adrianna comes over to Ethan and gives Annie the once over.  
  Annie realizes that Adrianna doesn t recognize her from the 
  parking lot fellatio.

                                  ANNIE
                    I wanted to audition but I guess I 
                    moved here too late.  So next 
                    Spring--

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Who s your agent?

                                  ANNIE
                    Agent? Um. I don t have--

                                  ADRIANNA
                    How embarrassing. Anyway, maybe one 
                    of the 818 s will cover you if you 
                    drop some weight.  Of course it 
                    will be hard to get noticed in the 
                    chorus.

                                  ANNIE
                          (friendly)
                    Well then I guess I ll have to be 
                    one of the leads.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Hey, good luck with that.

  Naomi spies Ethan and rushes over.  She gives him a long kiss. 
  Annie starts putting it all together.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           12.


                                  NAOMI
                    Where have you been?  I was late 
                    for homeroom looking for you.

                                  ETHAN
                    Just getting my lacrosse stick 
                    waxed.  Got tryouts later.

                                  NAOMI
                    Well, don t get so focused on your 
                    stupid lacrosse that you forget 
                    about me.  

  Naomi leans in to kiss Adrianna.

                                  NAOMI (CONT D)
                    How was rehearsal?

                                  ADRIANNA
                    I was like ten minutes late and 
                    Miss Austin made this BFD about it.

                                  ETHAN
                    Annie, this is Naomi.  My 
                      girlfriend.

                                  NAOMI
                    We ve met.  And Ethan and I are 
                      practically engaged. So look and 
                    admire, but don t touch or I will 
                    have you killed.

  Annie steals a quick look at Adrianna who has looked away.  
  Ethan caught Annie looking.

                                  ETHAN
                    It s good to be loved, huh, Annie?

  The bell rings.  Everyone goes off to class, the halls empty, 
  leaving Annie alone.  A teacher comes up to her.

                                            ACT TWO



  Two polished forty-something s wearing ten grand in casual wear 
  sit in office chairs. This is MR. AND MRS. BENNETT, Naomi s 
  parents.

                                    CHARLES BENNETT
                    --I know it s been a while since we 
                    went here, Harry, but I seem to 
                    recall the teachers  job was to 
                    enable the kids, not obstruct them--

  Harry sits beside Kelly Taylor and Ryan Matthews. 

                                  HARRY
                    Mr. Matthews wasn t obstructing 
                    Naomi, Charlie.  He s making sure 
                    she does her assignment like all--

                                    CHARLES BENNETT
                    --can I finish? And it s Charles, 
                    now. We re not kids anymore. For 
                    this young punk to threaten Naomi 
                    with an incomplete and for her 
                    advisor Ms. Taylor to back him is 
                    absurd.  It s one paper, it can t 
                    wait until next week?  She has an 
                    important function--

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Oh come on, it s a birthday party 
                    for a spoiled little-

                                  HARRY
                    Mr. Matthews, I got it.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    Do you see what we re dealing with, 
                    Harry?

                                  HARRY
                    I see that she hasn t done the 
                      assignment.  What am I missing 
                    here?  Just write the paper.

                                    CHARLES BENNETT
                    So you re going to go along with 
                    this giving Naomi an incomplete?     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           14.


                                  HARRY
                    Let s be clear. Naomi already has 
                    an incomplete. This project was due 
                    a week ago and she failed to turn 
                    it in.  Mr. Matthews rightly 
                    insisted she complete it.  Aren t 
                    those the facts, Ms. Taylor?

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    Yes.  We agreed she could still get 
                    a grade if she turned it in by 
                    Friday. If not, then her grade goes 
                    from an  I  to an  F  and she can 
                    kiss Yale good-bye.

  Harry gives a steady look. Mr. Bennett glares back, stands.

                                    CHARLES BENNETT
                    You should have stayed in Kansas, 
                    Harry.  I m calling the 
                      superintendent and you ll be the 
                    ones kissing your tiny little jobs 
                    good-bye.

  Mr. Bennett exits.  Tracy Bennett takes her time standing. 

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    Ironic, isn t it, Harry?  If things 
                    happened differently, we could have 
                    been talking about our kid.

  Kelly and Ryan exchange an  oh shit  look.  Mrs. Bennett exits.  

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Whoa.  That sounded interesting.

                                  HARRY
                    Little advice, Mr. Matthews. I hear 
                    you re a good teacher, but you re a 
                    tad casual with your mouth.  This 
                    isn t your Facebook page so show 
                    some respect for others.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Sorry, I was just-- thanks for 
                    backing me.  See ya around.

  Ryan exits.

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    He is a little mouthy, but the kids 
                    love him, he grades surprisingly 
                    hard, and they really learn.      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           15.


  An awkward beat.

                                  HARRY
                    Mrs. Bennett and I went out for a 
                    bit back in high school.

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    Yeah, no shit.

  A beat, then they both laugh.



  Dixon heads through the halls, late. Still some straggling 
  clumps of fashionable Bev Hills kids. Dixon glances from his 
  schedule to a passing younger kid.

                                  DIXON
                    Hey. The secondary gym?

                                    YOUNGER KID
                    Uh. I m a freshman.

  Dixon shakes his head. Great. Then, a girl s voice.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    One floor up.

  Dixon turns, sees the source of the info. A DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY 
  who takes his breath away.

                                    DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY
                          (playfully smart-assed)
                    That s why it s called the 
                      secondary.  Second floor. They re 
                    clever like that.  You re cute, 
                    though. Run with that...

  Dixon gapes at Dark-Haired Beauty. The two girls she s walking 
  with titter. Dark-Haired Beauty shoots one more smouldering look 
  back over her shoulder at Dixon, and then she s gone. 



  ANNIE is on the floor painting some scenery when a hand-painted 
  Converse shoe steps on her notebook indicating a band sticker...

                                  SILVER (O.S.)
                    What s this?     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           16.


  Annie looks up. She s being addressed by SILVER. Dark hair. 
  Pretty. Aggressively  different.  Annie can t figure out why she 
  she s pissed off.

                                  ANNIE
                    A  Future Clouds and Radar  
                    sticker.

                                  SILVER
                      Impossible. They have like eight 
                    fans in the whole world. Where d 
                    you get it, new kid?

                                  ANNIE
                    Brandon Flowers put one of their 
                    songs on his celebrity playlist, so 
                    I checked  em out.

  A very slight smile now comes over Silver s face.

                                  SILVER
                    Nice. Exactly how I found them. 

  Silver plunks down her belongings and drops down next to her.

                                  SILVER
                    I m Silver.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m Annie.

                                  SILVER
                    I know.  It s all over the news.

                                  ANNIE
                    Silver?

                                  SILVER
                    Just Silver.  Look princess, I 
                    wasn t planning on making you feel 
                    welcome here but then I saw the 
                    sticker. So where have you been all 
                    my life?

                                  ANNIE
                    Preparing for this moment..?

                                  SILVER
                    Wow.  The principal s daughter is 
                    funny too. What a shocker.

                                  ANNIE
                    Thank you and nice to meet you too.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           17.


                                  SILVER
                    Oh, you ll learn to dig me. I m 
                    totally benevolent.

  Annie and Silver crack up.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yay! A friend.

  A nice moment until a hand drops on Annie s shoulder. She looks 
  up, discovers Naomi.

                                  NAOMI
                    I need to borrow you.  Now.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah. Okay.

                                  SILVER
                    Hey Naomi. If you need help 
                      practicing turning Wheel of Fortune 
                    letters, I can totally carve out 
                    some time.

  Naomi waves bye-bye over her shoulder as she leads Annie away. 

                                  ANNIE
                    What are you borrowing me for?

                                  NAOMI
                    Actually, I m saving you. She s not 
                    good for the rep, she s way too 
                    weird.  And I felt bad about this 
                    morning, kind of bugging out on you 
                    and stuff, but I was all peri-oidal 
                    when I couldn t find Ethan but I m 
                    back now so, hi.  

                                  ANNIE
                    So are you and Adrianna good 
                    friends?

                                  NAOMI
                    Best. Is this because she was a 
                    bitch to you?  She just gets all 
                    psycho when she s doing a show.  A 
                    lot of pressure and has to, like, 
                    double up on the Ritalin.

  They ve arrived in the back corner. Two other hot girls slump in 
  chairs. They re supposed to be working on scenery but that s not 
  going to happen.      "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           18.

                    Anyway, if you re really into the 
                    acting thing you should talk to

  Naomi sits, pats the next chair. Annie looks around. Sits.  

  ANGLE ON SILVER watching as Annie sits with the  it  girls. 



  Adrianna is at her station in chemistry lab when the Michael 
  Cera type from Quiz Bowl walks up to her.

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    I accidentally grabbed your book... 
                    by accident.

                                  ADRIANNA
                    Yeah.  I guess I got yours too.

  They switch books and the Michael Cera kid goes back to his lab 
  station.  Adrianna puts the book beneath the desk so nobody can 
  see and opens it.  There is a cut out hole in the middle of the 
  book containing a bag of several pills. Seconal, Halcion, Xanax, 
  you name it, it s there.  There is also a note that reads  $600. 
    Tomorrow .

  She looks over at the Michael Cera kid and gives him a nod.  
  There is fear in her eyes, but after she places the book in her 
  backpack she returns to her studied indifference.



  Annie sits amongst the swans with her tray.  Naomi hands her two 
  invitations which, at first glance, look like mini movie posters 
  for La Dolce Vita.

                                  NAOMI
                    Oh and let me give you these.  Two 
                    invites to my not-so-sweet 16 
                    party.  It s Friday night.  It ll 
                    be the best night of your life.  I 
                    promise. What do you say?

                                  ANNIE
                    I d love to.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           21.


                                  NAOMI
                    Great.  We ll obviously have to get 
                    you some new clothes though.  
                    Because if this is what you wore on 
                    day one I d hate to see day two.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m not a real clothes horse.

                                  NAOMI
                    That ll change.  You can take 
                    something from my closet.

                                  ANNIE
                    Really?

                                  NAOMI
                    Of course.  Oh and I almost forgot. 
                    Ya know I googled you and you re 
                    like honor roll girl and top of 
                    your class and all that.

                                  ANNIE
                    Well, when your dad s a principal--

                                  NAOMI
                    Anyway, since I m so crazed this 
                    week and since we re friends now 
                    you could write my lit paper for 
                    Mr. Matthews class.

                                  ANNIE
                    Uh--

                                  NAOMI
                    And I need it before Friday.  And 
                    since you didn t tell me your dad 
                    was the new principal, I know 
                    you re good at keeping secrets. 

                                  ANNIE
                    I don t think I can do this.

                                  NAOMI
                    Of course you can.  It s easy. I 
                    can make your life amazing or a 
                    living hell.  Not so hard, right?

                                      ACT THREE



  The Mills family and Tabitha are gathered around the table 
  having dinner.

                                  CELIA
                    A fight?  You got in a fight on 
                    your first day?

                                    TABITHA
                    Did you kick his ass?

                                  HARRY
                    Mom.

                                    TABITHA
                    What?  That wasn t the first thing 
                    you thought of when you heard he 
                    was in a fight?  Then maybe that s 
                    why he lost.

                                  DIXON
                    I didn t lose.

                                    TABITHA
                    Never worry about being fair. Just 
                    grab on to his jewels and twist 
                    them like a garbage bag.

                                  HARRY
                    Okay, Mom.  And for what it s 
                    worth, I heard he got in some good 
                    shots.

                                  CELIA
                    That s not the point.

                                  HARRY
                    No, it s not the point at all.  I m 
                    just saying--

                                    TABITHA
                    Well I think I m going to let you 
                    kids hash this out alone.  I m 
                    going to call Dan Tana s for some 
                    take out...not that your KFC wasn t 
                    to die for.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           23.


  Tabitha exits.

                                  DIXON
                    He slashed me and I retaliated.

                                  HARRY
                    You know the retaliator always gets 
                    caught.  You have to control your 
                    temper.

                                  DIXON
                    I know, but I didn t start it.  And 
                    that Ethan dude, he was looking 
                    right at us.  He knows, but he 
                    wouldn t say anything.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m not surprised.  I don t trust 
                    Ethan Ward at all.

                                  CELIA
                    You know him?

                                  ANNIE
                    Sort of.  He s just kinda sleazy, 
                    you know?  Like everyone worships 
                    him but I don't think he s a very 
                    good person.

  Tabitha sticks her head back in.

                                    TABITHA
                    Was it racially motivated?

                                  CELIA
                    Tabitha, please.

                                  DIXON
                    So what are the coaches going to 
                    do? 

                                  HARRY
                    Look.  They clearly want you on the 
                    team.  It will all be settled 
                    tomorrow.

                                  CELIA
                    And Annie? Any fights on your end?

                                  ANNIE
                    Nothing that interesting, but I 
                    can t be in the play.  They already 
                    had auditions.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           24.


                                  HARRY
                    But next Spring...

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah, well, I don t know about 
                    that.  The musical is awesome, the 
                    kids are amazingly talented.  But I 
                    am learning stuff backstage.

                                  DIXON
                    And she got invited to the hottest 
                    party of the year.  On her first 
                    day. 

                                  CELIA
                    That sounds like fun.  Whose is it?

                                  ANNIE
                    A girl named Naomi.  Anyway, I ve 
                    got some homework and have to iChat 
                    with Jason before he goes to bed.  
                    Time difference.  So I have to 
                    excuse myself.

                                  DIXON
                    Yeah, and I ve got homework too.

  The parents wave them off.  The kids exit quickly.

                                  CELIA
                          (with a big fake smile)
                    I m loving this move, aren t you? 

                                  HARRY
                    Look, it wasn t a fight-fight.  It 
                    was an altercation during a 
                    practice.  They happen all the 
                    time.

                                  CELIA
                    Happen all the time?  When did you 
                    ever get in a fight in high school?

                                  HARRY
                    I ll have you know I kicked Charlie 
                    Bennett s ass junior year.

                                  CELIA
                    Was that the guy in the wheelchair?

                                  HARRY

  Harry starts tickling her and they start laughing, snuggling, 
  kissing when Tabitha enters the room.

                                    TABITHA
                    Oh good god.

  They break apart quickly as Tabitha keeps moving.



  A driving beat in a packed club.  Ryan is having a drink at the  
  bar when Naomi bellies up next to him.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    How did you get in here?

                                  NAOMI
                    Me?  How did you?  You re just a 
                    teacher.  Didn t the cover charge 
                    eat up like a month s salary or 
                      something?

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Maybe you should apply that caustic 
                    wit to your term paper that s due 
                    Friday.

                                  NAOMI
                    Actually, I spent all afternoon and 
                    early evening working on it.  I 
                    figured I was spending more time 
                    fighting it than it would take to 
                    actually do it.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    That and your daddy couldn t get 
                    you out of it.

                                  NAOMI
                    You know, you think you have power 
                    over me because you can make me do 
                    a stupid, little paper.  But in the 
                    end, you re just a broke, 
                      struggling teacher who spends his 
                    nights all alone in a bar full of 
                      strangers.

  The BARTENDER brings over a few beers and places them in front 
  of Ryan.  Ryan throws his cash on the bar.

                    Real friends who care about me 
                    because of what we ve been through 
                    together. Not the fake kind where 
                    it s about what you wear and how 
                    much money you have. Because when 
                    you re lying in bed at night 
                    staring at the ceiling with nobody

                    empty as this glass.  
                          (to Bartender)
                    She s underage.  Don t serve her.

  Naomi steams.  Ryan heads over to his table of friends and 
  kisses a hot girl who is obviously his girlfriend.  Naomi looks 
  at her reflection in the mirror.  Just for a second, we see that 
  she suspects he is right.



  Dixon puts down his Algebra 2 book and enters the Jack & Jill 
  bathroom and checks himself out for a beat, then opens the door 
  that adjoins his room and Annie s and sees....



  Annie is having her iChat with Jason.

                    Nice seeing ya, Jason.

  Dixon laughs as he exits and Annie has covered up.

                    It was his idea.  He said he missed 
                    me.

                                  DIXON
                    Missed you or missed them.

                    Shut up.  Let s just finish this.  
                    I m using my old paper on Gatsby 
                    from last year but making it not as 
                    literate so it sounds more like 
                    Naomi.

                                  DIXON
                    Yeah, she s not exactly a Rhodes 
                    scholar.  Oh, cut and paste that 
                    part to the top and lose the 
                    extensive ramblings of thematic 
                    imagery.

                                  ANNIE
                    Good idea.  See?  It s not that 
                    hard when we do it together.  And 
                    it s only five pages, totally worth 
                    it to get into that party.

                                  DIXON
                    I ve got to give it you, this takes 
                    balls.  Very impressed.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           28.


                                  ANNIE
                    You re on the hook too, pal.  And 
                    besides, it s more fear than guts 
                    because you know Naomi would ruin 
                    my life.  

                                  DIXON
                    You could ruin hers if she knew 
                    about Adrianna bobbing on Ethan.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah, well I m only focused on my 
                    own survival right now.  I mean, 
                    Mom and Dad can talk all they want 
                    about doing the right thing and not 
                    caring what people think but I do 
                    care what people think.  To them 
                    it s just a speech, but to me, it s 
                    my life. I m the one who would be 
                      miserable.  And besides, if they 
                    hadn t made us move here I wouldn t 
                    be doing this so it s just as much 
                    their fault as it is mine.



  Harry and Celia are sitting on the couch watching a movie.

                                  CELIA
                    I am not kidding you.  $800 for a 
                    pair of jeans.  With holes.

                                  HARRY

                    Even if I could afford them who is 
                    dumb enough to pay that?

  The doorbell rings.

                    Who s dropping by after ten?

                    Maybe your mother has taken Mickey 
                    Rooney as a lover.

  Harry opens the door and it is Tracy Bennett -- wearing those 
  $800 jeans.  With the holes.  And she looks damn good in them.  
  She holds a gift basket and she is just a little drunk.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           29.

                    Welcome wagon.



  Annie has on one of her Gap dresses and is not happy with the 
  look.  There is a knock at the door, Tabitha peaks in.

                                    TABITHA
                    Annie, you re going to a ball not a 
                    barbecue.

                                  ANNIE
                    I don t have any cool, sexy

                                    TABITHA
                    Please. Annie. How many times have 
                    I said it?  We re theater people -- 
                    call me Tabitha.

                                  ANNIE
                    Dad doesn t like that.

                                    TABITHA
                    He wet his bed until he was six.  I 
                    didn t like that either. Now how 
                    about these, Cinderella?

  Tabitha pulls out a few garment bags from the hallway.  Annie s 
  eyes widen.



  Tracy Bennett is sitting on the couch and she s the only one who 
  doesn t find this scene awkward.  It s past 10:30 now.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    And then Harry... what were we, 17?

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah, sure.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    Harry tries to climb on the  H  in 
                    the Hollywood sign because he 
                    thinks it looks like a ladder.  And 
                    the whole thing comes crashing down 
                    and he slides down on it for like 
                    fifty feet like a sled.  Oh my god 
                    did we laugh, but he was lucky he 
                    wasn t killed.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           30.


                                  HARRY
                    Well, that was a long time ago.  
                    Can I call you a cab to get you 
                    home?

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    I have a better idea.  Why don t 
                    you drive me home?

                                  CELIA
                    Or even better, why don t I drive 
                    you home and we can share stories 
                    about Harry s penis?

                    I have enough of my own, thank you.

  And with that, Tracy Bennett exits.

                                  CELIA
                    So should we turn off the lights or 
                    stay up and wait for some more ex-
                      girlfriends to drop by?

                                  HARRY
                    I m sorry.  That was pretty weird.

                                  CELIA
                    Yeah.  And I m getting those jeans 
                    tomorrow.  They looked really good.



  Annie is wearing one of Tabitha s classic dresses and she looks 
    absolutely stunning.  Harry and Celia poke their heads in.

                                  CELIA
                    Wow.  What s going on here?

                                  HARRY
                    Isn t it a little too revealing?

                                    TABITHA

  This looks like the coolest place in the world.  Hundreds of 
  hot, gyrating bodies pack the floor.  In the middle of the 
  action is Naomi, Ethan, Adrianna and others from their pack.

                    The thing is, Dixon didn t start 
                    it.  George did.  He was pissed the 
                    guy was better.  But George is all 
                    like, you have to do this man.  
                    Just say he slashed me first and 
                    jumped me and get him kicked off 
                    the team instead of me.

                    Did you know that Dixon guy is that 
                    new girl Annie s brother?  I think 
                    he s adopted.  I haven t seen the 
                    mom, but the dad doesn t strike me

                    What problem?  Just do it.

                                  ETHAN
                    Are you listening?  He didn t do 
                    anything wrong.  I would have hit 
                    George if he had done that to me.

                                  NAOMI
                    Yeah, but nobody would do that to 
                    you.  And you ve been friends with 
                    George since you were twelve.  You 
                    don t even know this other guy.  
                    You have to back George.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           32.

                    I hate being in the middle of this 
                    crap.  I just want it to go away.

                                  NAOMI
                    So make it go away.  But do me a 
                    favor, don t say anything to the 
                    coach about the black guy until 
                      Annie-Get-Your-Gun hands over my 
                    term paper. I need it tomorrow and 
                    I don t want anything F-ing with 
                    that. 

                                  ETHAN
                    I thought your parents took care of 
                    that.

                    Anyway, Coach will kill me if I 
                    stay here too late so I think I m 
                    going to go.

  Naomi looks over and sees Ryan Matthews having a great time with 
  his friends.  She is not going to be alone again.  She hands her 
  purse to Adrianna.

                                  NAOMI
                    Hold my purse, A.

  Naomi then takes Ethan by the hand and exits the dance floor.

                                  NAOMI
                    You can t go yet.  I need you.  
                    Now. 

  Naomi pushes past the line of women waiting for the single 
  bathroom and cuts off the woman about to go in and locks the 
  door.



  Naomi pulls Ethan up against her body.

  Naomi pulls up her skirt and they start to go at it.



  Adrianna has migrated to the dark corner of the club.  She looks 
  around, then takes out Naomi s wallet from the purse.  She pulls 
  out her ATM card, places it in her own purse, then puts Naomi s 
  wallet back.

  She returns to the crowd on the dance floor seemingly without a 
  care in the world.

  mean. And very public.  Finally, Dixon hits  stop. 



  Annie spots Silver at her locker. Silver notices Annie coming. 
  Looks away. But Annie walks straight for her. Silver glances up. 
    Self-conscious and awkward, preparing for some kind of face-off. 
  Instead, Annie is very genuine, in other words, herself.

                                  ANNIE
                    Hey. Saw the Beverly Hillbillies 
                    video. Funny stuff.

                                  SILVER
                    Thanks.

                                  ANNIE
                    I m just not sure what I did to 
                    make you so angry that you had to 
                    do that.

                                  SILVER
                    Gee I don t know, maybe dissing me 
                    like I was a piece of garbage to go 
                    sit with the Bratz dolls.

                                  ANNIE
                    Okay, first of all. I didn t diss 
                    you.  Naomi pulled me away.  I had 
                    already met her before you, in fact 
                    Mr. Matthews asked her to help me.  
                    Second of all, it was my first day 
                    and I don t know who to trust, who 
                    to be friends with or what the 
                    rules are around here.  So if I 
                    hurt your feelings by sitting with 
                    someone you don t like I am sorry.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           37.


                                  SILVER
                    It s not that I don t like her, I 
                    hate her.  Naomi is the anit-
                    Christ.

                                  ANNIE
                    Yeah, well the anti-Christ didn t 
                    trash my family in front of half a 
                    million people.  You did.

  Annie exits.  Off Silver reevaluating Annie...



  As he heads to class, Dixon catches sight of the DARK-HAIRED 
  BEAUTY heading the other direction. Dixon breaks into a near-
  run, cuts through classrooms, around lockers, gets to the spot 
  that allowed him to  cut her off at the pass. 

  Dixon pulls a copy of his schedule out of his bag, adopts a 
   lost  posture. A beat later, DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY lands in the 
  spot. She eyes Dixon looking confused, she approaches.

                                    DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY
                    Lost? ...Again?

                                  DIXON
                    Oh, hey. It s directions girl.
                          (re: schedule)
                    This rotating schedule takes 
                    getting used to.

  Dixon hands over the schedule. Dark-Haired Beauty smirks.

                                    DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY
                    I see your trouble.

                    Ohhhh, that s what all of those 
                    numbers and letters were. It s very 
                    confusing out here in California.  
                    Maybe you could help me acclimate.

                                    DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY
                    Maybe.  Are you gonna be at the 
                    Naomi Bennett Not-So-Sweet 16

                    Good.  That s where I m gonna be.

  And with that, she s off.  Dixon is reduced to putty.  The 
  Michael Cera type kid comes up to him.

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    You re wanted in the principal s

                                  DIXON
                    That s okay, I m cool.

                    What?  Don t they do that stuff 
                    back in Kansas?

  Ryan Matthews is quizzing Naomi in front of the class about the 
  paper that Naomi turned in.

                    in a hit-and-run who blamed it on 
                    Gatsby which lead to him being

  Dixon, Harry, Ethan, George and Ryan Matthews are in the office.

                                  ETHAN
                    And then Dixon... Slashed George 
                    and George just reacted like anyone 
                    would have.

                                  DIXON

  Annie and Naomi are standing at her locker.

                                  ANNIE
                    Okay, how did you memorize the 
                    paper that fast?

                                  NAOMI
                    I didn t.  I knew the answers 
                    because I ve read the book like ten 
                    times.

                                  ANNIE
                    So you re like, smart?  Then why 
                    didn t you just do the paper?

                    I don t like being told to do 
                    things.

                    Anyway, I have to go watch 
                      rehearsals.

                    Oh, and you re welcome.

  As Annie exits one way and Naomi the other we see Dixon watching 
  them.  He waits a beat before they turn their respective 
  corners, then he walks over to Naomi s locker and slips in a 
  folded note.

                    he weren t your son?  Greater good,

  The students are milling around on stage. Annie is working with 
  Kelly Taylor of the costume department. A stagehand comes 
  running in.

                                  STAGE HAND
                    I can t find Adrianna anywhere and

                    Okay, Julie, step in.  We re 
                    blocking Mama Who--

                                  STAGE HAND
                    Julie is sick.  She s got mono and 
                    may be out for a week.

  Annie is watching all of this very closely but is afraid to 
  speak up.  Silver, working on set decorations, notices.

                    Miss Austin.  I ll bet Annie knows 
                    the song.  She could stand in for 
                    the blocking.

                                  ANNIE

                                  MISS AUSTIN
                    This is the theater, honey.  No 
                    place for modesty.  It s a pretty

                    I know it.  I ve been watching.

  Annie walks her place on the stage. Silver gives her the thumbs 
  up.  The guitar player starts with the opening of  Mama Who Bore 
  Me  from the show and Annie begins to sing.  She is nailing it.  
  They are all blown away.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           42.



  Ryan, Kelly and Harry are talking.  Harry is starting to peruse 
  the paper.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    You re going to start getting tired 
                    of me pretty fast with all this 
                    stuff we have, but I m sorry, I 
                    don t believe she wrote it.  She 
                    knew the answers.  Maybe she 
                    memorized them, but that is not her 
                    work.  It s too structured.

  Harry reads while he listens.  Then his heart drops.

                                  KELLY TAYLOR
                    Do you think she got it online?



  We are now in the upbeat Reprise version of  Mama Who Bore Me  
  where the chorus has joined Annie in song and dance.  As before, 
  she s really good.  And as it ends... they all applaud.

                                  MISS AUSTIN
                    That was excellent, Annie.

                                  ANNIE
                    Thank you.

  Annie jumps for joy and runs off stage where she runs smack dab 
  into her dad, Harry.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    Dad, did you see?  I got to 
                    perform.  It was soooooo much fun.

  Harry holds up the term paper.

                    lie to him.

                                  NAOMI
                    Oh, you are so full of it.  You 
                    know you lie to your parents, you 
                    just don t have the guts to stick 
                    with it when you re caught.

                                  ANNIE
                    Not telling is different than lying

                                  NAOMI
                    Do you know what that is going to

                                  ANNIE
                    My fault?  Who didn t write the 
                    paper because you don t like being 
                    told what to do?  You sound like a 
                    spoiled brat.

                    Yeah, well you sound like a little 
                    bitch.  And just to be clear, you 
                    are so disinvited from my birthday 
                    party.

                                  ANNIE
                    Like I even care.

  The quiz bowl team, lined up behind a long table, is peppered 
  with questions from their Quiz Bowl Coach.  We find Dixon, not 
  in a good mood, sitting in his seat away from the action.

  No one on the quiz bowl team seems to know the answer. The Quiz 
  Bowl Coach looks up, frustrated.

                    I suppose we can just cross our

  All eyes turn to Dixon who doesn t look up from his notebook. 
  The coach rifles through his question cards, finds another 
    literature query.

  More uncomfortable silence from the team. The coach turns back 
  toward Dixon.

  Harry, Naomi and Tracy Bennett are in the office.

                    I spoke to my husband and we agreed 
                    that our daughter is not going to 
                    get a failing grade or be 
                      suspended.

                    That s not your call, that s up to

                                  NAOMI
                    What do you mean?

                                  HARRY
                    I mean, if you write a new paper, 
                    on a new subject. I won t fail or 
                    suspend you.

                    Don t talk to my daughter like 
                    that.

                                  HARRY
                    I m just trying to get her to take 
                      responsibility for her life.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    Oh you re a great one to talk about 
                    taking responsibility.

                                  HARRY
                    Okay, you know what, you and I can 
                    talk about that later, I promise. 
                    But right now, this is about you, 
                    Naomi.  Annie told me how you d 
                    read the book, how you knew the 
                    answers, but you just didn t want 
                    to do the work.  Well, it s time to 
                    do the work.

                                  TRACY BENNETT
                    That s not enough time for her.

                                  HARRY
                    Would you please let her decide?  
                    I ve been doing this long enough to 
                    know when I see a smart kid.  Pick 
                    a book, pick a subject and knock it

                    he s been wrong about you.  I know

                    He gets to grade it?  There is no 
                    way I m letting--

                    How long does the paper have to be?

                    How could you not want to be on  
                    Quiz Bowl?  It looks great on 
                    college applications, you get an 
                    extra study hall and there s a ton 
                    of out of town tournaments.  I got 
                    laid on one last year.

                                  DIXON
                    You got laid?

                                  NAVID
                      Technically.

  As they turn the corner, they run, literally, into Ethan.

                                  ETHAN
                    Whoa, dude-- Oh...

  Ethan is semi-speechless, not so much from fear but shame.  
  Dixon glares at him, Navid is hoping for a fight.

                                  ETHAN
                    I... don t know what to say.

  Dixon just looks at him then turns and walks away.  Navid 
  follows.  Ethan watches then walks the other way.

                                  NAVID
                    Why didn t you kick his ass?

                                  DIXON
                    Dude, I ve only had like three 
                    fights since I was ten, okay?  
                    Don t worry, I ve taken care of 
                    Ethan.

                                  NAVID
                    What does that mean?

  to her.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           48.

                    I don t care about that.  I wanted

                    like that and not have any 
                      punishment?

                                  CELIA
                    No, but it could have started 
                    tomorrow.

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah, it could have.  But I guess I 
                    feel like we have to be a little 
                    tougher out here.

                                  CELIA
                    I guess I feel that you were easier 
                    on Naomi than your own daughter.



  Harry and Celia knock on the door, then enter.

                                  HARRY
                    Sweetie.  It s not even eight yet.  
                    You can still go to the party.

  They find Tabitha pacing around the room and an open window.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Where is Annie?

                                    TABITHA
                    Exactly where she s supposed to be.

                                            ACT SIX



  Silver is driving, dressed in something that might make Gwen 
  Stefani blush.  Annie rides shotgun.

                                  SILVER
                    Okay, one of those small world 
                    stories. The printer Naomi used to 
                    make her party invites? Same 
                    printer the theater department uses 
                    for programs and whatnot. Voila.

  She whips out a stack of party invites.

                                  SILVER (CONT D)
                    I gave about fifty to these skaters 
                    from Fairfax High.  This is all I 
                    have left.

  She rolls down the window and screams at some pedestrians.

                                  SILVER (CONT D)
                    Party tonight! Free booze!

  She flings them out into the street.



  Dixon and Navid cruise down Sunset Boulevard in all its glory.

                                  DIXON
                    Thanks for letting me be your 
                    wingman tonight. I had to get into 
                    this party.

                                  NAVID
                    You re not my wingman, you re my 
                    bitch.  We re working.  Of course 
                    once we get enough footage...

                                  DIXON
                    Oh yeah.  I need to hang with some 
                    of these hot babes, get my mind off 
                    the lacrosse fiasco.

                                  NAVID
                    Why doesn t your dad just make them 
                    put you back on the team?     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           53.


                                  DIXON
                    He can t.  He tried.  District 
                    wouldn t let him so he s filing an 
                    appeal.  But like I said, Ethan 
                    will get his.

                                  NAVID
                    What did you do?

                                  DIXON
                    We ll see.

                                  NAVID
                    Okay so then answer me this, 
                    because I gotta ask:  What s the 
                    deal with you being in a white 
                    family?

                                  DIXON
                    They were my foster family from 
                    when I was like eight and then they 
                    adopted me when I was ten.  

                                  NAVID
                    So what about your real parents?

                                  DIXON
                    They are my real parents.

  And they drive up to...



  Annie and Silver approach the two girls working the door. 
  There s a red velvet rope and a couple muscle-bound bouncers in 
    sunglasses and suits keeping out the undesirables. 

                                  SILVER
                    So are we going to the ballroom at 
                    all or just hitting the room 
                    parties?

                                  ANNIE
                    What s the difference?

                                  SILVER
                    Room parties are where all the 
                    action is -- the sex, drugs, and 
                    mini-bar banditry.

                                  ANNIE
                    Let s stick to the ballroom.

                                  SILVER
                    I m with ya. All the quality guy 
                    browsing happens in the ballroom.

                                  ANNIE
                    Actually, I have a boyfriend.  He s 
                    back in Wichita.

                                  SILVER
                    Trust me, that ain t gonna last.

  Silver hands over the invitations. The girl regards her 
    suspiciously.

                                  SILVER (CONT D)
                    Move the rope, honey.



  TWO SHOT of Silver and Annie as they enter. What she sees takes 
  Annie s breath away. Silver is unfazed.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           56.


  REVEAL ANNIE S POV - it s decadence everywhere she looks. Hyper-
    sexualized dancing. A recreation of the Trevi fountain in the 
  center of the room. Hard-bodied bartenders in tight 1960s-style 
  bathing trunks and bikini-clad bartendresses stand on tables and 
  pour shot bottles straight into the open mouths of the party-
  goers.

                                  SILVER
                    What did I tell you -- lame.



  Harry is putting on his jacket to go out.  Annie and Tabitha 
  watch.

                                  ANNIE
                    Okay, I get that you are angry, but 
                    don t make a scene.  She has to go 
                    to school with these kids for the 
                    next two years.

                                  HARRY
                    I won t.  But she just can t sneak 
                    out when she s grounded, then 
                    totally disregard us ordering her 
                    home.  I mean, I know I was maybe 
                    too tough before, but now?  I m 
                    right and you know it.

                                    TABITHA
                    Woo hoo.  Maybe they should throw 
                    you a parade.

  Harry exits.

                                  ANNIE
                    You really shouldn t interfere with 
                    the kids, Tabitha.

                                    TABITHA
                    Get used to it.



  Dixon and Navid stand by the bar.

                                  NAVID
                    I m gonna go pick up some B-roll.

                                  DIXON
                    You do that.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           57.


  Navid departs. Dixon scans the room with his eyes until he finds 
  her -- Lauren Strange on the dance floor. She s dancing with 
  another girl. If Dixon had been in Beverly Hills longer, he d 
  probably realize quickly that she s rolling hard on E.

  Dixon isn t shy. He makes his way out to her.

                                  DIXON
                    I made it.

                                  LAUREN
                    It s you. It s really you.

  Lauren surprises Dixon by throwing her arms around him and 
  putting her tongue in his mouth. The kiss lasts seconds.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Let s go upstairs.

                                  DIXON
                          (what planet am I on?)
                    Cool.

  ANOTHER PART OF THE BALLROOM

  Annie and Silver are crossing, but they get separated.  They are 
  several feet away from each other when Silver runs into Adrianna 
  and Annie into Naomi. 

                                  SILVER
                    Too bad about the play.  But I 
                    figured if I poured a half bottle 
                    of Nyquil into your Coke, Annie 
                    would get her chance.  Just 
                    kidding.  Maybe.

  Adrianna can t believe what she just heard as Silver walks away.

  ANGLE on Annie and Naomi.

                                  ANNIE
                    If you want us to leave--

                                  NAOMI
                    That s a beautiful dress, Annie.  
                    You look great.

                                  ANNIE
                    Thanks.  So what did Mr. Matthews 
                    give you on your paper?

                                  NAOMI
                    I don t know.  He s grading it 
                    tonight.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           58.


  Naomi walks away.  She doesn t seem her normal snotty self.



  Ryan is reading Naomi s paper.  He s marking it up when there is 
  a knock at the door.  He gets up and opens it.  It s the The 
  Michael Cera-Type kid.  They are both surprised.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Where s Tim?

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    I don t know Tim.  They just sent 
                    me.

                                  RYAN MATTHEWS
                    Yeah, uh, look, you re not--

                                    MICHAEL CERA-TYPE
                    I m not going to say anything, Mr. 
                    Matthews.  Bad for business.

  He hands him a baggie of pills, Ryan hands him some money and 
  shuts the door.  His expression says  oh fuck. 



  Harry enters the hotel lobby looking for Annie. He spies her as 
  she comes out of the ballroom with Silver.  They are laughing 
  and having a great time in that silly way that only the young 
  can.  Harry smiles at seeing her so happy. And looking so 
    beautiful.



  A notorious room party. The smoky room is jammed with kids. 
    Heavy-duty drinking going on everywhere the camera points. 
  CAMERA EVENTUALLY FINDS DIXON. He s pressed up against a wall. 
  Lauren is making out with him. She pulls away.

                                  LAUREN
                    What s your name, again?

                                  DIXON
                    Dixon.

                                  LAUREN
                    How about we--

  Lauren s phone vibrates.  She reads the text message.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    I gotta go.  My boyfriend finally 
                    got here.  You want to meet him?

                                  DIXON
                    No.

  And with that, she is gone.  Leaving Dixon confused but still 
  happy.



  Naomi is holding the microphone and addressing her guests in the 
    background as Dixon strolls into the room looking for Navid. 
  However, he is stopped by Ethan sitting on one of the chairs. 
  Ethan is sporting a pretty good-sized black eye.

                                  ETHAN
                    You re back on the team, Millsy.

                                  DIXON
                    What?  How?

                                  ETHAN
                    How do you think?  I told coach the 
                    truth.

                                  DIXON
                    Really?

                                  ETHAN
                    Of course some of the guys weren t 
                    too happy about it so we may be the 
                    only players on the team now.

                                  DIXON
                    That s okay, man.  That s all we 
                    need. 
                          (beat)
                    Hey.  Thanks for doing that.

                                  ETHAN
                    Just pass me the ball, Dude.

  They turn their attention to Naomi as she turns her attention to 
  Ethan.

                                  NAOMI
                    Lastly, I want to thank my 
                      boyfriend, Ethan. You have taught 
                    me so much, baby.     "90210" Thomas  Rewrite by Sachs & Judah 4/20/08           61.


  Random cheers. Ethan beams in his seat. Mouths  I love you. 

                                  NAOMI (CONT D)
                    I guess the biggest lesson you 
                    taught me is never trust a man with 
                    your heart.  Ever.

  Ethan s eyes go wide. Suddenly you could hear a pin drop.

                                  NAOMI (CONT D)
                    Because recently I found out that 
                    my boyfriend Ethan was getting BJ s 
                    from my best friend, Adrianna.

  Ethan looks suddenly helpless in his seat.  Adrianna turns 
  white.  Navid is videotaping all of this.  Ethan glares over at 
  Annie, who looks back and shakes her head  No  violently and 
  mouths  It wasn t me.   He believes her, you just know she 
  wouldn t.

                                  ETHAN
                    Mills, when I find out who did this 
                    I am going to mess them up bad.

                                  DIXON
                    I don t blame you.

  The crowd starts booing Ethan.

                                  ETHAN
                    Let s get out of here.

  Ethan exits, and pulled by force of personality, Dixon and Navid 
  follow him.  Navid whispers.

                                  NAVID
                    You told her, didn t you?

                                  DIXON
                    I don t know nothing.



  Harry enters and finds Celia channel surfing on the couch.  
  Tabitha is sound asleep and snoring like a lumberjack.

                                  CELIA
                    She might have had a drop of Cutty 
                    Sark.
