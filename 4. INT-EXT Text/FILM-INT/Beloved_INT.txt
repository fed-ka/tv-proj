C.U. - THE HANDS OF TWO BROTHERS HOLDING EACH OTHER AS THEY
RUN DOWN THE STAIRS..
BULGAR (13 yrs. old) and HOWARD (14 yrs. old) run down the
steps from the second floor. They are fully dressed, carrying
a small bag of belongings.
HOWARD
We gonna need food. Wait here.
Bulgar reluctantly lets go of Howard's hand as the latter
runs into the kitchen. Alone, he edges towards the front
door, when suddenly;
THE DOOR SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN on it's own. Scared, he steps
away slowly.
Howard is trying to toss some food into a bag. He spots A
CAKE sitting on top the wooden table, with some pieces
already eaten. He finds a knife and approaches the table.
He is about to cut into the cake when he sees TWO TINY HAND
PRINTS appear on the cake's surface. Howard stops cold -
dropping the knife.
Howard exits the kitchen and takes Bulgar's hand;
HOWARD
Come on!
DENVER (OS)
Bul?
The boys look up the stairs and see their baby sister, nine
year old DENVER.
DENVER
Where you goin?
The brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her. They love
their sister. But there are stronger forces here.
A MIRROR on a wall beside Howard cracks down the middle.
HOWARD
We gotta go!
Bulgar looks up to Denver. They exchange a look of deep
affection and pained longing. He wants to take her.
HOWARD
Bye, Denver. You take care.
DENVER
Bye? Bul?
Bulgar is starting to cry. He rushes up the steps and hugs
his sister. He kisses her hard then breaks away. Denver's
outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid-air.
DENVER
No..Bul...
Bulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house
holding Howard's hand once more.
Denver sits alone at the top of the stairs.
She sadly looks
up and weeps, as if to the house itself:
DENVER
Now what you go and do that for?
BABY SUGGS, grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe, sits in
her bed fondling colored fabric of BRIGHT GREEN..It is the
only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding. Suggs is
bed-ridden, exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of
suffering and sacrifice and tested faith.
BABY SUGGS
Ya know what I'd love to see? I loved to
see me some lavender. You got any
lavender? Or even pink - pink'll do.
Sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser. She stops and
checks her pockets for rags or swatches...She looks around
the room..
SETHE
No. Sorry.
BABY SUGGS
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if
you've got an appetite for color.
Suggs goes back to contemplating her green until;
SETHE (OS)
Oh wait...
Suggs looks up to see Sethe sticking her pink tongue out at
her. Suggs smiles.
BABY SUGGS
Oh, that's fine. Fine.
Sethe lets out a small laugh. She walks toward the window,
stretching her body. Her expression changes as she thinks of
her boys. Baby Suggs reads her like a book.
BABY SUGGS
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they
lasted here this long.
SETHE
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
BABY SUGGS
What'd be the point? Not a house in the
country ain't packed to the rafters with
some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our
ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come
back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You
lucky. You got one child left, still
pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had
eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one
of them gone from me. Four taken, four
chased and all, I expect, worrying
somebody's house into evil. My first born
- alls I can remember of her now is how
she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her
little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they
slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight
children and that's all I remember.
SETHE
(returning to her work)
You remember Halle.
BABY SUGGS
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all
of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had
Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years...
My two girls, sold and gone before I
could even a heard about it, and them
without their grown up teeth yet. My
third child, my son after Halle...I let
that straw boss have me for four months
so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he
had him traded for lumber anyway and me
pregnant with his child. I couldn't love
that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the
rest either. God take what He
would....and He did...
SETHE
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were
here.
BABY SUGGS
Those boys didn't even know him. You had
six whole years of marriage to my Halle
Fathered every one of your children. A
blessing. I learned hard that a man's
just a man, but a son like that...like
Halle..now that's somebody.
Sethe's mixed feelings show all over her face. Although she
loved Halle, there is clearly something unresolved in her.
SETHE
Just got a few more things to do, then
I'll start supper.
Sethe exits.
Denver walks to her room in her night dress. She passes the
opened door of her mother's bedroom and peeks in:
Sethe kneeling by her bed, as if praying...
Beside Sethe, A WHITE DRESS KNEELS as well, with it's sleeve
around Sethe's waist. Like two friendly grown-up women,
comforting each other in prayer.
Denver tip toes away.
Sethe enters to check on Denver, whom she thinks is asleep.
She leans over and kisses her forehead, only to discover she
is awake;
DENVER
Mama?
SETHE
What is it baby?
DENVER
You think maybe when daddy comes, he
could talk to the baby ghost. Maybe make
her behave and then people won't be
scared of here no more.
SETHE
I don't know.
DENVER
Why won't she ever settle?
SETHE
She's mad like a baby gets mad. You
forgetting how little it is. She wasn't
even two years old when she died. Too
little to understand.
DENVER
For a baby she throws a powerful spell.
SETHE
No more powerful than the way I loved her.
Hearing her mother say this, moves Denver.
DENVER
What do you pray for Mama?
SETHE
Oh, I don't really pray anymore. I just
talk.
DENVER
About what?
SETHE
Oh, about time. How some things go. Pass
on. Some things just stay.
DENVER
What things?
SETHE
Like, the place I was at before here -
Sweet Home. Even if that whole farm and
every tree and blade of grass on it died -
it'll still be there. Waiting. And if you
go and stand in the place where it was,
what happened there once, will happen
again.
DENVER
If it's still there, waiting, that mean
nothing ever dies?
SETHE
Nothing ever does. That's why I had to
get my children out. No matter what.
That's why you can never go there.
DENVER
You never tell me all what happened. Just
that they whipped you and you run off
pregnant with me.
SETHE
You don't need to know nothing else.
DENVER
(nods)
I saw a white dress kneeling next to you
when you was praying.
SETHE
White? Maybe it was my bedding dress.
Describe it to me.
DENVER
Had a high neck. Whole mess of buttons
coming down the back.
SETHE
Buttons. Well, that's not my bedding
dress. I never had a button on nothing.
What else?
DENVER
A bunch at the back. On the sit down
part.
SETHE
A bustle?
DENVER
I don't know what it's called.
SETHE
You say it was holding on to me. How?
DENVER
Kneeling next to you while you were
praying. I mean, talking. It looked just
like you.
SETHE
Well, I'll be.
DENVER
I think it was a sign. I think maybe
baby's got plans.
SETHE
What plans?
DENVER
I don't know, but that dress holding onto
you got to mean something.
SETHE
Maybe. Maybe it does.
Sethe smiles sympathetically for her lonely child. They hear
a sound in the house - floor boards creaking.
DENVER
She's crawling again.
Sethe nods and holds her daughter's hand as they listen.
FADE OUT;
SUPER: 1873.
FADE IN;
Sethe opens the front door and enters, with Paul behind her,
hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder. As he
follows her in;
A POOL OF RED, UNDULATING LIGHT forms around him. It worries
him.
PAUL
You got company?
SETHE
On and off.
The light undulates faster and faster, extending all the way
to the kitchen at the end of the hall. Frightened, Paul steps
back out the door.
PAUL
Good God! What kind of evil you got in
there?
SETHE
It's not evil..It's just..just sad. Come
on. Just step through.
Sethe reaches out her hand. Paul tentatively takes it and is
lead through the red light of the hallway, through to the
kitchen where it ends.
As he walks through, we can see Paul affected by the light.
It is sad. A sadness that touches him, welling up inside
until tears are brimming in his eyes. He reaches the normal
light of the kitchen and steps out of it.
Paul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone.
PAUL
I thought you said she died soft as cream.
SETHE
(busying herself in kitchen)
Oh that's not Baby Suggs. That's my
daughter. The one I sent ahead with the
boys before I run off.
PAUL
She didn't live?
SETHE
No.
PAUL
The boys too?
SETHE
No, they alive - they run off before Baby
Suggs died. The one I was carrying when I
left Sweet Home is all I got left.
Still affected by the light, Paul eases himself down at the
table, finding something to say.
PAUL
Well, probably best..If a Negro boy got
legs he ought to use them. Sit down too
long, somebody figure out a way to tie
them up.......
(the image disturbs Sethe)
You by yourself then?
SETHE
Me and Denver... my daughter.
PAUL
No man?
(Sethe shakes head "no")
And that's all right by you?
SETHE
It's all right by me...I cook at a
restaurant in town. Sew a little on the
sly....
She places a bottle and a glass on the table before him. The
light jarred him. He snatches the bottle to drink and calm
himself down. She jokes.
SETHE
You look more done in by a walk through
my front hall than all those eighteen
years of walking put together.
PAUL
Got that right.
Denver, all of eighteen years old now, and beautiful, is
buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down
in the kitchen. She stops. Her face lights up.
DENVER
Daddy?
She runs down the white staircase.
As Denver runs into the kitchen, we hear:
SETHE (OS)
Won't you stay a little while? Can't
nobody catch up on eighteen years in a
day.
Denver appears expectantly, down the white staircase that
leads from the second floor. She looks at Paul wide eyed.
They turn to her with gentle smiles;
SETHE
Baby, this here's Paul D. Garner...Paul,
this is my Denver...Paul's the last of
the Sweet Home men.
Denver's heart sinks.
PAUL
Good morning Miss Denver. It's a
pleasure.
DENVER
Good morning, Mr. D.
PAUL
Garner, baby. Paul D. Garner.
DENVER
Yes sir.
PAUL
Glad to get a look at you. Last time I
saw your mama, you were pushing out the
front of her dress. She's a fine looking
young lady, Sethe. Fine looking. Got her
daddy's sweet face.
DENVER
You knew my father?
PAUL
Knew him. Knew him well.
SETHE
Of course he did. I told you, he's from
Sweet Home. Paul may stay with us a
while. Won't that be nice, having an old
friend stay a spell?
But Denver reacts with surprise and dismay. Paul is not her
friend. Paul, right now, is more of an intruder.
PAUL
If that's all right with you, that is?
DENVER
We have a ghost here, you know.
PAUL
We met. But sad, your mama said. Not
evil.
DENVER
No sir, not evil. But not sad either.
PAUL
What then?
DENVER
Lonely.
SETHE
I don't see how it could be lonely
spending every minute with us like it
does.
DENVER
It's my sister. She was just a baby when
she died in this house.
PAUL
Reminds me of that headless bride back
behind Sweet Home. Remember that Sethe?
Used to roam them woods regular.
DENVER
(annoyed, resentful)
Mama doesn't like talk about Sweet Home.
Says it was never sweet and it sure
wasn't home.
SETHE
Girl, mind yourself!
PAUL
Now, now, she got it right there, Sethe.
SETHE
But it's where we were. All together.
It's where I met your father. And it
comes back on us whether we want it to or
not....
DENVER
Then why don't you ever tell me about it?
Sethe pauses - unnerved and irritated by Denver's challenge.
SETHE
Denver, start up the stove. Paul must be
hungry.
PAUL
Don't go to no trouble on my account.
SETHE
Bread's no trouble. The rest I brought
back from where I work. Least I can do,
cooking dawn to noon, is bring dinner
home. You got any objections to pike?
PAUL
If he don't object to me I don't object
to him.
He addresses his humor to Denver who offers no response. She
crosses to the stove and works on lighting it. She's mad.
DENVER
Where's he going to sleep? Baby Sugg's
room got no sheets or nothing.
SETHE
We'll figure it out.
DENVER
Maybe you should stay with mama, Mr.
Garner. Then you two can talk about Sweet
Home all night long.
SETHE
(explodes)
What's the matter with you! I never knew
you to behave like this!
PAUL
Leave her be, Sethe. I'm a stranger to her.
SETHE
That's just it. She got no cause to act
up with a stranger.
Denver collapses where she stands, sobbing out loud. Sethe
moves to her.
SETHE
Baby, what is it? Did something happen?
Denver moves away. Sethe registers this rejection.
DENVER
I can't no more! I can't no more!
SETHE
Can't what? What can't you?
DENVER
I can't live here! I don't know where to
go or what to do but I can't live here.
Nobody speaks to us. Nobody comes by.
Nobody even knows I'm alive.
PAUL
What she talking about 'nobody speaks to
you'?
SETHE
It's the house. People don't...
DENVER
It's not! It's not the house! It's us!
It's you!
SETHE
Denver!
PAUL
Leave off, Sethe. It's hard for a young
girl living in a haunted place. That
can't be easy.
SETHE
(growing irritated)
It's easier than some other things. Come
here, baby..
Denver allows herself to be held.
PAUL
I'm a grown man with nothing new left to
see or do and I'm telling you it' ain't
easy. Maybe you oughta move.
SETHE
No!
PAUL
Sethe!
SETHE
No. No moving. No leaving. It's all right
the way it is.
PAUL
You going to tell me it's all right with
this child half out of her mind.
SETHE
(holding Denver in her arms)
I got a tree on my back and a haunt in my
house and nothing in between but the
daughter I'm holding in my arms. No more
running - from nothing! I will never run
from another thing on this earth, you
hear! I took one journey and I paid the
ticket but let me tell you something,
Paul D. Garner; it cost too much! Do you
hear me?! It cost too much! Now sit down
and eat with us or leave us be!
Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul. He watches as Sethe
ushers Denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to
quiet her down.
Alone, Paul is disturbed by Sethe's words. He fishes out a
pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it, searching for
smoking papers he knows he doesn't have...waiting for Sethe
to return.
When she does, she heads straight for the stove. She spits on
her finger and touches it to check it's heat. She then begins
to make bread from flour, soda and salt - keeping her back to
Paul throughout - as the scene continues;
PAUL
What tree, Sethe?
SETHE
Huh?
PAUL
What tree on your back? I don't see
nothing growing on your back.
SETHE
It's there all the same.
PAUL
Who told you that?
SETHE
White girl. That's what she called it. I
never seen it and never will. But she
said that's what it looked like. A
chokecherry tree. Leaves, branches. That
was 18 years ago. Could have cherries by
now for all I know...
PAUL
I don't follow.
Sethe pauses. Something in her decides to tell Paul D,
although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control;
SETHE
I had milk, see. I was pregnant with
Denver but I had milk for my baby girl
that I sent ahead with the boys. I hadn't
stopped nursing her when I sent her and
the boys ahead of me. Anybody could smell
me long before they saw me. Nothing I
could do about it. All I knew is I had to
get my milk to my little girl. Nobody was
going to nurse her like me. Nobody was
going to get it to her fast enough or
take it away when she had enough..nobody
knew she couldn't pass her air if you
held her up on your shoulder, only if she
was lying on your knee..Nobody knew that
but me...
Paul listens, half dreading where he thinks this story's going.
PAUL
We was talking about a tree, Sethe.
Sethe works faster. It is the work, taking an action - any
action - that allows her tell the story numbly, without the
pain of reliving it...without the images attacking
SETHE
Schoolteacher's boys drag me into the
barn and took my milk...
....yet, the images come anyway.
INTERCUT: FLASHES OF MEMORY attack as SETHE TELLS HER
STORY...
JUMP CUT TO:
- Sethe being raped, beaten, held down by SCHOOLTEACHER'S
BOYS in a barn with a loft...
SETHE (IN KITCHEN)
..Held me down in that barn and took it.
JUMP CUT TO:
Sethe screams and is smacked across the face.
SETHE (IN KITCHEN)
They were like boulders on me. Their
hands over my mouth and on my shoulders
and my legs.
JUMP CUT TO:
One of the boys holds her face and mouth and head as the two
others hold down her body and ravage her....
SETHE (IN KITCHEN)
I couldn't move. Alls I could see was the
loft above their heads.
JUMP CUT TO:
Her mouth covered, her head immobile - she stares up at the
loft.
END OF MEMORY IMAGES.
PAUL
The loft?
Sethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder
on the biscuit dough...The flashes of IMAGES STOP...
SETHE
I told Mrs. Garner on them. She had that
lump on her neck and couldn't speak but
her eyes rolled out tears, I remember.
Them boys found out I told on 'em and
Schoolteacher made one open up my back,
and when it closed it made a tree.
PAUL
They used cowhide on you?
SETHE
And they took my milk.
PAUL
They beat you and you was pregnant?
SETHE
And they took my milk!
Sethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips
into the stove. As she rises, Paul steps gently behind her.
He slowly caresses her breasts from behind, pressing his
cheek against her back.. He rubs his cheek against it,
feeling the scars beneath the dress. Raising his fingers to
the hooks, as Sethe cries silently, he undoes her dress which
slips down to her hips, exposing the sculpture her back has
become.
PAUL
Aw Lord, girl.
Grateful to have her body be someone else's responsibility
for the moment, Sethe closes her eyes as Paul touches every
ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth. The tenderness is
almost unbearable.
Suddenly, PAUL'S LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING. He pauses and looks
down...He realizes it is not his legs that tremble, but
rather;
THE FLOORBOARDS THEMSELVES ARE PITCHING, GRINDING, SHOVING
the house from side to side.
Sethe slides to the floor, struggling with her dress.
On all fours, Denver crawls in from the keeping room as if
trying to keep the house together.
Paul, falling, reaching for an anchor, begins to shout;
PAUL
GOD DAMN IT! HUSH UP! Leave this place
alone! Get the hell outta here!
A table rushes at him but Paul grabs it's leg. Managing to
stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch, he holds
the table by two legs and bashes it about, wrecking
everything, screaming at the house;
PAUL
YOU WANT TO FIGHT, COME ON! GOD DAMN IT!
SHE GOT ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU! SHE GOT ENOUGH!
The quaking slows to an occasional lurch but Paul does not
stop whipping the table around until everything it is
absolutely still. He leans against the wall, panting.
Sethe is crouched by the stove. A mixed expression of relief
and guilt - the expression of a mother whose disobedient
child has been sent away. But a child she loves nonetheless.
Denver looks frightened. More alone than ever, now that her
one companion is gone.
All three are breathing together as if to the same beat, like
one tired person.
LAP DISSOLVE:
Denver walks through the broken furniture and dishes. At the
stove, she ashes over the fire and pulls the pan of biscuits
from the oven,
Denver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard, it's contents laying
in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf. She takes out a
jar. She looks for a plate and finds half of one by the
broken table. She picks it up as she hears Paul enter through
the front door.
Sethe prepares a bed for Paul. Baby Suggs quilt is on the
bed. She hesitates whether or not to leave it there.
Paul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands, his
shirt hanging open down the front.
Sethe is surprised to see him there - she feels awkward.
SETHE
Why don't you...take a rest..I'll call
you when we're ready.
PAUL
Sure you don't want me to help clean up?
SETHE
No..you'd just get in my way. Denver and
me'll do it.
They stand in silence, looking at each other for a moment.
The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny.
Paul starts smiling. Sethe covers her mouth to conceal it.
And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and
the fear they feel takes it's place.
Paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the
floor. Sethe watches him. Paul crosses to her. He moves in to
kiss her. They approach each other's lips like two burn
victims, trying desperately not to hurt the other with their
touch.
Sethe and Paul lay in bed, after lovemaking. They are still
fully clothed. The lovemaking was fast and finished quickly.
Now, there is an awkwardness that is without humor or
excitement - but sits like a chasm between them.
As Sethe lays there, SHE REMEMBERS:
MEMORY:
MR. GARNER, the man who owns and runs Sweet Home. He offers
cooked corn to the men.
MR. GARNER
Raccoon must've got into my corn. Damaged
a few so, no use throwing them out...
The men looks to each other, suppressing a laugh.
MR. GARNER
Sethe, get the butter there.
Everyone looks at each other as they thank No. Garner and
begin to smear butter on their corn and eat.
A NEIGHBORING FARMER visiting the Garner's cautions him;
NEIGHBORING FARMER
You spoil these nigger boys.
GARNER
Maybe you got boys on your farm. My
nigger's are men. Not a boy among'em.
Bought 'em thataway, raised'em thataway.
NEIGHBORING FARMER
Beg to differ Garner. Ain't no nigger men.
GARNER
Not if you scared. But if you a man
yourself, you'll want your niggers to be
men too.
NEIGHBORING FARMER
Wouldn't have no nigger men around my
wife.
GARNER
Neither would I..Neither would I.
Sethe hides a smile as she hands a piece of corn to Halle.
Paul A and Paul F hesitate as they think of eating the corn
which the lovers consummated. But Sixo digs right in.
Paul D eats slowly, his eyes never leaving Sethe as she moves
Around the kitchen, her eyes never leaving Halle...Paul's
Attraction and love for her are apparent.
END OF MEMORY;
C.U. on PAUL, on his back, turned away from Sethe.
What began as Sethe's memory, has blended into Paul's.
Sethe rises off the bed, breaking the thick silence between them:
SETHE
I'll call you when there's something to
eat.
She exits, leaving Paul alone on the bed.
Paul is singing as he fixes the table he broke while driving
the baby ghost away.
Denver is sweeping the floor - irritated by Paul's presence
and voice.
They both hear the front door open as Sethe arrives home from
work.
They look to each other to see which one will make a move for
Sethe first. Paul knows enough to bide his time with Denver.
He watches as she places the broom down and exits the
kitchen.
Denver lies curled up in her bed. Alone.
Sethe enters and crawls in unexpectedly. Denver looks up,
surprised to see her.
DENVER
What is it? What's wrong?
SETHE
Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Lay back down.
Denver obeys, unsure.
DENVER
You think baby ghost's really gone?
SETHE
Don't know.
DENVER
I miss her.
Sethe lets out a small laugh.
DENVER
I do. Baby Suggs told me baby ghost would
never hurt me. She was my sister. When I
was little, after the boys left, I used
to think that she and me both were
waiting for daddy to come. And once he
did, she wouldn't be mad no more.
(Sethe listens sadly)
They hear Paul singing out on the porch. Denver grimaces.
DENVER
Wish he'd shut-up...He's ruined
everything.
SETHE
No, he hasn't. He won't.
(hesitates)
He..he wants to takes us to the
carnival next Thursday...
Denver's eyes light up with excitement then caution.
DENVER
You mean, go out where they'll be other
people?
SETHE
Dress up a little bit. Wear our hats.
What do you think?
DENVER
(downplaying her excitement)
Maybe....
SETHE
Maybe...All right...all right.
(difficult for her to say)
Can I ask you something?
(Denver nods, her back to
Sethe)
I was wondrin'..What you think about
us...maybe... maybe thinking we could
start...if we got an idea to, thinking we
could start.. countin' on...
(she stops)
DENVER
On what mama? Countin' on what?
Sethe can barely bring herself to say. To hope. To imagine.
Paul? But, for Denver, she forces herself and whispers;
SETHE
Something.
The Young Woman seated on a chair as Denver refills a tin cup
of water. The Young Woman drinks greedily, cup after cup.
SETHE
You from around here?
The Young Woman shakes her head NO. She reaches down and
takes off her shoes, which Sethe notices as new. Sethe bends
down to pick them up. The Young Woman never lets her eyes
leave Sethe.
PAUL
Those shoes look brand new.
SETHE
What might your name be?
The Young Woman speaks in a low, rough voice;
BELOVED
Beloved.
Sethe drops the shoes. Denver sits down. Paul smiles;
PAUL
Beloved. You use a last name, Beloved?
BELOVED
Last. No..just Beloved..
(she spells it)
B..E..L..O..V..E..D...
As she spells it we see sethe's reaction; she is deeply
touched. Then Denver's - who looks both amazed and curiously
excited.
Sethe hangs her own hat on a peg then approaches Beloved.
SETHE
That's a pretty name Beloved. Take off
your hat and I'll make us something. We
just got back from the carnival over near
Cincinnati-
But Beloved has fallen asleep upright in the chair.
PAUL
Miss...Miss, you want to lay down?
Her eyes open to slits. Paul is about to help her when Denver
rises;
DENVER
I'll take her up. She can sleep in baby
Suggs room - that all right Mama?
SETHE
Course.
Denver eases Beloved onto her feet, which Sethe and Paul
notice do not have a line or sore on them.
PAUL
(whispers to Sethe)
Look at her feet? They're not walking
feet. More like she rode from somewhere
all the way here.
Yet, Beloved can barely stand upon them as Denver escorts her
to the white staircase. Beloved starts coughing.
PAUL
Sounds like the croup.
SETHE
Is she feverish, Denver?
DENVER
No. She's cold.
SETHE
Then she is. Fever goes from hot to cold.
PAUL
Could have the cholera.
DENVER
(adamant)
She's not sick!
Denver helps her up the stairs. Sethe and Paul register
Denver's defensive reaction.
Denver eases Beloved into the bed. Beloved falls asleep the
second she hits the pillow. Denver gently - cautiously -
strokes Beloved's forehead and cheek.
Denver stands vigil beside Beloved, wrapped beneath a quilt.
Denver watches her sleep, wiping her hot forehead with cold
cloths...
Denver washes out Beloved's underwear and stockings...She
hears Beloved murmuring. She moves quickly to her side.
DENVER
Beloved? Beloved I'm here...what is it?
BELOVED
Heavy..this place is heavy.
DENVER
Would you like to sit up?
Beloved shakes her head no. She takes hold of Denver's arm
and wraps it around her own body. Denver sits up against the
pillow as Beloved snuggles her body into Denver's arms and
falls back asleep. Denver holds her, lovingly.
Denver has not left her bedside. She places another quilt
upon her, tucking it in around the sides. As she does this,
Beloved's eyes open for a brief moment, catching the sight of
Denver over her. She smiles. Denver gratefully smiles back.
DENVER
Can I get you anything? Are you hungry?
Beloved looks over to a plate of half finished food -
Denver's meal. Denver picks up a piece of sweet bread and
feeds her. Denver is thrilled.
THE FOLLOWING SCENES TAKE PLACE OVER SEVERAL WEEKS;
Denver places sugar between two pieces of bread and gives the
sandwich to Beloved, who, no longer feeling sickly, accepts
it with a bright smile.
Denver explains to Beloved how to warm the chicks with their
skirts as the latter eats something sweet. They both giggle
at the softness of the chicks.
Denver is showing Beloved how to make her bed.
DENVER
..then you fold it over like this see.
This here used to be where my brothers
and me slept. I was always at the top.
BELOVED
How you get so smart?
DENVER
I ain't so smart.
BELOVED
Yes you are!
DENVER
Well, I used to go to Lady Jones. She'd
teach us with songs how to spell and
count.
BELOVED
You don't go no more?
DENVER
No I...I had to stop going.
BELOVED
You so smart. Tell me about your
brothers.
DENVER
Well..they're names were Howard and..
As Denver continues, Beloved steps towards her and begins to
touch her face - examining her lips, her nose, her skin as if
it were a rose to admire. Denver drinks in the attention, her
heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange
creature.
DENVER
..and....and Bulgar...At night, we used
to..crawl into bed together..I'd lay down
on Bul's lap and Howard would tell us die-
witch stories. He said they would protect
us...And if I learned them, they would
protect me if ever they were gone...
Paul confronts Sethe as she sews.
PAUL
You gonna just feed her, from now on?
SETHE
Denver likes her. She's no real trouble.
PAUL
But don't she have a home? Some place to
go?
SETHE
Didn't mention one. I thought we'd wait
until her breathing got better. She still
sounds a little lumbar.
PAUL
She breathe like she can eat, she could
blow this whole house down. And all those
sweets.
SETHE
Sometimes the body needs that sugar for
strength when it's trying to recover
after an illness.
PAUL
But that's just it. She don't seem sick.
Something funny about her.
SETHE
Funny? How?
PAUL
Acts sick, sounds sick but she don't look
sick. Good skin, bright hands and strong
as a bull.
SETHE
She can hardly walk without holding onto
something.
PAUL
That's what I mean. Can't walk but I
passed by Baby Sugg's room this morning
and saw her lifting the rocker with one
hand.
SETHE
You didn't?
PAUL
Don't tell me. Ask Denver. She was right
there.
At that moment, Denver passes by on her way to the kitchen.
SETHE
Denver. Come in here a minute.
Denver enters the keeping room.
SETHE
Paul says you saw Beloved pick up the
rocking chair in Baby Suggs room with one
hand. That so?
Denver looks at Paul with a hard gaze;
DENVER
I didn't see no such thing.
From Paul's expression we can tell Denver is lying...and
whatever fragile connection they were building, is swiftly
destroyed.
Sethe is getting ready for bed. Denver sticks her head in:
DENVER
Have you seen her? I can't find her.
SETHE
Who?
DENVER
Beloved.
Sethe shakes her head. Denver exits anxiously. The mentions
of Beloved's name stir a MEMORY in Sethe:
MEMORY:
As the memory starts to fade form her mind, Sethe suddenly
feels someone else's presence. She looks up to find:
Beloved standing by the door - watching her.
SETHE
Oh!...I didn't know you were there.
BELOVED
Can I help?
SETHE
Help what, honey?
Beloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning
up Sethe's night dress.
BELOVED
Where you go in the morning?
SETHE
Work. I work in a restaurant.
BELOVED
What time you go?
SETHE
Little after the sun come up. I like to
make a loaf of bread before I go. How you
feelin'?
Beloved nods, absorbing the information.
SETHE
You remember your mother at all?
BELOVED
(scratching back of her head)
I remember a woman who was mine and I
remember bein snatched away from her.
Sethe, nods, understanding such things. She cautiously
reaches out to stroke Beloved's face. Beloved responds like a
puppy, pressing her cheek against Sethe's hand. Sethe is
moved.
Sethe enters the kitchen to make bread before she leaves for
work. She finds Beloved waiting for her, placing out her
cooking things on the table. Beloved looks up and smiles.
BELOVED
I'm helpin make your bread.
Camera moves up from the mended legs of the table Paul broke
to;
A suspicious Paul glares at Beloved as they eat dinner.
Beloved is ever ready to pass Sethe a bowl or napkin or
whatever she needs. She is "shining" - for Sethe, and for
Sethe alone.
Denver notices it as well.
It is raining outside. Both Denver and Beloved are wet from
the rain. Denver's hair is all tangled.
SETHE
Best unbraid that hair.
DENVER
Tomorrow.
SETHE
Today's always here. Tomorrow never.
DENVER
It hurts.
SETHE
Comb it everyday, it won't..
BELOVED
Your woman never fixed up your hair?
All three look to Beloved, puzzled by her question, which is
clearly intended for Sethe. Paul's getting more annoyed.
PAUL
What?
SETHE
My woman?..You mean my mother?
Beloved nods. Paul and Denver exchange a curious look.
SETHE
If she did I don't remember. I don't
think I saw her but a few times.
BELOVED
Tell me 'bout her.
Paul and Denver look to Sethe, waiting to see if she'll answer.
SETHE
..I remember once, she picked me up and
carried me behind the smokehouse... The
only thing I do remember in fact...
Paul is disturbed by Sethe's carefree storytelling - how it
contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it
will lead to no good...
Once again, Denver is surprised to hear what she's never
heard before. She looks to Paul and knows what he is
thinking. Paul looks back and knows Denver realizes it. But
Denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the
eyes.
SETHE
...She opened up her dress and right on
her rib, right here, was a circle and a
cross burnt right into the skin....
PAUL
(interrupts her)
Sethe.
SETHE
What?
Paul doesn't want her to continue but doesn't want to say so.
PAUL
Any more beans?
Sethe rises to get him more food and she continues:
SETHE
...anyway, she points to this mark and
says to me "This is your ma'am. I am the
only one whose got this mark now. The
rest all dead. If something happens to me
and you can't tell me by my face, you can
know me by this mark"..Scared me so...
I couldn't think of anything to say so I
said "Yes Ma'am..but how will you know
us? Mark me too. Mark the mark on me
too."
DENVER
Did she?
SETHE
No. She slapped my face. I didn't
understand it then. Not until I had a
mark of my own...
Paul is disturbed. He can see Sethe getting upset. He is mad
at Beloved for her damn questions..
BELOVED
What happened to her?
Something inside of Sethe stops, a wall erected. Something
unwanted is coming into her consciousness. Paul notices it.
She rises;
SETHE
Don't know. Everybody done?
Sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as Paul asks:
PAUL
Well, as long as we're all asking
questions, getting to know each other..
(to Beloved)
Why don't you tell us a little bit about
yourself?
Camera follows Sethe as she arrives at the sink, placing the
dish inside. We hear the others O.S.:
DENVER (O.S.)
(defensively)
She don't remember nothing.
PAUL (O.S.)
You be surprised what you start
remembering once you start talking.
BELOVED (O.S.)
Can I have some more pudding?
Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the
kitchen table. She is staring out the window above the sink
as if watching the MEMORY BEING RELIVED IN HER YARD;
POV - OUT THE WINDOW;
MEMORY:
Sethe, the memory passing, hears the voices in her kitchen:
PAUL (O.S.)
Ain't you got no brothers or sisters?
BELOVED (O.S.)
I don't have nobody.
She finds Paul interrogating Beloved who eats a second
pudding. Denver tries to interfere.
DENVER
She has us now!
PAUL
You been here five weeks, we still don't
know nothing bout you..
SETHE
Paul, Stop it. Denver bring those dishes.
PAUL
What was you looking for when you came here?
BELOVED
This place. I was looking for this place
I could be in.
PAUL
Somebody tell you about this place?
At the sink, both Sethe and Denver pause, obviously interested.
BELOVED
She told me. When I was at the bridge,
she told me.
Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs;
SETHE
Must be somebody from the old days.
PAUL
How'd you come? Who brought you?
BELOVED
I walked here. A long, long, long, long
way. Nobody bring me.
PAUL
You had new shoes. If you walked so long
why don't your shoes show it?
SETHE
Paul D. stop picking on her.
PAUL
I want to know! Where'd you get them
shoes and that dress you had on?
BELOVED
I take the shoes! (coughs) I take the
dress! (coughs) The shoe strings don't
fit! I...
Suddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding
and falls backward, off the chair.
Denver and Sethe rush towards her. Beloved thrashes around
until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin.
She breathes in Sethe's arms as Denver wipes up the mess,
glaring at Paul.
SETHE
You all right?
BELOVED
(whispers)
I want to go to sleep now.
DENVER
Come to my room. I can watch out for you
up there.
Sethe gets Beloved to her feet. Denver takes her up the
staircase to her room - glaring at Paul.
When the girls have gone, Sethe turns on Paul as she cleans
up.
SETHE
What's the matter with you?
PAUL
I don't understand what the hold is. It's
clear why she holds onto you, but I just
can't see why you holding on to her.
SETHE
What you care who's holding on to who?
Feeding her is no trouble. And she's nice
company for Denver.
PAUL
We was just starting to feel a little
like a family ourselves.
SETHE
Is that what's got your teeth on edge?
PAUL
I can't place it. It's a feeling in me.
SETHE
You wanna feel somethin!? ... Feel how it
is to have a bed to sleep in and somebody
there not worrying you to death about
what you got to do each day to deserve
it. And if that don't get it, feel how it
feels to be a colored woman roaming the
roads with anything God made liable to
jump on you. Feel that!
PAUL
I know every bit of that, Sethe. I wasn't
born yesterday and I never mistreated a
woman in my life!
SETHE
Well, that makes one of you in this
world.
PAUL
(surprised)
One? Not two.
SETHE
No. Not two!
PAUL
What Halle ever do to you? Halle stood by
you. He never left you.
SETHE
Ha, what'd he leave then if not me, huh?
PAUL
I don't know but it wasn't you. That's a
fact.
SETHE
Then he did worse - he left his children.
PAUL
You don't know that.
SETHE
HE WASN'T THERE! He wasn't where he said
he would be! I had to pack my babies off
ahead of me, on their own, so I could
stay behind to look for him...Underground
agent said by Sunday we had to leave..
Sunday came and he wasn't there.
PAUL
He couldn't get out of the loft, I expect.
Forgetting himself, Paul let that slip out.
SETHE
Loft? What loft?
PAUL
(hesitates)
The one over your head... The one in the
barn.
Sethe stops dead cold. It's no use...
The MEMORY TAKES OVER:
Violent, rapid images of Sethe being raped and beaten held
down by SCHOOLTEACHER'S BOYS. Sethe, pinned down, stares up
at the loft...Camera rises up...
There, in the loft, hides HALLE...The expression on his face
is that of a man broken in two...
END of MEMORY.
Sethe wraps her arms tightly around herself and asks;
SETHE
He saw? He told you he saw?
PAUL
You told me. The day I came here. You
said they stole your milk. I never knew
what messed Halle up. That was it, I
guess. I seen him the day after you left.
Says where you been Halle? All he says to
me was "the loft". I asked him what he
meant not going with you but he never
answers me. But I knew was something
broke him. Not one of them years of
Saturdays, Sundays and nighttime extra
never touched him. But whatever he saw go
on in the barn that day broke him like a
twig.
SETHE
He saw them boys do that to me and let
them keep on breathing?
PAUL
A man ain't a Goddamn ax, Sethe.
Chopping, hacking, busting every Goddamn
minute of the day. Things get to him.
Things he can't chop down cause they
inside him. The last time I saw him, I
knew he was broken for good...
SETHE
What did he say?
PAUL
Nothing.
SETHE
What did you say? Didn't you say anything
to him?
PAUL
I couldn't.
SETHE
Couldn't?! Why the hell not?!
C.U. on PAUL who doesn't want to explain - or even remember -
as we cut to:
MEMORY:
The room is still dark from the night but the sun is rising
outside.
Suddenly, Beloved awakens with a start. She senses something.
She rises and looks out the window to see;
POV;
SETHE WALKING ACROSS THE FIELD.
Beloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her, as
Denver awakens just in time to see her go.
Amy makes a pile of leaves for Sethe to lay on and some rocks
for her to put up her feet. She talks non-stop as she works.
AMY
Never know it to look at me but I used to
be a good size. Nice arms, everything.
That was before they put me in the root
cellar...
She eases Sethe onto the leaves then lifts her feet onto the
rocks.
AMY
...Mama worked for these people here to
pay for her passage but then she had me
and died right after so I had to work
for'em.. I was fishing off the Beaver
once and a nigger floated right by me. I
don't like drowned people, do you? Your
feet remind me of him. All swole like.
Amy props Sethe up from behind when she notices
AMY
You all bloody back here. Gal you a mess.
Undo your dress - let me see.
Sethe makes a tremendous effort just to turn to her side as
Amy undoes her dress;
AMY
Lord, I ain't never seen a poorer excuse
for a-
Amy sees Sethe's back and, for a moment, is speechless. Then:
AMY
Jesus...It's a tree Lu..A chokecherry
tree. I had me some whippings but I don't
remember nothing like this. Glad I ain't
you.. what God have in mind I wonder.
...You thank your Maker I come along.
Spiderwebs all I can do for you. What's
in here ain't enough. I'll look
outside...Maybe I ought to break them
blossoms open and let the pus run..
(rises)
(smiles)
That you ain't dead yet Lu's a miracle.
Make you a bet..You make it through the
night, you make it all the way...
To Sethe's amazement, Amy begins to massage her feet and legs
the pain of which causes Sethe to cry.
AMY
It's gonna hurt now..Anything dead coming
back to life hurts. Stop wiggling, girl.
(sings)
"WHEN THE BUSY DAY IS DONE AND MY WEARY
LITTLE ONE ROCKETH TO AND FRO; WHEN THE
NIGHT WINDS SOFTLY BLOW AND CRICKETS
CHIRP AGAIN; WHERE'PON THE HAUNTED GREEN
FAIRIES DANCE AROUND THEIR QUEEN THEN
FROM YONDER MISTY SKIES COMETH LADY
BUTTON EYES..."
(talks)
Don't up and die on me in the night, you
hear me Lu? I don't want to see your ugly
face hankering over me. If you do die,
just go on off somewhere where I can't
see you, hear?
SETHE
I'll do what I can, miss.
Amy continues singing.....
Stamp Paid leads Sethe and the others into the hutch.
STAMP PAID
Wait here. Somebody be here directly.
Don't move. They'll find you.
SETHE
Thank you. What's your name - so I can
remember you right.
STAMP PAID
Name's Stamp. Stamp Paid. Watch out for
that baby, you hear?
She nods as he and the boys exit.
LAP DISSOLVE:
LATER - SAME LOCATION:
Sethe is asleep with the baby when ELLA enters the hutch;
ELLLA
Saw the sign a while ago but I couldn't
get here no quicker.
SETHE
What sign?
ELLA
Stamp always leave the old sty open when
there's a crossing. Knots a white rag on
the post if it's a child too.
(kneels)
My name's Ella..Where you headed?
Ella empties a sack with a wool blanket, cotton cloth, two
baked sweet potatoes and a pair of men's shoes.
SETHE
My mother-in-law's. Name's Baby Suggs. She
got my other three children I sent ahead.
ELLA
When was this one born?
SETHE
Yesterday. I hope she makes it.
ELLA
Hard to say.
(gives her men's shoes)
Let's try to get these on your feet.
Baby Suggs bathes Sethe - first her face, her body...hands,
arms, legs...
When she gets to her unrecognizable feet, she touches them.
BABY SUGGS
You feel this?
SETHE
Feel what?
BABY SUGGS
Nothing..
Baby Suggs notices roses of blood on Sethe's back...She looks
and covers her mouth when she sees the remnants of the whipping.
BABY SUGGS
Girl...
Baby Suggs with two other grown women attend to Sethe's back -
greasing it and pinning double thicknesses of cloth to the
inside of a newly stitched dress...
Sethe, sitting in bed with her new dress and her wounds
dressed waits for her children.
Baby Suggs opens the door and the boys are ushered in. Sethe
welcomes them to her arms...They run to her, jumping on the
bed. The startle causes some pain but Sethe doesn't care.
The Little Girl (Beloved) is crawling and ushered toward her
mama.
BABY SUGGS
Already crawling - ain't that somethin?
..Come on, baby girl..right this
way..Mama's waiting..
Sethe picks her up and the tears flow. She can't stop kissing
them - their necks, their heads, their hands...The Boys
inspect her strange looking feet and ask;
HOWARD
Pappie come?
SETHE
Soon.
Baby Suggs seems doubtful but appreciates the lie for the
children.
BABY SUGGS
All right boys - mama's home now, you be
seeing her all the time..Go downstairs
and get your supper...Go on...
Sethe hugs and kisses them as if for the last time - as if
she still doesn't believe she can just get out of bed, walk
downstairs and be with them. The Boys leave as Sethe cradles
the Little Girl.
Sethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her
breast to the Little Girl. She winces with pain and smiles -
she got her milk to her baby girl.
Baby Suggs gathers the rags Sethe wore when she first arrived.
BABY SUGGS
Nothing worth saving here.
SETHE
Oh wait..Look and see if there's
something knotted up in the petticoat.
Wedding present. From Mrs. Garner.
Baby Suggs finds TWO CRYSTAL EARRINGS.
BABY SUGGS
Be nice if there was a groom to go with
it. What do you think happened to him?
SETHE
I don't know. He wasn't where he said to
meet him at. I had to get out. I had to.
He'll make it. if I made it, Halle sure
can.
BABY SUGGS
(skeptical)
Well put these on - maybe they'll light
his way.
As Sethe takes the earrings, the Little Baby Girl reaches for
them.
Through her eyes, we see them sparkle and shine - like
diamonds.
Baby Suggs hands gently massage Sethe's neck as she says;
BABY SUGGS
Whatever happens now...God lead you home.
So now lay'em down Sethe...Sword and
shield..Don't study war no more. Lay all
that mess down. Sword and shield...
Sethe surrenders herself to Baby Suggs firm, safe hands -
letting go of the "diamonds", one of which lands in the hands
of the Little Girl...who plays with them in fascination...
END OF MEMORY.
CUT BACK TO:
PRESENT DAY;
Sethe enters and runs through the house to the kitchen;
SETHE
Paul? Paul, you home?...
Paul sits in a tub under the white staircase. He smiles.
Sethe is relieved...grateful to find him there, for her.
PAUL
Where else would I be on a Sunday off?
Sethe smiles, almost in tears.
PAUL
Why don't you come on in here?
SETHE
Paul D. What if the girls came in?
PAUL
I don't hear nobody.
SETHE
I have to cook.
Paul D. stands up in the tub and holds Sethe against his wet,
naked body.
PAUL
What you gonna cook?
SETHE
(loving his body and his
attention)
I thought I'd make some snap beans.
PAUL
Oh yeah.
SETHE
Fry up a little corn?
PAUL
Yeah.
He kisses her - and that's exactly what she wanted.
SETHE
Oh Paul...
PAUL
I'm right here baby.
SETHE
Thank you Lord.
Camera slowly moves out of the kitchen as Sethe and Paul
begin to make love, revealing;
Beloved watching from the doorway, unknown to Sethe or Paul.
She is disgusted, envious...and runs out..
The inhabitants eat dinner in silence.
Denver awaits a look from Beloved. As Beloved passes her a
bowl of peas with a smile, Denver is satisfied.
Beloved then turns to Paul, offering him the bowl.
BELOVED
You have brothers or sisters?
Caught off guard, Paul looks to Sethe - whose expression asks
him to be nice.
PAUL
We don't talk about that.
Beat.
BELOVED
Sethe told us you been walking for
eighteen years. Where you been all that
time?
Paul is about to get mad when he looks to Sethe again, reels
it back in and answers curtly, but politely;
PAUL
Lots of places. I don't remember them
all. Don't remember much about anything.
BELOVED
You be surprised what you start
remembering once you start talking.
Hearing his own words echoed back to him, annoys him.
PAUL
Well not me. What's gone is gone. No good
come from bringing it back.
Pause. Paul focuses on his dinner, suddenly ill at ease. He
can't help looking, covertly, at Beloved and finds Beloved
staring right back at him...It makes him shiver.
Sethe is asleep.
Paul is restless - tossing and turning as we Intercut;
Dream Images flashing across his mind...
- RAIN POURING DOWN A TRENCH. A MUDDY POOL FORMING AROUND A
BLACK MAN'S FEET.
- IRON CHAINS FED INTO METAL ANKLE CUFFS.
- PAUL D. ON HIS KNEES BEFORE A WHITE GUARD crotch.
WHITE GUARD (OS)
YOU HUNGRY NIGGER?
Paul awakens.
Sethe enters to find Paul asleep in the rocker by the stove.
She stirs him.
SETHE
Paul?..Paul?
PAUL
(waking up)
Mmmm. What?...
SETHE
I called you two or three times but I
gave up round midnight. I thought maybe
you went out somewhere.
PAUL
Damn. I'm sorry honey...
SETHE
I'll make some breakfast - you get
yourself washed up.
Sethe begins to make breakfast as Beloved enters the kitchen
and sees Paul has slept in the rocker. She looks at him with
a smile, as if she knows more than she's letting on. Paul
registers the look.
Paul is asleep in the rocker...He is restless...HE DREAMS:
Paul awakens...his face and body drenched in sweat.
A torrential downpour. The men in the wooden cages watch the
rain filling the trench, corroding the red dirt wall around
them.
Bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet. Mud
covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof.
Some finds rest. other's minds are long gone.
Camera finds Paul...HE IS SCREAMING. But there is no sound
coming from his mouth. Tears flow down his face, but when he
touches them, he realizes;
They are tears of mud. He looks up and the wooden planked
roof is breaking under the power of the rain..He looks down
and the water is up to his thighs.
Suddenly, the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is
knocked down..He gets up, searches through the mud for the
chain and notices it's slack..He pulls as well....
One by one the men in the boxes realize the chain's end is
being undone by the rain, as camera tracks down towards the
last box to the dirt wall, into which the chain has been
locked...It is giving way within the muddy wall.
THE MEN BREAK THROUGH THE ROTTED WOOD ROOFS TO FREEDOM...
WIDE ANGLE;
AS THE MEN CLIMB OUT OF THE MUDDY COFFINS, GRASPING FOR A
HOLD, CRAWLING WITH EVERY MUSCLE OF THEIR BODIES - TO GET OUT
OF THE TRENCH before mud and water drown them....
Paul climbs with the will of ten men, with every ounce of
strength he has left...
END of MEMORY.
CUT BACK TO:
Paul D. is wide awake. The memories won't let him sleep.
Winter has arrived and the night is cold. He lies underneath
a thin blanket in yet another sleeping place, even further
from the house. He adds newspapers under and around his body
to stay warm.
He looks as if he has given up on sleeping altogether. He
hears the door to the cold room open. But he does not turn to
look.
PAUL
What do you want in here?
Beloved enters the cold room.
BELOVED
I want you to touch me on the inside part
and call me my name.
She hoists up her skirt and turns her head away.. Paul stares
at a silver lard can so as not to look.
PAUL
When good people take you in and treat
you good, you ought to try to be good
back. You don't....Sethe loves you. Much
as her own daughter. You know that.
BELOVED
(drops her skirt)
She don't love me like I love her. I
don't love nobody but her.
PAUL
Then what you come in here for?
BELOVED
I want you to touch me on the inside
part.
PAUL
Ever since you come here - feel like I
got a new devil to face.
BELOVED
You have to touch me. On the inside part.
And you have to call me my name.
PAUL
Ain't no chains on me no more. I don't
have to do nothing...Now, go back in that
house and go to bed.
Paul continues to stare at the lard can - like Lot's wife,
he's fearful what turning to look will do.
BELOVED
Call me my name.
Beloved moves closer, right up behind him, entwining her arms
around his body, like chains..
PAUL
No. Ain't no chains on me...
BELOVED
Call me.
PAUL
...Ain't no chains on me...
BELOVED
I'll go if you say it.
Tears well up in his eyes. Paul can feel her warmth. He
surrenders.
PAUL
Beloved.
Beloved presses her body against his. He turns and grabs her,
kissing her with a passion bordering on hatred.
Sethe, Denver, Paul and Beloved eat dinner...in silence.
Beloved is wrapping her body with a blanket as Paul lies on
his bed of newspapers - their lovemaking finished. Beloved
gives him a final look - no tenderness or affection or even
friendliness. Just a cold look, void of respect or even
attraction.
She exits the cold house, leaving Paul alone. He is on the
verge of tears.
Paul stands above the sleeping Sethe - his guilt driving him
mad. He wants to touch her, to wake her, to ask for
forgiveness and help. But he can not and buries his head in
his hands.
Denver is cleaning the dishes. Beloved sits like an angry,
upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth.
BELOVED
She likes him here...
(to Denver)
Make him go away.
DENVER
She'd be mad if he leaves.
Beloved didn't consider that. Her fingers move violently in
her mouth as if something were bothering her...until,
finally, she pulls out a back tooth...her lips slightly
bloody.
DENVER
OOoo..didn't that hurt you?
BELOVED
It's like my dreams...I get two dreams,
see..One, I exploding...BUUOOGGG...The
other I being swallowed. Sometimes it's
hard to keep my head on my neck, or these
legs connected to my hips...One day I
think I might wake up and I'll be in
pieces..
(Looks at tooth)
Maybe it's starting.
DENVER
(cleans Beloved's mouth)
Oh stop. It's just a tooth. Probably
wisdom. Does it hurt?
BELOVED
Yes.
DENVER
Then why don't you cry?
BELOVED
What?
DENVER
If it hurts, why don't you cry?
Beloved, eases herself into Denver's arms, and cries...
Sethe lies with Paul, in the dark, her face looking up to the
ceiling. Paul is asleep.
On her face are reservations. She rises, crossing to the
window to look out.
At the same time, Beloved appears silently at the doorway of
the room, looking at Sethe - hurt and sad. She walks by
without Sethe noticing her.
Sethe takes a breath at the window, watching the snow fall.
Then, as she moves back to the bed,...
Camera moves ahead of her to:
A DIFFERENT BED IN WHICH HALLE IS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP. A
YOUNGER SETHE CRAWLS IN BESIDE HIM.
WE ARE IN MEMORY;
Sethe, Halle and the baby girl (Beloved) sleep together by
the wall. The boys sleep together under a window.
Halle is
trying to sleep but Sethe is awake...
SETHE
What you think about Schoolteacher?
HALLE
He white, ain't he?
SETHE
I mean, is he different like Mr. Garner
was?
HALLE
How was he different?
SETHE
Well, he and Mrs. Garner - they ain't
like other whites I seen before.
Mr. Garner always spoke soft, for one.
Mrs. Garner too.
HALLE
Don't matter. Loud or soft, what they
say is the same.
SETHE
Mr. Garner let you buy out your mother.
Found that house for her to live in from
those friends of his in Ohio...
HALLE
Yep. He did.
SETHE
Well?
HALLE
If he hadn't, she would have dropped in
his cooking stove.
SETHE
Still, he did it. Let you work off her
fee, lending yourself out on Sundays. He
could of said no. He didn't tell you no.
HALLE
No, he didn't tell me no. She worked here
ten years. If she worked another ten, ya
think she would have made it? I pay him
for her last years and in return he got
you, me and three more coming..
SETHE
He always treated you fair. Called you
all men - said he never wanted niggers on
his farm.
HALLE
That's just it. We was men because he
said so. We was men because we was on his
land. You think he be calling us men if
we ever walked off his land?
SETHE
When we walk, don't matter what they call
you. You'll be free.
HALLE
Sethe..baby girl, that ain't gonna
happen. Not by walking, anyway.
SETHE
What you mean?
HALLE
Schoolteacher in there told me to quit
lending myself out.
That phrase "..while the boys is small"..causes Sethe to look
at her sleeping boys..
SETHE
But..then..how you gonna buy yourself
out? Or them?
(points to the children)
Or me?
Halle raises himself up to face her, to give her the final blow.
HALLE
Ain't gonna be no buying us out, like I
did with mama. Or them. As far as
Schoolteacher concerned, ain't no other
life ahead for any of us but this one.
Sethe understands, looks to her sleeping children and is
frightened.
SETHE
Halle....what we going to do?
HALLE
(whispers)
Sixo, ya know he creeps out at night..he
says the way they took my ma'am..he says
freedom is that way. He and Paul A. got a
plan.
They heard of this man, what they
call an underground agent...if we do what
he says, don't need no buy out.
SETHE
You mean...? But what if we caught?
What'd they do to us? To the children?
HALLE
Same thing they're doing now, honey -
only quicker.
Mrs. Garner is sick in bed with a goiter. Sethe enters with
some soup.
MRS. GARNER
I don't think I can swallow that.
Too thick. I'm sure it's too thick.
SETHE
Want me to loosen it up with a little
water?
MRS. GARNER
No. Take it away. Bring me some cool
water, that's all.
SETHE
Yes ma'am...
Sethe helps her drink a glass of cold water.
MRS. GARNER
Yes, you can have quite a few.
(drinks)
Mmmm. Thank you Sethe. Now tell me, I
know Halle's no trouble but the others,
the Pauls and Sixo - how's my brother-in-
law handling them? All right?
SETHE
Yes Ma'am. Look like it.
MRS. GARNER
They do what he tells them?
SETHE
They don't need telling.
MRS. GARNER
Good. That's a mercy. I know he's no Mr.
Garner. But after he died, I had no else
to turn to. I would've had to sell one.
It wasn't even enough selling Paul F. And
in my condition. I needed help. People
said I shouldn't be alone here with
nothing but Negroes. And he is a learned
man being a schoolteacher...
As Sethe fills Mrs. Garner's basin with fresh water, she
looks out the window and sees:
SCHOOLTEACHER outside with his students, we notice HE WEARS A
VERY DISTINCTIVE HAT as Mrs. Garners description continues;
MRS. GARNER
...I know his ways might be a little more
strict but as long as the men do as
they're told I'm sure it'll be fine. All
right, I'm through.. Talking makes me
tired.
SETHE
Yes ma'am.
Sethe lies beaten and raped, her clothes torn, her body
aching and sweaty. She struggles to get to her feet and exit
the barn.
Sethe opens the door to find her children asleep. She is
about to wake them when;
She notices Mrs. Garner's light is on in her bedroom window.
Sethe, blind with rage, decides there's one thing she must do
before she takes her children to the meeting place.
Mrs. Garner lies ailing through a sleepless night when her
bedroom door opens. Sethe enters - her appearance tells all.
MRS. GARNER
My God Sethe..what happened to you?
Sethe awakens, sweating from having fallen asleep and
reliving her past nightmare. She sits up and realizes where
she is. She looks beside her and sees Paul asleep. She lays
down, pressing her body against his so that there is no space
between - enfolding her arms around him.
Paul sits at the table. Sethe begins her story seated before
him.
SETHE
I don't have to tell you about Sweet
Home. What it was. But maybe you don't
know what it was like for me to get away
from there.
She looks for a response but expects none.
SETHE
I did it. I got us all out. Without Halle
too. Up til then it was the only thing I
ever did on my own. Decided. And it came
off right like it was supposed to..
She rises and begins to move about the room, circling Paul
as she tries to find a way to explain it all;
SETHE
We was here. Each and every one of my
babies and me too. I birthed them and I
got 'em out and it wasn't no accident. I
did that! I had help, of course, lots of
that, but still it was me doing it; me
saying, "Go on" and "Now!". Me having to
look out. Me using my own head. But it
was more than that. It was a kind of
...'thinking-about-myself' I never knew
nothing about before. It felt good. Good
and right. I was big, Paul, and deep and
wide and when I stretched out my arms all
my children could get in between. I was
that wide. Look like I loved them more
after I got them here. Or maybe I
couldn't love'em proper in Sweet Home
'cause they wasn't mine to love. But when
I got here, when I jumped off that wagon -
there wasn't nobody in the world I
couldn't love if I wanted to....
DISSOLVE TO:
MEMORY... as SETHE NARRATES:
SETHE (VO)
I had 28 days...28 good days of free
life.....
Sethe, out of habit, is awake before the sun has risen. She
is fully dressed.
SETHE (VO)
...of getting up like I always did,
getting dressed before the sun came out,
and then realizing I had to decide myself
what to do with the day...
She sits on the bed, watching the sun rise.
Sethe watches her children sleeping, safely.
SETHE (VO)
...Days of watching my children sleep
away the morning...And taking care of my
baby like it was the most important thing
I had to do...
Denver is asleep in a bassinet. Sethe reaches in and picks
her up. She sits by a window and breast feeds her as she hums
A MELODY. (This is the same melody we heard Sethe humming in
the beginning of the film).
Sethe's melody carries itself over the following images;
Ella teaches Sethe a new stitch as she chatters on.
SETHE (VO)
We had us days of company...
Baby Suggs and Sethe cook with a kitchen full of men and
women who have come for a visit.
SETHE (VO)
...of ease and real talk. Talks about the
Fugitive Bill, Dred Scott or book
learning...Talks as quiet or as stormy as
we wanted...
Two men get into an argument to the amusement of the women.
Sethe and Baby Suggs and Ella and several other women cook.
SETHE (VO)
...Three pies became twelve...two hens
became five turkeys...
The Nephew opens the door. The Four Men enter....
Howard and Bulgar are bleeding in the sawdust, unconscious -
a bloody shovel lays near them.
Sethe is holding a blood-soaked Little Girl (Beloved) to her
chest with one hand...and Denver by the heels of the other.
She is swinging Denver toward the wall planks, misses then
tries again...
When out of nowhere, Stamp Paid rushes by the horrified white
men and GRABS DENVER OUT OF SETHE'S HAND before she can swing
her a second time...
Stillness.
Schoolteacher looks at the carnage...a bloody saw lies at
Sethe's feet, the weapon she used on her own child's throat.
The Nephew is paralyzed...horrified.
NEPHEW
What she go and do that for?...What she
go and do that for?
Baby Suggs walks in. Whatever amount of God's grace she could
imagine and will into being, vanishes with one look into that
shed.
SHERIFF
You all better go on.
(to Schoolteacher)
Nothing here to claim, I guess.
Look like your business is over. Mine's
started.
Schoolteacher beats his hat against his thigh and spits in
the shed before exiting, followed by the catcher and the
nephew.
The Sheriff speaks to Sethe.
SHERIFF
I'll have to take you in. No trouble now.
You've done enough to last you....
Sethe doesn't move.
SHERIFF
You come quiet, here, and I won't have to
tie you up.
Meanwhile, Baby Suggs notices who breathes and who does not
and moves straight to the boys....
Stamp Paid extends his arm to Sethe.
STAMP PAID
Sethe. You take my arm and gimme yours.
Sethe turns to him, the first time she's looked into anyone's
eyes and sees Denver in his arms...A sound escapes from her
throat as though she'd made a mistake.
SHERIFF
I'm going out here and send for a wagon.
He exits. Baby Suggs rubs the boys' hands, tries to raise
their eyelids, spits on her dress and wipes away the blood as
they slowly regain a dazed consciousness..She whispers;
BABY SUGGS
I beg you pardon..I beg your pardon..
Paul D. sits at the kitchen table. The story told. Sethe
looks out the window...and waits..
PAUL
Your love is too thick, Sethe.
SETHE
Love is or it isn't. Thin love ain't love
at all...I did stop him. I took and put
my babies where they'd be safe...
PAUL
Didn't work though, did it?
SETHE
It worked.
PAUL
How? Your boys gone, you don't know
where. One girl dead, the other can't go
farther than the yard. How did it work?
SETHE
They ain't at Sweet Home! Schoolteacher
ain't got'em!
PAUL
Maybe there's worse.
SETHE
It ain't my job to know what's worse.
It's my job to know what is and keep them
away from what I know is terrible. I did
that.
PAUL
What you did was wrong, Sethe.
SETHE
I should have gone back there? Taken my
babies back there?
PAUL
There could have been a way. Some other
way.
SETHE
What way?
PAUL
You got two feet, Sethe. Not four!
That jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it.
Sethe has no response...The distance between these two people
in this small room is suddenly vast.
Paul rises, playing with his hat...not knowing how to leave.
But desperately needing to. He moves to the exit and stops..
PAUL
You can set aside supper for me... Might
be late getting back...
Unable to look at her, he turns to exit. When Sethe speaks in
a soft, forgiving tone, he stops to listen;
SETHE
After all I told you, Paul D. and after
telling me how many feet I have, you
think saying goodbye is gonna break me
into pieces?
Paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through
him...
SETHE
You're a sweet man.
Unable to bear it, Paul turns and leaves...
Sethe stands still, fighting tears, and whispers...
SETHE
So long, Paul D.
Sethe is scrubbing the floor, with Denver trailing by with
dry rags.
Beloved enters holding a pair of ice skates;
BELOVED
What do these do?
Sethe and Beloved look up. Sethe smiles;
SETHE
My Lord...where'd you dig up those?
DENVER
There for skating on the ice.
We have another pair and half of another,
I think.
BELOVED
Can we try them?
Sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious
lightness:
SETHE
Go ice skating? Ha...
(beat)
Why not?
DENVER
You sure mama?
SETHE
Strikes me that after your man leaves, it
might just be the wrong time to be
scrubbing floors... might just be the
perfect time to go ice skating.
Denver and Beloved register hopefulness in the light of
Sethe's attitude. Sethe speaks to Denver;
SETHE
Go get the shawls..and find me an old
shoe for that half a pair...
The girls get excited. Sethe tosses the scrub brush into the
pail.
It is a snowy night outside the windows.
Sethe has laid out blankets and quilts in front of the fire
in the stove. She has made sweet milk that she hands to the
girls before taking her place in between them, on the floor,
facing the fire; Denver, on her right, rests her head on her
lap. Beloved sits on her left.
She looks over to Beloved who is staring at the fire. The
illumination highlights her beauty and her profile; the chin,
mouth, forehead - all copied and exaggerated in a huge shadow
the fire threw on the wall. Sethe can't help but stare as
another thought occurs to her;
BABY SUGGS (V.O.)
...All I remember is how she loved the
bottom of burned bread. Her little
hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they
slapped me".
SETHE (VO)
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If
you can't tell me by my face, look here."
Beloved lifts her head towards the fire at the same time she
leans back to rest on a propped-up pillow. In the flickering
of the firelight, Sethe can see:
A SMILE OF A SCAR BENEATH HER CHIN.
Sethe knows before she's aware of it consciously. And just as
it hits her, BELOVED BEGINS TO HUM A MELODY.
Sethe recognizes it as her own melody.
SETHE
I made that song up. I made it up and
sang it to my children...
Denver lifts her head from her mother's lap to look at Sethe,
knowing what is happening....
SETHE
...Nobody knows that song but me and my
children.
Beloved turns to Sethe;
BELOVED
I know it.
A click. Sethe looks at her daughter, returned. "There is no
gasp of astonishment - no exclaim for the miraculous. For
what is truly miraculous is so, because the magic lies in the
fact that you knew it was there for you all along."
DISSOLVE TO:
MORNING;
It's snowy white outside. The girls are still asleep in front
of the stove. But Denver awakens upon hearing her mother load
the stove with dry wood and begin to cook breakfast. Sethe
hears her wake up and turns, as she beats eggs in a bowl;
SETHE
Back stiff?
DENVER
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor
or the skating.
SETHE
Could be that fall you took.
DENVER
That was fun.
Beloved snores lightly beside her;
DENVER
Should I wake her?
SETHE
No, let her rest.
DENVER
She likes to see you off in the morning.
SETHE
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm
going
make up a nice, big breakfast
against that cold outside.
DENVER
Won't you be late for work?
SETHE
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in
nine years. No great trouble..Whatever
goes on out there goes on with or without
me showing up on time... don't matter...
(looks at the girls)
The world is in this room, baby. This is
all there is and all there needs to be.
Denver smiles - but it is a cautious smile. Something about
her mother's statement both elates and disturbs her.
Sethe enters late, putting on her apron as SAWYER yells;
SAWYER
What the hell you thinking, girl?
Strolling in here this late?
SETHE
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say
nothing to me this morning.
SAWYER
What? What? You talking back to me?
SETHE
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Sethe begins organizing her counter to make pies.
SAWYER
You better get them pies made!
Sethe ignores him as she begins. Sawyer is at a loss.
SAWYER
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they
don't eat it.
SETHE
Make it the way I always do.
SAWYER
Yeah. Too sweet.
(he exits)
Ella opens the front door for Stamp Paid. He looks disturbed.
ELLA
Where you been keeping yourself? I told
John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
STAMP PAID
Oh I been out.
Stamp takes off his hat and follows Ella, who is doing
laundry in the kitchen.
ELLA
Out where?
STAMP PAID
Was over to Baby Suggs.
ELLA
What you want there? Somebody invite you
in?
STAMP PAID
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite
to look after her people.
Ella shrugs and continues folding wet laundry on a line
behind the stove. Stamp sits.
STAMP PAID
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you
might know who she is.
ELLA
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't
know about. What she look like? You sure
that wasn't Denver?
STAMP PAID
I know Denver.
ELLA
You sure?
STAMP PAID
I know what I see.
ELLA
Might see anything at all at 124.
STAMP PAID
True.
ELLA
Better ask Paul D.
STAMP PAID
Can't locate him.
ELLA
He's sleeping in the church.
STAMP PAID
The church!
ELLA
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in
the cellar.
STAMP PAID
It's cold as charity in there! What he do
that for? Any number'll take him in.
ELLA
Can't nobody read minds long distance.
All he have to do is ask somebody.
STAMP PAID
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody
offer? What's going on? Since when a
black man come to town have to sleep in
the cellar like a dog?!
ELLA
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few
days he been there.
STAMP PAID
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all
about it and don't give him a hand? That
don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you
been pulling colored folk out the water
more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you
can't offer a man a bed?! A working man
who can pay his own way?
ELLA
He ask, I give him anything.
STAMP PAID
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
ELLA
I don't know him that well.
STAMP PAID
You know he's colored? What else there to
know?
ELLA
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I
don't feel like it.
STAMP PAID
It's her, ain't it?
ELLA
Her who?
STAMP PAID
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in
there and you don't want nothing to-
ELLA
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see
bottom!
STAMP PAID
Girl, give it up! We been friends too
long to act like this.
Beat. Ella knows he's right. She surrenders the truth.
ELLA
Well, who can tell what went on in there?
I never even knew who Sethe was or none
of her people.
STAMP PAID
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
ELLA
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid
eyes on her till she showed up here. And
how'd she make it and her husband didn't?
And where is he? And how she have that
baby in the woods by herself? Said a
whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe
that? Well, I know what kind of white
that was.
STAMP PAID
Aw, no, Ella.
ELLA
Anything white floating around in the
woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's
something the Lord tells me I don't want
no part of.
STAMP PAID
You was friends.
ELLA
Till she showed herself.
STAMP PAID
Ella.
ELLA
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to
their own children.
STAMP PAID
What's any of that got to do with Paul
D.?
ELLA
What run him off? Tell me that!
STAMP PAID
I run him off.
ELLA
(surprised)
You?
STAMP PAID
I told him...Showed him the newspaper.
About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that
very day.
ELLA
You didn't tell me that. I thought he
already knew.
STAMP PAID
He didn't know nothing. And nobody.
Except her, from when they was at that
place Baby Suggs was at.
ELLA
He knew Baby Suggs?
STAMP PAID
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
ELLA
And he left when he found out what Sethe
did?
(Stamp sits)
What you say casts a different light on
it, I guess...I thought-
Stamp knows what she thought.
ELLA
But you didn't come here talking 'bout
Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
STAMP PAID
That's so.
ELLA
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or
what she is.
STAMP PAID
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere
you look you see one.
ELLA
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that
people who die bad don't stay in the
ground.
Stamp can not deny this.
Denver is cleaning the kitchen, waiting for her mother. We
hear her thoughts:
DENVER (VO)
..I swallowed her blood right along with
my mother's milk. She played with me and
always came to be with me whenever I
needed her. Me and her waited for our
daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt
me. I love my mother but I know she
killed one of her own, and tender as she
is with me, I'm scared of her because of
it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing
that happened that made it all right to
kill her own, could happen again.
Whatever it is, it comes from outside
this house, outside the yard. So I never
leave this house and I watch over the
yard so it can't happen again ... I have
to keep it away from my sister...I'll
protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
BELOVED'S VO FADES IN OVER DENVER'S...
DENVER (VO)
BELOVED (VO)
Beloved..She's mine
I am Beloved
BELOVED (VO)
and she is mine...
The girls rush into the house, and down the hall.
Sethe enters. Then turns back to the door.
C.U. ; OF SETHE'S HAND LOCKING THE FRONT DOOR AS WE HEAR;
SETHE (VO)
I AM BELOVED AND SHE IS MINE..
DENVER (VO)
SHE IS MINE...
OVER THE FOLLOWING CHORUS OF DIALOGUE, A MONTAGE OF
IMAGES DEPICTING SETHE, BELOVED AND DENVER CLOSING UP
THE HOUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD - LOWERING SHADES,
LOCKING WINDOWS, BARRING DOORS.....
SETHE (VO)
TELL ME THE TRUTH..
BELOVED (VO)
CANNOT LOSE HER AGAIN.
SETHE (VO)
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
BELOVED (VO)
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
SETHE (VO)
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
BELOVED (VO)
YES.
SETHE (VO)
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
BELOVED (VO)
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
DENVER (VO)
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
SETHE (VO)
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
BELOVED (VO)
YOU HURT ME.
DENVER (VO)
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
SETHE (VO)
WILL YOU STAY?
BELOVED (VO)
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
SETHE (VO)
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
DENVER (VO)
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU
DREAMS.
BELOVED (VO)
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
DENVER (VO)
THE WHITEFOLK?
SETHE (VO)
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
DENVER (VO)
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
BELOVED (VO)
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
SETHE (VO)
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM.
THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST
THING.
Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house,
revealing the same neglect inside;
Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder...
Camera enters;
Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains
hanging askew...
Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall.
She wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body - which
seems withered, frailer since we last saw her...In her lap
lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing
when she fell asleep from fatigue.
A LOUD CRASH wakes her up. Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED
YELL. Her face registers fear. She realizes where she is,
what time it is...and begins organizing breakfast...
She places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cloth
and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper,
placing them in the sink...
She opens a pantry cupboard to reveal BARE SHELVES except for
a SINGLE EGG and a bowl of HOMINY GRAINS about 1/4 full. She
searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening
cabinets, doors - places that never stored food. She realizes
there is none left.
Denver finished dressing. She has been able to maintain a
semblance of order about her person and room..
But as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we see
the same disarray as downstairs...
She passes by Baby Sugg's old room and discovers;
BELOVED, sprawled across the bed, half naked. Her belly is
huge, her body unwashed. She looks, and behaves, like a wild
animal...
A broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg as
she shifted in bed. Her feet, overhanging the bed, are still
touching the bedside table where the lamp sat.
She is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Sugg's
old quilt.
DENVER
You shouldn't be in here?
Beloved jolts her head up to Denver. She doesn't like being
looked at unawares...
BELOVED
What do you know about it? I sleep where
I want.
DENVER
You best leave that quilt alone. That was
grandma's quilt.
Beloved looks at Denver, then at the quilt - then abruptly
tears the hole apart with one strong pull.
Triumphant, she gets out of bed and exits, passing Denver;
BELOVED
Breakfast ready? I'm hungry!
Sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it
on one plate which she sets on the table. She stands at the
stove, with her back to us, picking crusted pieces of food
off the bottom of the pan.
Beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and
begins to eat, shovelling the food into her mouth.
Denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs,
as she pretends to wash the dishes.
SETHE
Morning.
DENVER
Morning, ma'am.
Sethe turns, not realizing Denver was there as well. Their
eyes meet. Sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the
pan crumbs. She smiles;
SETHE
You hungry?
Knowing there must be nothing left, Denver answers;
DENVER
No, ma'am.
Sethe looks relieved.
DENVER
I'll finish those. Why don't you sit
down?
Denver crosses to the dishes, taking the pan from her mother.
Sethe nods and crosses to the table, to sit down.
But as she sinks into the chair, Beloved kicks it away;
BELOVED
You don't sit with me!!
SETHE
Baby, don't be like that.
BELOVED
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with
people who leave me!
SETHE
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves
you.
BELOVED
I had another dream last night.
(as she eats)
The dead man laying on top of me and I
had nothing to eat. And the ghosts
without skin stuck their fingers in me
and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in
the light..
SETHE
Don't say those things. You forget about
those dreams..
BELOVED
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me
behind...
SETHE
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life,
every minute, every hour of it to take
back one of your tears baby...My children
my best thing. You my best thing!
BELOVED
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't
smile at me..
SETHE
That's not true. I told you, I had to get
you out, make you safe...so's you and me
could be together on the other side,
forever..
DENVER
Ma'am...
No one pays attention to Denver.
BELOVED
LIAR!
Beloved flings her plate at Sethe, hitting her hard across
the eye..the plate breaking...
DENVER
MAMA!
SETHE
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go
on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
DENVER
But mama..
SETHE
Go upstairs I said!!
Sethe's harsh tone is only for Denver. Denver exits the
kitchen, afraid to leave them alone...
As she moves from the kitchen, she hears;
BELOVED (OS)
I want somethin' sweet.
SETHE (OS)
We don't have nothing sweet no more,
baby.
BELOVED (OS)
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me
eat the pies...
SETHE (OS)
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't
have no more pies..
Denver walks up the white stairs...
Denver has straightened up her grandmother's room. Cleaned
away the broken pieces of the lamp. Gathered the remnants of
the quilt..
She holds the quilt as she sits on the bed, facing the
headboard. SHE REMEMBERS:
MEMORY:
Baby Suggs, near death, lying in her bed, chuckles and
coughs;
BABY SUGGS
You mean I never told you about your
daddy? About the Bodwins who let me rent
this here house while I do my shoe
repairing? About your mother's feet, not
to mention her back? I never told you all
that?
A NINE YEAR OLD DENVER shakes her head.
BABY SUGGS
Is that why you can't walk down the steps
and out yonder by yourself?
Denver can't answer.
BABY SUGGS
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and
learn your letters? You liked going there
I remember. Seeing the other children.
Then all a sudden, you stop.
DENVER
There was a boy there...said mama was a
jailbird...said he could prove it..
Baby Suggs face registers the pain of her granddaughter, hurt
by hurtful words.
BABY SUGGS
My Jesus my...What people won't say. Why
didn't you come and ask me?
(Denver shrugs)
'Fraid I'll tell ya, huh?
(Denver looks at her)
Come here, child..
Denver crawls into her arms.
BABY SUGGS
You got to go sometime. You got to go out
there by yourself sometime.
DENVER
But you said...you said out there, there
ain't no...what was that word?..no..de-
fense. No de-fense.
BABY SUGGS
There ain't.
DENVER
Then what do I do?
BABY SUGGS
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
END OF MEMORY.
Denver has crawled up and snuggled against the pillow in the
same position as when she was nine in her grandma's arms.
Denver has changed into a clean, pretty dress and is
approaching the stairs when she passes Sethe's room. It's
door is open. She looks in..
Sethe stands with her back to the door, cleaned up, wearing
her best dress and the hat she last wore to the carnival.
Denver smiles, hopefully;
DENVER
Mama?
Sethe turns, startled, to reveal - it is BELOVED in Sethe's
best clothes...When Beloved sees Denver, she smiles
tauntingly and strikes a pose...
BELOVED
I look just like her.
Disgusted, Denver exits.
Denver walks down the stairs, entering the kitchen;
Sethe is on her knees, picking up pieces of broken plate. As
she moves the skin on her knees bleeds as it scrapes against
pieces too small to clean.
DENVER
Mama let me help you.
SETHE
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Sethe continues her work, without even looking at Denver.
Denver pauses a moment, realizing she is of no use here - but
knowing she needs to help her mother somehow.
She looks up to the kitchen, where every cupboard door is
open revealing empty shelves...SHE EXITS - HEADING FOR THE
FRONT DOOR.
C.U. - FRONT DOOR.
Denver's hands slowly reaches towards the door lock - and
OPENS IT.
Tea things sit on a table between them. Denver eats whatever
she can. Lady Jones watches with care and concern.
LADY JONES
How's your family, honey?
Denver swallows a bite of something with some tea, then;
DENVER
I want to work, Miss Lady.
LADY JONES
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
DENVER
No. I mean work work.
LADY JONES
Well, what can you do?
DENVER
I can't do anything but I would learn it
for you if you have a little extra.
LADY JONES
Extra?
DENVER
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I
couldn't stay away from her too long,
cause of her condition but I could do
chores in the mornings.
LADY JONES
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay
anybody anything for work they did
themselves...But if you all need to eat
until your mother's well, all you have to
do is say so...We have a church committee
invented so nobody had to go hungry.
DENVER
No..No that won't do...
Lady Jones can sense something far more serious is going on.
Denver brings four eggs, some rice and some tea onto the
kitchen table.
Sethe's eyes well up. She looks at Denver as if for the first
time. Her face an expression of gratitude. Suddenly;
BELOVED (OS)
RAAAIN!!! RAAAAIN!
Sethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see;
beloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat,
causing it to bleed...
SETHE
BABY!
Sethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room. Sethe
stumbles over a chair to get to Beloved, kneeling on the
floor, ripping at her own neck...
Denver gets her from behind and Sethe grabs her from the
front, pinning her down - trying to stop her from hurting
herself. Beloved screams and strikes out at Sethe, pulling
her hair, clawing at her as well...
Beloved eats ravenously from a bowl of white beans. Sethe
sits in the corner, as if waiting to serve her...
Denver is returning a bowl to Grace, a friendly woman.
GRACE
No, darling. That's not my bowl. Mine's
got a blue ring around it..Would you like
to come in a spell?
Beloved sleeps curled up on the kitchen floor after eating -
her mouth still dirty from the meal...
Sethe, unwashed, her hair uncombed, sits in her corner chair.
She is trying to mend a torn dress.
Denver eats a little from the latest neighborhood gift. She
hears her mother mumbling to herself like a madwoman.
SETHE
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's
going be doing that..nobody going be
writing my daughter's characteristics on
the animal side..no sir..I don't
care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I
refuse..that's right..that's right...
DENVER
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you
eat something.
SETHE
She likes this dress...
DENVER
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there.
Come sit at the table.
Sethe considers this. She rises cautiously, then sits at the
table. Denver rises and gets her some food, placing it before
her.
DENVER
Please mama, eat something...
Sethe nods...Denver is getting more and more frightened of
losing her mother completely...Instead of protecting Beloved
from Sethe, she must protect her mother from Beloved.
The house is filled with books and pearl white lamps and
glass cases filled with glistening things.
Denver pushes her feet into the soft blue carpet as she sits
with Janey.
JANEY
You know what? I've been here since I was
fourteen and I remember like yesterday
when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat
right where you are. Whiteman name of
Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin
were good friends. That's how she got
that house you all live in. Other things
too.
DENVER
Yes ma'am.
JANEY
I never went to those woodland services
but she was always nice to me. Always.
Never be another like her.
DENVER
I miss her.
JANEY
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was
a good woman...Well, I don't know whether
the Bodwins think it or not but they sure
could use some extra help.
DENVER
(hopeful)
Ya think?
JANEY
They getting older now and I can't take
care of 'em like I used to. More and more
they keep asking me to sleep over night.
Now, I don't want to quit these people
but they can't have all my days and
nights too. I got my own family needs me.
It'll take some convincing but maybe you
could come after supper - take care of
your mama during the day, then earn a
little something at night, how's that?
DENVER
Fine. But what would I do at night?
JANEY
Be here. In case.
DENVER
In case of what?
JANEY
In case the house burn down or bad
weather slops the roads so bad I can't
get here on time or late guests needed
cleaning up after. Anything.
(laughs)
Don't ask me what whitefolks need at
night.
During Janey's lines, Denver looks about the house imagining
herself here at night...her eyes happen upon A STATUE OF A
BLACK BOY on his knees, his head thrown back farther than a
head could go, his mouth wide open like a cup and filled with
money for delivery tips. On the pedestal are the words' AT YO
SERVICE;
DENVER
They good whitefolks?
JANEY
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't
good. I wouldn't trade them for another
pair, tell you that. But you come back in
a few days - give me a chance to lead'em
to it. All right?
Denver nods, beaming gratefully - so gratefully that no words
come, only tears... Janey reaches for Denver's hand and holds
it warmly;
JANEY
What is it, child? What's the trouble
with Sethe?
Denver looks at her and we know she needs to tell someone.
Ella has gathered all the women of the town for a meeting
including Lady Jones, Janey Wagon, M. Lucille Williams,
Grace;
GRACE
But is it really the daughter, Janey? The
killed one?
JANEY
That what she say.
M. LUCILLE
WILLIAMS
How they know it's her?
ELLA
It's sitting there. Sleeps, eats and
raises hell. Whipping Sethe every day.
GRACE
I'll be. A baby?
JANEY
No. Grown now. The age it would have been
had it lived.
GRACE
In the flesh. And whipping her.
M. LUCILLE
WILLIAMS
Guess she had it coming a little.
ELLA
Nobody got that coming.
M. LUCILLE
WILLIAMS
But Ella- you can't just up and kill your
children.
ELLA
No, and the children can't just up and
kill the mama. What's fair ain't
necessarily right...
(the women listen)
Now you all know how I felt about the
whole thing. I know the rage Sethe felt
in that shed that day.
We all do. But
what I could not understand, and still
don't, was her reaction to it. Prideful.
Too damn complicated for a black woman in
her position before God. But whatever she
done, I don't like the idea of past
errors taking possession of the present.
I don't cotton to sin moving in on a
house, unleashed and sassy. Every day
life takes enough, takes all a woman has.
"Sufficient unto the day is evil thereof"
and nobody needs more. Nobody needs a
grown up evil sitting at a table with a
grudge. As long as that ghost showed
itself from a ghostly place, I respected
it. But once it take on flesh and come
into this world, well, the shoe's on the
other foot now. I don't mind a little
communication between worlds. But this
here's an invasion.
The women agree.
GRACE
Should we pray?
ELLA
Uh-huh. First. Then we got to get down to
business.
Denver comes down the stairs, entering the kitchen.
Sethe, worn out, looking more beaten and ravaged than before,
stands at the sink with an ICE PICK chopping up ice. Denver
speaks to her, but she does not turn or acknowledge her.
DENVER
Mama?....Mama I'm going out..
(no response)
Mama, I got a job. Working over at the
Bodwins at night. Mr. Bodwin coming over
now to pick me up on his way back from
town. I'll be staying there nights and
coming back here for the daytime. We'll
have some money, mama..Mama?
Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized. Denver
approaches her from behind and whispers softly;
DENVER
I'm going help you, mama. Don't you give
up yet.
Denver touches her gently, but Sethe acts as if she hears and
feels nothing. Denver exits.
Sethe is rubbing a naked Beloved's forehead with a cool cloth
filled with ice, when the two women hear the singing.
Beloved rises first and moves to the window to see.
Paul enters the house and hears HUMMING. He walks towards the
keeping room, whose door is ajar;
Sethe lies in bed with the remnants of Baby Sugg's quilt over
her, as she hums her melody and looks out of the window.
PAUL
Sethe?
SETHE
(turns to him)
Paul D.
She looks like she's dying.
PAUL
Aw, Sethe.
He approaches her.
SETHE
You shaved.
PAUL
Yeah. Look bad?
SETHE
No, You looking good.
PAUL
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear
about you not getting out of bed?
(no response)
I saw Denver. She tell you?
SETHE
She comes in the daytime.
She still with
me, my Denver.
PAUL
(nervous)
You got to get up from here, girl.
SETHE
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest
a while.
PAUL
(getting upset, shouts)
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs
quilt. Is that what you planning!?
SETHE
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at
all.
PAUL
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be
here in the night. I'm a take care of
you, you hear? Starting now.
Sethe looks at him - a long look - and sees in him that
thing, that blessedness, "that makes him the kind of man who
can walk into a house and make women cry, make women tell him
things they could only tell each other".
PAUL
What, baby?
SETHE
(cries)
She left me. She's gone again.
PAUL
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got
more yesterday than anybody. We need some
kind of tomorrow...
SETHE
She was my best thing.
Paul leans down and takes her hand, entwining his fingers
into hers...
PAUL
You your best thing, Sethe. You are.
Sethe smiles, with tears in her eyes, looking almost
surprised;
SETHE
Me?...Me?
