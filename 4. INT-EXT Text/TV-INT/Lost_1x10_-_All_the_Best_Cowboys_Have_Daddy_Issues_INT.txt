      Well where is he?

                                                  -- Anybody seen Ethan?

      AS THE CAMERA SPINS, PEOPLE COMING TO CHECK THE COMMOTION, 
      WORD OF SAYID S RETURN - MURMURING - JACK, LOUDER NOW, HIS 
      SENSE OF SOMETHING FUCKING TERRIBLE GROWING --

                                  JACK
                    Has anyone seen Ethan?

      CAMERA finds MICHAEL --

                    Yeah... said he was gonna get wood - 
                    took off on the path to the beach.
                          (re: Sayid)
                    Is he okay, man?  What happened --?

      But Jack s mind is going a THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR, LOOKING 
      AROUND -- suddenly realizing --

                        JACKKATE
      Where s Charlie?
                                                  -- What?

                                  JACK
                    Where s Charlie?

      And on that, the CAMERA ABRUPTLY STOPS.  A moment.  Another 
      moment.  And then, finally we find someone we haven t yet 
      heard from --

                                  LOCKE
                    He went after Claire.

      And as the implications of this hit Jack full force, we PUSH 
      IN ON HIM and --

      ECU on Jack, mouth and nose covered by a surgical mask, eyes 
      narrowed into slits as he wages war on a mounting crisis.

                                  JACK
                    - come on - come on!

      WIDEN TO REVEAL a harsh CONTRAST TO THE LUSH JUNGLE -- the 
      COLD ANTISEPTIC WHITENESS of an OPERATING ROOM.

      And we re IN THE SHIT here, folks.  CAMERA once again ON THE 
      MOVE as we find Jack surrounded by several SURGICAL NURSES 
      and an ANESTHESIOLOGIST gathered around the OPERATING TABLE 
      as Jack works an incision in the PATIENT s abdomen -

                                                  almost there -

    - BLEEEEEEP!  That sound.  Instantly recognizable as a heart 
      monitor s way of saying the Grim Reaper s come a-knockin .

      Over the WHIRR of defibrillator paddles CHARGING UP, a Nurse 
      (ANDREA) performs CPR as Jack redoubles his efforts - *

    - and takes his hands out of the incision, grabbing the 
      paddles without missing a beat -

                                  JACK
                    CLEAR!

    - and pushing them into the patient s chest - KA-THWUM!  The 
      Patient JERKS UPWARDS as...

        BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE -- Monitor still flat-lining, Jack s 
      head whipping back to his patient --

                                    ANDREA*
                    We re charged -

                    Clear!

      KA-THWUM!  BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE...

      Jack passes off the paddles.  Instantly begins to administer 
      CPR himself...

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    - C mon -- C mon back --

      More COMPRESSIONS.  Andrea administering OXYGEN from a  *
      SQUEEZE MASK --

                    C mon... Let s go... C mon back...

      And that s when we hear an AUTHORITATIVE VOICE -- we ve been  *
      on this action so TIGHT, we neglected to register the MAN  *
      standing just five feet behind the table, out of the fray -- *

                                  MAN*
                    Call it.

      Jack doesn t stop.  Keeps PRESSING --

                                  MAN (CONT D)*
                    Call it.

      Jack ignores the voice --

                                  MAN (CONT D)*
                    Jack.

      Jack finally turns to face the man -- *

      (CONT'D) (2)55


      -- and as the man lowers his mask, for those of us who can  *
      remember back to Episode Three, we instantly recognize 
      SHEPHARD.  Jack s father.

      [For those of us who DON T remember, we ll restate their 
        relationship soon enough.]

                                  SHEPHARD
                    It s over.  Call it.

      And Jack just LOOKS at his father.  A BEAT.  ANOTHER beat.  
      And finally --

      Jack slowly removes his hands from the patient s chest.

      Reaches over to the MONITOR.  FLICKS A SWITCH.  The 
        BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE abruptly CUTS OFF.

      Jack exchanges a look with Andrea.  Her eyes drop.*

      And now, he pulls off his OWN MASK.  Turns back to his 
      father, eyes burning intensely --

                                  JACK
                    You call it.

    A stand-off.  A battle of wills.  SO FUCKING MUCH GOING ON 
      HERE -- and we ll spend the rest of the episode exploring it.  
      But for now, Shephard holds his son s gaze.  And without 
      batting an eyelash --

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Time of death is 3:23 PM.
                          (beat)
                    Per the Chief of Surgery.

      Jack turns from his father to look at this Patient -- His 
      eyes locked in as he PULLS OFF HIS BLOODY GLOVES - and as we 
      STAY TIGHT ON HIM --

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


    - abuzz with activity - anxiety abounds, and all of the 
      movement in the valley (including the brief, clipped pace of 
      the following scenes) indicates growing unease.

      KATE enters in mid-argument with Locke -

                                  KATE
                    You just let him go?  Alone?

                                  LOCKE
                    Couldn t stop him.  Don t worry -- 
                    I ll catch up.

                                  KATE*
                    Nothing.  Nobody s seen them.*

      Locke nods.  Of course they haven t.  Then --*

                                  KATE (CONT D)*
                    I m coming with you.

                                  LOCKE
                    Figured you might.

      LOCKE reaches his little area, PULLS OPEN his SUITCASE -- 
      loaded with KNIVES.  Selects the biggest and SHARPEST as we 
      pick up --

                                    SHANNON (O.S.)
                    - What are you doing?  We need to

                    I heard you re forming a search  *
                    party.  Can I help?

      Locke and Kate look up to see BOONE, SHANNON on his heels --

                                    SHANNON
                    Search party?  This is a deserted *

                    No choppers, no Amber alert - how 
                    exactly are you going to find them?

      Locke takes one look at the put-upon expression on Boone s 
      face and shuts Shannon down -

                                  LOCKE
                    By following Ethan s trail -
                          (off Shannon s look)
                    - no one can walk through 
                    wilderness without leaving signs -- 
                    bending blades of grass, breaking 
                    twigs -- especially with captives 
                    in tow.

      Locke extends a KNIFE to Boone --

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    And yes, I could use another hand 
                    if you re up for it.

      Boone takes the knife, grateful for the validation.

                                  BOONE
                    I m up for it.

      And Locke REGARDS BOONE -- as if for the first time.  Really  *
      take this kid in.  Odd.  Finally:*

                                  LOCKE
                    Then let s get moving.

      Locke and Kate step past Shannon toward the cave exit - Boone 
      follows, gives his sister a look as he PASSES.

      And off her DISBELIEF of having been completely FROZEN OUT --


    - the equally troubled look on Jack s face as he looks down 
      at the dead woman on the operating table.  This is the quiet 
      after the storm.

      The nurses and assistants file out.  Jack places a sheet over 
      the patient and turns to look at his father and realizes that 
      the storm is about to begin.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Never thought I d see the day.

      Jack says nothing.  The Old Man approaches - his anger *
      building.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    You barge into my OR to work on my 
                    patient?

      Jack s tone is somber - reserved - there is something between 
      him and his father he does not want to articulate -

                                  JACK
                    You didn t have to do the 
                    procedure...

                                  SHEPHARD
                    I don t have to do anything.

                                  JACK

                    -- Yeah.  Of course you don t.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    I chose to do this procedure -- 
                    this emergency procedure -- because 
                    when that girl crashed in the E.R., *
                    they called me.

                                  JACK
                    I was upstairs -

                                  SHEPHARD
                    And you should have stayed there - 
                    How did you even know about...

                                  JACK
                    One of the nurses came to get me.

      This effectively freezes Shephard for a moment.  Then --

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Who?

      Jack won t take the bait and put another person in dad s 
        cross-hairs.  Keeps his mouth shut.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Well.  Thank God I have you and

                    She told me your hands were

                    She was in a car crash - her 
                    insides were a mess -

      But these two aren t even talking anymore - this thing

                    How many drinks did you have at

      It just hangs there - OUT LOUD AT LAST... in the shadow of 
      the death of a patient, there is little else to add.

      An interminable moment passes between father and son - the  *

      Hurley watches as Michael fills water bottles and puts them 
      in a backpack.  Another five CASTAWAYS work nearby -

                                    MICHAEL
                    - I m trying to help and all the 
                    guy can tell me is to  go south.   
                    Like what, I m gonna get in his way 
                    or something?

                                  HURLEY
                    Look, man, everyone s tweaked - 
                    Locke s feelin  it just like the 
                    rest of us -

      Michael stands and indicates the other five Castaways -

                                    MICHAEL
                    So what?  I got five other guys who 
                    are going out there with me, 
                    putting our necks on the line to 
                    find Charlie and Claire.
                          (beat)
                    All I m saying is I m getting sick 
                    of being treated like a second-
                    class citizen around here just 
                    because Mount Baldy knows how to 
                    bag a boar.

      Hurley shrugs back his dissent, realizing that Michael needs 
      to vent - but a third voice comes to Locke s defense -

                                  WALT
                    He knows a lot more than how to get 
                    a boar.
                          (off the looks)
                    Mr. Locke s a warrior.  He knows 
                    how to hunt and track and stuff - 
                    and he s the only one who brought 
                    knives.  If he told me to stay out 
                    of his way...

    - but Walt realizes that his dad is glaring at him.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                          (timidly)
                    ...I d listen to him.

                                  MICHAEL*
                          (beat, then)*
                    Well I don t want you to.  *
                      Y understand?*

    A beat.  Walt nods.  Then:*

                                  MICHAEL (CONT D)*
                    You stay with Hurley.  I might not *
                    be a warrior.  But I m going south.*
                          (to the group)*
                    Let s go.*

      Michael walks off with the others.  Walt watches him go,  *
      feeling as guilty as he does righteous.  He looks up at  *
      Hurley.*

                                  HURLEY*
                    Back home?  I m known as something *
                    of a warrior myself.*

      Walt just stares -- is this guy fucking with him?  A beat.   *
      Then Hurley smiles.  Walt reluctantly smiles too --*


      We find Hurley and Walt playing BACKGAMMON.  Hurley ROLLS the  *
      dice -- looks at the results -- FRUSTRATED --*

                                  HURLEY
                    Crap!


                        WALTHURLEY
      You blots can t get it.
                                                  -- Yeah, I know my blots 
                                                  can t get in.

                                  WALT
                    My roll.

                                  HURLEY
                    Yahoo.

                                  WALT
                    Okay, I need a four-three...

      Walt concentrates, blows on the dice, SHAKES THEM, in his 
      cupped hands -- for the longest time.  Hurley rolls his eyes.

                                  HURLEY
                    Dude, would you please roll?

      Finally Walt rolls.  The dice tumble and Hurley watches,  *
        incredulous, as Walt gets a four-three, HITS another of his  *
      pieces, puts it on the bar --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)*
                    No!!

                                  WALT
                    Your turn.

      Hurley rolls again.  DAMN.  And again, he must cede the dice 
      to Walt.  Hurley can barely contain himself.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    It s okay.  I wasn t very good when 
                    I first started playing either.

                                  HURLEY
                    I didn t just start playing.  I 
                    finished 17th at a tournament once!

                                  WALT
                    17th s not very good.

                                  HURLEY
                    No, 17th is very good.

                                  WALT
                    If you say so.
                          (does his rolling shtick)
                    C mon, double sixes...

      Walt rolls.  And... DOUBLE SIXES!

                                  HURLEY
                    You gotta be kidding me.

                                  WALT
                          (shrugs)
                    I m lucky.

      Walt wins.*

                                  HURLEY
                    No one is that lucky.

                                  WALT
                    My Dad said I was the luckiest *
                    person he knew.*

                                  HURLEY

      Hurley gives him a surprised look -- other Dad...?*

                                  WALT (CONT D)*
                    It s kind of a long story.*

      Which Walt doesn t want to go into.*

      Walt picks his pieces off the board (this is what you do in  *
      the endgame of Backgammon) --

                    C mon, one more game -- double or 
                    nothing again.

      Hurley just shakes his head.  Gets up.

                                  HURLEY
                    I got a meeting.

                                  WALT
                    A meeting?

      OFF Walt, left alone -- and he s bored.

                    Okay - who got taken by what? *

      Sawyer puts BOTTLES OF WATER into his backpack, while 
      listening incredulously as Walt catches him up on current 
      events -

                                  WALT
                    Charlie and Claire... they think 
                    Ethan took them.

                                  SAWYER
                    Ethan took them.

                                  WALT
                    Yeah.

                                  SAWYER
                    Took them why?

                    And who the hell is Ethan?

                                  WALT
                    Dunno -- but he wasn t on that list 
                    thing.  The manifest.  People are 
                    saying they don t remember him from 
                    the plane.

                                  SAWYER
                    You ever think he might ve lied 
                    about his name?

      And we can t help but notice the following give and take 
      either makes Sawyer more childlike or Walt more adult.  Pick 
      one. 

                                  WALT
                    Why would he lie?

                                  WALT
                    There could be lots of other people 
                    on the island.

                                  SAWYER
                    So a tribe of evil natives planted *
                    a ringer in the camp to kidnap a

                    And why am I getting the evening 
                    news from a six year old?

      Walt shoots Sawyer an annoyed glare:

                                  WALT
                    I m ten.

                                  SAWYER
                    Okay, then it must be true.*

      Walt shakes his head.  Enough of this guy.  As he walks off --

                                  WALT
                    If you don t believe me, go ask 
                    Sayid.  He said we re not alone.

      And this news knocks the snark right out of Sawyer.

                                  SAWYER
                    ... Sayid s back?*

      And as we sit on SAWYER, absorbing this as Walt walks off -- *


      Shephard sits at his desk paging through a surgical incident 
      report, doesn t bother to look up as Jack enters.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Thanks for coming, Jack.  Sit down.

      Jack doesn t.  Shephard pushes the report across the desk.

                                  JACK
                    What s it say?

                                  SHEPHARD
                    The truth...

      Jack looks at his father, who stands to meet his gaze:

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    ... That a patient was brought to 
                    the ER following a car accident, 
                    rushed into surgery with massive 
                    internal bleeding.  You joined me -- 
                    and in spite of our most heroic 
                    efforts -- the patient succumbed to 
                    her injuries.

      Jack picks up the file, then, with a bitter edge:

                                  JACK
                    Looks like you fixed everything but 
                    the patient.

      Jack expects Shephard to blow, and is ready for the fight.  
      But Shephard doesn t.  He let s Jack s statement hang there.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    You had no business being in that

                    You really think I d have walked in

                    You ve done it before.

      Shepard doesn t deny this.  Almost a sense of pride about it:  *
      he s a great surgeon and he knows it - almost too well. *

                                  SHEPHARD*
                    That s right.  I have - and I m *

                                  SHEPHARD
                    You were part of the team.  I m not 
                    the only one on the hook for this.
                          (beat)
                    You called me off!  You were the 
                    surgeon of record when she died!

      Jack doesn t reply.  He s willing to let the chips fall where 
      they may and Shephard knows it.

      Shepard softens his tone and approach.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Accidents happen in surgeries all 
                    the time, Jack.  You know that.  
                    That s the truth.  But if you 
                      contradict this report -- mention 
                    alcohol -- well, that s the only 
                    fact that will matter.  They ll 
                    strip me of my license.

                                  JACK
                    Yes, they will.

      Jack looks up at his father.  And he s surprised because 
      instead of anger he sees something he s never seen in his 
      father s face before --

      His features have gone soft.  Into fear, vulnerability.  
      Shephard RUBS the bridge of his nose, shakes his head 
      despondently.  Let s face it, it freaks Jack out.*

                                  SHEPHARD
                    I know I ve been hard on you.

      Possibly the greatest understatement of all time.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    But that s how you make metal into 
                    steel.
                          (beat)
                    And that s why you re the most *

      Jesus Christ!  Did Jack just hear that right?

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    This is a career that s all about 
                    the greater good.  I ve had to 
                    sacrifice certain aspects of my 
                    relationship with you, so that

                    thousands of patients will live, 
                    will thrive, because of your 
                      extraordinary skills.

      And, oh my God, tears are welling in Shephard s eyes.  This  *
      cracks Jack s own visage of determination, hits him in an 
      emotional place he s unprepared for.  He s getting what he s 
      always wanted when he very least expected it.

      Shephard steps up, puts his hand on Jack s shoulder.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Long time coming.  I know.

      Shephard picks up the file, arranges the papers neatly 
      inside, to cover his own emotions.  Then he turns to Jack 
      with complete sincerity:

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    What happened today... I promise 
                    you -- it ll never happen again.

      Shephard holds out a pen.  What he says next -- it goes so 
      much to Shephard s emotional core he can barely get it out 
      above a whisper --

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    What I ve given... This isn t just 
                    my career, Jack.  This is my life.

      The pen hovers there in Shephard s hand.  An interminable 
      beat.  And then Jack reaches out.  And takes it.

      Jack makes the toughest choice of his life.  He signs the 
      false surgery report.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Thank you, Son.

      And OFF JACK, already torn by what he s just done... *

      ECU on Sayid s opening eye - WIDER to reveal him shooting to 
    a sitting position from a pile of blankets on the cave floor.

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    I don t know if you  Islams  have a 
                    concept of karma -

      Sayid sees Sawyer, squatting a few meters away.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    - but I get the sense this island 
                    served you up a heaping platter of 
                    cosmic payback.

      Sayid backs himself up against the cave wall, facing Sawyer.

                                  SAYID
                    What do you want?

                                  SAWYER
                    Doctor do-right don t trust me with 
                    his antibiotics, so I have to hump 
                    here every day to get my meds.
                          (then)
                    Apropos of nothing... a less 
                      magnanimous man than I might just 
                    be thinking he could beat the ever-
                    loving snot out of you without fear 
                    of reprisal.

                                  SAYID
                    You want a shot, take it... but 
                    know that I left this camp out of 
                    shame for what I did to you.  It 
                    was never my intention to return.

                                  SAWYER
                    You cut me up, put bamboo under my 
                    nails... Sorry, I m fresh out of 
                    sweet forgiveness.
                          (leaning in)
                    So if it wasn t your intention to 
                    return, why did you?

      Sayid considers.  Then --

                                  SAYID
                    I was taken prisoner by the French 
                    woman.

                    The one that s been sending out the *

                          (long skeptical beat)
                    ... she s alive?

                                  SAYID
                    She was on a science expedition... 
                    She said they shipwrecked.

                      SAWYERSAYID
      How?  Where?
                                                  -- She didn t say.

                                  SAWYER
                    She alone?

                                  SAYID
                    She said that there were others on 
                    the island.

                                  SAWYER
                          (beat, -- what?!)
                    Her people?

                                  SAYID
                    No.
                          (beat -- this is hard)
                    She murdered her entire team.
                          (then)
                    She believed they were... sick.

      Okay, this freaks Sawyer out.  He tries to cover, stay cool.

                      SAWYERSAYID
      Right.  And these  others?   I don t know.
      Who the hell are --(beat)
                                                  She s never seen them.

                                  SAWYER
                    Never seen them.  But she knows 
                    they re there.

                                  SAYID*

      Sayid looks at him.  Doesn t want to share this information.

                    something in the jungle.  
                      Surrounding me.









































                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST      "All the Best..."       (BLUE)        10/13/04      34.

                                  SAWYER
                    Something like what?*

      Sayid tilts his head back -- frustrated.  He shouldn t have 
      opened up to him after all:

                                  SAYID
                    Do you have something to say to me, 
                    Sawyer?  Or are you going to 
                    continue to ask me questions you 
                    know I don t have the answers to?

      ON SAWYER.  Busted.  But doesn t want to let Sayid know it...

      So he just shakes his head.  Gets up.  Turns to go --

                                  SAWYER
                    By the way, the tides are comin  up 
                    the beach.  Plane hull s almost in 
                    the water...
                          (the point)
                    I kept your signal fire burning.

      Sawyer goes.  Sayid watches him.  Was that an olive branch?  
      Maybe these two have made a very tentative connection.


      Jack s face is blurred - as if the lens has been doused -  *
      until a squee-gee crosses the frame to reveal that Jack is  *
      standing in front of a pair of glass doors at the entrance to  *
      the corridor --*

      -- he is wearing scrubs and a labcoat and reading a chart,  *
      waiting for the JANITOR cleaning the door to step aside so he  *
      can move into the corridor.*

      We get the sense it s LATE.  Not the heavy bustle of peak 
      hours.  Jack steps past the janitor and SEES --*

      AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY --

      SHEPHARD.  And he s talking to a VERY SAD LOOKING MAN in his 
      thirties.  Both unaware of Jack.

      And Jack is very interested in this conversation -- Jack 
      standing there, watching his father.

      And whatever they re talking about, Shephard s conversation 
      with the man is intense and COMPASSIONATE --

      And just then, ANDREA (we may recognize her as one of the  *
      nurses from the OR earlier) emerges through the DOORS right 
      next to Jack --

                                    ANDREA*
                    Dr. Shephard.

                                  JACK
                    Andrea -- do you know who that man *
                    is?  That my father s talking to?

      Andrea looks down the hallway.  Turns back to Jack, SOMBER. *

                                    ANDREA*
                    That s her husband.

      And Jack knows exactly to whom Andrea is referring.  And  *
      maybe she s actually a little ACCUSATORY when she says --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST      "All the Best..."       (BLUE)        10/13/04      37A.

                    He s threatening to sue.

      And with that, she walks OFF.

      BACK ON JACK as he continues to watch the conversation.

      DOWN THE HALLWAY

      The MAN breaks into a WRACKING SOB.  And although this is 
      Jack s POV, we make sure we get all this because --

      Shephard RUBS the bridge of his nose, shakes his head 
      despondently.  And gently places his hand on the man s 
      shoulder.

      And Jack doesn t even need to hear the words to know --

      He has just watched his father  handle  another person s 
      emotional crisis in the exact way he handled his own son.

      THE CRASH OF THUNDER BRINGS US BACK TO --


      The INSANITY of the jungle is replaced by the quiet austerity 
      of a HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM as we find ---

      JACK.  Calmly sitting at the POLISHED TABLE as his father 
      commands the room, addressing a group of FIVE OTHER DOCTORS --

                                  SHEPHARD
                    - of course, every effort was made 
                    to resuscitate the patient - but 
                    the severity of her injuries and 
                    the amount of internal bleeding 
                    made it impossible.

      Shephard looks at the members of the board, clear, decisive.  
      Shit -- We saw what happened and we believe him.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "All the Best..."   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)    10/12/04   43.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    In my professional opinion -- and 
                    that s all I ve got, gentlemen...
                          (somber, yet responsible)
                    By the time I was called in, the 
                    damage was irreversible.

      On Jack.  STOIC.  Can t bring himself to look at his dad...

      The Board members make their final notes, exchange glances.  
      Finally, the HEAD DOCTOR speaks up -

                                  HEAD DOCTOR
                    Thanks, Christian.  Sorry about the 
                      formality.

                                  SHEPHARD
                          (shakes his head)
                    Of course.

      Jack keeps his expression neutral - knowing that he just has *
      to stay still until this is over and then he can wash his 
      hands of the entire affair.

      And that s when --

                                  HEAD DOCTOR
                    Just one final detail - you were 
                    aware of the patient s pregnancy 
                    when you went into the procedure?

    - pregnancy?  Jack looks at his father, who doesn t react - 
      but as Shephard gives a lucid, convincing response, the look 
      on Jack s face indicates his distress at this revelation -

                                  SHEPHARD
                      Absolutely.  The patient s husband 
                    informed the attending at the ER.  
                    It was, however, extremely early in 
                    the pregnancy and out primary focus 
                    had to be on the mother.

      And while the Board buys the line - we settle on JACK...

      Because he DIDN T know that.

      And Jack now realizes it wasn t just a woman s life that was 
      destroyed.  The truth is inescapable: a family s entire 
      future died that day -- and his eyes swell with tears as it  *
      becomes clear why Jack has been hell bent on saving Claire:  *
      another pregnant woman under his charge.

                                  HEAD DOCTOR
                    Okay, then.  I think we re done and 
                    the final report will be filed --

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    I need to revise my statement.

      And that s when everyone turns to --

      JACK.  And now -- as he speaks -- he IS looking at his 
      father.  RIGHT at him.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    I didn t come into the OR until 
                    well into the procedure.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Jack.

                                  JACK
                          (ignores him)
                    I was warned by one of the nurses 
                    that my father was operating under 
                    the influence -

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Jack.  This is not--

                                  JACK
                          (louder now)
                    By the time I got there it was 
                    clear that my father was not only 
                      incapacitated, but that he severed 
                    the patient s hepatic artery, which 
                    in my professional opinion, caused 
                    the crisis that led to her death.

      And there it is.  Let it sit.  Let it sink in.

      And as we realize what the implications of this are going to 
      be -- that the career of Christian Shephard, M.D. has 
      officially just ended -

      And so has Jack s relationship with his father.

      MICHAEL

      -- enters with his search party.  Walt races up to his dad - 
      and then stops --

      -- because the look on Michael s face is grim: a father who 
      knows he is about to disappoint his son.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We didn t find them, Walt.

                          (hard for him to say this)
                    Glad you re okay.

      Michael reaches forward and takes Walt by the shoulder, 
      drawing him into an embrace.  Then, after a moment --

                                    MICHAEL
                    We the only ones back?
