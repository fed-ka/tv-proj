Hi Barb.

Some things I have to
do.
Things I couldn't do while you were here.
Maybe you would have
approved.
Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything
and I can't seem to get their attention.
But now they'll learn how it
feels on the other side.
Let's hope it elevates their thinking.

JADE
So
how long have you been out?
MASON
A while.
JADE
A while.
And you didn't call?
You are free now, right?
MASON
I'm here with you, aren't I?
JADE
Why now?
I mean why today.
MASON
I was driving through San Francisco.
I decided it was time.
JADE
Well there's not a lot I know about you other than you escaped from
San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and I'm the result.
You can imagine I'm pretty confused.
MASON
I tried to explain in my letters.
JADE
Ahh.
Your letters.
They weren't very easy to follow.
She fishes in her pocket.
Pulls out A LETTER.

What I
need to know is: do you want me in your life?
JADE
How can I answer that?
I don't know if we can.... after 19 years,
just start like that.
MASON
We are the same blood.
JADE
But I don't know you.
MASON
where to begin.
(sighs)
My name is John Paul Mason.
I'm Scottish.
I attended Dartmouth Naval College.
My favorite color is green.
I
like books.
I like a good joke.
At one time I shot a pretty fair round
of golf.
I'm in my 60's and I've been in jail half my life.
(Jade looks away)
Maybe it's better I go.
She smiles.
Puts her hands on his.
JADE

GOODSPEED
(tight)
You almost got me killed.
Twice.
MASON

GOODSPEED wheels on MASON and swings.
SNATCH.
MASON

Three inches from his face.
GOODSPEED
It hurts.
