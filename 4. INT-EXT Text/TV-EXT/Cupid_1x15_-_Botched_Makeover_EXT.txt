  GUNSHOTS.  Then tight on a wounded western-dressed, though 
    thoroughly modern, sexy and masculine police detective, 
  SUNSET.  He pants as BULLETS RIDDLE the side of the building 
  around him.

                              CHAMP (O.S.)
                Brother, you are in some serious jelly 
                this time.

  Sunset turns.  His expression registers shock, then fear.

                                SUNSET
                Cohen?

  CHAMP emerges from a cloud of black smoke, an apparition on 
  the mean streets of Chicago, immune to the flying bullets.

                              CHAMP (COHEN)
                Prior to my untimely demise, your hands 
                didn t shake.

                                SUNSET (cont d)
                      (w/genuine Don Johnson angst)
                Cohen?  But you re dead.  Your wife got 
                the folded flag,  cuz I didn t cover your 
                back. 

                              CHAMP (COHEN)
                I m wearing the chalk outline  cuz some 
                skell carved out my heart.  No blemish on 
                your conscience.

                                SUNSET
                      (hopefully)
                On the line?

  The fog machine kicks into overdrive and rookie detective 
  Cohen begins to fade into the urban landscape.

                              CHAMP (COHEN)
                I m tellin  it straight.  Just get that 
                junkie who ended me.  Make  em pay, 
                Sunset.  Make  em pay!

  Sunset, now determined, grits his teeth, counts to three to 
  himself, then darts from behind the cover of the building, 
  firing away like Butch or Sundance.

  PULL BACK TO REVEAL a working film set.  A crew is busy

                That s Champ TerROSS  last shot in the 
                movie.  Let s break for lunch.

  Cast and crew give Champ sporadic applause and begin heading 
  for the catering truck.  REVEAL a bored Trevor watching the 
  scene.  Champ approaches.

                Hey, I ve got the afternoon free.  Let s

  Trevor takes Champ by the shoulders, looks deep in his eyes 
  and feigns sincerity.

                                TREVOR
                Your lack of faith disheartens me.

                                TREVOR
                Look on the bright side, everyone has 
                roommate problems -- playing the stereo 
                too loud, using up all the hot water -- 
                at least your roommate problems are

  Trevor follows Champ into the offices.


  Members of the group spill out.

  PULL BACK to REVEAL Tom, his pal, flask-chugging MATT and two 
  other cronies.  Unseen, they watch the group members exit.

  As Tom and Matt stroll across, Matt whips out his flask.

                Not much time left.

                              TOM
                More than enough.  In fact, just to make 
                it interesting, I ll play it right down

                              MATT
                Why?

                              TOM
                Because I m an artist, my friend.

  Matt gives him a look that says,  no, it s because you re a 
  twisted fuck, but I like that about you. 


  Tom and Kristy get their food and duck inside...


  Tom and Matt loiter.  Tom s reading Kristy s  Atlantic 
  Monthly  article while Matt girl-watches.

                              MATT
                What are you reading?

  Tom doesn t respond.  Matt reconsiders the question.

                              MATT (cont d)
                Why are you reading?

                              TOM

                  internet.

                Gotta admire a man who ll go to any 
                lengths to win a bet.

  Tom goes back to the article.

  CLOSE - THE ARTICLE

  WE SEE a photo of Kristy in frumpy mode and a headline that
