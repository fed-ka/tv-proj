It's finally happened.
Hell's frozen over.
Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.
Peace has
been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.
Salvation
Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.
And now, as
night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
"JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
Christmas."
The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.
At a souvenir
store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
year old.
Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
chains, ceramic figurines.
The kid is already wearing a
Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
wants more.
Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading "AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
BATWING -- $19.95 and up."
A PANHANDLER is perched at the
entrance.
Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.
In Gotham this
winter, Batmania is everywhere...
Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
blizzard.
The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
all but empty of cars.
A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...
...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
bundled up in mufflers and parkas.
Unbothered by the weather,
they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
the few passersby.
They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of "Silent
Night" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.
Its sides
are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
of year.
A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
as it rounds a corner.
The CAROLERS carol.
Then --
-- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.
Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.
The windows
have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.
Gut-shot
SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.
CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.
The POLAR
BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...
The REAR DOORS open.
A RAMP slides down from the back of the
truck.
The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.
SIRENS HOWL.
A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
into a drift.
MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.
The COP CARS skid
to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.
By now, of
course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.
SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.
A couple
of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
avoid getting run over.
Every time they poke their heads out,
another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.
The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.
These guys are
obviously going to get away clean -- unless...
The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...
BRAKES SQUEAL.
Several squad cars are now massed at the
entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.
The city's
snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading "CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."
A
huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
snowmobiles vanish into the trees.
The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
a plan.
A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
of the park.
Another is at his car, barking into a radio
mike:
COP WITH MIKE
Yeah, you heard me.
Snowmobiles!
(pause)
So what do we do?
Chase 'em on foot??
ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.
The COPS peer down the
long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
stopping...
THE BATMOBILE!!
COPS dive left and right.
A split-second
later...
...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
ice and snow on the paths before it into water!
The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.
The COPS
get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.
One of
them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:
COP I
...That was Batman.
COP II
NO SHIT!!
COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
follow suit.
ENGINES REV.
As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
a path, they might as well join in the chase...
TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
speeding SKIDOOS.
Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
horizon...
...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.
Thrilled beyond words, they
WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.
The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.
The lead car LOSES
CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.
The DRIVER jams the
pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
ice.
He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
COPS race past him on foot.
We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.
They
look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
disappear over a crest of a hill...
They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
of a frozen-over LAKE.
With the roar of the Batmobile behind
them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
of the lake.
Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.
The car's weight tips
suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.
The
prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --
-- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.
The left
front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
sliding forward.
-- and the trunk pops open.
An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.
The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.
They're almost
halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...
Fireworks?
No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
-- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
know what's hit them.
ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING
The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
not with toys, but precious stones.
He approaches the edge of
the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
outcroppings.
He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
clearing...
...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
behind him.
The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
to build up speed.
As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
flamethrower.
But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
the Batmobile rises half a foot --
-- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.
A heavy NET is
strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
tracks.
Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
Batmobile barrels down.
When the great black machine is
almost atop him --
-- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
frame.
The COPS are spread out near the entrance.
They've rounded up
the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.
They hear a
dull ROAR in the distance...
...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.
At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
vanishes whence it came.
A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
colleague and SHRUGS:
COP I
...Merry Christmas.
The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.
COP II
Gift-wrapped and everything.
DISSOLVE TO:
TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
with a sizable crowd watching from the street.
COMMISSIONER
GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.
GORDON
After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
in precious jewels were recovered intact
by the police force -- working in concert
with Batman.
At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
crowd:
VOICES IN CROWD
TAKE BACK THE STREETS!
TAKE BACK THE
STREETS!
TAKE BACK THE --
GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.
The CHANTERS are a group
of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.
They're
obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
saw in the park.
GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
over the din.
GORDON
I would like to stress -- that while this
city enjoys a special relationship with
Batman --
(louder)
-- we do not condone vigilantism --
(practically screaming)
-- IN ANY FORM.
It's no use.
He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
continue to shout and shake their fists.
Giving up, he
returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
huff.
The RED BERETS CHEER.
CUT TO:
INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
Square.
A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
RED BERET as "MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
BAT."
SEKOWSKY
And hey!
Where does this --
(BLEEP; expletive deleted)
-- Gordon get off calling us ?
We're not breakin' any laws.
We're a
group of concerned citizens, that's all --
just like Batman.
WOMAN IN CROWD
You people are nothing but hoodlums!
SEKOWSKY
Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
like you.
(into mike)
If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --
MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.
The picture jumps suddenly as a
minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
breaking out.
Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
screen, placing us in:
It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE
PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally
attired in cutaway and pin-stripes.
He pauses to inhale a
deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of
exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading
his wings, REVELING in the cold.
A STRETCH LIMO pulls up.
Two identically gaunt and vulture-
like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and
umbrellas, step out to meet him.
These two gentlemen -- FRICK
and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and
"business managers."
FRICK
Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.
PENGUIN
Mr. Frick.
Mr. Frack.
Our years of
planning are about to pay off.
T-BONE on work detail.
He's got the Walkman on and he's
shoveling snow to the beat.
He winces, and removes the
headphones...
The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie,
high-pitched WHINE.
He's twisting the knob, trying to find
the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT
AT HIS HEAD.
T-BONE
HEY -- !
He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his
head.
Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped
down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy.
He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a
frenzy.
DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls,
SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him.
He falls to the
ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like
rabbits, terrified...
By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard,
T-BONE's no longer even visible.
There's just a swarming,
man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings
insanely.
Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS
blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs.
All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's
mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard.
A GUARD notices the
Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing
but ROCK MUSIC -- "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen.
Bird bird
bird, bird is the word...
An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted
road leading away from the prison.
It disappears from view --
and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great
squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as
he makes his way back to Gotham City.
DISSOLVE TO:
FIRES burn in garbage cans.
TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy
landscape.
Men, women, and children wander aimlessly,
huddling against the cold.
An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park.
On
the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens,
half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a
candlelight VIGIL.
Hand-lettered placards read: "SAVE THE
PARK."
"PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE."
"THIS PARK IS OUR HOME."
The source of the protest?
A towering SIGN posted in a corner
of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new
luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw
Construction, Inc.
A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby...
Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to
Gotham's elite.
A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has
been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of
PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as
BRUCE'S CAR pulls up.
A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in
concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush.
The liveried
DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience
-- as they enter.
Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor.
FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS --
totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the
sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank
leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar:
the WHARF RAT.
Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are
icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost.
A small STEAMBOAT
is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS --
mean, ugly, and heavily armed.
A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet
them on the dock below.
The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT
RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank.
Something major
is about to happen...
The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a
black MEDICAL BAG.
Hands raised, the two of them start up the
gangplank.
Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on
the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies.
One of them turns to
a colleague:
DOCK GOON I
Where's that goddam Ricky?
DOCK GOON II
Probably out gettin' laid.
And here we
are freezin' our balls off...
The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's
bag.
The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING
CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck.
BOAT THUG I
You pick.
The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random.
Two BOAT THUGS tip
it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM --
revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER.
POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a
ramshackle boathouse at water's edge.
Down on the deck of the
steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the
merchandise.
LIEUTENANT
It's pure.
REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof.
The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only
details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY
EARS...
CHIEF GOON (O.S.)
Let's do it.
He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH
assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT
THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to
the big hook.
BOAT THUG I
Hold it.
Let's see the money.
Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase
and opens it.
Lots of long green inside.
The BOAT THUG
signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the
goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank.
LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT
The goon with the suitcase marches up.
Beyond him, in the
distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof
and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the
CRANE.
ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone
holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck
and crane swings over the pier.
ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT
Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the
air.
ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down
onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath.
The crates
explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and
random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic.
ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT
Nobody knows quite what's going on.
Panicking, the GOON with
the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the
gangplank.
BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick
shot.
Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the
drink, suitcase and all.
Pandemonium.
All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE.
Thinking
he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON
and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range.
BOAT THUG I
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
(to another BOAT THUG)
Go after it.
Get the money.
GO!!
He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys --
diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire.
Everyone's
ducking for cover.
BOAT THUG I barks orders at the
pilothouse:
BOAT THUG I
Soltar las amarras!
-- CAST OFF!!
ANOTHER BOAT THUG
LOOK!
BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE
landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away.
Clad in inky
black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is
concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK.
Studded, with
openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous
touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.
She bares her teeth and HISSES.
It's a woman.
BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized.
In the time it takes
him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS.
She
SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,
RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat.
He slumps
to the deck, lifeless.
The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw
with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him
toppling into the water.
The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the
pier.
She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the
DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the
boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.
Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky
specimens remain behind.
She somersaults forward; takes one
goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off
the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more
reeling with swift talon-slashes.
The whole frenzied mop-up
action takes just under ten seconds.
Alone at last, she
stands back to survey the scene.
Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in
the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead.
The snow
is speckled with red.
A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in
their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down
and softly MOANING.
Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the
wreckage of the smashed shipping crates.
BINDLES OF WHITE
POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all
about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested.
Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the
sides of the crates.
She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents
until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel.
She opens
it carefully and holds it up for inspection.
The statuette of
a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the
moonlight.
The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the
MOANING PUNK's back pocket.
Then, cradling the raven under
one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet.
A LANTERN approaches.
It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of
hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the
sight of the carnage on the docks.
He kneels beside the
moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the
PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.
PUNK
Murcielago.
MURCIELAGO!!
CUT TO:
VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps.
She's standing
behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown
DEMOLITION SITE.
SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a
VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn
with rubble.
The only structure still standing is a lone,
decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above
it, ready to strike.
A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE
COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION,
INC.
Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and
hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE:
SHAW
Come on!
Let's move it!
We're an hour
behind as it is!!
A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the
tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION
GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the
condenmed building.
VICKI watches angrily...
HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS
A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling,
clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave.
Their few
belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which
the cops heave rudely out onto the street.
Finally, the
handcuffs and nightsticks come out...
ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman
taking photos in the crowd.
SHAW recognizes her instantly.
His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been
personally betrayed.
SHAW
Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!
He makes eye contact with her.
VICKI stares back defiantly.
He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT
signals to him:
HARDHAT
Phone call, Mr. Shaw.
Guy said it's
urgent.
SHAW
(to tbe SURVEYOR)
Hold the ball.
I wanna hear it crash.
He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a
CELLULAR PHONE.
INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW
BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his
one phone call to contact the construction magnate.
BARRETT
It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett.
I
want you to call my attorney.
That was my
shipment they busted up last night.
SHAW
Jesus, Walter, I --
(suddenly puzzled)
Why are you calling me??
BARRETT
It's worse than that.
Somebody took my
raven.
SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief.
ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT
SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a
daze.
He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE
blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the
facade of the tenement.
SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it.
He scurries off
to his car at the end of the block.
VICKI, highly intrigued,
gets it all on film...
The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky.
After a beat, the
CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point
and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past.
BARRELING TOWARD US on the street.
The SQUAD CAR gains behind
it.
A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash...
The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES.
OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS
As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO
MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the
pursuit.
All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back
of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE
DRIVERS...
TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift
roadblock.
ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them.
They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing
smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them...
ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself
from the body of the car.
It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS
flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER.
A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES.
The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING
UP and dive for the sidewalk.
The COW-CATCHER slams into the
SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises
through the gap.
As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow
the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby
building --
-- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot,
because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the
action with some dismay.
His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky
ground.
He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL
UNIT:
BATMAN
Evasive.
SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in
thought.
CUT TO:
SIRENS echo in the streets.
SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and
streak off toward SHAW's building.
Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an
ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his
head.
An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the
police frequency:
DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter)
-- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at
Gotham Park West.
Move out.
It's Randall
Shaw.
Repeat, all units --
BATMAN's eyes widen.
He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY
METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as
part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo.
But it's no umbrella.
When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his
BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding
-- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS.
He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS
THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise
past far below.
Forty stories up.
The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she
scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one
lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF.
She scampers across the
rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle,
like a mountain climber --
-- until she reaches the building at the end of the block.
Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack.
She pulls out a
retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around,
HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street...
POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally
oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the
small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in
black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the
intersection.
The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides
she's out of danger.
Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops
to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches,
emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure.
She's just
made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped
for a moment of Quality Time.
She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over.
Her whole
body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes
dart left.
A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line.
The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest
of seconds before he steps back into the shadows.
She acts
like she hasn't noticed...
...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same.
TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT
His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her.
If it's
possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're
seeing it now.
HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT
She still doesn't let on that she's seen him.
Instead, she
goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a
gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little
private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE
ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit.
His jaw is down around his knees.
Whoa.
He edges forward
slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her...
She hears a noise.
Stops.
Makes a big show of looking left
and right.
Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN
jumps back into the shadows.
She gathers her things; a small
WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and
she VANISHES over the edge.
Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in
time to see --
She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building,
flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master
gymnast.
Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS
-- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect
landing on the roof of a passing BUS.
BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD.
He
kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled
upon it...
LOOKING FOR LOVE?
He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment.
He rushes back to the
edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the
entrance to Gotham Park.
He's reaching for his grappling-gun,
figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the
face.
Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the
rooftops.
Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as
he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view.
COP
Hey.
You see what I saw...?
This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios.
Right
on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up.
LT. BULLOCK,
who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out.
BULLOCK
It's Randall Shaw.
Torn to ribbons.
--
We just made Batman up on the roof.
GORDON
Oh God.
The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park.
A BLACK
SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing
among the branches...
We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving
finally at:
The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks
and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park
Towers.
MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest
nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift
soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches.
VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand.
She's
trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken.
VICKI
Please, just one.
It's important for
people to see what's happening.
HOMELESS MAN
They don't want to see us, lady.
They
just want us gone -- out of sight, and out
of mind.
(mumbling as he wanders off)
Get worse before it gets better.
It
always does.
VICKI TURNS.
In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and
wailing.
A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and
a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd.
All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE
IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables,
RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos.
Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run.
Those who resist meet with
swift and sudden violence.
A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and
gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble.
VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come.
She
backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS
FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film.
A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --
sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the
snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.
He points her out to a colleague...
...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with
pure cold malice in their eyes.
VICKI turns to run, but it's
slow going in the snow.
She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers
are almost upon her...
...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES
one of the HARDHATS.
The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to
the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.
The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.
But the
FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the
way.
As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his
head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow
from the second guy's tire iron.
In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's
belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the
tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets
to his feet.
He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING
the iron --
-- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-
KICKS HIM in the face.
HOP; KICK.
HOP; KICK.
The FIGURE has
nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit
the ground.
The FIGURE turns toward VICKI.
Her eyes go wide with
astonishment.
It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,
grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT.
She stares at
him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the
aid of his fellow homeless...
She can't believe what she's seeing.
The KID wades smack into
the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass --
spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display
of pure athleticism.
It seems like he's everywhere at once.
There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle
himself like this...
Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch
bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide
turns.
The invasion is being repelled.
Faced with renewed
resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and
race off to their VAN.
Triumph in shantytown.
The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster
together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that
everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the
trees.
But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.
As the KID
runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --
TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.
The KID
throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at
him...
CLANG.
The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,
BOARDLIKE.
The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there
with a baseball bat.
He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his
feet -- thanks for returning the favor.
He's about to light
out again when --
VICKI
WAIT!
Don't be afraid.
I wanted to thank
you.
I --
KID
(cautiously)
Twenty.
VICKI
What?
KID
Twenty bucks.
VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just
the same.
She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID
snatches the bill out of her hands.
They stare at each other
for a long moment --
VICKI
...Who are you?
KID
Dick.
-- and then he's bounding off like a shot.
VAULTING up into a
tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches.
VICKI starts to
follow, but there's no way she can keep up.
Instead she digs
into her CAMERA BAG...
HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS
Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the
treetops.
She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks
of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from
limb to limb...
For a moment it seems like she's lost him.
As she sweeps the
lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of
an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance.
She ups the
magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal.
The
stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE
-- BRUCE's great-grandfather.
As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet
from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again.
He
looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then
races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small
hillocks, over a frozen creek.
There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter,
mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate
and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place
behind him.
Home sweet home.
as she lowers the lens.
Her face is full of conflicting
emotions.
She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find
out what his story is.
But on the other hand -- even the
homeless are entitled to their privacy...
CUT TO:
The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9
shopping days left until Christmas.
Down below, BRUCE is
walking VICKI to work.
VICKI
Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then
vanished into a drainage pipe -- right
next to the statue of General Wayne.
BRUCE
My illustrious great-grandfather.
Think
it's the same kid we heard about?
VICKI
Must be.
He reminded me of you.
BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe
building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM:
NEW BAT-MURDER?
Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer
Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment
The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY
RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall.
BRUCE scowls at VICKI:
BRUCE
-- You work for this rag?
(snatching up a paper)
Your boss is calling for Gordon's
resignation -- unless he brings Batman in
for questioning...
VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the
street.
THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP
The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his
Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS.
A MOTHER drags
her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells
heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't
approve...
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI
looking on in dismay.
BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage:
BRUCE
I need a good PR man.
NEWS VENDOR
Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'?
With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack.
VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe.
VICKI
That's what happens when you go after the
rich and powerful.
BRUCE
Hey, it wasn't me, remember?
I am rich
and powerful --
As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand.
He sees
an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- "LOOKING FOR LOVE?
Find
it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS."
Looking for Love.
Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a
quarter and races back to the newsstand.
VICKI keeps
walking...
VICKI
Maybe it's almost...good.
In a weird way.
I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people
like that were really scared, maybe
they'd --
She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself.
She turns
around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly
unfolding a copy of the Globe.
She marches back and tugs at
his sleeve.
VICKI (cont.)
Hey, I'm late for work.
You can read that
later.
BRUCE
Quiet.
I'm looking for a personal ad.
Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the
page.
BRUCE (cont.)
"Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on
the roof 12/16.
I was in black; you were
too."
VICKI
Is this some kind of bad joke?
BRUCE
It's her.
That cat woman, or whatever she
is.
(reading aloud)
"I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping
you'd follow, but you were too shy..."
VICKI
What does she want -- a date?
BRUCE
She's trying to contact me.
Says she's
gonna leave me another ad...
The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity.
BRUCE's
mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that
makes VICKI just a trifle nervous...
WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of
the courthouse.
BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS.
REPORTER I
Mr. Barrett!
Any comment on the
arraignment?
REPORTER II
Is it true bail was set at two million
dollars?
ATTORNEY
Stand back!
My client has nothing to say
at this time!
The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a
waiting CAR, shielding his face.
REPORTERS cluster around
it...
As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS
taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall
of Justice.
OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR
PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is
idling at a traffic light far below.
BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated.
He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he
stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE.
He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been
waiting for:
TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming.
Why don't we trim the tree together?
This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street.
In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN
are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost
fifty feet tall.
The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham.
BRUCE
smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to
his car.
DISSOLVE TO:
SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree.
The
tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the
ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric
sheets.
A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in
front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition
of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen."
The Square is rocking with
good will toward men.
When they get to the part about saving
us all from Satan's power --
-- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from
his usual gargoyle's perch.
He's scanning the streets and the
rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move --
whatever it is.
He glances at the building directly across the square from
him.
On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in
ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL
SCULPTURE of the world turning.
His eyes rove downward along
the facade of the building...
At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the
Globe offices.
THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of
the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX
handcuffed to his wrist.
Of course, we can't see what's
inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just
about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE.
The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without
incident.
As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the
frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which
reads:
BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE?
Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE!
He watches with some curiosity.
An armored car: is this some
part of the CATWOMAN's scheme?
But no...the GUARDS are safely
inside the building, and the CAR is leaving.
He settles back
to wait.
"Here Comes Santa Claus" echoes up from the streets.
BATMAN
watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of
the Globe...
In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors
still spinning.
In FG, the small dormer-like structure that
houses the STAIRWAY.
The metal access door opens, and the
first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready.
He
smiles back at his pal.
GUARD
No way.
They don't pay us enough to
tangle with Batm--
A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of
the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT...
singing "Here Comes Santa Claus" at the top of their lungs.
Happy faces beam.
No one hears anything unusual over the
music...
BATMAN straining to listen.
We get another faint series of
POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the
loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades.
He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all.
He scans
the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's
happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon
sign...
The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire
from the dead GUARD's rifle.
The helicopter is still idling,
but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with
stiffs...
He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight
from the Globe roof across the square.
Something weird is
definitely going on.
He's about to abandon his post --
-- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING.
The
big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the
seconds:
CROWD
Ten!
Nine!...
A ramshackle kiosk at street level.
The NEWS VENDOR has
stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities.
A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR
MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of
papers on the curb.
EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off:
CROWD
...Three!
Two!
One!
The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into
CHEERS.
The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of
"JINGLE BELLS."
The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone
else when a second newspaper van rumbles past...
NEWS VENDOR
Hey!
No!
I aleady got a --
He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing
RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS.
They shove a BODY out the door --
The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk
with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read
"BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE."
The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded
a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square.
The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence --
-- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID,
CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!!
The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop
down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders.
ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the
BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant
Christmas tree.
CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES.
They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as
the bats attack.
WOMEN SCREAM.
CHILDREN SCREAM.
MEN SCREAM
TOO.
A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands
on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA
CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a
prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO."
The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as
the BATS converge on him.
He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below.
He
glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a
WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at
the chaos, TAUNTING him.
A few blocks away from Gotham Square.
SIRENS HOWL.
There's a
steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the
disturbance.
One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction,
against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN.
BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the
CORPSES strewn across the helipad.
A dying GUARD raises a
shaky hand...
BATMAN crouches beside him.
A GURGLE comes up from his throat
and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips.
All at once he
hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE
SCULPTURE...
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Some people just can't take discipline.
(beat)
Go ahead.
Finish 'em off...
His head jerks up.
He can't see anything.
A sudden WHOOSHING
noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the
roof.
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
You might as well.
You're going to get
blamed for it anyway.
He stands.
He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW
springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof,
clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures.
He reaches for a
Batarang.
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Oh, come on, angel.
You know you want to.
(purring loudly)
Besides -- I want to see how you do it!
BATMAN
Who are you?
He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind,
feet first, knocking him to the rooftop.
He tries to get up,
but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS,
knocking him back into a cornice.
He ducks right just as a
SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three
inches from his throat.
He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and
lands on her feet.
Cats always do...
CATWOMAN
My, aren't we frisky tonight.
He flings the BATARANG.
It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as
she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach.
GLASS TUBING
shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows --
CATWOMAN
I should tell you -- I've got nine lives
to play with -- and you've only got one...
He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a
death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly
toward the HELICOPTER.
The huge ROTOR BLADES are still
turning...
BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free --
FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof.
It's a strategic move: when
he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and
KICKS UPWARD with startling force.
This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his
feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER.
He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on
him.
She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around
his CROTCH.
He tries to break her grip, but she's just as
strong as he is.
And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward,
toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the
helicopter!
The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises
perilously closer.
At the last possible instant, he grabs a
handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can --
With a YOWL, she releases him.
They tumble to the roof and
she DIVES ATOP HIM.
Her TALONS click into place -- he sees
them poised directly above his EYES --
-- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can
strike.
Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and
circle each other...
SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the
roof, trying to break it down.
BATMAN turns for an instant --
a sudden CRACK --
-- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT-
O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER.
She
sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he
collapses to the roof in a jittering heap.
The BANGING on the
door is louder...
CATWOMAN
Did I tell you I invited company?
-- Keep
'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.
She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching
face.
Then she scurries to the edge of the roof,
DISAPPEARING --
-- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes
crashing out onto the roof!
Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but
the COPS are swarming the place.
They spot the BODIES on the
tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the
obvious conclusion.
Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE.
BULLETS
RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE.
BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a
GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which
is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS
HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall.
The SWAT COPS score a
couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum,
but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough
to reach the roof.
CUT TO:
The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a
LAMPPOST and SKIDS.
The second car CRASHES INTO IT.
And the
pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto
the immobilized squad cars.
AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK
continues.
COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies
as they try to evacuate the citizenry.
PARAMEDICS drop the
stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their
heads...
BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof
over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow.
The
roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for
step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the
next, leading him on.
Finally she reaches the edge of a
building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go
but down.
She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to
him --
CATWOMAN
Ooh.
Where have you been all my life?
He edges closer.
Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY
OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.
BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING.
He hesitates a second -- moves
closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE.
BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT
Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade
of the building some ten or twelve feet below.
The window of
a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping
in the chill wind.
She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment.
BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop
to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way
down.
A sudden CRACK --
The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment.
Instead, she's
followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently
doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN.
He TURNS just as
her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg.
She gives it a
sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER
THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.
He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS
UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING.
The WHIP
has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding
tight.
He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away
from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip
UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.
He manages to brace his left foot against the wall.
It's a
massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from
moving.
The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down
to the pavement...
She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed
pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place.
With a cheshire-
cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it
on the edge of the cornice.
BATMAN hanging immobile.
Craning his neck, he can just see
the
RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly,
and apparently talking to him...
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Nevermore.
Nevermore!
Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice,
chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a
fern bar.
CATWOMAN
Cute, huh!
I think it'll look nice over
the fireplace.
Maybe you can drop by and
see it sometime.
(demurely)
I hope you won't think I'm too...
aggressive or anything, but I find you
very attractive.
She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat
with a piece of yarn.
BATMAN grimaces.
She speaks in a low,
soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr.
Behind the bondage
mask she bats her eyelashes.
CATWOMAN (cont.)
It's just so hard to meet interesting men
these days.
Don't you think so?
(sighing)
I have trouble with relationships.
Men
find me intimidating...kind of predatory,
you know?
Really I'm not.
Really I'm
just playful...
BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can
grab hold of the whip.
She frowns and YANKS on it.
His foot
flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils
before he can stabilize himself.
CATWOMAN (cont.)
Don't laugh!
I'm trying to open up to
you!
Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut
him loose.
ANGLE ON BATMAN
He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt.
Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around
into firing position.
He'll shoot it right through her if he
has to...
CATWOMAN (cont.)
I always seem to fall for the wrong guys.
You know...most men are rats.
ANGLE ON CATWOMAN
She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her
philosphical mode.
CATWOMAN
Mice, really.
It's disgusting -- they beg
you to walk all over them and then they
whine when you do it.
Once you've had
your fun there's not much you can do but
kill them.
(beat)
But you seem different.
I mean, you
obviously understand about dressing up...
that saves a lot of explaining.
I think
people should indulge their fantasies,
don't you?
BATMAN is sweating profusely.
He can't hold his position much
longer.
And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation
out endlessly...
CATWOMAN
So I think I'll let you live.
Cute boys
like you are hard to find...
(standing up)
'Bye, angel.
I'll be thinking about you.
And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with
her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle.
He hangs there a moment,
tries to twist himself around without moving his foot.
He
braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his
grappling gun and FIRES.
The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof.
BATMAN yanks the line
taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when --
-- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice!
CATWOMAN
Gee...I'm so fickle.
A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly
SEVERED.
BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's
still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN.
He DROPS eight or ten
feet...
watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to
DISLODGE.
It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof
and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the
CORNICE --
-- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY.
Fascinated, the
CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down...
ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS
He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up
toward him.
He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS
CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch.
The rods in his
cape begin to INFLATE...
Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge.
Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS.
Four stories up, he rights himself.
Three stories up, he goes
into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide
arcs over the street...
...and a moment later there are no stories left.
With an ugly
crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES.
Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the
middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION.
A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two
feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD.
He doesn't move.
PEDESTRIANS
are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and
peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the
street:
DRIVER
What the hell is this?
CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few
blocks over.
HORNS are honking.
A TRAFFIC COP marches
over --
TRAFFIC COP
Awright, what's the problem here?
(spotting BATMAN)
Jesus.
He tries to clear the crowd away.
A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is
forming around the prostrate BATMAN.
The COP blows his
whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN
rush up to join him.
They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.
The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body
armor.
Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters...
PATROLMAN
Good God.
Cowan -- get to the car --
radio the commissioner!!
By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection,
all surging forward to get a look.
More COPS are arriving to
beat them back.
TRAFFIC COP
Is he dead?
What do we do?
PATROLMAN
The mask.
Get the mask off.
They hunker down over BATMAN.
One of them tugs at his mask --
but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way.
He feels
around --
TRAFFIC COP
Some kinda seam here on the neck...
The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like
fastening under BATMAN's chin.
The instant it comes open --
-- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS
in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,
shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.
Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced.
One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.
On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN.
The
body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --
TRAFFIC COP
DON'T SHOOT, you idiot.
The crowd --
Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the
ONLOOKING COP's hand.
BATMAN is back among the living.
SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing
out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --
Fuck the crowd.
TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire
in absolute panic.
BATMAN slams backward into the delivery
truck and crumples to the ground.
As he falls, he grabs a
couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the
pavement.
Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading
through the intersection.
BATMAN emerges into the midst of
the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --
A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam,
drawn by all the confusion.
He rears the horse back, turns it
in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute
the incoming cars...
Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms.
He
looks down.
He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden
JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.
BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over
to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of
the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE.
He digs in his heels,
maneuvering through traffic...
LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks
off trying to get through the jam.
Their siren is on, but the
cars blocking their path have no room to pull over.
BULLOCK
grabs the radio mike:
BULLOCK
Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner.
We'll have to go in on foot...
As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in
the opposite direction.
On the back of the horse...is BATMAN.
Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car
immediately into REVERSE.
As they watch, BATMAN kicks the
horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park.
A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds
before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling.
BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment.
DICK lands
hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked
smile comes to his face...
Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent.
The body
armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and
above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view...
As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the
bridge.
Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange
little boy's hands.
The kid sizes up the situation immediately.
He nods his head
up and down.
Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws
it to BRUCE.
BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.
He
pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and
starts to move off.
DICK
NO.
WAIT!
BRUCE turns, uncertainly.
DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP.
The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably.
Then he sprints off
into the woods, dancing, leaping.
As he disappears from view,
he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK --
-- which is obviously intended to divert the cops.
BRUCE
makes haste in the opposite direction.
BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape
still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it.
The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone,
sorting through letters and packages.
He hasn't even rung the
bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches
the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS
FACE.
The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and
beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against
the setting sun.
A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past...
TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of
the brownstone.
COP
Mr. Tiptree!
What the hell are you --
HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine.
TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone
follow suit.
At the end of the block he vanishes down a
SUBWAY ENTRANCE.
The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT.
CAMERA
ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL...
A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on
schedule.
DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch.
He lets go and
drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding
again.
As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER
coming from around the house.
He races over to peer around the corner.
He sees the two cars
out front.
He sees the last of the goon squad barging in
through the front door.
His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window.
In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI
surrounded by gun-toting intruders.
One of them grabs her and
twists her arm behind her back.
The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming
cautiously around the grounds.
They turn suddenly --
-- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over
every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor!
SQUAD CARS everywhere.
FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs,
flanked by COPS.
PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious
SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an
ambulance.
