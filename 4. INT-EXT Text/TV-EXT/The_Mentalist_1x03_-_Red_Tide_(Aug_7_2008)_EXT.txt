      Early morning in Paradise.  Through a LONG LENS it s a 
      perfect California postcard -- bright blue sky, waves 
      crashing up and down the sand.  Hardly anyone out this early, 
      but a few hardy SURFERS out on the water and --

      A little GIRL, 7, at tide s edge.  Droopy drawers and a 
      clumsily tied bikini top.  Playing with a doll.  She spies 
      something washed up on the sand, we can t see what.  A 
      jellyfish, maybe.  Moves closer, curious.  It s covered with 
      seaweed.  

      The Blond Girl reaches out, tentative, and pulls aside the 
      seaweed to reveal --

      A DEAD TEENAGE GIRL.  Swimsuit, thin braids tangled in 
      seaweed.  The little Blond Girl SQUEALS for her mom as a wave 
      washes over the body and we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A memorial service on the rocks: A group of six or so TEENAGE 
      SURFERS, leis around their necks, stands on the rim of rocks 
      as crashing waves spray up at them.  Amongst them, featured 
      but not focussed on particularly -- Fit, tan, various shades 
      of blond -- are DANNY, 16, HOPE, 15, WIN, 15 and ANDY, 16.  
      (A few other locals watch the ceremony from the sand, 
      including SURFERS, 20 s to 50 s.)  

      Jane, Cho and Rigsby walk down the beach, toward this scene, 
      hot and awkward in their suits --

                                  CHO
                    You had the keys in your hand the 
                    whole time.

                                  JANE
                    Nope.

                                  CHO
                    Van Pelt told you beforehand.  

                                  JANE
                    If I tell you how it s done, the 
                    Magic Circle sends a team of 
                    assassins to kill us all.  It s the 
                    law. 

      They arrive at a MAKESHIFT SHRINE in the sand where people 
      have left flowers, candles, teddy bears, handwritten notes 
      around an old surfboard. 

                                  RIGSBY
                          (pointing)
                    Her body was discovered right 
                    there.  Coast Guard says that means 
                    she was put in the water somewhere 
                    within a mile north of here.  Any 
                    further along the coast, the 
                    current would have taken her to 
                    Mexico.

      The mourning surfers toss their leis into the crashing surf, 
      then they clamber down from the rocks.

      Jane s gaze rakes the beach.  He zeroes in on one of the 
      spectators on the sand.  A surfer, 30's, more like a BEACH 
      BUM.  Stringy braids, unkempt; he seems very upset, pacing 
      and muttering to himself.  Jane starts to move toward the 
      bum, but Hope tentatively approaches the CBI trio.  Her 
      friend Win kinda scootches up behind her, drawing closer as 
      the conversation continues.  Danny and Andy walk away, up the 
      beach with their boards.

                                  HOPE
                    Hey.  Excuse me.  Are you guys

      Lisbon and Van Pelt emerge.  Lisbon shoves her folder of 
      notes in her bag, more angrily than she meant to.  Papers fly 
      out.  Lisbon curses as she picks them up.

      A few Beachgoers near the water -- families, surfers, 
      gawkers.  Jane ambles along, now in an undershirt and 
      pantlegs rolled up...  

      Plops himself down near a KID, 8, who s building a sad, 
      leaning sandcastle with two plastic buckets and a shovel.  
      Jane starts digging up piles of wet sand for his own 
      sandcastle.  It s hard with no tools.  The Kid eyes him 
      pityingly.

      CLOSE ON THE KID, an astounded look on her face as she stares 
      at --

      A GINORMOUS SANDCASTLE.  Minarets, turrets, it s like a mini-
      Disneyland Castle.  Jane, now standing, beams as he puts the 
      final touches on.

      A small crowd of admirers has gathered, surfers, others (and, 
      we ll realize later, the Beach Bum).  As Jane grabs a used 
      drinking straw from the sand and pokes it in the top turret, 
      a little striped flag, the crowd bursts into APPLAUSE. 

      Off Jane...


      An ancient trailer in the back row.  From deep inside the 
      dark interior we HEAR the muffled sound of sinister THRASH 
      METAL MUSIC, cranked high.   

      Lisbon and Rigsby cautiously approach.  No guns drawn, but

      Makes Jame Gumb s basement look very done, very Hamptons 
      WASP.   The music is BANGING now.  Tension is high.  They 
      both draw their weapons.  The place is too spooky not to.

      Nice campus -- this school has money.  A memorial has just 
      been held for Christine Tanner.  A blown-up PHOTO of her sits 
      on an easel near the double doors.  Stragglers are still

      The kids are confused and off balance now.  What s his game?  
      Jane keeps them off balance by abruptly changing the subject.

                                  JANE
                    When I spoke to you before, about 
                    Monday night at Devon Point, you 
                    didn t mention that you had a party 
                    after you went surfing.

                    people, aside from her killer, to 
                    see Christine alive.  She was  
                    drowned later that night.

      The kids react with the shock expected of them.

                    Mr. Rayburn?

      Rayburn comes over and grudgingly bends down to look at the 
      cement floor in the same way.  

      RAYBURN S POV - When the light hits the cement right, out in 
      the middle of the floor, you can see a little pink bump, an 
        imperfection in the smooth surface.  

                                  JANE
                    See that?

                                    RAYBURN
                    What is it?

                                  JANE
                    The tip of Eddy Garcia s nose.

                    Get outta here.

      Rayburn walks over to the bump, bends down and touches it,  
      screams and falls on his ass. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      The body of Eddy Garcia, encased in a shroud of cement, is 
      lifted by a front-end loader toward the nearby Coroner s 
      wagon.  It s now a crime scene:  yellow tape, Deputies and 
      BFS doing their jobs.

      Lisbon and Jane talk with Rayburn. 

                                  LISBON
                    How is it you don t notice a nose 
                    in your floor? 

                                    RAYBURN
                    It s what I m telling you. 
                    We re trying to finish this thing 
                    too fast.  

                                  KURTIK (O.S.)
                    What the hell is going on here?

      DANE KURTIK - a large rich man - emerges from a black merc 
      that seemed to creep up unseen like a cat.  From the car 
      stereo comes the FAINT THUMP of clearable (1950 s) ROCKABILLY 
      music.  Kurtik sees Garcia s body.  

                                  KURTIK (CONT D)
                    Oh for heaven s sake.  That s a 
                    person?  Someone I employ?

                                  LISBON
                    We think so.

      Kurtik sighs wearily, pinches his nose.  

                                  KURTIK
                    God help me.  If it s not one 
                    thing...

      He turns on his heel and walks back to his car.

                                  LISBON
                    Mr. Kurtik, Dane Kurtik?

      Kurtik pauses impatiently, eyeing Jane and Lisbon.

      A hit.

                                  KURTIK
                    I ve heard the name obviously.  
                    It s been on the news.

                    Your son Danny and Christine were

      Kurtik goes to his car.  Jane waits til Kurtik is opening the

                    Hey, Pops.

      Kurtik turns automatically.

                    I hear you re good in bed.  What s 
                    the secret?

      Kurtik takes a half beat too long to reply, and Jane is now 
      certain he s right.

                                  KURTIK
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about, but you mean to be offensive 
                    I guess.  And you ve succeeded very 
                    well.  I m going to be taking this

      Jane lets that hang, forcing Kurtik to step toward him, or 
      risk appearing to back off.

      Kurtik punches Jane on the nose.  Jane goes down like timber 
      and Kurtik goes to follow up with a good kick...

      Two DEPUTIES launch on Kurtik.  Roaring with anger, he is 
      wrestled to the ground.  Jane crawls onto a cement bag, 
      holding his bleeding nose.  Lisbon watches balefully. 


      Late afternoon.  Spooky shadows growing.  Danny, Hope, Win 
      and Andy walk toward the fence.  Danny in the lead, as usual.  
      Hope, timid, clutching Andy s hand.  The gate ajar.

                    Just because they were having an 
                    affair, it doesn t mean your father 
                    killed Christine. 

                                  ANDY
                    It could have been Flipper.

                                  JANE
                    Right.  Or someone else.

                                  WIN
                    You said you had a way of finding 
                    out.

                                  JANE
                    Really a way you can find out.

      They stop at the gate.  Now the kids can see there s some 
      kind of light ahead, flickering. 


      A giant BONFIRE burns, flames licking at the dark.  The CRASH 
      of the surf.  It s spooky.  The group approaches the fire...

                                  JANE
                    I want to hypnotize you all.  So 
                    you remember details of that night.

      He sees the kids  reaction.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    It s safe.  I m fully trained, 
                    hell, I used to hypnotize people 
                    for a living.  

                                  WIN
                    Uh, no thanks.

                                  JANE
                    Your subconscious minds may recall 
                    things that can help us find the 
                    killer.  Hypnosis will let you come 
                    up with those things.

                                  DANNY
                    What kind of things?

                                  JANE
                    Who knows?  Maybe something Chris 
                    said.  Maybe a glimpse of somebody 
                    up on the bluff there.

                    The smallest thing you recall might 
                    be a vital clue.

                                  ANDY
                    I don t want you messing inside my 
                    head.  No offense.

                                  JANE
                    That s the thing with hypnosis.  
                    I can t mesmerize you against your 
                    will.  It s not possible.  You re 
                    in control the whole time.
                          (a pleading smile)
                    What do you say?  Christine really 
                    needs your help.

      Off the kids, what else can they do but...


      The kids now sit on a log near the crackling flames.  Jane 
      stalks among them.  We get a sense of the showman Jane once 
      was.  CU on Jane s fingers tapping his leg in rhythm, 
        establishing an  anchor  for the kids... He walks behind them 
      slowly --

                                  JANE
                    Close your eyes... Listen, listen 
                    only to my voice... And think of 
                    that night... the bonfire... the 
                    sound of the ocean... The sound of 
                    the ocean.  

      The kids fall into varying degrees of trance.  Andy resists, 
      but Hope is completely under, it seems.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I don t know what you will recall 
                    of that night, but you will recall 
                    something because it s all there in 
                    your memory and all you have to do 
                    is go back to that night and be 
                    there, and there you are.  

                                  HOPE
                    Aaah!

      The others jump out of their trance states.

                                  JANE
                    What is it, Hope?  What do you see?

      Hope, eyes wide open, is still inside her memory.  She points 
      to the bluff.

      Jane touches her shoulder.

                                  JANE
                    Come back now, Hope.

      Hope shakes off the trance state, looks confused.

                    What?  What happened?

      Win walks off into the dark.  Andy scrambling to catch up.  
      Jane is left alone with the ocean and stars and crackling 
      fire.  A beat.

      Morning.  Lisbon and Jane, near the big double doors, sipping

      breaks free, punches Garcia across the jaw with his fist.  
      Garcia goes down --

      Danny still stands over the dead guard.  As the others beg 
      and plead with her not to, Christine takes out her phone and

                    Hope was always smarter than any of 
                    you.  You never appreciated that.  
                    She made all of you take part, 
                    to make all of you equally guilty.  
                    So no one could tell on the others. 

      All four kids hold a feebly struggling Christine down in the 
      ditch-water until she stops moving. 

      END FLASHBACK


    Out on the water is a figure.  It s... Jane.  Surfing 
      expertly across the swells.  As he grins in enjoyment --



                                                                          FADE OUT.

                          THE END                                      APPENDIX A

      EP 103, SCENE 38:


      Danny stands over the dead Guard, a shovel in his hands.  
      Andy, Christine and Hope, Win pacing in the b.g.

                                  WIN
                    Oh man oh man oh man...

                                  ANDY
                    Are you sure he s dead?!  You re 
                    sure?

                                  DANNY
                    We bury him!  No one ll know.

      Christine takes out her phone.

                                  CHRISTINE
                    You re joking, right?  We have to 
                    tell someone.

                                  HOPE
                    You mean the cops?  Are you crazy?

                                  CHRISTINE
                    It was an accident, we ve got 
                    nothing to hide.

                                  DANNY
                    Nothing but a dead guy!

                                  CHRISTINE
                    If we cover it up, that s the 
                    crime!  Relax, you guys.  It was an 
                    accident.

                                  HOPE
                    You re ruining Danny s life!

                                  CHRISTINE
                    A guy s dead.  We are not covering 
                    this up.  Not happening.

      She s implacable.  Danny clenches the shovel.

                                  DANNY
                    You bitch!  What are you doing to 
                    me?
