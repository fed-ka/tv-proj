Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds
chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika! Fists in the
air.
SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
Ayatollah Khomeini.
PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who
were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.
Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH -- JUSTICE
FOR MURDER. A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as
bystanders than peacekeepers.
A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.
From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
the protest. There are three primary buildings on
campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.
Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something
simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate
and makes it to the other side.
And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This
isn't archive footage anymore.
We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA
station chief here.
The PROTEST in front of the gate is getting rowdier --
its energy and numbers swelling.
A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all
bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to
the front of the protest --
WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal.
As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A
WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from
underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT
-- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate
CLOSED --
When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket
raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed
PISTOL in his clothes.
More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet
to the other side, one after another.
ARGO - Final 3.
But a moment later no more climbing is required, because
the GATE CHAIN IS CUT and protestors FLOOD through the
embassy gates, a human dam breaking --
PROTESTORS come running, turning the corner to reach the
building. They use bats and crowbars to smash the
windows of the building.
An IRANIAN POLICE CAPTAIN smokes a cigarette, watching
the mayhem, impassive.
PROTESTORS, now on the embassy grounds, carry banners.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 5.
17 CONTINUED: 17
PROTESTORS
La ilaha ilallah --
A WOMAN IN A CHADOR uses her own radio.
Some of them ring around the building, holding hands and
chanting. Some carry AUTOMATIC WEAPONS openly.
Al Golacinski steps out onto the steps and immediately
there is shouting, and a protestor puts a GUN to his head
-- blindfolds him -- PUSHING AL'S head to the ground...
Golacinski HELD UP TO THE DOOR -- GUN TO HIS HEAD. He
starts to panic.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 7.
27 CONTINUED: 27
AL GOLACINSKI
Let me in! Jesus Christ! Open
the fucking door!
The Marines OPEN THE CHANCERY DOOR -- PROTESTERS POUR IN.
Protestors RUNNING on the roof of the consulate building.
Several stop to try and RIP off a vent cover using CLUBS
and PIPES.
THOUSANDS are now on the grounds of the embassy and they
continue to swarm through the gates.
The student with the SUPER 8 continues to film it all.
Also filming, a NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER with a 16 mm camera.
Smoking cannisters of TEAR GAS, people hurling them.
A protestor lights a paper on fire to ward off the sting
of the gas --
The It's quiet -- the sound of the protest on the other
side of the roof and the embassy campus is distant. Just
the empty street.
On the ground: discarded banners from the protest,
fliers and newspapers.
We see something that looks like BLOOD on the street.
(CONTINUED)
ARGO - Final 10.
40 CONTINUED: 40
They walk west. They're hurrying but taking care not to
run. The five can hear the gunfire and shouting in
Farsi. They walk up the street, away from the sounds of
the protest, instinctively grouping together. Cora looks
back.
BOB ANDERS
Keep going.
41-45 OMITTED 41-45
A LONE ribbon sags in the f.g. -- the CAPITOL BUILDING
behind.
Yellow ribbons tied to lampposts. A Catholic church with
a sign on the lawn that says PRAY FOR OUR HOSTAGES. A
dry cleaner with a large American flag in the window and
yellow ribbons drawn by kids around it.
The exterior of a neighborhood bar, O'Tooles. More
ribbons.
SUPERIMPOSE: McLEAN, VIRGINIA - 69 DAYS LATER
ARGO - Final 14.
Mendez's car speeds by yellow ribbons along trees on
Canal Road.
Mendez gets out of his car and hurries toward a white
building that looks like a college campus.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)

SIEGEL (V.O.)

Chambers, on hold on the phone, walks to Siegel holding
up The Horses of Achilles script in a William Morris
binder. Stacks of scripts on a table outside. Siegel's
new A.F.I. award is being used as a coaster.
SIEGEL
Nobody makes Westerns anymore.
CHAMBERS
(looking through it)
It's ancient Troy.
SIEGEL
If it's got horses in the title,
it's a Western.
CHAMBERS
(into the phone)
Yeah, Kenny, please. It's John
Chambers, about the office space.
(THEN)
It dsn't matter. It's a fake

SIEGEL
If I'm doing a fake movie, it's
gonna be a fake hit.
CHAMBERS

Is A006 still open on the lot?
Mendez walks up to the table where Siegel and Chambers
are already eating.
MENDEZ

Mendez throws down the script.

Chambers looks at the BULLSEYE logo on the cover page.

Tony and Lester turn off Sunset Blvd. and into the office

SIEGEL
He's only a prick if you catch him
on the wrong day.
MENDEZ
Is it the wrong day?
SIEGEL
It's always the wrong day.
They've arrived at a door with a sign: MAX KLEIN

MENDEZ
Taking time off.

He's gotta... stay where he is.
SIEGEL

Kids need the mother.
Chambers and a GRAPHIC ARTIST walk through the set. We
REVEAL a couple of CYLON RAIDERS, helmets off, taking a
break from shooting and leaning against the wall.
A black sedan pulls up to the hotel. A driver opens the
back door. Mendez, Siegel, and Chambers get out of the
car. They're wearing suits.
They walk past a sign that reads: PRESS EVENT and
READING FOR ARGO. A couple of posters with the explosion-
in-space ARGO: A COSMIC CONFLAGRATION logo.
Mendez approaches the iconic building.
ESTABLISHING SHOT. WIDE. OVER the city, featuring the
famous domed mosques.
SUPERIMPOSE: ISTANBUL - JANUARY 25
Mendez walks, the BOSPHORUS in the b.g. He reaches the
doors of an OFFICIAL-LOOKING BUILDING and gs inside.
Tony walks through the doorway revealing the historic
mosque, we hear the call to prayer echo through the
courtyard. Tony walks through the courtyard. We see
some TOURISTS with 70s Instamatics. Locals are HEADING
IN TO PRAY.
Lester is BOUNCING A RUBBER BALL. The PRODUCER from later
in the movie walks by.
PRODUCER
You're working late.
SIEGEL
Til the dawn's early light.
PRODUCER
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna
be you.
SIEGEL
You wouldn't be me for long. I'm
80.
Producer walks away and Lester looks into the Argo'
office as he squeezes the ball.
FROM INSIDE THE OFFICE -- In the foreground, we see what
Lester is looking at: a phone. Stubbornly silent.

Archive footage may be mixed with new footage. Normal
city life mixed with men with automatic weapons. The
contradictions of Tehran at this moment.
A Massive HELICOPTER SHOT OF TEHRAN. We TILT DOWN to see
a traffic jam SPRAWLS AROUND THE AZADI MONUMENT. Bikes,
mopeds, pedestrians, peddlers and old, patched together
cars compete for space. No one gets anywhere.
The taxi pulls up to a FORMAL, PINK BUILDING.
The Driver stops. They've arrived.
A TAXI pulls away.
Mendez, carrying his luggage, stands at a wrought iron
gate with MAPLE LEAVES worked into the iron. Ken Taylor
comes out of the building, opens the gate himself.
MENDEZ
Mr. Ambassador.
TAYLOR
Ken Taylor.
He shakes Tony's hand and they start to walk to Taylor's
car.
TAYLOR
I was expecting more of a G-Man
look.
MENDEZ
You're thinking of FBI, sir.
They get into the car.
Ken Taylor drives up to a nice, but not huge, home in the
expat/diplomatic neighborhood of Tehran. Automatic gates
open.
Taylor leads Mendez inside. Pat Taylor waits for them in
the hall. Takes Tony's hand.
Mendez comes out and lights a cigarette. Ken Taylor is
already there.
TAYLOR
We've got orders to close the
embassy and go back. There's
nowhere for them to stay.
MENDEZ
If we go, you need to leave
immediately. There's a
DANGER --
TAYLOR
Pat and I discussed it. If they
catch you at the airport, they
come here and we go on trial for
harboring the enemy. It's a risk
we took.
(after a moment)
Can you pull this off?
MENDEZ
I don't know.
Tony looks at one of the Argo storyboards -- one
depicting an EXOTIC SPICE MARKET, a BAZAAR -- in the
light.
CORA LIJEK (V.O.)
This isn't what we agreed to.
It's a CAR RENTAL MAN, 60s, speaking. Tony is looking at
a MINIVAN on a lot of beaten-up rental cars.
MENDEZ
This one, how much? One day, how
much?
Tony drives the minivan through streets of Tehran. The
Houseguests sit in silence, looking out the windows.
There is a vehement DEMONSTRATION going on -- stars-and-
stripes burning in Molavi Square -- and it's taking place
right in their way.
They stop at the demonstration, then realize people
aren't passing by as much as celebrating in the street.
Tony is forced to nose his way through the crowd --
chanting and yelling -- some SLAPPING THE WINDOWS.
They finally get through and pull away. With the
demonstration receding behind them, Tony tries to regain
their focus.
MENDEZ
Tell me who you are.
This recalls attention from the windows.

ARGO - Final 81.
The minivan double-parks on Musavi Street. Taxis, men
loading and unloading rolled-up carpets onto pickup
trucks, chaos.
A YOUNG MAN IN SUIT WITH NO TIE waits. This is REZA, mid-
20s, a low-level administrator in the Ministry of
Guidance.
Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The
image FREEZES. In a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.
They exchange pleasantries and Reza leads them down a
narrow street toward the bazaar.
Reza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests
through the Tehran Bazaar. A word about the place: the
world's largest bazaar. 10 kilometers of narrow alleys.
Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers,
fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded
down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older
Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and
rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like
Bourbon Street.
Bob Anders walks toward the front.
REZA
You are the director?
BOB ANDERS
Yes.
REZA
(PLEASANT)
Is this film a foreign bride film?
BOB ANDERS
I'm sorry?
REZA
A film where a foreign bride is
brought to Iran, but she dsn't

misunderstandings and laughs.

of the bazaar.
MENDEZ

LEE SCHATZ
(not looking up)
Yeh.
MENDEZ
If I said you were looking through
the wrong end of that viewfinder,
would I be right?
Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it
again.
LEE SCHATZ
Yep.
ANGLE
Mendez talking to Lee from a distance. A zoom, a closer
snapshot of LEE. Then of CORA LIJEK, who walks through
the bazaar with an open ARGO SCRIPT in her hand.
The Revolutionary Guard photographer is taking pictures
of each of the Houseguests, picking their portraits off
one by one like a sniper.
Two sedans turn onto the property and head up the
driveway.
Ali Khalkali, the revolutionary official, gets out of one
of the cars. He's joined by a couple other OFFICIALS and
by two armed REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS.
Sahar is moving through the garden, she sees the men
approach. She gs to greet them at the gate.

Khalkali makes his decision. He wordlessly turns to go.

The call to prayer echoing as night falls in Tehran. In
an alley where cloaked women hurry past posters of
Khomeini. On a street where a five-year-old boy, in the

Ken Taylor emerges. Waits a beat.

Tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in
one hand and the Canadian passports in the other. He
puts the passports in the bucket, LIGHTS A MATCH.
He looks down at the match, at the passports. The first
stirring of the morning calls-to-prayer echo in the
distance.
HOLD for a long beat ON Tony. Thinking.
Then, HE BLOWS OUT THE MATCH.
Mendez gets into the driver's seat. Lee Schatz on the
passenger side.
We see Ken's black embassy sedan waiting, driven by a

QUICK CUT BACK TO:
Siegel and Chambers are walking back to the Argo office.
They are within sight of the Argo bungalow, but a P.A.
steps in front of them.
P.A.
(a stage whisper)
I'm sorry, we're shooting.
He motions for them to wait. A movie -- it looks like a
police procedural -- is shooting on the lot between them
and the office.
P.A., still holding Chambers and Siegel. The ACTOR
playing the cop is conferring with the director. He's
not happy with something. They're holding everyone until
the next take, and --
P.A.
Going again please! We're
ROLLING --
A PICKUP TRUCK with 5 Komiteh -- including Khalkali --
automatic weapons out -- drives up to the Canadian
Ambassador's residence.
SIEGEL
I'm sorry, pally. We're just gonna
be in the movie. Call my agent.
P.A.
Sir. SIR!
Siegel and Chambers walk through the shot toward the Argo
office.
Khalkali and Komiteh are forcing the front door of the
house open.
A BUSLOAD of passengers about to be ferried to the
airplane.
A Swissair Rep is closing the gate to Flight 363. She
looks up to see the Houseguests and Mendez hurrying
through the terminal, headed toward her. She holds the
gate, speaks in German into a walkie, and --
The Houseguests head up the stairs to the plane.
An IRAN AIRLINES 747 takes off, revealing the Swissair
jet behind it. Only empty runway ahead of Swissair 363
now and --
ARGO - Final 112.
We're SPEEDING BEHIND two Iranian police cars and a
canvas-topped TRUCK as they speed toward the Swissair
plane. In the back of the truck we can see half a dozen
Komiteh, weapons drawn and --

speeding ahead -- they're GAINING ON us --
ANGLE ON THE JEEPS
We start to PULL AWAY FROM them -- leaving them behind --
beginning to RISE UP --
The Komiteh from the Jeep are now standing on the runway
watching the plane disappear.
We are looking at a street corner in Tehran when the
PLANE CRESTS THE STOREFRONT, heading upward and away.
Siegel throws down a phone and rushes outside... to where
Chambers smokes.
SIEGEL
OUUUT! THEY'RE OUT!
Chambers and Lester scream like kids who've just scored
the game-winning touchdown. The P.A. tries to shush
them.
An IRAQI BORDER GUARD, checking passports at a chain-
link, barbed-wire fence, speaks to a WOMAN IN HIJAB who
is turned away from us. The Guard stamps the Woman's
passport.
BORDER GUARD (ARABIC)
You are admitted to the Republic

She stands and stares at the line of REFUGEES still
waiting to cross: WOMEN balancing blankets tied up with
all they own. An OLD MAN being helped by his SON. A
couple of KIDS, a SEVEN YEAR-OLD shushing an INFANT in
her arms. Lives that have become another tableau of
refugees.
Sahar, now one of them, walks into Iraq.
Siegel in a bathrobe, looking out over L.A., holding
The New York Times in front of him: SIX U.S. DIPLOMATS,
HIDDEN BY CANADA, LEAVE IRAN SAFELY. Next to that, an
article about Ken Taylor: DIPLOMAT DIRECTED ESCAPE IN

She said, Why couldn't we pull
off something like that?' You

O'Donnell is on his way out, heading toward Tony who is
heading in. Seeing Mendez, he stops dead.
O'DONNELL

O'DONNELL
If we wanted applause, we would

He waits. After a moment, Christine opens the door.
