      MARTIN BOHM, (37), stands at the Lost and Found counter in
      the baggage area of JFK airport.  He's wearing a baggage
      handler's UNIFORM, but looks like he was meant for something
      more ambitious than sorting bags.                                                                                          4.

      Martin has a somber, haunted demeanor.  He's a man with a
      secret. 

      As he waits, a little impatiently, he notices a NEWSPAPER
      laying open on the counter.  Something catches his eye.  He
      slides the paper over for a closer look.  Stares down at an
      article with the headline, "Muller Denied Stay, Execution
      Date Set."

      Martin eyes the article.  Something about it haunts him.  

                                    LOST AND FOUND GUY (O.S.)
                    Batteries are all dead on these ones.

      Martin looks up to see Lost And Found Guy approach with a
      small CARDBOARD BOX filled with 35 old CELL PHONES.  Martin
      looks up from the article.

                                      MARTIN
                    That's okay. 

      Martin slaps a TWENTY down on counter.  

                                    LOST AND FOUND GUY
                    What the hell do you do with these
                    things, anyway?  

      Martin musters just enough energy to qualify as conversation.  

                                      MARTIN
                    My son... likes to take them apart.

      Martin picks up the box and starts to carry it away.

                                    LOST AND FOUND GUY
                    Hope he ain't making no bombs with'em,
                    like they do over there in Iraq.

                                      MARTIN
                          (without looking back)
                    Me too.


      Martin exits, carrying the box.  We MOVE with him through
      the back area where 1,000 pieces of luggage revolve on giant
      CONVEYOR BELTS.  

      Suddenly, RIIINNNGGG!  It's one of the phones in the box. 
      Martin, startled, digs through the phones, finally finding
      the culprit.   

      THE PHONE WITH THE CARE BEARS STICKER ON IT  

      Martin stares it, curiously.  Then answers, cautiously --                                                                                        5.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

      A MAN'S VOICE squeezes through the tiny speaker.  British
      accent.  It's Simon Plimpton, whom we met in the MONTAGE.

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    I want my phone back. 

                                      MARTIN
                    Who is this?

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    The owner of the phone you are
                    illegally in possession of.

                                      MARTIN
                          (WTF?)
                    I am not illegally possessing any...
                    It was in the Lost and Found.

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    Where?

                                      MARTIN
                    JFK airport. 

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    New York?!  Jesus...

                                                                          INTERCUT WITH:


      SIMON stands at a pay phone in this crowded Indian station. 
      He looks even more disheveled than the last time we saw him.

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    ...Look, I don't care how you got
                    it, I just want it back.  It's been
                    forty eight hours, people phone-
                    skipping it around the globe.

                                      MARTIN
                    Phone skipping?

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    The latest craze.  Find a phone that
                    doesn't belong to you, leave some
                    video message or a questionable
                    contact in it and send it forward. 
                    It is neither as amusing nor clever
                    as it sounds.  So can I please have
                    my phone back?                                                                                        6.

      BACK TO MARTIN

      who looks harassed by the whole damn thing. 

                                      MARTIN
                    Can't you just get a new one?

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    It's not the phone I need.  It's a
                      photograph I took with it.  Of my
                    daughter.  It's her birthday tomorrow
                    and... it's a long story, so if you
                    could just-- 

                                      MARTIN
                    Alright, alright, fine.  How do I
                    get it back to you?

      Suddenly, Martin's own phone RINGS in his shirt pocket.  

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    I'm in Mumbai on business.  I'm
                    staying at the --  

                                      MARTIN
                    Hold on a second, my phone's ringing.

      Martin sets down the Care Bears phone on top of a piece of
      luggage on a conveyor belt in order to answer his own phone.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

      We DON'T HEAR the other side of this conversation, but Martin
      is suddenly alarmed. 

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    What?  Ah, Christ... When did he...
                      nevermind.  I'll be there as fast as
                    I can. 

      Martin hangs up his phone, grabs the box of phones and takes
      off running.  We TILT DOWN to Simon's PHONE still on top of
      the SUITCASE, as the conveyor belt STARTS UP and begins to
      MOVE.  We hear SIMON'S VOICE squeeze through the tiny speaker - 

                                      SIMON (O.S.)
                    Hello!  You still there?!!  Hello?!!


      CHRIS ROCK

      PROWLS on stage in one of his HBO specials, microphone in
      his hand, but with no sound.  WIDEN to see we're looking at
      a SMALL TV in the bare living room of Abdul's house.

      ABDUL

      prowls back and forth in unison to Chris Rock, a WOODEN SPOON
      in his hand as a microphone.  He's pantomiming all of Chris
      Rock's moves.  When Chris gestures, Abdul gestures.  When
      Chris stops and flashes a wide grin, so does Abdul.                                                                                          11.

                                      ABDUL'S MOTHER (O.S.)
                          (in Arabic)
                    You look like an idiot.

      Abdul stops and turns to see his MOTHER in the doorway. 
      (Italics = Arabic.)

                                      ABDUL
                          (in English)
                    I'm practicing my English.  

                                      ABDUL'S MOTHER
                    Great, the Americans left us their
                    wonderful language along with a whole
                    country in ruins.  
                          (points to TV)
                    And this filth?  This is the real
                    legacy.

                                      ABDUL
                    It's Chris Rock.  I'm learning all
                    his moves.  When I get into the comedy
                    clubs I'll make a fortune.  

                                      ABDUL'S MOTHER
                    What comedy clubs?!  This is Baghdad!  

                                      ABDUL
                          (undaunted)
                    You'll see.  Then we won't have to
                    sell bread for the rest of our lives.

                                      ABDUL'S MOTHER
                    Well we won't have to worry about
                    that since we no longer have an oven!

      This stops Abdul.  He looks at her seriously.  Abdul's mother
      puts her hand to her mouth, overcome with emotion.

                                      ABDUL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                    Your father is in the kitchen, sitting
                    vigil, too much pride for you to see
                    him cry.  No oven, no bread.  No
                    bread, no money.  No money, no house.  

      Abdul just stares at her, feeling the weight of this family
        catastrophe.  Abdul crosses to her.  Embraces her.  

                                      TARIK (O.S.)
                    You ready?

      Abdul turns to see TARIK, (18), a little pudgy, wearing jeans
      and a Ben & Jerry's T-shirt.                                                                                          12.

                                      ABDUL
                          (to his mother)
                    I have to get to school.  Don't worry,
                    mother, I'm going to figure something
                    out.  I promise.  I don't want you
                    to worry.

                                      ABDUL'S MOTHER
                    You're a good boy, but there's is
                    nothing to be done to fix the oven. 
                    We are in Allah's hands now.

      She turns and walks away.  Tarik looks at it Abdul, confused.

                                      TARIK
                    Did I miss something?

      Abdul doesn't answer.  Just picks up his books and heads for
      the door, blowing past Tarik.


      Martin drives, silent but fuming.  A man at his wits end.  A
      long beat, then trying to remain calm --

                                      MARTIN
                    You can't do this anymore, Jake.   

      He looks over at Jake, who doesn't respond -- too engrossed
      in his box of cell phones.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    The police filed a report this time. 
                    You know what that means...?

      Still no response.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    You remember the courthouse?  The
                    lawyer with the bad toupee?  We're
                    already on thin ice... 
                          (really worried)
                    This isn't good...

      Another beat, then he changes tack --

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    It's your mom's birthday today. 
                    We're all the way out here... might
                    as well go pay a visit, huh?

      He looks over at Jake, who just keeps his attention focused
      on the phones, as we DRIFT out the window and up to the sky --

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                        13.


      A TV mounted near the ceiling plays FOX NEWS with the sound
      off.  On SCREEN a PRISON INMATE is being led down a long
      institutional hallway.  Underneath the image a CAPTION reads,
      "Kentucky Governor denies Stay for Muller". 

      The CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN to find Martin staring at the silent
      image on the TV.  His blank expression looks through the TV. 
      He stands in line at the counter with Jake, a bottle of ORANGE
      FANTA in Martin's hand.  

      Jake stares at the MAN in front of him in line.  The Man is
      big, burly with a PONYTAIL.  He steps up to the counter. 

                                      PONYTAIL
                    Lottery ticket please.  87 1 9 20 31
                    11.  

      Jake watches as the LOTTERY TICKET is placed on the counter
      next to Ponytail.                                                                                          15.

      As Ponytail pulls some bills out of his wallet to pay, Jake
      reaches out and picks the ticket up off the counter.  He
      stares at it, then takes off running with it, out the door.  

                                      PONYTAIL (CONT'D)
                    Hey!  What the hell are you--?!!!

      Martin looks up to see this insane moment play out as Ponytail
      takes off chasing after Jake, who barrels --


      KATE GRAHAM (from the opening MONTAGE) sings an infectious
      version of Bob Marley's "Three Little Birds - Don't Worry
      'Bout a Thing".  But now we hear her, and Kate is a terrific
      singer and dynamic performer.  

      The SHOT is HAND-HELD and has a "VIDEO" quality.  We REVERSE
      to see it's being filmed by the CAMERA in the CELL PHONE
      with the CARE BEARS STICKER on it.    

      NILES BORNE, a nerd of the highest order, is filming with
      the phone.  He's the classic pretty girl's platonic best
      friend.  We're in a cheesy karaoke bar filled with drunk
      BUSINESS PEOPLE.

      We watch Kate's big finale and the drunken crowd RISES in a 
      STANDING OVATION.  She is obviously way too talented for
      this shitty place. 

      Niles turns the phone towards himself and says right into
      the camera, with a thick IRISH ACCENT --                                                                                        17.

                                      NILES
                    Ladies and gentlemen, the song
                    stylings of the next global phenom,
                    Kate Graham.  Play it forward, pass
                    it along.  Start your fan clubs here.

      KATE makes her way through the crowd of admirers, as Niles
      hops down off the table and joins her.

                                      NILES (CONT'D)
                    I'm star struck.  You killed tonight.

                                    KATE
                    And now for the post performance
                      depression.  

      She grabs her ORANGE FANTA off the table and heads for the
      door.  Niles looks at her concerned, then follows her.


      CLOSE ON THE LOTTERY TICKET

      as it's tacked to a CORK BOARD.  WIDEN to see that it's one
      of HUNDREDS of other LOTTERY TICKETS.  Each of the tickets
      share the IDENTICAL sequence of numbers.  He's been playing
      the same numbers for what looks like years.  WIDER still and
      we see --

      PONYTAIL 

      step back and look at the cork board.  We're in his small,
      dark, cluttered home.  The home of a single man who doesn't
      get out much.  Off Ponytail's somber expression as he stares
      at the cork board full of LOTTERY TICKETS --


      We're LOOKING DOWN on Martin asleep, his head resting on the
      kitchen table next to an open FILE.  There are PAPERS and
      CLIPPINGS spread out on the table around him.  

      We're not sure what it is we're looking at, but there are
      CRIME SCENE PHOTOS, COURTROOM TRANSCRIPTS, a PHOTO of a GUN,
      several EXTREME CU'S of the GUN'S SERIAL NUMBER.  FINALLY, a
      MUG SHOT of a MAN, the name "FRANK MULLER" on the placard
      held beneath his chin.

      A FOLDED NEWSPAPER with the same article we saw earlier,
      "Kentucky Governor Denies Stay, Execution Date set", rests
      near his hand.  We PUSH IN on Martin until he suddenly BOLTS
      UP, as though from a dream.  He composes himself when he
      realizes where he is.  Looks at the clock.  

      It's 3:18.  He stares at the time.  That's odd.  He lifts
      the newspaper and looks at the article, as though reminding
      himself what he was doing here.  Then looks up to see --                                                                                        21.

      JAKE

      standing in his doorway.  It's a big BOO!  

                                      MARTIN
                    Jesus, Jake.  You scared the hell
                    out of me.  What are you doing up at
                    this hour?

      But Jake turns and walks away.  After a beat, Martin follows.

      IN THE MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

      Martin, the newspaper still in hand, crosses through the
      loft.  We note a woman's touch to the decor, nicer than we'd
      expect for a baggage handler at the airport.  Martin rounds
      the corner to --

      JAKE'S ROOM

      and stops.  Jake sits on the floor with the BOX of cell phones
      in front of him.  He's arranged a DOZEN PHONES on the floor
      in a SPIRAL SHAPE.  In the center of the spiral --

      JAKE'S NOTEBOOK

      open to the page with the BUS LICENSE PLATE and LOTTERY
      NUMBERS written on it.  Underneath these, written in large
      numbers -- 3 and 18.  Martin doesn't notice this.  But we
      do. 

      Martin sits down cross-legged on the floor with Jake, who
      just continues to neatly arrange his dead phones.  Martin
      reaches out to place his hand affectionately on the back of
      Jake's head, but stops inches away.  This is as close as he
      gets.  He pantomimes caressing him.  After a beat --

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    I want to believe I'm more than just
                    the guy who feeds you, but maybe
                    that's asking too much... of both of
                    us.  You don't even know who I am,
                    do you?   

      Jake of course doesn't respond.   

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Maybe it's because I never told you. 
                    Told you that I used to be somebody...
                    Someone who believed in things. 
                    Someone who wanted to find the truth,
                    and write it down.  I worked at a
                      newspaper, did you know that?  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        22.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                          (holds up the newspaper)
                    For this one.  And I was good at it,
                    too.  Even won some awards.  

      Martin looks off wistfully, then points to the article about
      Muller.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    But that was before this... 

      He stops when he realizes he's just talking to himself.  He
      straightens himself.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                          (looks right at Jake)
                    Your doctor says you're going to be
                    bigger than me.  How the hell is
                    that going to work?   

      Jake stares at his phones.  Martin sighs.  Then stands and
      crosses to the bed and pulls back the covers.  Pats the bed.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Get some sleep, okay?

      Jake looks over at the bed.  Stands up and crosses to it. 
      Climbs into bed.  Martin blows him a kiss, turns off the
      lamp on the night stand and heads for the door.

      We MOVE with Martin, when we notice a slight LIGHT CHANGE in
      the room behind him.  A GLOW.  Martin senses this and turns
      back around.  Stares.  His eyes react as he sees -- 

      THE PHONES 

      on the floor have all LIT UP.  Come to life.  Martin stares,
      confused by this.  He walks over to them.  Looks down.  Each
      of the six phones has the same SERIES of NUMBERS illuminated
      on the screen.  

      He looks up at Jake, who's just staring at the phones.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    How did you...?

      But he stops as he realizes something.  He looks at the
      NOTEBOOK in the center of the spiral.  Picks it up.  The
      LOTTERY NUMBERS that Jake copied from Ponytail's ticket.

      He checks the phones.  The numbers on each phone are identical
      to the lottery numbers.  Off Martin, wondering what the hell
      this is all about --

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                        23.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Simon, our British businessman, sits mid-row in the coach
      section, as PASSENGERS load bags into the overhead
      compartments, pre-flight.  Simon stares at his new cell phone,
      debating whether to make a call.  A moment of decision, then
      he dials a number.  After a beat --

                                      SIMON
                    Hi, it's me...  Oh, yeah, no it's a
                    new phone.  

      INTERCUT with:


      NELL PLIMPTON (31), sits on a little girl's bed in a little
      girl's room, holding a phone to her ear.  She looks somber,
      tired. 

                                    NELL
                    What do you want, Simon?

                                      SIMON
                    I just thought I'd call and check
                    in.  

                                    NELL
                          (impatiently)
                    Uh huh...

                                      SIMON
                    See how you were doing.

                                    NELL
                          (cold)
                    I'm okay.

      There's a long beat.  We've obviously dropped in on something
      very tense between them.  

                                      SIMON
                    I was going to try to make it home
                    for her birthday.  

                                    NELL
                          (without affect)
                    Why?

                                      SIMON
                    Nell, please.                                                                                         24.

                                    NELL
                    I'm sure you're very busy. 

                                      SIMON
                    I'm on a plane to Tokyo.  There's a
                    new chain of Italian bakeries opening
                    and this could be a huge account. 
                    But I can make it back there by
                    tomorrow night.

                                    NELL
                    I don't see the point.  

      Simon takes a long beat, trying a new tack --

                                      SIMON
                    I'm going to try to make it anyway.  

      Nell doesn't respond.  Finally --

                                    NELL
                    Is that all?  Because I have to go.

                                      SIMON
                    Yeah, that's all... 
                          (then)
                    Wait... Last summer in Bristol...
                    that hotel we stayed at on the beach. 
                    We were all so happy there.  

                                    NELL
                    What about it?

                                      SIMON
                    Did we take any photos besides the
                    ones from my cell phone?  

                                    NELL
                    No.  Why?

                                      SIMON
                          (after a beat)
                    Nothing.  Nevermind.  Like I said,
                    I'll try to be there.

                                    NELL
                    It's okay.

      CLICK.  She hangs up.  As we PULL BACK slowly, leaving Nell
      sitting on the edge of the bed, a blank stare on her face,
      we PRELAP a DOORBELL RINGS, and --

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        25.


      CLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR 

      as it opens to reveal CLEA HOPKINS, 27.  Fresh faced,
      professional.  There's a hint of Tracy Flick from "Election"
      in her.  Business attire, briefcase at her side.

                                    CLEA
                    Mr. Bohm?

      REVERSE on Martin in the doorway.  Jeans, t-shirt, barefoot,
      coffee mug in his hand.  He stares, suspiciously --

                                      MARTIN
                    Who wants to know?

                                    CLEA
                          (extends her hand)
                    Clea Hopkins, Child and Family
                    Services. 

      Hearing this, Martin's jaw tightens.  Ready for a fight.

                                      MARTIN
                    What happened to "Miss" Lebowski?

      And he says "Miss" with utter disdain.

                                    CLEA
                    She's on maternity leave.  

                                      MARTIN
                          (deadpan)
                    You're kidding.  God help us all.

      Martin makes a big show of looking down the hallway in both
      directions.  Stares back at her defiantly --

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Where are the men in white suits?

                                    CLEA
                    I'm sorry?

                                      MARTIN
                    You're here to take my son, right?

                                    CLEA
                    I've come to do an assessment of his
                    current situation to determine a
                    proper course of --                                                                                        26.

                                      MARTIN
                    Bullshit!  The kid's had three strikes
                    against him since he was eight.  And
                    you people have been circling the
                    building ever since --   

      This is a macho display, as he takes a step forward.

                                    CLEA
                    Sir, I'm just following protocol
                    based on the recommendation of the
                    facility where your son's been --

                                      MARTIN
                      Facility?!  He'd have been safer if
                    I'd left him in a cardboard box in
                    Times Square every day!  And if you
                    think I'm going to just let you walk
                    in here now and take my--

                                    CLEA
                          (surprisingly tough)
                    I'm here to do my job, Mr. Bohm!  I
                    told you, I've come to evaluate your
                    home situation and report my findings!
                          (then)
                    Now, either you let me in to do that,
                    or you leave me no choice but to
                    file a hostile encounter report. 
                    Trust me, you don't want that.

      A Mexican standoff.  A long beat, then Martin acquiesces,
      and swings the door open.  As she steps through, she hands
      him a folded NEWSPAPER.

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    Your paper.

      He takes the NEWSPAPER and lets her in.  


      Martin, holding his newspaper, closes the door behind her. 
      Clea takes in the place.  We sense her trying to sum up their
      "situation" by the look of the loft.  She's impressed.  She
      pulls a FILE from her folder, opens it.

                                    CLEA
                    I'll just ask a few questions if you
                    don't mind.  

                                      MARTIN
                    Knock yourself out.                                                                                          27.

                                    CLEA
                    You still working as a doorman?  

                                      MARTIN
                    I've been a taxi driver, construction
                    worker and baggage handler since
                    then.    

      Clea just stares at him. 

                                    CLEA
                    That's a lot of instability.  There
                    were problems with those other jobs?

      He looks at her, still defiant --

                                      MARTIN
                    I guess I'm still trying to find
                    myself.  I was thinking brain surgeon
                    next.

                                    CLEA
                          (checking the file)
                    You have a Masters degree in
                      Journalism from University of
                      Wisconsin.

                                      MARTIN
                    Three of my life years down the drain. 
                    These days all you need is a cell
                    phone and a laptop and you too can
                    be a journalist.  Who knew?  

                                    CLEA
                    Yet you lost your job at the New
                    York Times.

                                      MARTIN
                    I was fired.  
                          (beat, explaining--)
                    Had a little trouble maintaining my
                      objectivity on a story I was covering. 

                                    CLEA
                    So I guess you never found the gun?

      Martin looks at her, taken aback by this.

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                          (admitting)
                      I followed the story in those articles
                    you wrote.  

      Martin looks at her.  Then shakes his head slightly.                                                                                        28.

                                      MARTIN
                    I looked for two years.  All I found
                    was the bottom half of a pawn shop
                    ticket.  There's seven thousand
                    pawnshops in this country and it
                    could be at any one of...

      He stops, not wanting to go any further.  An awkward beat as
      Clea looks around the loft, then --

                                    CLEA
                    Look, not to be presumptuous, but
                    you're living in a 3000 square foot
                    loft in the Meat Packing district,
                    which it says here you own....

                                      MARTIN
                    It belonged to my wife.  She was a
                      stockbroker.  The 90's were good to
                    her.

                                    CLEA
                    Still, must be worth an awful lot. 
                    You could probably get enough for it
                    to take care of you and your son for
                    quite a while.  

                                      MARTIN
                    She left it in a trust in my son's
                    name.  Her parents are the executors. 
                    It's their decision.  

      Clea sees she's not getting very far with this line of
        questioning.  Changing tack --

                                    CLEA
                    I'd like to meet Jacob, if I could.

                                      MARTIN
                            (matter-of-fact)
                    He's right behind you.

      She blinks, confused, then turns, a little startled to see 

      JAKE 

      sitting at the kitchen table eating a bowl of cereal.  

                                    CLEA
                    Wow... you're a quiet one, aren't
                    you?  Hello, Jacob, I'm Clea.

      She crosses enthusiastically to him, extending her hand.                                                                                        29.

                                      MARTIN
                      I wouldn't do that if I were you.
                          (when she stops)
                    Unless you're up for peeling him off
                    the ceiling.

      Clea looks at him, confused.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    He doesn't let anyone touch him. 
                    Ever.    
                          (off her look)
                    Don't take it personally.  I don't.  
                          (then)
                    Look, I can explain about the incident
                    yesterday at the cell tower...

      Martin crosses to the kitchen table, sets the NEWSPAPER down.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    ...He's had this fascination with
                    cell phones lately and I think he
                    somehow got it in his head that --

      Martin suddenly stops, staring at the newspaper, his back to
      Clea.  There's a long beat, as she wonders what's going on.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                          (under his breath)
                    My God...

      Clea's eyes narrow curiously.  Suddenly, Martin snatches up
      the newspaper, spins around and RUNS toward Jake's room.  

      IN JAKE'S ROOM

      Martin slides to a stop.  Looks down at the phones, still in
      a SPIRAL on the floor.  Except now, all of them are "dead"
      again.  He picks one up.  Tries to turn it on.  Nothing.  

      Clea appears in the doorway behind him, thoroughly confused. 
      She watches as he picks up another phone, tries to turn it
      on.  It's dead, too.

                                    CLEA
                    Mr. Bohm?

                                      MARTIN
                          (a little crazed)
                    The numbers.  They were all here.  

      He turns and looks at Clea, who looks back at him like he's
      nuts, which he pretty much looks right now.                                                                                        30.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Last night.  These phones.  They had
                    numbers on them.  All the same.  Lit
                    up like a Christmas tree. 

                                    CLEA
                    I'm not following you here.

      Martin hands her the newspaper.  The headline reads, "BIGGEST
      LOTTO WIN IN NEW YORK HISTORY".  The winning NUMBERS listed
      right under the headline.  The same ones from the phone!  

      Under that, a subheading - "Lucky Winner Still At Large".

      Martin picks up the NOTEBOOK from the center of the spiral. 
      Sure enough, the numbers are still there.  Circled.  

                                      MARTIN
                    Look!  He wrote these down yesterday. 
                    It's like he knew...  

      He points to them and thrusts the notebook towards Clea. 
      She looks at the numbers, then checks them against the
      newspaper.  Holy shit.  He's right.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                          (mind racing)
                    How could he have known?

      Off Clea's narrowing eyes --


      The front door opens and in steps Ponytail, wearing an old
      pair of sweats and sneakers, carrying the morning NEWSPAPER
      and cup of Dunkin Donuts coffee.  

      He opens the newspaper and lays it on the table, then turns
      to head into the kitchen.  But he stops, his back to us.  A
      beat, then slowly turns and looks down at the headline.

      We PUSH IN on his eyes as sees the same headline.  

      He crosses to the newspaper and picks it up.  Stares at it. 
      A long beat, then calmly crosses to the PHONE on the wall. 
      Picks up the receiver and dials a number.  After a beat, we
      hear a WOMAN'S VOICE answer "Hello" through the tiny speaker --                                                                                        33.

                                      PONYTAIL
                    Hi.  It's me...

      There's a long silence on the other end.  Then --

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          (stunned)
                    Randy?  My god... it's been ten
                    years...

                                      PONYTAIL
                          (after a beat)
                    I'd like to come home now.

      And as he looks down at the headline, "BIGGEST LOTTO WIN IN
      NEW YORK HISTORY" -- 


      Clea sits on the sofa staring at the notebook.  Martin paces
      in front of her, completely lit up by this.

                                    CLEA
                    ...There are strange coincidences
                    around us all the time.  And autistic
                    children often have a heightened-- 

                                      MARTIN
                          (snaps, impatient)
                    -- Ability for numbers!  You think I
                    don't know that?! 

                                    CLEA
                    I'm sorry.  Of course you do.  
                          (then, confessing)
                    This is only my third solo case and
                    I'm still working on my interpersonal
                    skills. 

                                      MARTIN
                    Great, I get the one with the training
                    wheels.  

                                    CLEA
                    Mr. Bohm, your son has a diagnosis
                    of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder,
                    the most severe form of autism. 
                    There is no positive outcome for
                    this...   
                          (off Martin's silence)
                    It's not uncommon for the guardian
                    to feel a lack of human connection
                    to these children...                                                                                        34.

                                      MARTIN
                    Unless that's exactly what he's trying
                    to do.  Connect!

      Martin starts to pace.  

                                    CLEA
                    Mr. Bohm... Please. 
                          (then)
                    The truth is, the State believes
                    that it is time for Jacob to be
                      institutionalized to keep him from
                    harming himself or others.  

                                      MARTIN
                    But if he's finally communicating...! 

      She looks at him, frustrated that she's not getting through.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Jake climbed that tower three times. 
                    And each time the security camera's 
                    caught him at exactly 3:18.  

                                    CLEA
                    I don't see what any of this has to
                    do with--

                                      MARTIN
                    For two weeks now he's set every
                    clock in the house to this time.  

      Martin crosses to a nearby dresser, turns a clock around. 
      Sure enough it reads, "3:18".  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    And then there's this.

      He yanks open a drawer, pulls out another NOTEBOOK, just
      like the one that we've seen Jake using.  Hands it to Clea. 
      She opens it and leafs through the pages.  

      Every page is scrawled from top to bottom with the same three
      digits over and over - "318, 318, 318, 318, 318, 318...."
      Page after page after page.  Clea looks up, intrigued.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    He's trying to say something.  And I
                    didn't even realize it.    

      Clea stares at him for a long beat, then --                                                                                         35.

                                    CLEA 
                    What you're talking about is just
                    wish fulfillment.  I know you love
                    your son, but--   

                                      MARTIN
                    You're saying I'm making it all up.

                                    CLEA
                    I'm saying that human connection is
                      a powerful need.  It can drive us to
                    see meaning where there isn't any.  

                                      MARTIN
                    Three cases into a career and you've
                    got it all figured out, don't you? 
                    You know it all. 

                                    CLEA
                    I know enough to recognize someone
                    who's underwater, who's given up too
                    much.  A career, a wife...

                                      MARTIN
                    My wife and I had an appointment to
                    see a divorce lawyer on September
                    12th, 2001.  Don't try to make me a
                    clich .   

                                    CLEA
                          (undaunted)
                    Either way, your life is now dominated
                    by a child that you can no longer
                    control.  Have you ever truly
                      communicated with him?  Does he even
                    know who you are?!

      That stops him in his tracks with no clever comeback.  

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    That's not your fault.  No one is
                    judging you for that.  

      He looks at her and we see tears starting to well in his
      eyes.  

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    There's a board and care facility
                    fifteen blocks from here.  The best
                    in the city.  At the end of his two
                    week evaluation period you will be
                    given a chance to make your case for
                    custody.  It will be based on your
                    ability to control, care for, and
                      communicate with him.                                                                                          36.

      Martin slumps down onto the arm of the sofa.

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    Once he's out of the house, I think
                    you'll see that you'll both be better
                    off with this arrangement.  

      Martin lowers his eyes as he listens to this. 

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes you just have to get out
                    of a bad situation to finally see
                    what's best for everyone.  

      And she says this with a kind of understanding that tells us
      she's speaking from experience.  Off Martin looking at her,
      tears in his eyes --  


      We're in a FIXED, LOW ANGLE, looking at the SUITCASE with
      the JAPANESE FLAG on the ID tag that belonged to the
      Businessman whom we met in Galway, Ireland.  It rests on one
      of those hotel suitcase stands.  In the b.g.  We SEE only a
      PARTIAL VIEW of the rest of the hotel room.  (We HOLD ON
      this FRAME for the entire scene.)

      Somewhere off FRAME we HEAR two people speaking.  One is a
      TEENAGE GIRL, whom we will come to know as MIYOKO.  (Italics
        = Japanese).  

                                      MIYOKO (O.S.)
                    Wow, Ireland, cool.  My friend Izumi
                    and I are like in a fan club for a
                    band from there...  The Morticians. 
                    You know them?

                                      JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN (O.S.)
                    No.

                                      MIYOKO (O.S.)
                    So... are you like just passing
                    through Tokyo?

                                      JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN (O.S.)
                    I live here.  Just don't feel like
                    going home yet.

                                      MIYOKO (O.S.)
                    That's cool.  So why don't you just
                    like go clean yourself up a little
                    first.                                                                                         37.

                                      JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN (O.S.)
                    Then maybe I can take that outfit
                    off of you.

      Miyoko GIGGLES.  And now we see a PAIR of LEGS cross the
      FRAME, the Businessman in dark slacks.  The bathroom door
      CLOSES.  A beat, then another PAIR of LEGS APPEAR.  These
      belong to MIYOKO, (17).  Although we only see her legs, we
      know that she's dressed in an iconic JAPANESE SCHOOL GIRL
      costume - high top socks, short pleated skirt, etc. 

      We SEE the back of her LEGS as she turns and we sense she's
      staring right at the suitcase.  She crosses quickly to it,
      leans over it so we just SEE the bottom of her chin.

      We HEAR the FAUCET turn on in the bathroom, allowing cover
      for Miyoko to unzip the bag and RIFLE through its contents. 
      She pulls out a PASSPORT WALLET, opens it and a couple hundred
      thousand YEN bills tumble out.  She scoops them up, tucks
      them down her blouse into her bra.

      She continues rifling through the suitcase.  A beat, then
      pulls out the CELL PHONE with the CARE BEARS STICKER on it. 
      She turns it over in her hand, examining it.  Then clasps it
      in her palm and races out of frame.  O.S., We HEAR the hotel
      door OPEN and CLOSE.  

      A beat.  Then the Businessman's LEGS emerge.  We sense that
      he's looking down at the ransacked suitcase.  We HOLD ON his
      legs, not knowing what to do.

                                      JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
                    Shit.


      In a WIDE SHOT, looking down a long corridor, Martin stands
      with Jake and Clea in this old, rambling building that feels
      more like a warm, funky school than an institution.  Martin
      holds the CARDBOARD BOX full of cell phones. 

      Jake has his BACKPACK on for his two week stay.  He stares
      at the floor.

                                      MARTIN
                    It's only for two weeks.  I'll see
                    you everyday.  I promise.

                                    CLEA
                    We have tons of fun things for you
                    to do here, Jake.  You'll see.                                                                                        38.

                                      MARTIN
                          (RE: the box of phones)
                    These'll keep him busy for a while. 
                    When he gets agitated try giving him
                    an Orange Fanta.  That usually calms
                    him down.  That and popcorn.  He'll
                    want to count all the kernels before
                    he eats it.

                                    CLEA
                    Give us twenty four hours before you
                    come back for the first visit.  

                                      MARTIN
                    You hear that, Jake.  I'll be back
                    tomorrow.  

      Clea extends her hand to Martin.  He shakes hands with her.  

                                    CLEA
                    You're a very brave man, Mr. Bohm. 

      Martin looks at Jake.  An obligatory hug is so painfully
      missing.  Martin and Clea both pick up on this awkwardness. 
      Clea smiles, then she and Jake turn to leave.  

      Martin watches them walk down the long corridor, wishing
      that Jake would turn to look back at him, if only for a split
      second.  He does not.  And they disappear around the corner.  

      Martin stares at the empty hallway after they're gone.  Then,
      something draws his attention to the floor in front of him.  

      It's Jake's NOTEBOOK.  Martin stares at it, wondering how
      and why it is here.  He bends down and picks it up.  Off
      Martin, wondering if there's meaning in this --


      CLOSE ON THE CARE BEARS PHONE

      as KATE'S VIDEO from the karaoke lounge plays on its small
      screen.  WIDEN to see the phone on the edge of a sink.

      Miyoko and her friend IZUMI (17), have nearly completed
      changing out of their schoolgirl uniforms and into full-on
      HARAJUKU costumes (Google it).  Izumi is staring at Kate's
      video, as Kate reaches her finale.  (Italics = Japanese)

                                      MIYOKO
                    I think she's like a huge star in
                    Ireland.  We could start the Tokyo
                    chapter of the Kate Graham fan club.                                                                                         39.

                                      IZUMI
                    Every fan club we join like dies
                    before we can even spread the word.  

                                      MIYOKO
                    We have to make sure the contents of
                    this phone gets someplace where
                    everyone can see it.  

                                      IZUMI
                    How?

                                      MIYOKO
                    You know Ando's brother, Takezo? 
                    Guess where he works?  He like
                    programs the jumbotron at Shibuya. 
                    And he like likes me.  

                                      IZUMI
                    Awesome.  Then who do we pass the
                    phone to next?

                                      MIYOKO
                          (looks at her watch)
                    I've got another client at 4:00.  
                          (smiles)
                    And he has to catch a plane to Dubai
                    in like three hours.  

                                      IZUMI
                    And what if someone there starts a
                    Kate Graham fan club?!

      The two girls GIGGLE at this.

                                      MIYOKO
                    Okay, here's what we do.  We get t-
                    shirts made like just like we did
                    for Magnetic Death and we --

      And as the girls go running quickly out of the bathroom -- 


      CLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

      The words  autism" and "cell phones" TYPE into a GOOGLE SEARCH
      FIELD.  A beat, then a GOOGLE RESULTS PAGE appears with a
      LIST of websites. 

      WIDEN to see Martin sitting at the computer at one of the
      empty airport gates, wearing his baggage handler uniform.                                                                                         40.

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN

      The CURSOR MOVES down the list and hovers over a website
      that says "PODOLSKY INSTITUTE".  We see the subheading
        "Electro-magnetism - microwaves and autism .

      Martin's eyes narrow with interest.  He CLICKS on the LINK. 
      A crudely made website appears, a nearly blank page with the
      words,  You have questions.  We have answers.   

      Under it, a YOUTUBE LINK to the Charlie Rose Show.  A
      distinguished looking BORIS PODOLSKY, 70, (think Andre
      Gregory) sits across the round table from CHARLIE ROSE in
      the iconic darkened studio. 

      Martin clicks on the LINK.  The YOUTUBE VIDEO begins --

                                      CHARLIE ROSE
                    You're saying the epidemic in autism
                    is all because of cellular technology?

                                      PODOLSKY
                    No, I'm saying, that cellular energy,
                      microwaves, electromagnetic radiation,
                    these hold the answers to a new and
                    higher state of consciousness for
                    mankind.  

      Charlie looks at him, incredulous.  

                                      PODOLSKY (CONT'D)
                    And these children who are
                      experiencing these connections are
                    here for a reason.  We need to learn
                    from them.   

      And with this bold pronouncement, the video FREEZES on
      Podolsky's cocky grin.  

      MARTIN 

      leans back, mesmerized by this.  He clicks back to the HOME
      PAGE, where the only other thing on the entire page is an
      address.  We PUSH IN on "Podolsky Institute, 318 West Tesla
      Street, Bronx, NY .  Off Martin staring at the number 318 --


      We're mid conversation.  Martin sits on the sofa in this
      cluttered little hovel.  Professor Podolsky is in the tiny
      kitchen.  We see him moving around in there from Martin's
      POV, opening the refrigerator and digging around as --

                                      PODOLSKY (O.S.)
                    Easiest way to think of it is that
                    he's a conduit for energy.  Like an
                      incandescent light bulb, 'cept living,
                    breathing flesh.  It's all in the
                    book.

                                      MARTIN
                    What book?                                                                                        42.

                                      PODOLSKY (O.S.)
                          (flash of anger)
                    The one those bastards wouldn't
                    publish!  Explains it all.  Human
                    life comes down to just
                      electromagnetic energy and
                      connections...

      Podolsky emerges from the kitchen and plops down a bag of
      pretzels and two ORANGE FANTAS.  Martin looks down at the
      soda in front of him like it's a rabbit that's been pulled
      out of a hat.

                                      PODOLSKY (CONT'D)
                    ...And there are those among us,
                    mostly kids, who are radars for this
                      connection...

                                      MARTIN
                    But my son doesn't even talk.

                                      PODOLSKY
                      Unnecessary.  An evolutionary speed
                    bump.  Like your pinky toe.  You
                    have to think of these kids as air
                    traffic controllers for
                      interconnectivity.  That's their
                    purpose.  

      Martin listens, unsure if this man is mad or a savior.

                                      PODOLSKY (CONT'D)
                    He pretty advanced with the numbers?

                                      MARTIN
                    Numbers?  Yeah, he has been his whole
                    life.  

      Martin shows Podolsky the notebook.  Podolsky flips through
      the pages.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                      I actually thought math might be my
                    ticket in with him.  When the interest
                    started I tried to teach him how to
                    add one plus one.  But he corrected
                    me.  Wrote one plus one equals three.  

                                      PODOLSKY
                    And what exactly is one plus one
                    supposed to equal, Mr. Bohm?

                                      MARTIN
                          (what?!)
                    Two.                                                                                        43.

                                      PODOLSKY
                    For you, maybe.  And maybe for
                    everyone else in the world except
                    for your son.  
                          (then)
                    For him, one and one equals three. 
                    And if you can let him teach you
                    that, you'll be at the center of the
                    universe with him.

      Podolsky suddenly stops at one of the pages in the notebook. 
      Something has caught his attention.

                                      PODOLSKY (CONT'D)
                    Has your son ever taken a math class?

                                      MARTIN
                    No.

                                      PODOLSKY
                    Had a tutor?

                                      MARTIN
                    I told you, he doesn't even talk.

                                      PODOLSKY
                    Read a math book?

                                      MARTIN
                    Never.

                                      PODOLSKY
                          (impressed)
                    Then he discovered the Fibonacci
                    sequence on his own. 

                                      MARTIN
                    The what?

                                      PODOLSKY
                    These numbers...

      He shows Martin a series of numbers in the notebook. 
          "8,5,3,2,1,1,0,1,1,2,3,5,8".

                                      PODOLSKY (CONT'D)
                    The patterns found in nature, over
                    and over again.  The curve of a wave,
                    the spiral of a shell, the segments
                    of a pineapple.  It's a mathematical
                    sequence discovered by a twelfth
                    century mathematician named Fibonacci.

      Podolsky leafs through a stack of papers, finds a PHOTO of a
      collage of patterns in nature - FLOWERS, SEGMENTS of FRUIT,                                                                                         44.

      SHELLS, GALAXIES, etc. (Among these images, we note the
      "spiral" shape that Jake created with the cell phones.)

                                      MARTIN
                    What does any of this have to do
                    with--?

                                      PODOLSKY
                    Your son sees these patterns. 
                      Everywhere.  It's all numbers to him --
                    The past, the present, the future. 
                    He sees how they're connected.

      Martin can't help but think about the lottery numbers...

                                      MARTIN
                    You're saying he can predict the
                    future?

                                      PODOLSKY
                    If the patterns lead him to that,
                    yes.

      Martin stands, starts to pace.

                                      PODOLSKY (CONT'D)
                    The universe is made up of precise
                    ratios, patterns.  All around us. 
                    You and I, we don't see them.  But
                    if we could...
                          (like he's seeing God)
                    ...Life would be magical beyond our
                    wildest dreams.  A symphony of numbers
                    and patterns, a quantum entanglement
                    of cause and effect where everything
                    and everyone reflects on each other
                    like facets of jewels strung together
                    in a giant net.  Every action, every
                    breath, every conscious thought
                      connected.  Imagine the unspeakable
                    beauty of the universe he sees.  No
                    wonder he doesn't talk.

                                      MARTIN
                    You're telling me my son sees all of
                    that?

                                      PODOLSKY
                          (ominously)
                    Mr. Bohm, your son... sees everything.  

      Off Martin, his world turning upside down -

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                        45.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Jake sits on the floor, TOYS scattered around him.  He ignores
      them all, writing numbers instead into a NEW NOTEBOOK.  Clea
      enters with two bags of POPCORN.  Sits down next to him. 
      Forces a smile and holds out one of the bags to him.  

                                    CLEA
                    Your dad said you like popcorn.  

      He doesn't look up at her, so she sets the bag down in front
      of him.  After a beat, Jake looks up at it.  

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    Go ahead.  You can eat it.

      Jake lifts the bag.  A beat, then dumps the popcorn out onto
      the floor.  He starts to SORT it into little PILES.  Two
      kernels in one pile, one in another, two, seven, four, etc.  

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    I see you're arranging them into
                    little piles there.  Can I count
                    those with you?

      He doesn't even look up at her.  She starts to count --

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    Let's see, there's two in that one
                    and one in that one and two there. 
                    Then seven, four, six, three...

      As she counts, he writes down the number in his notebook -
      212-746-3742.  She stares at the number curiously, then --

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    That's my mother's phone number... 
                    I haven't thought of that number in
                    years.

      No sooner does she say that when her cell phone RINGS,
      startling her.  She reaches into her pocket and pulls out
      her CELL PHONE and stares at it.  

      CLOSE ON THE PHONE'S SCREEN

      On the caller id - "212-746-3742"   

      Clea nearly drops the phone.  She turns and looks at Jake,
      who has now crossed to the wall and is standing by a CALENDAR. 
      It's open to the month of MARCH.                                                                                          46.

      He circles the number "18" and steps back.  Looks right at
      Clea with a beatific expression.  

      Clea stares at the circled number, and suddenly a realization
      hits her.  Torn between the incessant RINGING of her phone
      and what she's realizing from the calendar, she finally
      answers her phone numbly -- 

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    Mom...?

      We PRELAP the sacchariny sweet, cheerful, automated VOICE of --

                                      AUTOMATED JULIE (O.S.)
                          (recorded voice)
                    Hi, I'm Julie, your Amtrack
                      reservation assistant...

      WEDGED into the frame of a mirror.  WIDEN to see Ponytail in
      his bathroom, in front of the mirror looking at himself with
      a blank expression.  Nearby, the phone is on SPEAKER.

                                      AUTOMATED JULIE (O.S.)
                    Please say the name the of destination
                    you're traveling to.

      Ponytail reaches and wraps a hand around his ponytail.  Pulls
      it around his neck to the front.

      Ponytail lifts a PAIR of SCISSORS to his ponytail.

                      Louisville, Kentucky.  Okay.  Now,

      CUUUUTTT.  He SLICES the scissors through his thick ponytail. 
      And as the hair tumbles into the sink, we --


      Martin stands in the doorway of Jake's room, holding the
      notebook in his hand.  He looks down at the cell phones still
      arranged in a spiral on the floor.                                                                                          47.

      Martin flips through the pages of the notebook.  Comes to
      the last page, where the numbers correspond to the lottery
      ticket and the number 318.  

      Several of the numbers are CIRCLED, arrows pointing from one
      to the other.  Martin takes a pen and writes down the circled
      numbers in a sequence.  Sure enough, two of the numbers are
    3 and 18. 

      Then, an idea strikes him.  He divides the numbers by putting
      a "-" between the grouping.  Looks at it.  It's a telephone
      number.  A 212 number.  As he stares at the telephone number --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      A COMPUTER SCREEN - A MOMENT LATER

      A "REVERSE DIRECTORY" website appears.  The telephone number
      we just saw TYPES OUT into the search field.  

      WIDEN to find Martin working on his LAPTOP at the kitchen
      table.  The FILE on the Frank Muller case still scattered
      around him.  He types away.  Hits enter.  A beat, then an
      ADDRESS comes up on the screen.  He CLICKS on it and up pops --

      A GOOGLE MAP IMAGE with a PIN stuck in it, designating the
      exact location.  It's midtown Manhattan.  East 42nd St.

                                      MARTIN
                    Grand Central station.

      He stares at the image.  Then reaches for the phone.  Dials
      the number... It RINGS and RINGS, but no one answers.

      He lowers the phone, stares off.  His gaze lands on the papers
      from the Muller file.  He spots something protruding from
      beneath a sheet of paper -- Pulls it out.  It's a torn TICKET
      STUB.  The kind you'd get at a dry cleaners or a pawnshop. 
      He stares at it.  The ticket number is "318".  Holy shit.  

      Just as BANG, BANG, BANG, an incessant KNOCK at the door.

      THE FRONT DOOR - SECONDS LATER

      swings it open, revealing --

      CLEA - an odd look on her face.  Martin looks at her confused. 
      Before he can ask her what she's doing here --

                                    CLEA
                    318.  
                          (off his look)
                    It's today's date.  

      Martin stares at her.  Then the realization takes hold.                                                                                          48.

                                      MARTIN
                    March 18th.  

                                    CLEA
                    I thought I owed it to you to tell
                    you I figured it out.  

      Martin's mind races as he tries to make sense of this.

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    This doesn't change anything.  Just
                    wanted you to know. 

      She turns to leave.  He calls after her --

                                      MARTIN
                    You came all the way here to tell me
                    that?  You could've called. 

                                    CLEA
                          (stops, doesn't turn)
                    I know.

      There's something she's not telling him.  She finally turns.  

                                    CLEA (CONT'D)
                    The numbers aren't just a coincidence,
                    are they?

                                      MARTIN
                    No.  None of it is.  

                                    CLEA
                    He predicted a call from my mother. 
                    I hadn't spoken to her in eight years. 
                    How is that possible?

                                      MARTIN
                    He sees things.  Connections.  The
                    past, the present, the future...  

                                    CLEA
                    The future?  That's impossible...
                    Isn't it?

                                      MARTIN
                    He's trying to tell us about
                      something.  

                                    CLEA
                    But... what?  Why?

                                      MARTIN
                    To stop it from happening.  Or make
                    it happen.  I don't know.                                                                                          49.

      Martin holds up the torn PAWNSHOP TICKET.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    The pawnshop ticket from the Muller
                    case.  It's all connected somehow. 
                    And whatever it is, it happens today,
                    March 18th.  
                          (realizing)
                    At... Grand Central station.  He
                    wrote down this phone number.  I
                    traced it to a phone there.  It's
                    got something to do with that phone. 
                    In...
                          (looks at his watch)
                    ...Twenty two minutes from now.  At
                    3:18.  

                                    CLEA
                    Twenty two minutes?

                                      MARTIN
                    You've got a car, right?

      Off Clea nodding her head, knowing this is insane, but
      completely sucked into it nonetheless --


      A BURLAP BAG dumps FORTY CELL PHONES onto a table under a
      HARSH bare bulb of a hanging lamp.  A PAIR OF HANDS sorts
      through them and we SEE that -- 

      The CARE BEARS PHONE is among them.  ADJUST to find we're in
      a dingy basement.  It's dark, but we see the silhouettes of
      THREE MEN.  Two of them wear Jalabiyas and Muslim head gear. 
      The other has on an OAKLAND RAIDERS JERSEY.  

      We cannot make out faces, but we do make out the MIRRORED
      RAY BANS on one of them, as we realize where we've seen these
      guys before.  The three men speak in ARABIC --

                                    RAY BANS
                    DCI codes?

                                      RAIDERS JERSEY
                      Untraceable?

                                    RAY BANS
                    Sim cards?  Batteries?  

                                      RAIDERS JERSEY
                    All of them.  Freshly charged. 

      Ray Bans sorts through the phones.  Picks up the CARE BEARS
      phone and accidentally presses a button on the keypad.                                                                                          50.

      The screen suddenly COMES TO LIFE with a VIDEO set to the
      SONG from Kate's performance at the karaoke lounge.  It's a
      SERIES of QUICK CUTS of DIFFERENT people, one after another
      after another.  All standing in the same place, SHIBUYA,
      Tokyo, wearing the same t-shirt with "Kate Graham Fan Club"
      written in big block letters on the front.  

      The QUICK CUTS has the effect of a TIME LAPSE sequence. 
      It's got a playful, MUSIC VIDEO quality to it.  It ends with
      Miyoko and Izumi speaking in Japanese into the CAMERA.  They
      GIGGLE and wave good bye and the video CLICKS OFF.

      Ray Bans turns to the other two men, with a WTF expression --


      Clea drives, Martin in the passenger seat.

                                    CLEA
                    If we find this phone there... what
                    then?

                                      MARTIN
                    I don't know.  Wait for a call
                    maybe...

                                    CLEA
                    Tell me we're not both completely
                    insane.

                                      MARTIN
                    You're asking the wrong guy.  Turn
                    here on 22nd!

                                    CLEA
                    22nd?  Shouldn't I take 24th?

                                      MARTIN
                      Construction on 24th.  Turn right
                    here!

      OUTSIDE THE CAR

      SCREECH, tires SQUEAL as the rickety Saab FISHTAILS around
      the corner.

      FROM ABOVE 22ND STREET

      the traffic is like a parking lot.  The Saab SKIDS to a stop,
      a BUS and four CARS pull into place behind them, blocking
      them in.                                                                                        51.

      IN THE CAR

                                    CLEA
                    22nd, huh?  Any other great ideas?

      THE SAAB'S DOORS

      fly open and Clea and Martin scramble out and take off
      SPRINTING.  We CRANE UP as they weave in and out of the
      deadlocked traffic and take off up the sidewalk.

                                      MARTIN
                    The A train!

      They disappear down a subway station.


      The massive CLOCK reads "3:16".  We TILT DOWN to find Martin
      and Clea running across the large main hall, trying to decide
      where to look first.  They stop, turn in all directions. 

      AT THE INFORMATION BOOTH

      Martin SLIDES to the counter, GASPING for breath.  Slaps
      down the scrap of paper with phone number on it, shoves it
      to the INFORMATION WOMAN behind the counter.

                                      MARTIN
                    Where in the station would I find
                    the phone that has this number?  

      The Information Woman slowly inspects the paper.

                                      INFORMATION WOMAN
                    I don't recognize it.

                                    CLEA
                    It's here at Grand Central station!  

                                      INFORMATION WOMAN
                    All official numbers start with a
                    785 prefix.  But we got lots of shops
                    and restaurants here.  You might
                    wanna check those.

      Martin and Clea look at each desperately.  They don't have
      time for that!  Then Martin looks up at the giant clock. 
      The SECOND HAND CLICKS to 3:17.  Shit.  

                                      MARTIN
                    You go that way!  I'll go this way!

      He takes off running, leaving Clea looking in all directions.                                                                                          52.

      Martin SPRINTS through the crowd, swimming upstream, bumping
      into COMMUTERS, desperately trying to look over the oncoming
      horde.  He stops.  Frantic.  Which way to go?  Then, through
      a gap in the passing heads of the commuters he sees --

      A PAY PHONE - WAY OFF IN THE DISTANCE

      at the end of a the LONG TRAIN TUNNELS, fifty yards away. 
      Martin stares, transfixed.  That's it!  Suddenly, a MAN in a
      dark suit, his back to us, steps up to make a phone call.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    NO!

      IN THE TUNNEL 

      Martin sprints towards the phone - as he approaches --

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    S'cuse me.  I need that phone!  I'm
                    waiting for a call.

      The Man ignores him and doesn't turn around for the following
      exchange, so we DO NOT see his face.  Martin cranes his neck
      to look at the phone's number above the keypad - sure enough,
      it's the right number!! 

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Sir, I really need the phone.

      The Man ignores him.  Martin paces as the Man continues to
      talk on the phone.  Martin fumes.  He looks up at the giant
      clock just as CLICK, the second hand moves to 3:18.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Look, man, you've gotta get off the
                    phone right now!

      The Man, his back still to us, lifts his index finger up,
      the universal "just a sec" sign.  Martin, furious now, grabs
      the Man by shoulder.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    You don't understand!  I have to use
                    this phone!!

      And he spins the Man around, revealing PONYTAIL - except he
      no longer has a ponytail, and he's clean shaven.

      Martin stares at him, as he suddenly recognizes him.  Ponytail
      takes even less time.

                                      PONYTAIL
                    YOU!  What the fuck's your problem?!                                                                                         53.

      And WHAM!  He hauls off and COLDCOCKS Martin, who staggers
      back for a moment, then regains his footing and CHARGES,
      tackling Ponytail and SLAMMING him against the wall.   

      The two men ROLL to the ground in an ugly, awkward mano a
      mano.  A small CROWD forms and suddenly a burly PORT AUTHORITY
      COP pushes his way angrily through the crowd.  

                                    COP
                    Alright, that's it!  Break it up! 
                    Break it up!

      The big Cop bodily hoists both Martin and Ponytail off the
      floor.  Slams them against the wall.

                      PONYTAILMARTIN
        He started it.He was hogging the phone!

                                    COP
                    Fine, it'll all go in the report. 
                    Now let's go.

      Martin grabs onto the wall to keep himself from being dragged.

                                      MARTIN
                    I can't!  I'm waiting for a phone
                    call! 

                                      PONYTAIL
                    I've got a train to catch!

                                    COP
                    Sorry.  Shoulda thought of that before
                    you started a fist fight on Port
                    Authority property.

                                      PONYTAIL
                          (sneers at Martin)
                    Thanks a lot, asshole.

      Off Martin staring back at the phone as he's pulled away --


      ON THE TV

      An overly perky WEATHER GIRL delivers the bad news of the
      worst STORM of the year hitting the tri-state area.  We PULL
      BACK to find Martin slumped on the sofa in the darkened loft. 
      He has a GLASS of SCOTCH resting on the armrest.  

      He takes a sip, then sets the glass down clumsily on top of
      the FILE of the Frank Muller case.  The glass tips and spills
      onto it.  

      Martin sits up quickly, pissed.  Stands up and carries the
      dripping file to the sink.  Shakes the liquid out into the
      sink, then stares at the soaked file.                                                                                          57.

      In a fit of frustration and anger, he opens the garbage drawer
      under the cabinet and tosses the file into the trash.

      As he turns back to head for the couch, he passes the PHONE
      on the counter.  There's a BLINKING RED LIGHT on it.  

      He stops.  Looks at it.  Presses the button on the phone.  

                                      MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          (on recorder)
                    Mr. Bohm, my name is Randall Burke. 
                    I was a fireman with Ladder Company
                    318.  On September 11th, 2001 I was
                    on the 87th floor of the north tower
                    of the World Trade Center.  I found
                    a woman alive, barely conscious. 
                    She was bleeding pretty bad... It
                    was your wife, Emily.  

      Martin stares at the phone in disbelief as in the b.g.  We
      can HEAR Martin's VOICE on the recording --

                                      MARTIN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Sir, I really have to use that phone!

      And we now realize who this is.  So does Martin. 

                                      PONTAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    I carried her down 31 flights of
                    stairs.  The smoke was everywhere
                    and I couldn't see, I couldn't
                    breathe.  I just couldn't carry her
                    any farther.  I set her down, checked
                    her pulse and I told myself she was
                    already dead.  But the truth is, I
                    don't really know if she was.  I've
                    been thinking about her for ten years,
                    and...  
                          (beat)
                    ...I have some money now I want to
                    give to you.  It's a lot of money...

      Again, we HEAR Martin's VOICE interrupt --

                                      MARTIN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Look, man, you've gotta get off the
                    phone right now!

      We HEAR a commotion, then CLICK, the phone HANGS UP. 

      Martin is stunned by this.  He sobers up quick as, O.S. on
      the news we HEAR --                                                                                        58.

                                      NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                    Sixteen children and one bus driver
                    owe their lives to one man tonight. 
                    Retired fireman Randall Burke...

      Hearing this, Martin whips around to look back at the TV.

      ON TV

      a PHOTO of a younger RANDALL BURKE (Ponytail) in a fireman's
      uniform.  

                                      NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)
                    ...Pulled the children from a burning
                    bus that had rolled into a ravine
                    below the Triborough bridge.  

      Martin, wide eyed, walks over to the TV and stares as --

      The image on TV switches to a LIVE FEED of the CRASH SITE. 
      It's pouring RAIN as a REPORTER stands in the swirling POLICE
      LIGHTS.  In the b.g., a BUS lies tipped on its side, CHARRED
      from fire.

                                      REPORTER
                    Mr. Burke, you are quite a hero
                    indeed.  In your own words, can you
                    tell us what happened?

      The CAMERA PANS to Ponytail.  He looks into the CAMERA self
        consciously.  

                                      PONTAIL
                    Just in the right place at the right
                    time, I guess.  I got to it before
                    the fire got too bad and just started
                    pulling kids out and--  

      He suddenly stops talking and looks off, oddly.  The Reporter
      looks uncomfortable.

                                      REPORTER
                    Mr. Burke are you alright?

                                      PONTAIL
                    I've played the same lotto numbers
                    every week for 10 years.  9, 11,
                    2001, 87th floor, 31 flights of
                    stairs.
                          (snaps out of it)
                    I guess if I hadn't missed my train
                    today, I never would've been walking
                    here.  It's kinda amazing how things
                    work out sometimes, isn't it?                                                                                         59.

                                      REPORTER
                          (whoa...)
                    I'm sorry, what were you saying about
                    the lotto numbers?

      But Ponytail just turns and walks away.

                                      REPORTER (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Burke!  Those are the winning
                    numbers!

      We PUSH IN on Martin, as the implications of this whole crazy
      day dawns on him like a ton of bricks.  And suddenly, he
      reacts, snapping out of it.  He grabs his keys and races out
      the door. 


      WE CRANE UP OVER a sea of CUBICLES, each containing dreary
      OFFICE DRONES with a headset on, speaking to customers, past
      NILES, speaking animatedly with a customer.  We ARRIVE at --

      KATE'S CUBICLE

      to FIND Kate, looking bored with her life --

                                    KATE
                    Your account has been verified.  How
                    may I help you, Mr. Plimpton?   

      INTERCUT WITH Simon --

                                      SIMON
                    I've been trying to find my phone
                    for three days, and now I'm getting
                      a recorded message.  Something about
                    an invalid territory.  

                                    KATE
                    Certain territories are blocked to
                    our customers, usually for security
                    reasons.  If your phone's in one of
                    these areas, I'm afraid I won't be
                    able help you.                                                                                        60.

      Simon sighs.  Leans back against the wall.  In the b.g., 

      MIYOKO AND IZUMI

      stand on the curb, staring up at the --

      GIANT JUMBOTRON 

      as it comes to life with the VIDEO of Kate singing at the
      Karaoke lounge.  It's there for all of Tokyo to see, fifty
      feet high.  Simon, of course, is completely unaware of the
      serendipity of this.  

                                    KATE (CONT'D)
                    Maybe it's time for you to get a new
                    phone.

                                      SIMON
                          (snaps, annoyed)
                    I got a new phone!  But I need what's
                    in that phone.  Could you GPS it, or
                    just call the number for me?  

      Kate gives an annoyed look.

                                    KATE
                    I could, but we're not supposed to
                    do that. 

                                      SIMON
                    There's a photo in the phone.  And I
                    need to see it.  I can't really
                    explain other than... It's someone I
                    won't ever see again... So please. 
                    You sound like a very nice person. 
                    You're Irish, right?  

                                    KATE
                    Sir, I really am not suppo--  

                                      SIMON
                    I come to Ireland a couple times a
                    year.  I sell restaurant supplies
                    and I always enjoy the Irish, such
                    friendly people.  
                          (off her silence)
                    Look... I know it's a long shot, but
                    could you just do this for me? 

      Kate sighs --

                                    KATE
                    I'll have to put you on hold.                                                                                        61.

      She presses a couple of buttons on the counsel of her phone
      and dials the number on the account --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Martin barrels through the doors and sprints down the long
      corridor, as Clea comes rushing out of the office. 

                                      MARTIN
                    The numbers.  They were right!  

                                    CLEA
                    Oh, thank god you're here.  I've
                    been trying to call you.

                                      MARTIN
                          (on a roll)
                    Jake predicted it all, the bus, the
                    kids, 318, the lottery, everything! 

                                    CLEA
                    He's gone!

      This finally stops him.

                                      MARTIN
                    What?

                                    CLEA
                    Jake.  He's gone.  I went to check
                    on him before I left and he was gone. 
                    I thought maybe he'd tried to go
                    back home.  I was just going to start
                    driving around to look for him.   

      Martin thinks for a beat, then --

                                      MARTIN
                    He's not going home.                                                                                        65.

                                    CLEA
                    What?  How do you know?

      But Martin has already turned around and started running --

                                      MARTIN
                    I just do!

      Clea, confused, runs after him.


      The CAMERA FLOATS OVER Kate standing over Niles' shoulder
      looking at a computer screen.  On the screen, "The Kate Graham
      Fan Club".  On it, a VIDEO of Kate's performance on the 50
      foot screen in Shibuya.

                    thread around our ankle...

      three men positioning a NEW OVEN into place where the old
      used to be.

                    ...And attached it to all of the
                    people whose lives we are destined
                    to touch...
