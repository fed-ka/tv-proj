                                   Network Draft                                          PARENTHOOD


      INT. SARAH S TRENTON, N.J. APARTMENT - DAY

        A CRAPHOLE.  MOVING BOXES everywhere.  Two indifferent 
        MOVING MEN struggle to move a large CABINET out the front 
        door.  SMASH!  Into the doorway--

        SARAH BRAVERMAN (37), pretty but worn and constantly on 
      edge from years of single parenting, follows them out to 
        the hallway stairs. 

                                        SARAH
                      Like I said it s been in the family for 
                      years, are you sure--

                                        MOVER ONE
                      Lady, we got it.

                                        SARAH
                      --Well, I have to tell you, I don t like 
                      that angle.  Maybe if we just had a 
                      little strategy session here--

                                        MOVER TWO
                      Whoa, whoa, whoa--

        SLAM!  Into the metal railing.

                                        SARAH
                      Okay, okay.  I m not going to watch this--

      MOVE with Sarah as she heads into her apartment where 
      DREW (12) at that awkward pre-teen period of having 
        recently discovered his penis, plays Nintendo.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      Drew, could you pretend to help?  Amber, 
                      we are moving in a half hour, I do not 
                      want to hit that traffic... Amber!

        She flings open the door to Amber s room and stops cold.  
        EMPTY!  The window leading to the fire escape is open 
        wide.  Sarah just stares, dumbfounded.  Then recovers. 
        Smiles.  She s isn t going to let this get to her.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                              (all is well)
                      Drew, sweetie, we have an extra stop to 
                      make.

                                                                              CUT TO:        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   2.



      EXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAY - MOVING

        BEAUTY SHOTS.  Italian delis, the Schuylkill River, 
        Rittenhouse square, row houses, a pick up basketball 
        game.  Neighborhoods.  This is where our show is going to 
        live, and it s not a bad place to be.  We land on a 
        humble turn of the century house on a middle-class 
        street, the kind where two houses share one driveway with 
        old basketball hoops mounted on the garages.  WE PRELAP:

                                        ADAM S VOICE
                      I don t want you to be afraid to get in 
                      there and take your cuts.


      INT. ADAM & KRISTINA S HOUSE - DAY

        Where we find ADAM BRAVERMAN (41).  Beneath this affable, 
        humane, good looking guy there is an insane lunatic, 
        driven beyond reason to have a normal, happy family.  
        Adam, dressed in his coach s jacket and baseball cap, 
        kneels next to his son, adjusting his uniform which is a 
        little askew as usual.  MAX (8) is sweet, quirky, a bit 
         off,  as Adam continues.

                                        ADAM
                      This season is all about learning.  
                      Taking swings.  Going for it.  If you 
                      strike out, you strike out.  I want to 
                      see you take your cuts.  Sound good?

        Max looks at Adam and says simply.

                                        MAX
                      Do I have to go?

                                        ADAM
                      Max, you don t have to go.  This is not a 
                      have to.  This is a want to.

                                        MAX
                      Do I have to want to?

        KRISTINA (37), Adam's pretty, wise and quietly forceful 
        wife, who loves her husband and kids, but would also love 
      at some point to get her life back, witnesses this.  A 
      look is shared between Adam and Kristina -- one that says 
        they re both concerned about this little boy.  

        HADDIE (15), their pretty, good-girl daughter walks by on 
        her way out, cell phone in one hand, iPod in the other. 

                                        HADDIE
                      Love you, Mom, love you dad.  Bye.          "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   3.



                                        ADAM
                      I thought you were coming with us to the 
                      game.

                                        HADDIE
                      I talked to Mom like five days ago.  

        Haddie leaves.

                                        ADAM
                      She should be coming with us.  Family 
                      time.

                                        KRISTINA
                      Honey, she s fifteen.  

                                        ADAM
                      You realize in three years she ll be in 
                      college.  After that we will never see 
                      our daughter again.  We have a hundred 
                      and fifty weekends left and then it s 
                      game over.

                                        KRISTINA
                      That s such a healthy perspective.

        Max comes out in his uniform, still looking slightly 
        disheveled -- shirt half untucked, etc.  Adam looks at 
        Max with a big smile.

                                        ADAM
                      You look great.  The glove goes on the 
                      other hand.  There you go.  This is gonna 
                      be fun.


        INT./EXT. JOEL & JULIA S HOUSE - DAY

        JULIA BRAVERMAN (32) is beautiful, successful smart, even 
      in her sweats and a ponytail she could still do a 
        magazine shoot.  She has meticulously packed the back of 
        their SUV-hybrid with picnic lunch, frisbee, picnic 
        blankets, etc.  Her angelic looking daughter SYDNEY (5)  
        comes out, still sleepy eyed, and Julia kisses her all 
      over her body.

                                        JULIA
                      You re up.  Yum, yum, yum, yum, I think 
                      I m going to eat you for lunch.

                                        SYDNEY

      JOEL (early 30s), Sydney's startling good looking stay-at-
        home-dad husband walks out--

                                        JOEL
                              (re: the packed car)
                      What s this?

                                        JULIA
                      I know I ve been working so much this 
                      week, but this weekend, it s just the 
                      three of us.  I m talking frisbee.  I m 
                      talking kids concert in the park.  I m 
                      talking crazy ass bonding. 
                              (off their stares)
                      What?

                                        JOEL
                      It s Joey P s birthday party at Chuck E 
                      Cheese this morning.  Her entire class is 
                      going.

                                        JULIA
                      That s today?  Oh no.  Do we really want 
                      to eat pizza at ten in the morning?  I 
                      made frittatas.

                                        SYDNEY
                      They have unlimited tokens, Mom.  
                      Unlimited.  Like a google.  More than a 
                      google.  Like infinity tokens.

        Julia looks at the picnic lunch she just worked for hours 
        preparing.  Then at Sydney s pleading eyes, Julia does 
      what is harder for her than most people, switch gears.  
        She reaches for a large bottle of Purell and puts on a 
        brave smile--

                                        JULIA
                      Okay.  It s Chucky E Cheese!

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY

        The  Mackabee Hardware Cubs  take the field and Adam 
        excitedly yells out encouraging words from his head coach 
        position in the dugout.

                                        ADAM
                      Jordan take a few steps over toward 
                      second.  Gabriel, five steps in.

        Max is playing second base.  His feet are crossed.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   5.



                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Max, let s uncross those feet. 

        The pitch.  Ground ball to second base!  Adam screams 
      out.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Max.  Get in front of it.  Gobble it up.  

        The ball goes right through Max s legs into right field.  
        A COMMUNAL groan from the field and even some of the 
        parents.  Adam winces, exchanges a pained looked with 
        Kristina, then recovers.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      That s okay.  That s okay, pal.  You ll 
                      get the next one.

      Adam takes out his cell, hits speed dial.  A GROGGY VOICE 
        picks up.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Where the hell are you?  The game 
                      started.  You re my assistant coach.  I 
                      need you here, jackass.

        youngest of four he has made a life out of falling 
        through the cracks.  He s whispers on the phone because 
      he is laying next to a mostly naked KATIE (33), his long 
      time on again off again girlfriend.  

                                        CROSBY
                      I can t really talk right now.

                                        ADAM
                      What do you mean you can t talk?  Are you 
                      with someone?  Katie?  Are you back with 
                      Katie?  Did you have make up sex?

        Crosby rises and heads to the kitchen.

                                        CROSBY
                      You re pathetic.

                      I m walking out the door.

        Crosby hangs up and reaches into the freezer and grabs 
        the coffee.  He stops, seeing something odd:

      He reaches in and takes out a small vial with a medical

      INT. TRENTON N.J. APARTMENT IN INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - DAY

        A door bursts open and Sarah, Drew in tow, storm in the 
        apartment where she finds her daughter AMBER (16), 
          provocatively dressed, with an attitude to match.  She s 
      with DAMIEN (19), her shirtless, tattooed musician 
        boyfriend.  

                                        AMBER
                        Philadelphia is a living hell, Mom.  I m 
                      not moving there.  I m moving in with 
                      Damien.  We ve decided, right Damien?

                                        DAMIEN
                              (not convincing)
                      Uh-huh.

                                        SARAH
                      Damien, I would like to speak to my 
                      daughter, could you give us a moment?  
                      Perhaps, you could use the time to put on 
                      a shirt. 

                                        AMBER
                      Stay right there, Damien. Don t let her 
                      scare you.  She s all bark and no bite.

        Sarah and Amber stare down.  Then, as Sarah lunges toward 
        Amber, we,

                      Of course you know them.  Don t be 
                      ridiculous.  I am telling you this is

                      around for us.  Who s turn is it to push?

                                        DREW
                      Hers.

      Drew gets into the driver s seat as Amber and Sarah get 
      in the back of the car and start pushing.

                                        AMBER
                      You couldn t park going downhill?

        Mayhem!  Packed with kids on sugar and adrenalin highs.  
        Julia and Joel walk through as one mom after another 
        smile and wave to Joel.  Apparently, he s the best thing 
      to happen to the afternoon pick-up line in awhile.

                      touch you?

        Julia notices RACQUEL (early 30s) enter with her adopted 
        Chinese daughter HARMONY (5).  Racquel has the look of a 
      free spirited artist -- long sexy unkempt hair, jeans 
        covered with paint.  She s Julia s diametric opposite.  
        Julia s face falls as Sydney literally jumps into 
        Racquel s arms.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   8.

                      Oh, how cute.

        Racquel walks up--

                      Hey, Joelskies.  Oh my God, finally.  You 
                      must be Julia.  Joel has told me so much

      EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY

        QUICK CUTS:

        --Boom! MAX strikes out.

        --Bam! MAX drops a fly ball in right field.

        --Wham! The other team hits a ground ball home run and 
        celebrate at home plate.

        RESUME...

        OUR TEAM S having a late inning rally.  Crosby has now 
        arrived, and stands next to Joel, holding the score nook.  
        A batter walks, loading the bases.  

                                        ADAM
                      Okay, we re only down by seven!  We can 
                      do this.

        But the energy in the dugout dies as Max steps out of the 
        dugout holding a bat in his hands. 

                                        TEAMMATE
                      Oh, no, Max is up.  We might as well go 
                      home.

                                        ADAM
                      Hey!  Not cool.

      Adam walks up to Max, who heard this, and kneels next to 
      him.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   10.



                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Okay, Max, I know I said to swing away, 
                      but remember a walk s as good as a hit.  

        Max looks at Adam, he looks like he s on the verge of 
        tears.

                                        MAX
                      Can t someone else hit?

                                        ADAM
                      What?

                                        MAX
                      Please.  I suck.  I m going to strike 
                      out.  Everyone s going to hate me.

                                        ADAM
                      Listen to me.  Okay?  It doesn t matter 
                      whether you get a hit or not.  The game s 
                      all about having fun.

                                        MAX
                      I m not having any fun.

      Adam doesn t have a comeback for this.

                                        ADAM
                      Just try your best, pal.

        Max reluctantly walks to the plate.  

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Alright, Max.  Let s bring it, baby.  
                      Bend your knees.  Not that much.  Bat 
                      back.  Elbow up.

        The PITCHER winds, delivers.  SWOOSH!  Strike one.

                                        CROSBY
                      That kid can t be eight.  Did you see 
                      that pitch?

                                        ADAM
                      I saw it.

        The Pitcher winds.  WOOSH!  Strike two!

                                        CROSBY
                      What did they do, bring him in from the 
                      Dominican Republic?      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   11.



                                        ADAM
                      Any time you want to shut up would be 
                      great.  Okay, Max, gotta cover the plate 
                      now, buddy.  Swing at anything close.

        The Pitcher delivers.  And Max swings and CONNECTS!  
        Well, barely.  The ball goes about a foot and a half and 
        stops.  In fair territory.  Shocked, Max just stands 
        there.  Then like in a dream ADAM starts screaming: 

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      RUN!  RUN MAX RUN!

        Max finally breaks for first.  Picks up speed.  The big 
        bruiser of a CATCHER runs for the ball.  Picks it up.  
        Throws to first.  The ball and Max get there at almost 
        the exact same moment.  The UMPIRE yells,  OUT!   

        All goes silent.  HOLD ON Adam.  Frozen.  No, it can't 
        be.  He couldn't possibly have made that call.  And then 
        suddenly something comes over Adam, something primal, 
        something he isn't in control of.

      WE MOVE WITH ADAM as he marches ONTO THE FIELD toward the 
        Umpire and COMPLETELY FUCKING LOSES IT.  

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Are you kidding me?  He was safe.  What 
                      the hell is wrong with you?  You can t do 
                      that, you can t take that away from him.  
                      No way.  

                                        UMPIRE
                      Stand back, Coach.

                                        ADAM
                      No, I m not going to stand back.  

        And as Adam s anger begins to build the dialogue drops 
        out giving way to score.  Adam gets up close, arguing 
      nose to nose with the Umpire, like it were the major 
        leagues.  Kristina watches, shocked.  As does Max.  
        Crosby tries to calm Adam down.  Both teams stand in the 
        dugout stare at the crazy man, as do all the parents.  
        Finally, Adam kicks dirt at the Umpire and the Ump, with 
        a grand gesture, throws him out of the game.

      In a wide shot, Adam walks across the field toward the 
        parking lot.  

                                                                            BLACKOUT:

      EXT. ZEEK & CAMILLE S - DAY

        Sarah s Volvo with a U-Haul trailer pulls to a stop in 
        front of her childhood home -- the least kept up house on 
        the block.  Sarah honks the horn to indicate their 
        arrival and a gaggle of Bravermans cascade out through 
        the front door to greet them.  This is everyone we ve 
        already met (Adam, Kristina, Haddie, Max, Julia, Joel, 
        Sydney, Crosby) and CAMILLE (60s) winning, elegant, 
        sarcastic from years of marriage.  AND last but not least 
      ZEEK (60s) Vietnam vet, turned hippie, turned actor, 
        turned entrepreneur, embraces Sarah, his favorite -- the 
        complicated one, the one who he feels most resembles

                      trying to end the game early so he could 
                      get to the Phillies game.  It s

      Adam looks through the kitchen window exchanging a

        Where she is set up to sleep.  She stops to look at 
        Zeek's fondest memories -- he as a soldier, an actor, 
      with all his children.  Sarah smiles sadly.  She reaches 
      into the small middle drawer in his desk and looks 
        around, finds a scissor, cuts off a tag on her pajamas.  
        She puts the scissor back, is about to close the drawer 
      when she notices something disturbing--

        Max comes in dressed for school, which in his case means 
      he is in full pirate regalia.  Haddie looks at her 
        parents to see what they re going to say.

      Adam puts the eggs on a plate in front of him.  Max 
        shakes some salt and pepper on them, takes a forkful, 
      puts them in his mouth, starts to chew, and then spits 
      them out all over the table.

        All the chaos of a public high school at peak lunch hour.  
        Amber stands there pathetically in her provocative 
        clothes holding a sad looking bowl of turkey chili on her 
      tray and scopes the place out.  Just what she thought.  
        She s completely alone.  She takes a seat on her own.  

        ANGLE ON HADDIE a few tables over, seeing Amber.  She s 
      with a bunch of girlfriends.  They re all pretty enough 
      to not seem like dorks, but too well behaved to be 
        considered cool.  Amber notices Haddie whispering 
        something to her friends, and they all look over to 
        Amber.  Amber smiles back, annoyed.  Haddie rises and 
        walks over to Amber.

      grad named GABRIEL (early 30s), Ms. A, and the school 
        counselor DR. BARBARA SCHACHTER (50s), the one person who 
        looks like a genuine adult here.

                                        KRISTINA
                      I just can t believe Max would do that.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   27.



                                        ADAM
                      He must have been taunted.

                                        GABRIEL
                      And we will definitely deal with Amos as 
                      well, but right now, we really want to 
                      focus on Max.

        Adam s body language shows he s not very happy with this.

                                        MRS. SCHACHTER
                      Kristina.  Adam.  Often when we see these 
                      kinds of behaviors, the child is telling 
                      us something.  That he has a lot of 
                      anxiety, that he doesn t feel safe.

                                        ADAM
                      Aren t we over-analyzing this a little?  
                      Maybe if we didn t let him come to school 
                      in a pirate costume he d fit in a little 
                      better.  

                                        KRISTINA
                                (touches a nerve)
                      We all decided that we were going to 
                      monitor the pirate situation--

                                        ADAM
                      No, everyone else decided, and now he s 
                      getting picked on, which is exactly what 
                      I thought would happen.

                                        GABRIEL
                      There s really no reason to cast blame--

                                        ADAM
                      You indulge him.  The pirate uniform.  
                      The eggs from the orange pan.  
                              (to Dr. Schachter)
                      She nursed him until he was two--

                                        KRISTINA
                      Adam!

                                        GABRIEL
                      Guys, if we could just stay on topic?  I 
                      think what we re trying to say here is 
                      we re not sure Sullivan Elementary is the 
                      right fit for Max.

      This gets Adam and Kristina s attention.  They are 
        completely flabbergasted, rejected.      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   28.



                                        KRISTINA
                      What?

                                        GABRIEL
                      He may need an environment where he gets 
                      more support.

        Kristina and Adam look at the room, suddenly the whole 
        dynamic has shifted as they realize this was the purpose 
        for this whole meeting.

                                        ADAM
                      Are you giving us the boot?  Are we 
                      getting shitcanned?

                                        KRISTINA
                      Adam.  For God s sake.
                                (then)
                      Are we?

                                        GABRIEL
                      I think we need more information.  We d 
                      like you to bring Max in for educational 
                      testing.

        Kristina and Adam stare at them, barely able to process 
      this news.


      INT. VINNIE S PIZZA - NIGHT

          A godforsaken dump.  Amber hangs out with Haddie and her 
        buds, GEORGIA and STELLA, and while they re all dorks, 
        they re sort of nice, and Amber is getting into the 
        fantasy of this more innocent life. 

                                        AMBER
                      This pizza sucks.

                                        GEORGIA
                      We know.

                                        AMBER
                      So are you just here to gawk at those 
                      guys?

        Amber refers to a group of TEENAGE BOYS most notably EVAN 
      at another table.

                                        GEORGIA
                      Haddie s totally in love with Evan.      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   29.



                                        AMBER
                      Which one is he?  The Kurt Cobain 
                      throwback or the Jo-bro wannabe.

                                        STELLA
                      The latter.

                                        HADDIE
                      Okay, please, shut up.

                                        AMBER
                      You guys are sad.

        Amber smiles devilishly and rises--

                                        HADDIE
                      What are you doing?

        Amber struts across the restaurant fearlessly.  

                                        HADDIE (CONT D)
                      Oh my God, what is she doing?

                                        GEORGIA
                      She s fearless.

                                        STELLA
                      She s like God.

      We stay with a terrified Haddie as she watches Amber go 
      up to the table and totally own them.  They talk, they 
        crack up, she totally knows how to work it.  She points 
      over to Haddie and the others, and the guys all look 
        over.  Haddie, Georgia and Stella wave back lamely.  And 
        Amber walks back over.

                                        AMBER
                      They want to know if you want to go to 
                      hang in some park or something.

                                        HADDIE
                        McCallister?

                                        AMBER
                      That s it.

                                        STELLA
                      You are God.


      INT. ZEEK & CAMILLE S HOUSE - NIGHT

        Sarah runs to pick up the phone.      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   30.

                      Hello? -- This is who? -- Oh my God.

      As Sarah listens, with building alarm, we,

      INT. ZEEK'S CAR - NIGHT

        Sarah sits in the passenger seat trying to stay calm. 
      Zeek drives. 

                                        SARAH
                      The first day.  First goddamned day.  I m 
                      going to kill her.

                      Sometimes questioning authority is the 
                      first step in really defining who you 
                      are.

                                        SARAH
                      Shut up, Dad.

        There s a beat, then--

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      Kristina and Adam are going to hate me.     

                                        ZEEK
                      Stop it.  Adam s your brother.  How could 
                      he hate you?

                                        SARAH
                      Because my daughter corrupted their 
                      daughter.  Their perfect, pristine, never 
                      before caught smoking pot and ending up

                      Hey.  Hey.  Stop that.  Don t go to that 
                      place.  It happened.  It s over.  We move 
                      on.  Right?

        Sarah wants to believe this.  She appreciates Zeek saying 
        this, but for some reason it brings up her doubt about 
        her father, which brings up something else.   

                                        SARAH
                      Dad, why are there condoms in your drawer

                      What?

                                        SARAH
                      I mean, I'm sure there's some explanation 
                      other than you're cheating on Mom, but I 
                      have to ask, because I just moved my 
                      family here to be in the bosom of my 
                      parents and siblings and I need there to 
                      be an explanation.

        A long, pregnant, condom-related pause -- then.

                      I know they're complicated, I grew up in 
                      your fucking house, I'm asking why you 
                      have--

                                        ZEEK
                      Sarah.  Honey, you need to take care of 
                      your own business.

        She stares at him, feeling betrayed, and sad, and 
        shocked.  He just drives, they re pulling into the police 
        station. 

                                        ZEEK (CONT D)
                      Don t mention this to the others.  They 
                      wouldn t understand.

                                        SARAH
                      And I do?


      INT. POLICE STATION -  NIGHT

        Sarah walks the gauntlet past scary looking guys in 
        handcuffs, and prostitutes, up to Kristina and Adam who 
        are there with a cluster of PARENTS.  Amber, Haddie, 
        Georgia, Stella sit looking contrite, young and dumb, as 
      Adam finishes signing them out.

                                        SARAH
                      Adam--

                                        ADAM
                      It s okay.  They weren t officially 
                      booked.  It s not going on their records.      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   32.



                                        SARAH
                      Thank God.  Kristina, I am so sorry.

                                        KRISTINA
                      It s okay.  It s over.  

        But Kristina is a little less warm than usual, and Sarah 
        feels stares from some of the other Moms.   Amber glares 
      at Haddie who does nothing to dispel the myth that this 
      is all Haddie s fault.

                                        KRISTINA (CONT D)
                      Sarah, you remember Lisa and Jan.

                                        SARAH
                      Yeah, hi--

                                        LISA & JAN
                      Hi... / Welcome to Philadelphia.

        But they re decidedly cool, which is not lost on Sarah.  
        Clearly Amber is taking the blame for all this, and Sarah 
      is guilty by association.

                                        ZEEK
                      You know sometimes rebellious behavior is 
                      just a sign of the mind starting to 
                      really fire--

                                        SARAH & ADAM
                      Shut up Dad.


      EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

        Sarah walks briskly several feet ahead of Amber and Zeek, 
      up to Zeek s car.  As Zeek walks to the driver s side to 
        get into the car, Amber has a private moment with her 
      Mom.

                                        AMBER
                      It wasn t my pot.

                      Great.  That s so great.  I m so proud of 
                      you, Sweetie.

        Sarah gets into the car and slams the door shut.  OFF 
        this, we,

      INT. JULIA AND JOEL S BEDROOM - DAY

      Joel and Julia finish having morning sex.  There s a beat

                      She totally wants to sleep with you.

                              (even her name s annoying)
                      Racquel.  Does she have to walk around in 
                      those painted jeans?

        Max sits at a table across from DR. CAROLINE SANCHEZ a 
        warm, empathic developmental pediatrician.  Adam and 
        Kristina sit on the other side of the office, observing, 
        trying not to look tense, nervous and emotional. 

                                        DR. SANCHEZ
                      Max!  Hey, look what I m going do to.

        Dr. Sanchez takes a series of small, wooden blocks and 
        places them one after the other.  She puts four in a row, 
        and then takes the fifth block and places it on top.

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      Choo!  Choo!  Look what I did, Max.  I 
                      made a train.  Choo, choo!  See that?

        Max nods indicating he does.  Then Dr. Sanchez takes the 
        blocks and scrambles them up on the table.

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      Okay, now you do it!

        Max looks at Dr. Sanchez, unsure.

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      Go ahead, try to make a train just like I 
                      did.

        Max tentatively reaches out and starts to move the blocks 
        around.  This is painful because he isn t able to make 
        the train.  Adam watches, squirming out of his skin.  
        Kristina too.  Max finishes.  It s totally wrong.

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      That s good.  Okay, let s try again, Max.  

        She makes the exact same train.  

                                        DR. SANCHEZ (CONT D)
                      See it?  Okay.  Take a really good look 
                      at it.  Okay, now you try.

        She scrambles up the blocks again.  

                                        ADAM
                      Max, focus, dude.

        Dr. Sanchez looks over to Adam and smiles--

                        really...familiar.  Anyway, Julia told me 
                      you ran into her at Starbucks near her 
                      office.  Do you work downtown too?

                      around on the weekend in Juicy

                      be going out with a short, fat, balding 
                      barista?  Really?  Is that who I am to

                                        SARAH
                      You always have to prove you re better 
                      than me.  You ve always been setting me

                                        JULIA
                      Oh God, Sarah, will you just grow up

                                        SARAH
                      I will never let you set me up again.

        She puts on a demur smile.  Sits.

                      Hey, I have to show you something.

        Jim takes out a ring, it has one of those yin-yang 
        symbols on it.

                                        SARAH
                      Oh my God, is this--

                                        JIM
                      Oh, well, I don t know if you remember, 
                      you sort of threw it at me that night you 
                      broke up with me.

                                        SARAH
                      Oh my God, that s right.  I got you right

                      several ping pong trophies on display in 
                      my otherwise unimpressive apartment and 
                      if that isn t enough, which I m sure it 
                      is, the New Yorker just told me they were 
                      publishing one of my poems.

                      What?  Oh my God.  That s... The actual

        She smiles at him, remembering how charming he is.  He 
        looks at her, growing serious.

                      I m really glad you called.  I ve always 
                      thought about you, Sarah.

        Sarah is incredibly touched by this.  By the idea of 
        being seen by someone, even someone who hasn t seen her.  
        She starts to tear up.

                      What s wrong--

                                        SARAH
                      I m just, I don t know.  You just kept 
                      this ring all these years and you re 
                      funny and nice and I married a complete 
                      asshole with all kinds substance abuse 
                      issues -- I m such a fucking jerk.  Oh 
                      God, I m so sorry, this is morbidly 
                        embarrassing.  You have to understand I m 
                      out of practice with the whole dating 
                      thing.  And even in my prime, I was 
                      really bad at it which I don t have to 
                      tell you...

        She wipes her eyes, blows her nose, finally meets his 
        eyes, feeling vulnerable.  He just looks right back at 
        her smiles.

                      No, like setting a schedule.  You wait a 
                      little, until I m ready.

        Katie stops taking in what just happened.  She grows 
        moved, emotional.  Crosby grows terrified.  But it s too 
        late, she s already coming into him and kissing him, all 
        teary and flush and sexed up by talk of kids.

      INT. ZEEK S OFFICE - NIGHT

        The door bursts open.  And Sarah and Jim enter, kissing 
        and groping, like a couple of teenagers, only not.      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   47.

                      That s okay.

        Sarah goes to her father s desk and takes out his sinful, 
        extramarital Trojans, and rips one open.

        Sarah puts on Jim's flannel shirt, and they sneak out 
        into--


      INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING AREA - DAY

      They walk into the kitchen, and start looking through all 
        the cabinets.  It s sweet and fun and super-immature.  

                                        SARAH
                      Ooh, chocolate covered pretzels.  Yum.

                                        JIM
                      I really couldn t.

      He says as he shoves a few into his mouth.  

                                        SARAH
                      Eureka.  

        Sarah pulls out a bottle of really gross looking 
        blackberry Brandy.

                                        JIM
                      Yesssss!

      As Sarah takes a big hit off the bottle, LIGHT goes on.  
      It s Drew.  He looks at his mom wearing nothing but a 
        man s flannel shirt and holding a fifth of booze.  Then 
      he looks at Jim, wearing only his white Hanes briefs that 
        probably are a size too small.  Mortified, the only words 
        out of Sarah s mouth are:

        Sarah pulls to a stop outside the school and Drew is 
        about to get out.  Sort of a moment of truth.  She s got 
      to say something.

                                        SARAH
                      Drew...?

      He stops for a moment, his hand still on the door handle, 
        indicating he s not up for a big talk.

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      About what happened last night.

                      I know I m your mom, but I m also a 
                      woman... Oh God, delete, delete, delete.  
                      What I m trying to say is that no matter 
                      what you saw last night, and no matter 
                      what permanent indelible mark it might 
                      have left on your memory, that I m first 
                      and foremost your mother and that you and 
                      Amber are my number one priorities.  
                      Always.  

        There s a long beat, Drew seems thoughtful, then--

                      I want to move back in with Dad.

        Sarah s expression freezes.  She is completely blind-
        sided. 

                                        SARAH
                      What?

                      Look, I m glad you re able to be with 
                      your brothers and sisters and your old 
                      boyfriends or whatever, but this isn t 
                      home to me.  I want to be back in 
                      Trenton.  So I figure it makes sense.

      Drew gets out of the car and closes the door.  Sarah sits 
        there, flabbergasted.

        for a minute, looking at his computer.  She walks up to 
        it.  It s opened to his AOL account.  She sits.  Looks at 
        the screen.  Growing disturbed.

                      Read the most recent one.

        Sarah and Kristina open an e-mail, each of them filling

                      So do you think it s cool for me to see 
                      her even though I m sort of quasi 
                      engaged.

                      Crosby, you can t just decide to grow up.  
                      And I would argue that getting engaged to 
                      a woman just because you were jealous of 
                      her donor sperm is not actually the act 
                      of an adult.       "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   53.

        INT./EXT. JULIA S CAR/ANGELO S CAFE - DAY

        Julia drives by in her car and cranes her neck looking 
        through the window of this groovy, cafe.  She gets 
        distracted seeing Joel and Racquel at a table.  A honk.  
        A swerve.  A near miss.  Julia pulls over and a car goes 
      by flipping her the bird.  Julia has landed in a good 
      spot from which to spy on.  Feeling like an idiot she 
        takes out a pair of binoculars and looks through them.  

      IN THE RESTAURANT Joel and Racquel, smile at each other.  
        They re fighting over the check.  Their hands touch, 
        their eyes meet.  Julia watches, feeling ill.

        Kristina paces in front of a large office building in the 
        business district Adam walks out.

                      Look, I ve been thinking about this.  We

      Adam looks at her, every cell in his body unwilling to go 
        along with this.

        OFF the two of them, her eyes filled with tears.  He 
        looks at her, not wanting this to be true.

      Adam pulls to a stop with Max, in his pirate costume.  
        Max walks out of the car, is about to close the door--

                      Max.  Your bookbag.

        Max reaches in and gets his bookbag.  Adam gets out and 
        starts walking Max up the block to the school.  Adam 
        looks his son, watching everything in a new way.  Another 
        student passes Max--

                                        OTHER STUDENT
                      Hey Max!

        Max doesn t respond.

                                        ADAM
                      Max.  That kid just said hello to you.  
                      If you don t say hello he ll think you re 
                      being rude.

                                        MAX
                      Okay.

                      Uh-huh.

        Adam s heart is breaking in two.  The bell rings.  Max 
        turns to leave.

                                        ADAM
                      Max? -- Max!

        Max turns.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      I love you.

        Max smiles, and turns around and walks away.  Adam 
        watches.  Devastated.  The whole thing is sinking in on 
      him.  Hitting him like a ton of bricks.  PAUL, another 
      dad, approaches somberly.

                      Listen this is a little uncomfortable.  
                      The board at the Little League had a 
                      meeting last night.  The consensus was it 
                      might be better if you stepped aside.  
                      Let someone else coach the rest of the 
                      year.  Jordan Shefranick s dad is able to 
                      step in.

      Adam nods.  Not entirely thrilled.  Not surprised either.  
      Then the tough part--

                                        PAUL (CONT D)
                      And Adam, they ve also asked me to tell 
                      you that you can t be present at future 
                      games.  They ve gotten some complaints 
                      from some parents.  Apparently, the 
                      Umpire is threatening a lawsuit.  Really

                                (then, compelled)
                      It was a bad call.

      Paul walks away.  HOLD on Adam.

                                                                              CUT TO:

        Julia stands in the office of her boss LEON DENGRAF (40) 
        really successful, handsome, sees a world of potential in 
        Julia -- unstated sexual tension looms large between 
        them.

                                        LEON
                      Explain that to me.

                      You know.  Like either three days a week.  
                      Or preferably, five days a week where I 
                      come in early and leave by two thirty.

                      You want to feel that you tried, you did 
                      everything you could, but it s not

                      This is my daughter.  I feel like I 
                      hardly know her.  I m not around. She s

                      I m not good at losing control.

                      Julia, you re a lawyer.  A good one.  
                      Maybe a great one.  You re an up and 
                      comer.  And this is one of the hottest 
                      law firms in the city.  At a time when 
                      there are layoffs left and right, we 
                      barely have time to invoice our billable 
                      hours.  Look, Ed s going to kill me for 
                      bringing this up to you without him, but 
                      under the circumstances -- we re making 
                      you partner.

        Julia is literally shocked.  She starts to cry, knowing 
        there s no way out from the bed she has made.      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   59.

                      I m sorry, Drew.  I m so sorry.  But you 
                      can t go on forever believing that your 
                      dad s this cool, famous musician who 
                      played on three Jackson Browne records.  
                      It is not enough.  And it s not enough 
                      for a father to take his son out to 
                      Phillies games three times a year and 
                      forget about him the rest of the days.  
                      It is not okay.  I want you to know the 
                      truth.  You re old enough now.   Look at 
                      you.  You re a young man now aren t you?  
                      How did that happen?  And for what it s 
                      worth you ll always have me.  And I m

      In a rare moment Drew falls into her arms.  She holds him 
      like she never wants to let go.

      EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - FRONT ENTRANCE NIGHT

        The mood is festive as the family makes their way toward 
        the school for Sydney s play.  Sydney is pumped with 
        energy, wearing her white tights and runs lines with 
        Zeek.  Julia holds her angel wings for her.  And Joel 
        videotapes it all.  The whole thing could not be cuter.  

        Haddie looks at Amber who gives her another cold stare.  
        Finally, Haddie can t take it anymore.  She approaches 
      Adam and Kristina.   

                                        HADDIE
                      Can I talk to you for a second?

        Haddie looks to Amber.  Haddie faces her Mom and Dad, 
      this is the hardest thing she has ever done.

                                        HADDIE (CONT D)
                      That whole thing that happened the other 
                      night wasn t Amber s fault.  It was my 
                      fault.  Amber didn t even want to go to 
                      the park.  I dragged everyone there 
                      because I m totally into Evan Summerton.  
                      Totally.  Amber had nothing to do with me 
                      smoking pot.  She wasn t smoking or 
                      drinking.  I was.  She tried to stop me.

                      And I couldn t tell you the truth because 
                      I feel like I m supposed to be this 
                      perfect person to make up for all the 
                      weirdness around here.  But it s too much 
                      pressure.  I m not that person.  And I 
                      can t pretend to be anymore.  Oh, yeah, 
                      full disclosure.  This is mine.  

        She hands them a bag of WEED.

                      Okay.  So, I ll give you guys some time 
                      to discuss my punishment.  

        Haddie turns and walks into the auditorium trying to not 
        shake.  Adam and Kristina just look at each other.

      INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

        The show is on.  Sydney playing an angel, glows with her 
        classmates.  It s cute, messy, and you could feel the 
      love from the parents and relatives in the audience which 
      each syllable uttered.  

      IN THE AUDIENCE

        PAN the delighted faces of Parents, Siblings, 
        Grandparents until we FIND The Braverman s.  Julia seated 
      next to Joel, wondering what will be; Haddie looks at 
        Amber wondering if she s won any points back; Sarah 
        seated between her children reaches out and takes Amber s 
        hand.  Amber pulls away.  She grabs it again.  Doesn t 
        let go.  Then she takes Drew s hand.  Drew pulls his 
        away.  She grabs it again.  Doesn t let go.  She s going 
      to have a family moment if she has to pull their hands 
        out of their sockets.  Zeek seated next to Camille -- he

      EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - EVENING

      Adam sits outside on the steps -- we can hear the sound 
      of five-year-olds singing from within.  Max is ten or 
        fifteen feet away continuously jumping off of a step onto 
        the ground.  Over and over.  Relentlessly.  The 
        loneliness of having an autistic kid.

      Zeek comes out.  Sizes up the situation.

        And these words open up a flood gate.  To speak the most 
        dreaded thing on his mind is both empowering and 
        incredibly sad.

        Everyone looks over to Crosby who is rolling Haddie s pot 
      into two joints.

                      I think the most parental thing we can do 
                      right now is see exactly what kind of 
                      mischief Haddie has been getting herself 
                      involved in.  From the look of things, I 
                      think it s Columbian mischief.  But 
                      there s a slight possibility this could 
                      be Hawaiian mischief.

                      You really are turning into Dad.

                                        ADAM
                      Who says I m turning into Dad?

                      Everyone.

        A joint is lit.  It s passed.  Some smoke.  Some don t.  
        (Look forward do many conversations with standards and 
        practices.)  Adam shakes his head, grows thoughtful, 
        looks at Kristina, then he just says to everyone.

                                        ADAM
                      Max is autistic.  He s got, what is that 
                      called...?

                      Aspergers.

        Everyone takes this in.  Then Sarah reaches out and takes 
        Kristina s hand.  Crosby puts an arm around Adam s back.  
        Julia takes his hand.  Somehow a joint gets lit.  Passed 
        around.  Adam doesn t smoke, but he just sort of shakes

                      I m really sorry that I judged Amber like 
                      that.

      INT. ADAM & KRISTINA S - KITCHEN - SUNDAY MORNING

      Adam walks in with a big bag of bagels and other brunch 
        fare.

                                        ADAM
                      They were out of salt bagels again.  I 
                      know we don t like to have this 
                        conversation, but I think we may need to 
                      consider changing our bagelry.

        But Kristina stares at the window.  She indicates for 
      Adam to come over.  Adam does and the two of them look 
        out the window at 

      ZEEK & MAX

        They re playing in the backyard.  Zeek is throwing tennis 
        balls to Max who joyfully swings at them with a 
        broomstick.  Max is having fun.  Zeek is having fun.  We 
      hear Zeek say things like,  That s okay, you ll hit the 
      next one.   We see Max hit a crappy grounder and Zeek 
        says,  That s a hit, baby...   Etc.  

      Adam watches, moved, he takes Kristina s hand.

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      This is gonna be okay.  We re going to be 
                      okay.  

        Kristina nods, hoping beyond hope that he s right.

      INT. CROSBY S APARTMENT - DAY

        Crosby has fallen asleep with the TV on.  His doorbell 
        rings.  He rises, stumbles to the door.  Looks through 
        the peephole.  He sees JASMINE (late 20s), African 
        American, gorgeous, intelligent face, dancer s body. This 
        guy does have the life.

                      Hi.

        Crosby senses something in his peripheral vision.  He 
        looks down where he sees a BOY, about 5, African 
        American, with an angelic face.

        Crosby s smile fades.

                      Can we come in?  We need to talk.

      INT. ADAM & KRISTINA S - LATER

        Brunch is on.  Everyone but Crosby is here.  Lots of 
        reaching for bagels.  Sarah looks at Camille for a beat, 
      then makes a decision.  She walks up to Zeek and speaks, 
      very quietly very firmly--

                                        SARAH
                      Whatever it is you re doing with whoever 
                      it is you re doing it with, you ve got to 
                      talk to Mom.  If you don t, I will.

        And she walks away.  Hold on Zeek for a beat.  Crosby 
        walks in, goes to Adam.

                                        CROSBY

      As Crosby pulls Adam aside and starts talking, we see 
        Adam s Holy Shit face form.

        Sarah comes up to Amber.      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   70.



                                        SARAH
                      Listen, I just want to let you know I m 
                      sorry.  I blamed you for the whole thing 
                      with Haddie.  And I shouldn t have.

                                        AMBER
                      Good.  Listen, I have good news.  I 
                      decided not to move back to Trenton with 
                      Damien.

                                        SARAH
                      That is so great.

                                        AMBER
                      He s moving here.  Turns out the music 
                      scene in Philly blows Trenton out of the 
                      water.  The entire band s coming.  

        Sarah s smile freezes.

                                        SARAH
                      We ll talk about it.

                                        AMBER
                      What are we going to talk about?  They re 
                      on their way.

                                        SARAH
                      They are not on their way.

                                        AMBER
                      How do I say this?  They re on their way.  

        And in the middle of it all Max walks in and says.

                                        MAX
                      Isn t the game today?

      Adam is shocked.  Everyone is shocked.

                                        ADAM
                      Buddy, I thought you were done with 
                      baseball.

                                        MAX
                      It s my team.

      Adam exchanges looks with his brothers and sisters, Mom 
        and Dad.  He looks at his watch.

                                        ADAM
                      Game starts in ten minutes.

        And everyone snaps into gear.        "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   71.

      Adam tosses him the keys.

                      his glove?  I think it s in the garage.

        A voice out of nowhere.

                                        DREW
                      I ll find it.

        And everyone is shocked, most of all Sarah.

                                        ADAM
                      Good man.

        And Drew goes off to the garage.

      As we begin to hear the song FOREVER YOUNG begins, we go 
      to a...

        MONTAGE

      Of snacks being slapped together; gloves being found; a 
        desperate search for a matching pair of baseball socks, 
        and... 

        The faces, the faces, the faces... 

                                        THE SONG
                      May God bless and keep you always/May 
                      your wishes all come true/May you always 
                      do for others/And let others do for 
                      you...      "PARENTHOOD"           NETWORK DRAFT           1/23/09   72.



        ... the beautiful absurdity of twelve people coming 
        together to get one eight-year-old boy to a baseball 
        game.

        THE FAMILY makes it outside and they load into TWO 
        MINIVANS

      AT THE FIELD

        The entire family bails out of the MINIVANS and run with 
        Max to join his team in the dugout.  

        Except ADAM who has been banned from the game.  He has to 
        watch through a hole in the fence. 

                                        THE SONG (CONT D)
                      ...May you build a ladder to the 
                      stars/And climb on every rung...

        Max steps to the plate.  Adam closes his eyes, and 
        consults with God...  Please.   He opens his eyes, and 
        mutters to himself, willing Max from a distance:

                                        ADAM
                      Bend your knees, not that much, bat back, 
                      elbow up...

      As the Pitcher winds, delivers, we move close on Adam s 
        face.  As we HEAR the crack of a bat hitting a ball and 
      HOLD ON Adam s amazed face, we...

                                                                          BLACK OUT.

                                          THE END
