                    They re here somewhere.  I m a little 

                    hung over this morning.

                                        HOLLY

                    Were you out clubbing all night?

                                        EDEN

                    Oh my God, do you follow me on 

                    Twitter?!  Are you  Wish I were Eden, 

                    but I m not. 

                                        HOLLY

                    No.  I m  Wish I were twenty-four, but 

                    I m not.                                                                                        I/A

                                        EDEN

                    By the way, Stuart slept in your 

                    office last night.

                                        HOLLY

                    Again?

                                        EDEN

                    Actually he s the one who let me in.  

                    I left my keys in my party purse.

                                        HOLLY

                    Eden, give me one reason why I 

                    shouldn t fire you?

                                        EDEN

                    I went to Brown.

                                        HOLLY

                    (SHRUGS) Not a bad answer.  

      HOLLY GOES INTO HER OFFICE.

                                                                          RESET TO:

                    (GROGGY) What time is it?                                                                                        I/A

                                        HOLLY

                    Time to get on with your life.  You 

                    can t keep sleeping on my couch.

                                        STUART

                    Why not?

                                        HOLLY

                    Because I m your divorce lawyer. 

                    People are starting to talk.

                                        STUART

                    What people?

                                        HOLLY

                    Me.  To anyone who ll listen.  This is 

                    crazy.

                                        STUART

                    I know.  I know.

                                        HOLLY

                    Why don t you move into an apartment 

                    or at least a hotel?

                                        STUART

                    Because that would mean that I ve 

                    given up hope.  That my marriage to 

                    Lorna is over.

                                        HOLLY

                    (GENTLY)  Stuart, Lorna signed the 

                    divorce papers yesterday.

                                        STUART

                    She did?                                                                                      I/A         
                                                                                      4.                                                                                                                          


                                        HOLLY

                    With the darkest ink I ve ever seen. 

                    She even did a raised version for the 

                    blind. 

                                        STUART

                    But I loved being married.  I miss my 

                    wife... I miss my house.  Can I show 

                    you the picture again?

                                        HOLLY

                    Nope.  I'm not looking at that outdoor 

                    pizza oven one more time.  And Lorna 

                    claims you've been trespassing again.

                                        STUART

                    So I snuck in a few times to mow the 

                    lawn.  Big deal.  (THEN) I m sorry. 

                    This is very difficult for me. 

                                        HOLLY

                    I understand.  But I have some good 

                    news.  The two guys who live across 

                    the hall from me are looking for a new 

                    room mate.  They re divorced and have 

                    grown kids like you.  You should take 

                    it.

                                        STUART

                    Whoa.  We re kind of moving at warp 

                    speed here. (THEN) But it would be 

                    nice to have someone to talk to... 

                    besides the cleaning crew.                                                                                        I/A         
                                                                                      5.                                                                                                                          


                                        HOLLY

                    Plus you ll save a ton on rent which 

                    is good considering you gave Lorna 

                    everything in the divorce. 

                                        STUART

                    It s the least I could do.

                                        HOLLY

                    She left you!

                                        STUART

                    But she had to put up with me all 

                    these years.  

                                        HOLLY

                    Stop being so nice! 

                                        STUART

                    How do you know these guys will even 

                    want me as a room mate?

                                        HOLLY

                    Let s just say I m very close with the 

                    owner of the apartment.

                                        STUART

                    How close?

                                        HOLLY

                    It s me.

                                        STUART

                    Why do you own two apartments in the 

                    same building?                                                                                      I/A         
                                                                                      6.                                                                                                                          


                                        HOLLY

                    Stuart, I answered less questions to 

                    pass the bar.  So, what do you say?  

                    You willing to give it a try? 

      STUART THINKS IT OVER FOR A MOMENT, THEN GETS UP.

                                        STUART

                    Okay.  Why not?

                                        HOLLY

                    (HUGGING HIM)  Way to go, Stuart.  I m 

                    proud of you. (STUART STARTS TO SIT) 

                    Don t you dare get back on that couch!

                                        PHIL

                    What can I say, I like women... a lot.

                                        HOLLY

                    I know.  I handled your divorce, 

                    remember? (THEN)  Listen, I have good 

                    news.  I found you a new room mate.

                                        PHIL

                    Oh, yeah.  What s he like?                                                                                      I/B

                                        HOLLY

                    He s a home run.  Great guy.  Great, 

                    great guy.  Super cool.  Super. 

                                        PHIL

                    Did you know when you lie that 

                    adorable right eye of yours starts to 

                    flutter?

                                        HOLLY

                    It does not.

    HER EYE STARTS TO FLUTTER.

                                        PHIL

                    There it goes. 

                                        HOLLY

                    Look, the guy s wife left him and he 

                    needs a place to live.

                                        PHIL

                    So, the mother hen is trying to place 

                    another stray.

                                        HOLLY

                    May I remind you that you were one of 

                    those strays, and so was Haskell.  

                    When I met you you were a incorrigible 

                    womanizer with no where to live.  And 

                    now... you live somewhere.  And 

                    Haskell s wife had just thrown him out 

                    because he wouldn t get his ass of the 

                    couch.  And now... 

    SHE LOOKS AT HASKELL ON THE COUCH.                                                                                      I/B         
                                                                                      10.                                                                                                                          


                                        HOLLY (CONT D)

                    ... He s on a different couch.

                                        PHIL

                    Picking a new room mate is a very 

                    delicate matter.  You can t just put 

                    anyone in here.  He s got to fit in. 

                    Take Haskell and I.  We ve probably 

                    said twelve words to each other in the 

                    last month.  Right, Haskell.

                                        HASKELL

                    Right.  Speak to you again in a month. 

                                        PHIL

                    You got it. (TO HOLLY)  Plus the new 

                    guy will be replacing Stan and he s 

                    going to be a tough act to follow.  

                    The guy was a dream.  It s like he 

                    wasn t here.

                                        HOLLY

                    He wasn t.  He was transferred to Hong 

                    Kong six months ago.

                                        PHIL

                    Let s just say he s good people.

                                        HOLLY

                    And so is Stuart.  I think you guys 

                    will be good for each other.

                                        PHIL

                                        PHIL

                    You re marking the guy down?  That s 

                    not a good sign. 

                                        HOLLY

                    The offer expires in thirty seconds.

                                        PHIL

                    What s the big rush?

                                        HOLLY

                    No rush.

    HER EYE STARTS TWITCHING.

                                        PHIL

                    I ll do it on one condition: Haskell 

                    and I reserve the right to vote him 

                    off the island.

                                        HOLLY

                    Deal.

                    cruise she s planning with you and her

                                                                                      36.                                                                                                                          


                                        STUART

                    Yes.  I am. (THEN) You know my wife 

                    has a cousin named Holly.  Small 

                    world, huh?

                                        HOLLY

                    Alright, stop right there.

                                        STUART

                    I know.  I know.  I used the wife 

                    word.  Let me start over. (THEN) So, 

                    Holly, what do you do for a living?

                                        HOLLY

                    I m an attorney.

                                        STUART

                    That s very impressive.  Where dyou 

                    go to law school?  Where dyou go 

                    undergrad?  Where dyou--

                                        HOLLY

                    Alright, stop right there.  You re 

                    doing what s called on a date, the 

                      interrogation.

                                        STUART

                    Is that bad?

                                        HOLLY

                    Not if you re a DEAagent.  Let the 

                    night unfold naturally.  It s not a 

                    job interview.                                                                                      III/K         
                                                                                      37.                                                                                                                          


                                        STUART

                    Got it.  (THEN) So let me tell you a 

                    little bit about myself.  I m recently 

                    divorced.  Bummer, right?  But my new 

                    motto is: ready, set, life!

                                        HOLLY

                    Lose the motto.

                                        STUART

                    Got it. (THEN)  How about you, Holly. 

                    You ever been married?

                                        HOLLY

                    No. (THEN) I was engaged once.

                                        STUART

                    Really?  What happened?

                                        HOLLY

                    I don t want to talk about it.

                                        STUART

                    You have to.  We re on a date.

                                        HOLLY

                    And your date doesn t want to talk 

                    about it.

                                        STUART

                    C mon, you know everything about me.

                                        HOLLY

                    Alright.  (THEN)  You want to know why 

                    I own two apartments in the building?  

                    I ve always had my eyes on the one you 

                    guys live in.   

                                        (MORE)                                                                                      III/K         
                                                                                      38.                                                                                                                          

                                        HOLLY (CONT'D)

                    So when I got engaged, I finally 

                    bought it.  Then a few days before the 

                    wedding I stopped by to see if the new 

                    carpeting had been put down and 

                    discovered that the only being laid 

                    was my fiance. 

                                        STUART

                    Wow.   That must have been pretty 

                    traumatic.  (RE: FILES) No wonder you 

                    bury yourself in your work.

                                        HOLLY

                    I do not.  I ve got a date.  In fact 

                    he s picking me up for dinner any 

                    minute.

      A BELL GOES OFF.

                                        STUART

                    Something done in your microwave.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                      III/L         
                                                                                      39.

                                        STUART

                    Sorry, I m late, I--

                                        PHIL

                                        STUART

                    Are you serious?  Is this a joke?

                                        PHIL

                    What s wrong?

                                        STUART

                    You know Lorna s my ex-wife s name.                                                                                      III/L

                                        PHIL

                    I thought it was Mona.

                                        STUART

                    That s because you never listen.

                                        ANDREA

                    Awkward.

                                        LORNA

                    I ll tell you what, Stuart.  Why don t 

                    you call me by my middle name, Jill?

                                        STUART

                    Jill was my ex-wife s middle name.

      THERE S SILENCE:

                                        STUART (CONT D)

                    I m just messing with you.  Her middle 

                    name wasn t, Jill.  That was just a 

                    little tension breaker. 

                                        LORNA

                    (PLAYFUL) You re bad.

                                        STUART

                    Yeah, her real middle name was--

                                        PHIL

                    Alright.  Let s move on.

                                        STUART

                    Jill, I brought you some chocolate. 

                    Actually, it s a Nestle s Crunch.  

                                        (MORE)                                                                                      III/L

                                        STUART (CONT'D)

                    Since it was so last minute I bought 

                    it from one those kids on the street 

                    raising money for Botswana.  (THEN) I 

                    didn t want to come empty handed.

                                        LORNA

                    Thank you, Stuart.  That was very old 

                    school.  And I like old school.

    SHE KISSES HIM ON THE CHEEK.  PHIL, IMPRESSED, GIVES 
      STUART THE THUMBS UP.

                                        ANDREA

                    So, Phil, what did you bring for me?

                                        PHIL

                                        PHIL

                    Hey, Haskell, remember Andrea?

                                        HASKELL

                                        ANDREA

                    I had a party in my hotel suite and 

                    you spent the whole night on the couch 

                    watching TV.

                                        HASKELL

                    Oh, yeah.  Now I remember.  Sometimes 

                    it s good to get out.

                                        PHIL

                    Andrea, how would you like a tour of 

                    the apartment?

                    Phil, you might want to start with the 

                    kitchen.  I hung the new spice rack.

                                        PHIL

                    Tempting, but I think I ll start with

                                        STUART

                    So, shall we sit, Lorna--I mean Jill?

                                        LORNA

                    Sure.

      THEY SIT ON THE COUCH NEXT TO HASKELL.

                                        LORNA(CONT D)

                    (TO HASKELL) Hello.

                                        HASKELL

                    Hi.

                                        STUART

                    (RE: LOUD TV) Haskell, do you mind?

                                        HASKELL

                    Oh.  Sorry.

      HASKELL PUTS ON HIS WIRELESS HEADPHONES. 

                                        LORNA

                    (TO STUART, RE: HASKELL) He seems to 

                    really like that TV... and those hot 

                    wings.  I gather he s divorced too.

                                        STUART

                    It took him two weeks before he 

                    noticed his wife had left him.

                                        LORNA

                    Wow. (THEN) So, Stuart, tell me more 

                    about yourself.  I know you re a 

                    dentist.

                                        STUART

                    Guilty.                                                                                      III/M         
                                                                                      44.                                                                                                                          


                                        LORNA

                    Where d you go to dental school?  

                    What s your specialty?

                                        STUART

                    Jill, you re doing what we call on a 

                    date, the interrogation. 

                                        LORNA

                    I m sorry.  I m just a little nervous.  

                    I m kind of new to this dating thing.

                                        STUART

                    That s cool.  I was once a rookie, too.   

                                        LORNA

                    How long have you been divorced?

                                        STUART

                    A week.  

                                        LORNA

                    Well you don t show it.  You seem so 

                    self assured.  So confident. 

                                        STUART

                    As I see it you have two choices: you 

                    can either move on or stay frozen in a 

                    time that s never going to be.

                                        LORNA

                    What a great attitude.                                                                                      III/M

                                        STUART

                    It s called survival.  Life goes on.  

                    Just being with you tonight, looking into 

                    those beautiful blue eyes, makes me 

                    realize (BREAKS DOWN SOBBING) how much I 

                    miss my wife!  You have her name, her 

                    eyes, you even twirl your hair in the 

                    same adorably compulsive way. 

                                        LORNA

                    (STARTS SOBBING) And you remind me of 

                    my husband.  He was a crier, too.  So 

                    sweet and sensitive.

                                        STUART

                    (SOBBING) He sounds like a great guy.

                                        LORNA

                    (SOBBING) He was.

                                        STUART

                    I m sorry, Lorna-Jill.  I m not ready 

                    to move on.  I m going home.

                                        LORNA

                    (SOBBING) Good luck.  It was nice 

                    meeting you.

                                        STUART

                    (SOBBING) You, too.

      STUART GRABS HIS COAT AND EXITS THE APARTMENT.

      LORNA IS SITTING ON THE COUCH WITH HASKELL, BOTH WEARING 3-
      D GLASSES AND WATCHING TV.  PHIL ENTERS FROM HIS BEDROOM. 
    ON TOP OF THE WORLD.  HEADS TO THE KITCHEN FOR SOME WINE.  
      THEN NOTICES STUART S NOT THERE.

                                        PHIL

                    (TO LORNA) What s going on?  Where s 

                    Stuart?

                                        LORNA

                    He left. 

                                        PHIL

                    What do you mean he left?  Where d he 

                    go?

                                        LORNA

                    He got kind of emotional and said he 

                    wasn t ready to move on.  That he was 

                    going home.

                                        PHIL

                    Home?  He doesn t have a home.

      HOLLY IS POURING OVER HER WORK FILES.  THE DOORBELL RINGS.  
    SHE OPENS IT TO PHIL.

                                        HOLLY

                    Phil?  

                                        PHIL

                    Stuart ran away.  

                                        HOLLY

                    What? (CONCERNED) Come on in.  

      PHIL ENTERS AND LOOKS AROUND THE LIVING ROOM.

                                        PHIL

                    I thought you had a date.

                                        HOLLY

                    (CAUGHT) It ended early.  Let s focus 

                    on Stuart, shall we?  The last I heard 

                    you blackmailed him into going on a 

                    date so you could hook up with a sure 

                    thing.

                                        PHIL

                    It sounds so much worse out loud.  

                    Anyway, he told his date he wasn t 

                    ready to move on and is on his way 

                    home.

                                        HOLLY

                    That means headed to his old house.  

                    I ve got to stop him.                                                                                       IV/R

                    Why?

                                        HOLLY

                    Stuart might not have moved on, but 

                    his wife has.  She s seeing someone.

                                        PHIL

                    The guy s told me every detail about 

                    his life.  I know the names of every 

                    one of his dead pets.  But that he 

                    leaves out?

                                        HOLLY

                    That s because he doesn t know.  I 

                    didn t have the heart to tell him. 

                                        PHIL

                    When his wife was in my office, I 

                    asked to borrow her cell and read her
