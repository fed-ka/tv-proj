ELLATRACHE
(in French)
There's a journalist in London.
Simon Ross. He seems to know a
lot about you.
He has a source
inside the program. Someone
there from the beginning. What

elevator lobby.
The three car alarms distract them. They
search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...
Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of
modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
locked.
84
A second CRI car arrives.
Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
speed.
He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a
sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly
free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
stops.
Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.
A
third blocks the exit ramp.
Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower
of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead
on him.
Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm
toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?
267
268
The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
toward Bourne--
But before they can get a bead--
Bourne slams the car into reverse again.
Petal to the
metal in reverse--
The agents open fire.
Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.
As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent
adjusts his fire into the car's grill.
Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's
driveline.
Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
behind him.
85
Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
structure.
Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits
the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
car up and over the wall.
Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a
second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden
angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's
car, to the shooters.
Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25
feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.
The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
against the roof.
Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a
moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over-
turned car.
CRI AGENT
Ho-ly shit!
269
270
The CRI agents race to the spot where Bourne's car
disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into
Bourne's car but they're too late! Bourne's already out.
He disappears from sight under the covered parking
structure.
LEAD CRI AGENT
Get down there! Get down!
271
271A
One of the agents scrambles over the edge and starts to
climb down. Other agents race for the stairs.
TACTICAL TEAM LEADER (V.O.)
Don't tell me--

Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the
level Bourne's on.
275
275
Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
roof lands hard behind him.
Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
a head on charge.
The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
the floor as he dives out of the car.
The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
glass shatters, and airbags explode.
Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
car implodes against the oncoming agents.
87
Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.
The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.
The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.
The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.
An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.
With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.
Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.
The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.
The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.
BOURNE
10-13. Shots fired. Officer
down. Port Authority parking
lot. Level four.
Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer.
Then he hands the cop his
radio back.
BOURNE (CONT'D)
Stay out of sight until one of
your own arrive.
Bourne disappears.
We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits.
CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--

Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east,
followed closely by a CRI sedan.
As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into
Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the
right. It ricochets off several parked cars before
regaining control.

Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
by hitting his bumper.
Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that
car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.
282
284
Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.
Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.
Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
intersection completely blocking his path.
Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.
As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.
Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan
overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.

BOURNE emerges into the crowed street, headed uptown.

Bourne reaches 71st street and 2nd Ave.
He looks up at the

Bourne arrives at the "Johnston Medical Center."
He looks
up to see "415".

NEW YORK -- HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON

This is the place... When he looks down Landy steps out of
the lobby to meet him on the sidewalk.

BOURNE
They'll kill you for giving me
this place.
LANDY
4/15/71 isn't much of a code. My
guess is Vosen's already on his
way.
BOURNE
Why'd you do it?
LANDY
This isn't us, David. What they
turned you into, what they're
doing with Blackbriar... This
has to stop.
BOURNE
Then stop it. Everything you
need is in there.
Bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital.
LANDY
David... Come in with me. It's
better if we do this together.
BOURNE
(shakes head)
This is where it started for me,
this is where it ends.
She watches the doors close behind him....
Landy lets him
go.

QUICK SHOTS of six different CRI sedans and SUVs rushing

Landy looks in the backpack.
JUMPCUTS:
--She unzips the backpack and looks in at the the
Blackbriar Operations File.
--A cover page inside: "utmost secrecy"... "potentially
explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program"...
--Another page: "Terminated" stamped across the photos of
victims. Next to the victim from the inciting incident,
the words: "US citizen"...

LANDY
Oh, my God...
--A third page, more photos, no "terminated" on these.
Future victims. "US citizen" stamped next to each one...

LATE AFTERNOON 309R
Landy walks down the street. She looks up to spot two
black sedans speeding east on 71st, turns south -- two SUVs
coming up York.
Shit--

Vosen's SUV careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic.
Still a half block from the entry door but it's close
enough--
322
352
Bourne runs out onto the roof. Rushes across it to look
over the edge.
It's a straight drop to the FDR -- 12
stories down.
He races to another ledge -- the East River below him. But
he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of
the building to hit the water.
He backs up to get a
running leap.
As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on
him.
PAZ
Why didn't you take the shot?
Bourne looks at him.
BOURNE
Do you even know why you're
trying to kill me? Look at what
they make you give.
Bourne turns and runs off the roof.
Paz fires into the air...
FOLLOW Bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the
freezing river--
MULTIPLE ANGLES -- Bourne goes into the river...
