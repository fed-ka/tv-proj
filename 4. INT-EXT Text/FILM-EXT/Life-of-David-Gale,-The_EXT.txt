A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely
highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through
the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The
sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO
into the mist.
She runs, and runs.
She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway.
Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a
tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.
She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going
to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty
parking lot to Volvo station wagon.
As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the
capitol building in the distance.
David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop
inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance.
The car's lights move past a sign: "Huntsville 27 Miles."
BITSEY (V.O.)
His sperm was inside her.
The car exits for the rest area.
ZACK (V.O.)
Little did they know their troubles
were just beginning.
Zack mimics the OPENING MUSIC to "Dark Shadows."
Well lit and empty. The rental car is parked with the hood
up. They stand looking at the radiator.
BITSEY
Is it hot?
He puts his hand on it.
ZACK
Oww! Jesus, yes. Isn't it always?
Bitsey shrugs.
ZACK
So what do I do?
BITSEY
I don't know, something male.
Zack animatedly adjusts his balls, spits.
ZACK
Now what?
Bitsey's not paying attention. She's watching headlights
coming toward them.
BITSEY
Company.
ZACK
I hope whoever it is never saw
Deliverance.
A late model pickup pulls up behind them. They shade their
eyes from its headlights. The lights go off. An OLDER COWBOY
(mid-60's, Stetson, lizard skin boots) steps out.
OLDER COWBOY
You folks need some help?
BITSEY
Actually yes.
The motel lies adjacent to Interstate 45 and a Kettle
restaurant. The rental car pulls up to the reception building.
The rental car is parked in front. The morning is overcast,
it's sprinkling. Bitsey emerges from one of the rooms on the
second floor carrying an umbrella.
Drizzle. The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a
few hundred yards down the road. In front of the guardhouse
is a sign: "TDC Ellis Unit. All visitors must report."
SUPERIMPOSE: "DAY ONE"
The rental car ENTERS the FRAME, brakes briefly for the empty
guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison.
Bitsey and Zack get out of their car. She has an umbrella.
ZACK
So where do we report?
Three razor wire fences surround the prison. Guard towers
rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building
with a sign: "REPORT HERE."
Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the
building.
Someone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny
Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty
yards away. He watches them neutrally.
CAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a
series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building.
Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's)
stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim
skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside
him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back
against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white
guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the
building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger
(20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the
chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.
Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the
Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows,
turns his collar up.
GROVER
Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?
BITSEY
Yes.
Zack smiles to himself.
GROVER
On death row?
BITSEY
No.
GROVER
Well, we house 422 inmates here.
Average stay with us is nine years.
Some get commuted, move on, most get
killed. It'll put you off your supper,
but then it's supposed to.
The unit fence gate parts as they enter. The older gate guard
nods as they pass.
GROVER
(to the guard)
Afternoon, Earl.
(back to her)
We've got three concerns here: safety,
safety and safety. The visitation
area is entirely secure -- we just
ask you don't touch the glass. Windex
gets expensive.
They come to the door of the entrance area.
GROVER
Rules say seven days prior to
execution inmates must be interviewed
in a cage.
The DOOR BUZZES, Grover opens it.
David and Constance exit the building into the sun.
CONSTANCE
She's gonna do the whole mother thing.
She empathizes with you completely,
but experience has given her the
courage to take the tougher road, ta-
da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And
flirt politely.
DAVID
'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for
a woman who executed thirty eight
last year.'
They've come to a sidewalk junction, stop.
CONSTANCE
And watch your ego. Don't come across
as one of those I-hate-authority-
because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the-
New Yorker types.
DAVID
Anything else?
CONSTANCE
Yeah, don't fall into one of your
brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting
new federal stats from Amnesty
tonight.
DAVID
I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them
to Sharon's number at the house.
She looks at him sternly over the top of her glasses.
CONSTANCE
If you have a hang-over tomorrow --
DAVID
(hangs up, walking
away)
Apropos playing Mother.
CONSTANCE
(calling after him)
Ten o'clock!
(beat)
Bright-eyed and bushy tailed!
The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian,
far better than what a university professor can afford.
The grounds are perfect. David's Volvo is in the driveway,
his wife's new Laredo beside it. On the street out front
sits a new VW Beetle.
Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the
parking lot.
CONSTANCE
Your exact words were, 'Just tell me
when my ego gets in the way of the
work.' Now I'm telling you: Your
ego's in the way of work.
DAVID
(indicating the station)
Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.
CONSTANCE
You put up precisely two seconds of
protest at the thought of a televised
debate.
DAVID
What's that supposed to mean?
CONSTANCE
It means DeathWatch suffers because
you're so anxious to finger authority,
to publicly prove that David Gale is
so much fucking smarter than the
powers that be. Learn to work without
an audience. Try squeezing money
from the donor list. Have you ever
licked one single mail-out envelope?
They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are
standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s).
MAN #2 (SUIT)
Mr. Gale?
DAVID
Look, guys, there's not much more to
say --
MAN #2
Rameriz, Austin police. This is
Officer Haslinger.
The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine
it more closely.
DAVID
What, arguing with the Governor is a
crime?
The officers exchange a look.
MAN #3 (SUIT)
No, sir, rape is.
Constance and David look at each other, stunned.
OVERHEAD SHOT
CAMERA QUICKLY CRANES UP and ROTATES.
DISSOLVE TO:
WHITE.
DISSOLVE TO:
Bitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms.
Zack is lighting a cigarette. The rain's stopped, but the
lot is wet.
BITSEY
Try phone records, a net search.
ZACK
Fucking better than watching you
work.
They walk a beat in silence.
ZACK
You think he's telling the truth?
BITSEY
Don't ask me that. I don't know.
There is no truth, only perspectives.
ZACK
Can't say that. If you say 'there is
no truth,' you're claiming it's true
that there is no truth -- it's a
logical contradiction.
BITSEY
Working on our philosophy merit badge,
Zack?
ZACK
I, on the other hand, think Gale's
telling the truth.
They come to the stairs and start up.
BITSEY
This you know telepathically?
ZACK
It's just my perspective.
In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the
rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb
the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are in
their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feels
the music.
Bitsey rings the bell. Zack stomps out a cigarette, points
out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his
eyebrows. As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is opened
by a GOTH GIRL, probably not quite eighteen.
She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine Inch
Nails T-shirt. METAL MUSIC comes from within.
The Goth Girl just looks at them. After an uncomfortable
silence, Bitsey extends her hand.
BITSEY
Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is
Zack Stemmons. We --
GOTH GIRL
You want the tour?
Her voice is slacker monotone.
BITSEY
Uh, yes.
GOTH GIRL
There's a twenty-dollar mandatory
donation, apiece. But you get a re-
enactment photo packet. It's got
five pictures.
BITSEY
Okay.
A beat.
GOTH GIRL
I gotta collect first.
BITSEY
Oh, sure.
Bitsey reaches in her bag.
As David approaches them, Chase runs to them -- still carrying
Cloud Dog. He jumps on his dad.
CHASE
Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me
like a fur!
As he walks, David drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders
(like a fur). Chase squeals with pleasure.
DAVID
Who's your hero?
Chase bonks him on the nose. David sets Chase down when he
reaches his WIFE. He kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles
to move on to something else. A long beat as David and his
wife stand uncomfortably.
DAVID
Call me when you get to Boston?
SHARON (WIFE)
Yeah.
A beat.
DAVID
I wish you --
SHARON
Don't.
She turns and walks to the Jeep. The door's open.
SHARON
Chase, get in, Sweetie.
Chase climbs in, sits in the driver's seat.
CHASE
(turning to his dad)
See ya later, Alli-gator.
DAVID
After awhile, Crocodile.
CHASE
Take it easy, Japa-ne-se.
DAVID
Okey-dokey, Artichokey.
SHARON
(to Chase)
Scoot.
Chase scoots over to the passenger seat. Sharon gets in the
driver's seat.
SHARON
I sent you an e-mail.
DAVID
Okay?
SHARON
Just read it.
She closes the door. Suddenly, Chase opens the passenger
side door, runs around the Jeep carrying Cloud Dog. He runs
to his dad, hugs him one last time.
SHARON
(cracking her window)
Come on, Chase.
Chase starts to go back, turns and hands David his Cloud Dog
without comment. He then quickly runs back around the Jeep
and gets in.
David watches them drive away. Chase's hand waves out the
window until they are out of the parking lot.
INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN
with an e-mail message: "David, I want a divorce. I'm sorry
to say it so plainly, but that's how I feel it. I don't need
time to think, this whole 'rape' thing has only forced..."
A Century 21 real estate agent is putting a "For Sale" sign
in the front yard.
David stands on the balcony of a sparsely-furnished 420-a-
month apartment. Books are stacked everywhere. An Interstate
runs nearby. He holds a phone, looks down in the pool area.
DAVID'S POV
A horribly-tanned man in his seventies (wearing a Speedo)
attempts to do Tai Chi.
CHASE (V.O.)
(on his mom's answering
machine)
We aren't home. Please, tell us a
message.
SHARON (V.O.)
(cueing him in the
b.g.)
At the beep.
CHASE (V.O.)
At the peep.
ON DAVID
David lets the PHONE BEEP, just stares down at the man, saying
nothing.
As David gets out of his Volvo, a SORORITY PLEDGE (funny
clothes, Greek letters on her cheek) quickly approaches.
She takes his picture with a Polaroid camera.
She runs to a waiting convertible, where two other girls
sit.
SORORITY PLEDGE
I got it! I got it!
She jumps in the car and they speed away.
David and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green.
BELYEU
Because divorce proceedings do not
require her presence in the country.
For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll
have to return.
David chooses a club.
BELYEU
But without successful completion of
an alcohol treatment program, you'll
be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'.
David walks to the ball.
DAVID
So my chances of getting partial
custody aren't good?
BELYEU
Roughly the same as you sinkin' that
from here.
David looks at him, then concentrates on the ball -- suddenly
it has meaning. He swings. The ball lands in a water trap.
It's a beautiful day. The house looks much different than in
the Goth Girl's care -- flower bed, well-manicured lawn,
fresh paint. The "Block Home" sign is in the window. David's
Volvo pulls up in front.
Constance opens the door for David. He's wearing a short
sleeved Radio Shack shirt and tie. She's taken aback.
Looks at him a beat, bites her lip, suppresses a laugh.
CONSTANCE
I'm sorry.
He plays hurt, then they both burst out laughing.
LONG SHOT - CONSTANCE AND DAVID
She hugs him as they laugh on the porch.
CONSTANCE
She went up at 18, she's 26 now.
She sets the plant down among others. At the very back of
the yard, the Older Cowboy spades in a vegetable garden.
DAVID
(calling to the Cowboy)
Hey! She ever not make you work when
you come by?
OLDER COWBOY
(raising his spade in
greeting)
Mornin', David.
DAVID
(turning to Constance)
What's her story?
CONSTANCE
I really want us to get behind this
one. She's articul --
DAVID
Constance, who did she kill?
Constance looks at him a beat, sighs.
CONSTANCE
A cop.
DAVID
She admit to it?
Contance sheepishly nods.
DAVID
You're a crazy woman. Not your medium
grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's-
bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose-
screws-in-the-belfry insane.
CONSTANCE
You're mixing metaphors.
DAVID
A real danger to flora and fauna.
CONSTANCE
Are we gonna do this?
DAVID
(the smile)
And how.
He kisses her on the forehead -- he's surprised.
DAVID
You're burning up.
David exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup-
container, tries to sip one without spilling the others.
He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier.
In the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his
Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front
of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the
passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back,
waves. As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic
DOOR-LOCK BUTTON.
Constance comes anxiously out the front door.
CONSTANCE'S POV
David's Volvo pulls out of the parking lot.
BACK TO SCENE
She stands watching it drive away, breathing heavily. She
winces, grabs her stomach, vomits on the sidewalk.
The Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street. David stands
at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a
calling code. He waits, impatiently, looks across the street:
There's a liquor store.
CLOSEUP - RECEIVER
at his ear, Chase's MESSAGE BEGINS.
BACK ON DAVID
He speaks into the PHONE after the BEEP.
DAVID
Sharon, pick up. For once just pick
up the goddamn phone! If you keep
him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging
you. He's my son! Please! Please....
Please.
David starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts
smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long
after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand
bleeds.
Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward
her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks.
David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign,
holding Cloud Dog. He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio
Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand. He's sloppy
drunk.
DAVID
We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.
CONSTANCE
Come on, come inside.
She opens the door as he stands.
DAVID
We fell off our wagon.
The rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot, as
far as possible from the razor-wire fence and exercise pens.
The guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down.
Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car.
All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked
in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where
another Highway patrol car is stationed.
The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only
vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people
in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive.
The rental car ENTERS the FRAME.
The rental car passes a farmhouse.
The rental car passes a black teenager hitchhiking in front
of an abandoned vegetable stand.
Bitsey and Zack make their way to their rooms. Zack's is
first.
BITSEY
Give me an hour.
Zack runs towards Bitsey. She stands outside her room.
ZACK
What!?
BITSEY
It's open.
ZACK
So? Maybe the maid forgot.
BITSEY
(pointing)
Look!
As he comes to her door, he sees what she's indicating:
Between the door and its frame, someone has stuck a roll of
duct tape.
Zack runs out the front door carrying a VCR, the cables drag
the ground behind him. He runs toward the rooms.
Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate
and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon.
After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her.
ZACK
Belyeu says to bring the tape first
thing tomorrow. Also said you were
right about not calling the police.
A beat, she keeps looking straight on.
ZACK
Are you gonna be okay?
Bitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes.
She shakes her head no. Her lips start to tremble. He puts
his arms around her as she starts to cry.
The storm batters the motel. We see Bitsey's dark front
window. Lightning. A figure stands looking out. More
lightning. It's Bitsey, intently watching the night.
Bitsey hurries umbrella-less through the rain to the rental
car parked in the loading zone.
A taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and
press that now gather along the drive.
David sits in a lawn chair beside his Volvo. The tailgate's
down, serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and
whiskey bottle. David stares off down the alley, clearly in
pain. He holds a child's drawing.
INSERT - DRAWING
Has Gaudi's church and a matador in background. Prominent in
the foreground are three labeled figures: Sharon ("Mommy"),
Chase ("Me") and a dark-haired man ("Papa Jorge"). Jorge is
dressed in a tux, Sharon seems to wear a bridal gown.
In the window, Dusty holds up the marker. David nods.
David sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Black
Bush in the chair beside him. He's staring at nothing.
Constance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a
turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan. She goes to
the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits. They
silently survey the yard, the sunset. She hugs the bottle,
he sips his drink.
CONSTANCE
Remember those Kubler-Ross stages,
the ones the dying go through?
DAVID
Denial, anger, bargaining, depression,
and acceptance. Where are you?
CONSTANCE
Denial.
DAVID
Denial's my personal favorite.
CONSTANCE
The whole idea of there being a
process makes me tired. I'm not up
to the job of Dying Person. Marveling
at blades of grass. Lecturing
strangers to relish every moment.
DAVID
Mending bridges.
CONSTANCE
Mending bridges. Confessing regrets.
Uuuggh.
DAVID
No regrets?
CONSTANCE
Nope.
A beat.
CONSTANCE
Take that back. I wish I had a child.
DAVID
Me, too.
CONSTANCE
I'm sorry, David.
She reaches over and puts her hand on his arm.
CONSTANCE
I guess I just wish I would have
risked more.
She has the bottle in her other hand, looks at it, takes a
swig.
CONSTANCE
(making a face,
swallowing hard)
Uumm, also not enough sex. Should
have had more sex.
She puts the bottle down beside her chair.
DAVID
How much... how many lovers have you
had?
CONSTANCE
Including college?
DAVID
Including college.
Her hand (on his arm) holds up four fingers.
DAVID
Well, it's... not every... yeah, you
should have had more sex.
She laughs, coughs. He laughs. Their laughter trails off
into the yard. He takes her hand in his.
CONSTANCE
You work hard not to be seen as a
sex object. Before long, you're not
seen at all.
DAVID
I see you.
They are holding hands in the air, their elbows on the chairs'
armrests.
DAVID
Want to make it five? Finish the
hand?
CONSTANCE
A pity lay. No thanks.
A beat. They watch their fingers lightly play with one
another.
DAVID
It wouldn't be pity.
They turn, their eyes meet, hold.
The house is dark. A light in one of the rooms comes on.
David goes to the pay phone against the building.
David sits in a lounger speaking to someone on his right.
He's sober.
DAVID
Let's say they move back from Spain,
that I somehow got my one weekend a
month. Would it matter? By high
school, I'd be his weak spot, the
focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed
pride. In college there'd be late-
night angst: 'What if I turn out
like the old man?' Holidays would be
forced smiles and unscheduled exits.
I mean, what girl comes home with
you if there's talk that Pops is a
rapist?
A beat.
DAVID
I can't stand the idea of being his
model of failure. Without him, I
drink. To cover the hole. To prove
to myself he's better off without
me.
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Dusty Wright sitting in the
lounger beside him.
David sits in a swing set, rocks slowly. He's simply looking
at the house. A yuppie woman opens the back door.
DAVID
(standing)
Sorry, just leaving.
We see David lying in the grass of recently-cut lawn.
A guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door.
GUARD
Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here?
Bitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protesters
flank the drive.
BITSEY
No thanks.
She turns and walks toward the highway.
The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers.
The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists:
They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint
signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder
doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large
black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey.
The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty
activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs:
"Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's
Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours."
At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign
leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain;
its letters run.
Pouring rain. As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms,
they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac. He carries
Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own.
BITSEY
Belyeu!
He turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper over
her head, Zack slouches.
BITSEY
Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?
BELYEU
I employ Mr. Wright from time to
time.
BITSEY
You could have said something.
BELYEU
(opening her umbrella)
That would have defeated the purpose.
Apologies if I caused you unnecessary
anxiety, but I'm paid to be
suspicious.
(handing it to her)
Thought I'd return this.
ZACK
Any word on the writ?
BELYEU
Denied. Tape went to a federal judge
two hours ago. Your videographer
friend made contact?
BITSEY
No.
BELYEU
What you got was definitely a snippet.
Could be he has more previews
scheduled. Best stick close to your
room.
BITSEY
How's David?
BELYEU
Holdin' up. I'm headed back over.
BITSEY
Tell him I'll take care of it, about
his son, I mean.
BELYEU
Will do. We'll talk later?
She nods.
BELYEU
Watch yourselves.
They turn from one another. Bitsey turns back.
BITSEY
(calling after him)
Mr. Belyeu.
He turns.
BITSEY
Were Dusty and Constance close?
BELYEU
Thick as thieves.
Bitsey nods.
INTERSTATE - NIGHT
The rain's lightened up. The motel's full. Lights are on in
ten of the motel rooms. The Kettle's lights go off, one after
another.
Rain. All the rooms except Bitsey's are dark. From within
comes a TV glow.
Behind a couple of trees near the woods' edge, Bitsey and
Zack hide watching him.
ZACK
Hairy.
BITSEY
Come on.
She turns back into the woods.
Bitsey and Zack emerge from the woods near the rental car.
They walk and speak quickly in the light rain.
BITSEY
...Because of the Berlin thing,
Constance knew the police would go
straight to Gale. In a way, he's
perfect. A high profile alcoholic
whose life was shit anyway. But...
ZACK
She was in love with him.
BITSEY
I don't know. Something. They were
close. She wouldn't want him dead.
They come to the car, get in.
The gas station is old, isolated on a country road.
Closed, dark. By the road, a single light pole illuminates
the area -- its light catching the drizzle.
Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey
waits by the rental car.
Bitsey sits in the car's driver seat. Zack stands by the
booth.
BITSEY
Don't move from the booth. Call the
second you see the truck. Remember,
let it ring just once. Then get into
the woods --
ZACK
I know. Go.
BITSEY
(pulling away)
Into the woods, Zack.
ZACK
Go!
Bitsey is in the woods, watches Dusty pull away in the pickup.
She hurries to the front door, enters.
Zack paces in front of the booth, checks his watch.
Zack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth,
drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch
the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong
to a car. He quickly hangs up.
Zack hugs himself in the waning drizzle.
ZACK
Come on. Fucking come on.
Bitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods.
The pickup is nowhere to be seen.
As they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing
beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching.
The car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle
has stopped.
The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate
shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He
runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist.
The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring
stop signs.
The rental car flies past a "Huntsville City Limit" sign and
disappears into the fog.
The highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork
reads: "TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles."
The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a
dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand.
She doesn't close the door. Starts running.
Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The
rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility
is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and
SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist.
She runs, and runs.
A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns,
starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves
around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on.
She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past
a sleepy farmhouse.
She runs, and runs.
She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway.
Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a
tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.
She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.
Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights.
They rise on hill and then fall behind another.
They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an
ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move
slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their
cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach.
The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas
Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION.
She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW
MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot
hear her. We HEAR NOTHING.
Dusty walks along the Ramblan. He carries a duty-free bag
