      THE MUSIC CONTINUES, As Harry walks, a look of stunned
        disillusionment on her face.

                                        LOUIS ARMSTRONG
                          (singing)
                    Pardon the smile on my face, my
                    friend/ Dreamin' of reachin' my
                    journey's end/...

                                        HARRY (O.S.)
                    It's certainly been said that every
                    knock is a boost.  

      Suddenly--  WOMP.  A BLACK MAN, age nineteen, lands on
      top of Harry. 

                                        HARRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Not sure who said it.  

      She's flat on her back, unconscious, as MALCOLM DAVIES,
      nineteen, the falling assailant, a little shockey, rises. 
      There's SOME IMMEDIATE AND ESCALATING PANIC FROM BYSTANDERS
      during--




                                                                (CONTINUED)      HARRY'S LAW 2j5941 - Pilot - SEVENTH DRAFT 6-17-10        3.

                                        MALCOLM
                    Oh my God!  Are you alright?  Oh my
                    God. 

      But Harry doesn't move.  

                                        MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                          (screaming)
                    Somebody call an ambulance!  Help! 
                    Somebody call nine-one-one!
                          (then)
                    Help!  Please don't die.  Please
                    don't die.

                                                              TIME CUT TO:



      Harry, strapped onto a gurney, head immobilized, is being
      loaded into an ambulance.

                                                              CUT TO:



      Harry walks, somewhat purposelessly, THROUGH AN UNLOVED
      NEIGHBORHOOD, AS WE HEAR THE MUSIC.  A PEDESTRIAN BUMPS
      HER SLIGHTLY, innocently, it startles her perhaps more
      than it should.  She gives a quick glance to the sky,
      makes sure nobody's coming from that direction... then,
      as she continues on... she stops... SPIES A SHOE STORE.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      HARRY'S LAW 2j5941 - Pilot - SEVENTH DRAFT 6-17-10        5.

      BIG SIGN "FOR RENT" IN THE WINDOW. 

      CLOSE ON HARRY.  For whatever reason, she's utterly
      captivated by the place.  A beat.

      RESUME

      HARRY steps off the curb to cross the street.  WOMP. 
      SHE'S SUDDENLY KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME BY A CAR; WE HEAR THE
      SCREECH OF BRAKES AS WE:

      ANGLE: A BMW SIX SERIES CAR

      FISH-TAILING, SCREECHING TO A STOP.  THE DRIVER, ADAM
      STORM, late twenties, LEAPS OUT.

      RESUME

                                        ADAM
                    Oh my God.  Oh my God.

      He runs to A GROUP OF MEN, movers from a moving company,
      CLUSTERED AROUND THE FALLEN HARRY.

                                        ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (to the Men)
                    Is she dead?  Oh my God, is she
                    dead?

                                                              TIME CUT TO:



      HARRY, on a stretcher, is being taken away again.

                                                              CUT TO:



      Harry walks down the street.  Headed for her new life.

                                                              CUT TO:      HARRY'S LAW 2j5941 - Pilot - SEVENTH DRAFT 6-17-10        8.





      Adam walks briskly toward the Laundromat, realizes there's
      TOTAL CHAOS GOING ON INSIDE; HE CAN EVEN HEAR WAILING.
