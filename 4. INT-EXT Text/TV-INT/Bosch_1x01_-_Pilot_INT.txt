Bosch sits at one of the tables next to Assistant City 
Attorney RODNEY BELK.  The Blonde he followed into the 
 CHANDLER, courthouse sits at the other table: SUNNY  MONEY 
mid-thirties, killer eyes, killer legs, exceptionally good at 
what she does.  Next to her sits ROSA FLORES, middle-aged.

A FULL JURY seated in the box.  In the public gallery, 
several reporters, including NATE TYLER from the L.A. Times 
and TV reporter GLORIA NEWSOME, as well as a SKETCH ARTIST 
poised to capture the personalities of the case.

Judge ALVIN KEYES, sixties, Southern and courtly, enters from 
chambers and takes the bench.

BAILIFF
All rise.  The United States 
District Court for the Central 
District of California, Judge Alvin 
M. Keyes presiding, is now in 
session.  All persons having 
business before the court, draw 
near and you shall be heard.
Be seated.

Everyone settles, including the Judge.2.


KEYES
In the matter of Flores versus 
Bosch, are we ready for opening 
statements?

CHANDLER
Yes, Your Honor, the plaintiffs are 
ready to proceed.

Belk stands, all 250 pounds of him.

BELK
Your Honor, the defense is ready.

Bosch is a defendant here.

KEYES
Very well then.

KEYES turns his Atticus Finch attentions to the JURY.

KEYES (CONT D)
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for 
being on time this morning.  We 
will begin our trial today with 
opening statements from the 
attorneys for both sides.  These 
statements are not to be construed 
as anything like actual evidence.  
The attorneys, being attorneys, may 
make some highfalutin  allegations, 
but just because they say it, 
 make it true. doesn t

Polite smiles and chuckles from the JURY.

KEYES (CONT D)
It will be up to you to decide if 
what the lawyers allege in these 
statements is in fact proven during 
the course of this trial.  The 
plaintiffs always go first.  Ms. 
Chandler, you have the floor.

Chandler stands and moves to a lectern that stands off the 
corner of the jury box.  She smiles and begins, making eye 
contact with each of the jurors in turn. 3.


CHANDLER
The judge is quite right when he 
 tells you that the statement I m
about to make is only a blueprint, 
a road map, if you will, of the 
case I will be presenting on behalf 
of my clients, Rosa Flores and her 
daughter Elena.  I would like to 
take you down that road a piece -- 

She shoots a quick glance in Keyes  direction, to see if that 
bit of folksy landed.  Bosch glances at Belk and rolls his 
 homespun approach.eyes at Chandler s

CHANDLER (CONT D)
This is not a criminal case.  You 
may believe that what happened to 
 husband and father my clients was 
criminal, but in this courtroom we 
are trying a civil matter.  It 
involves the fatal shooting of a 
man named Roberto Flores.  A loving 
husband and father.

She glances at Rosa at the plaintiff s table and then behind 
her to the gallery and ELENA FLORES, fourteen, sitting 
tearfully in the front row.  

CHANDLER (CONT D)
Most of all, this case is about a 
 police officer, who wasn t
satisfied with his job and the vast 
powers that come with it.  He also 
wanted your job, ladies and 
gentlemen of the jury.  And Judge 
Keyes  job.  In fact, he wanted the 
 job, the job state of California s
of administering verdicts and 
sentences, especially carrying out 
executions.  He wanted it all.  
This case is about that officer, 
Detective Harry Bosch, sitting at 
 table. the defendant s

As she turns to look at him all eyes go to Bosch --

FLASHBACK TO:



Chandler pauses and stares at the jury, selling it.  Bosch 
watches intently, already frustrated by her story.

CHANDLER
Ladies and gentlemen, we look up to 
our police.  We all depend on them, 
in matters of life and death.  Most 
of them -- the vast majority -- do 
a thankless job and do it well.  
What we are talking about here is a 
rogue cop, a killer cop, a cop who 
epitomizes the worst traditions of 
the Los Angeles Police Department,  
the bad old LAPD of Rampart and 
Rodney King.  A cop who one night 
four years ago took it upon himself 
to be judge, jury and executioner.  
Detective Bosch shot dead a man he 
thought was a killer.  But there 
was no legal basis for that belief.  
(MORE)5.

CHANDLER (CONT'D)
Mr. Flores had not been arrested or 
charged with any crime.  He had 
never been arrested or charged with 
any crime.  Roberto Flores had no 
criminal record.  He was unarmed 
that night.  There was no reason 
for Detective Bosch to consider him 
a suspect, to stalk him that night, 
to kill him in cold-blood.  The 
justice Detective Bosch decided 
Roberto Flores deserved that rainy 
night lasted only a few seconds.  
Just the time it took Detective 
Bosch to point his satin-finished 
nine millimeter Smith and Wesson 
and pull the trigger.  Twice.

Bosch follows the eyes of several jurors, leans forward past 
 Belk to see Rosa Flores crying quietly at the plaintiff s
table.  He sits back, barely masking his contempt.

CHANDLER (CONT D)
Ladies and gentlemen, the LAPD and 
the District Attorney took no 
action against Detective Bosch. 
They rubber-stamped his reckless 
and criminal behavior.  But thanks 
to you, Roberto Flores will have 
his day in court.  And you will be 
able to right the great wrong done 
to him and his family. 

 Bosch shakes his head.  Belk turns and gives a look:  don t
react.  He puts his hand on his arm -- Bosch brushes it off.

CHANDLER (CONT D)
The German philosopher, Friedrich 
 fights Nietzsche, said,  Whoever
monsters should take care that in 
doing so he does not become a 
monster himself.  For when you look 
into the abyss, the abyss looks 
into you. 
(then)
Ladies and gentlemen, that is what 
this case is about.  Detective 
Harry Bosch has looked into the 
abyss.  And on the night Roberto 
Flores was murdered, the abyss 
looked into him.

As all eyes go to Bosch,

FLASHBACK TO:6.



Chandler looks at each juror, in turn, and then says:

CHANDLER
Thank you.

As she takes her seat, Bosch exhales.  He tracks Chandler 
back to her table and catches the daughter, Elena, in the 
first row, staring daggers at him.  Unnerved, he turns away 
like a guilty man.

KEYES
We are going to take a brief recess 
before we hear from Mr. Belk.

BAILIFF
All rise...

As KEYES stands, everyone else follows --



Off the Courtroom Artist s SKETCH of Belk at the lectern PAN 
up to Belk, half way through his opening statement.  Bosch 
sits at the defense table, staring straight ahead, unable to 
look at his lawyer, who he and everyone else knows is second 
tier talent compared to Chandler.

BELK
Which is what Detective Bosch 
believed.  That his life was in 
danger.  A dark rainy night, an ill-
lit street, crime-ridden 
neighborhood, a dedicated detective 
in hot pursuit of a serial killer.

CHANDLER
(on her feet)
Objection.  An unproven 
characterization, your honor.

KEYES
Which is exactly what this trial is 
for, Ms. Chandler.  
(MORE)10.

KEYES (CONT'D)
I did not allow Mr. Belk to 
interrupt your opening, which, I 
might add, was replete with 
unproven characterizations of 
Detective Bosch.

CHANDLER
Yes, your honor.  I apologize.

She sits.  Belk continues, a little thrown by the 
interruption.

BELK
A police officer in threatening, 
possibly dangerous circumstances, 
trying to apprehend a suspect, is 
allowed, under the law, to use 
deadly force when he believes his 
own life is in jeopardy.  The facts 
of this case will show that Mr. 
 Flores ignored Detective Bosch s
repeated commands to stop moving 
and put up his hands.  He ignored 
repeated commands to keep his hands 
in plain sight --

FLASHBACK TO:



Back to Belk.

BELK
Detective Bosch reacted as he 
should have, just as all his 
training and experience taught him 
to -- with deadly force.  Mr. 
Flores had only himself to blame. 
His death was a result of choices 
he made that night. Detective Bosch 
acted properly, under the color of 
law...
(pause)
Thank you.

Belk shuffles over and sits.  Bosch glances at the jury.  
They seem unmoved, blase.  Keyes shuffles papers.

KEYES
Ladies and gentlemen, I think 
 enough for today.  We are that s
going to take the weekend, to 
separate opening statements from 
 case. the start of the plaintiff s

The courtroom starts to stir, relieved.

KEYES (CONT D)
 Please remember the court s
admonishment to avoid reading or 
listening or watching any media 
reports on this trial.  I wish you 
all a good weekend.  Thank you all 
very much. 

BAILIFF
All rise.12.


The judge leaves the bench and the jury shuffles through the 
rear door to the assembly room.  Tyler, Newsome and the other 
media types exit, Chandler and the Flores family in tow.  
Belk leans back.

BELK
What do you think?

Bosch pushes his chair back and gets up.

BOSCH
I think she ate your lunch.

He leaves Belk in a pool of his own flop sweat.



Bosch, behind the wheel, smoking, listening to jazz radio -- 
 something with momentum.  Freddie Hubbard sHub Cap. 

Hollywood Boulevard is decked out in candy canes and tinsel 
on the light posts and glittery Christmas scenes strung above 
every intersection.  Xmas in Tinsel Town. 

He turns into the Hollywood Station parking lot.  



Bosch goes past A COUPLE OF CUSTODIES cuffed to a bench -- 
one of them a drunken Santa Claus, his red hat askew.  He 
looks up at Bosch with blood-shot eyes.

BOSCH
...tis the season.

He steps through back door of the detective bureau.



Late afternoon, holiday Friday, half empty.  Holiday decs on 
the walls and a few desk-top Christmas trees.  But it all 
looks old and dusty and straight out of a box that is pulled 
from storage every December 1st.  The usual squad room 
clutter: file cabinets, counters, desks, every flat surface 
awash in files and paperwork.  A FEMALE DETECTIVE at a desk 
in a pod under a sign that says CRIMES AGAINST PERSONS is 
wearing a Santa Claus hat.

Bosch goes to a December deployment board nd runs his finger 
along the date boxes until he gets to the weekend.  He stops 
his finger under the names JOHNSON and MOORE.  13.


He turns and sees JOHNSON and MOORE, both overweight and 
middle-aged, putting on their suit jackets, on their way out.  
Bosch walks over, taking an envelope out of his coat pocket.

BOSCH
Crate and Barrel, just the two guys 
I want to see.

JOHNSON
Bosch.  Thought you were on trial.

BOSCH

playing Santa Claus, Barrel. Look 
at what I got.

MOORE

Bosch smiles.



Bosch slides behind his desk which is neat and orderly, 
stacked on both sides with files.  The desk is glass-topped 
and beneath the glass are several PHOTOS of different women 
 still working, and a few children -- victims in cases he s
 forget.   that he won t

There is a coffee mug full of pens -- on the side is the 
beret-wearing skull insignia of the U.S. Army Special Forces. 

On the wall next to the desk is a bulletin board cluttered 
with various reports and messages.  A yellowed printout in 
large block letters: GET OFF YOUR ASS AND GO KNOCK ON 
DOORS.Partially hidden is an old photo of five Special Forces 
soldiers in front of a cave entrance in Afghanistan. Bosch is 
in the photo.  Noticeable on their helmets are infrared 
 tunnel rats. O ne of the men holds up a goggles -- they re

There is also a 5 dollar bill pinned to the board with a Post-

Bosch starts looking through a stack of phone messages, 
pointedly ignoring his partner, JERRY EDGAR a/k/a J. 
Edgar(mid-30s, BLACK, stylish), who sits at a desk pushed up 
to his own so they face each other.  He sneers, tosses them 
in the trash.

EDGAR

CAMERA moves through his neat, austere house.  The dining 
room table is a work table, stacked with files.  The living 
 room is basic: no personal photos, just a print of Hopper s
Nighthawks over the functional couch.  A rarely used pre-flat 
screen tube TV.  No Christmas decorations, no indoor plants.  
A perfect place for a man whose whole life is his work, and 
whose work is a sacred mission.  The only touch of 
extravagance is the stereo -- no expense spared here.  Frank 
 Morgan sLullaby,s melancholy signature song wafts  Bosch 
outside to the deck.  The sliding door is open and the camera 
follows the sax solo outside to --



Late afternoon.  Getting dark.  BOSCH, behind wheel, checks 
car clock: 4:20.  He watches through the windshield as the 
BODY CREW removes the dead woman from her car and puts her on 
a stretcher, then covers her with a green blanket.  As they 
open the back of the van and start loading her in, his cell 
phone rings and he answers.22.

As Bosch turns on the ignition --



Cruising the canyon, listening to 88.1, the Long Beach jazz 
and blues station, Buddy Guy's cover of "Mustang Sally".  

Bosch turns onto Wonderland Avenue --24.



Bosch, driving up the steep, winding street, to dead-end 
traffic circle, pulls up behind a patrol car, cuts engine.



Bosch enters, Brasher behind.  Guyot, at his desk, Calamity 
curled at his feet, a large book -- Gray s Anatomy -- open in 
front of him, an open shoebox next to that, with an Officer, 
JULIUS EDGEWOOD, black, mid-thirties.  Guyot, wearing latex 
gloves, is comparing something in the book to what's in the 
shoebox.  Bosch nods at EDGEWOOD.

EDGEWOOD
Detective Bosch.  Dr. Guyot.  He 
found the bone.

DR. GUYOT
To be accurate, my dog found it.  I 
just called it in.

Bosch steps over to the desk, leans in to look at the dark 
yellow-brown object in the box.

BOSCH
This it?

DR. GUYOT
I was just showing the officer.

Guyot spins the book around: taps an illustration of a bone, 
posterior and anterior views -- and a small sketch of a 
skeleton with the humerus bone of both arms highlighted.

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)
 Those highlighted areas -- that s
the humerus.  If we compare it to 
the recovered specimen --25.


Guyot lifts the bone out and compares it to the illustration:

Bosch gives her a look, she steps back.  To Edgewood: 

BOSCH
You guys can clear.  I can take it 
from here.

Edgewood gets the message, glances at Brasher, nods yes.26.


BOSCH (CONT D)
 And keep this off the air.  Don t
want the media hyenas sniffing this 
out.

EDGEWOOD
Copy that.

They exit.  Bosch turns back to Guyot, pulls on a glove.

BOSCH
You told the sergeant that the bone 
had a fracture --

Guyot runs a finger along a vertical striation.

DR. GUYOT
 a break See the striation?  That s
line, Detective.  A healed 
fracture.

BOSCH
Healed?

DR. GUYOT
Broken and mended.  Ante-mortem.

 He holds the bone out to Bosch and he takes it.  While he s
studying the break line --

DR. GUYOT (CONT D)

usually comes from severe twisting 
of the limb.  

BOSCH

Off Bosch, pondering the implications --32.



BOSCH waits, "admiring" the tastefully flocked all-white  
Christmas tree hung solely with blue lights and ornaments.  
He holds the shoebox under one arm.  He shifts it to his 
other arm and it aggravates his ribs.  He winces at the pain, 
just as Corazon enters, carrying his camera.33.


CORAZON

in the waiting area.   The girl sits down and Billets strides

Bosch puts the shoebox down so she can see the bone.

BOSCH
Just take a look at it.

She does.  Then glances past Bosch and through the glass at 
her daughter, texting on her phone.  Sighs.  Then, softer:

Bosch, driving home, his hand holding the shoe box steady on 
the seat next to him.  As the radio PLAYS Ben Webster's 
version of "Bye Bye Blackbird" --



MUSIC continues. Dexter Gordon, "Round Midnight."  Bosch, in 
the dark, sleeping on the couch, SHOEBOX on the coffee table. 
On the wall above the couch CLOSE on the framed print of 
 Edward Hopper sNighthawks, a frozen moment of loneliness.  

Gordon's tenor mixes with the SOUND of a POLICE CHOPPER 
passing overhead in the night.  As the CHOPPER'S SEARCHLIGHT 
sweeps across the hillside --39.



Bosch, in uniform, full gear, alone, making his way 
cautiously down a pitch black tunnel, infra-red goggles, 
sweeping it with his high-tech light. Distantly, the SOUND of 
a CHOPPER from the world above.

Sees a faint cold purple white GLOW at a bend in the tunnel.  
Switches off his own light.  Holds up his hand. He can see it 
in front of him. Puts his hand down, moves slowly toward the 
GLOW, steps into the bend, around the corner, into --



Full of lost light.  He removes his goggles.  In front of him 
is a clear plastic DESK. Something laid out on the surface.  
He moves closer.  

SMALL BROWN BONES, perfectly assembled: a child's skeletal 
hand, GLOWING in the lost light.

Bosch crouches, crawls under the desk, lies on his back.  
Looks up. He's directly under the CHILD'S HAND.

On Bosch, staring up.  As it dawns on him what he's looking 
at, he's flooded with emotion, his eyes fill with tears --



His eyes pop open.  Off Bosch, wiping his eyes, trying to 
extricate himself from his dream to the SOUND of the POLICE 
CHOPPER making a pass, its SEARCHLIGHT sweeping the night --

CROSS FADE TO:



Late, deserted.  One GUY, who bares a strange resemblance to 
Michael Connelly, sits alone at the end of the bar, drinking 
a martini, texting on his phone.  The scene resembles the 
 apartment.Nighthawks painting in Bosch s

Bosch and Brasher at the bar, washing down steak dinners with 
signature martinis with the side car carafes on ice.

BRASHER

BRASHER

worried about what the jury will

A red jacketed waiter comes down the bar.

WAITER
Harry, last call.  You want me to 
back you up?

Bosch and Brasher turn to look at each other at the same 
time.  The moment of decision.



Bosch and Brasher make love urgently, their moves matched by 
the jazz from the living room stereo -- the Sonny Rollins and 
Branford Marsalis duet of For All We Know.  Like the two 
saxophones, they move in competing but complementary rhythms.

Bosch s ribs hurt. He makes wincing sounds and she pauses -- 

BRASHER
 sorry.  Am I hurting you?I m

BOSCH
In a good way.

BRASHER
Should I stop?

In response he kisses her fiercely.  As they resume --54.



They lay side by side in the dark.  Bosch reaches up to the 
lamp on the side table and turns it on. The action stresses 
his ribs, and she sees the purple blossoms on his side.  The 
 music changes -- Frank Morgan sYou Must Believe in Spring.  
Re: ribs and bruises.

BRASHER
Oh my god, you poor thing.

She gently touches his side.

BRASHER

BOSCH
Yeah. 

BRASHER
From the war or here?

BOSCH
 The street.  A classic shoot-don t

would shoot.  I guessed wrong.

BRASHER
How long were you out?

BOSCH
About four months.  No permanent

That still gives me trouble.

bureau.  There is a jar half full of bullet casings.  She 
 not lifts it, shakes it.  Looks over at him -- he s

off the floor and goes into the bathroom.

BRASHER (O.C.)
What are the bullet casings for?

BOSCH
Oh... nothing really.55.


The toilet flushes and Brasher comes out, now seductively 
wearing Bosch s shirt.  She gets in bed and climbs on top of 
Bosch.  She leans over and turns out the lamp.

BLACK AND WHITE, jumpy IMAGES distorted by a FISH-EYE LENS:  
TWELVE-YEAR-OLD HARRY running down a hallway, pursued by an 
ANGRY ADULT MALE with a baseball bat.  

Trapped at the end of the hallway by a blank wall, TWELVE-
YEAR-OLD HARRY turns to face his pursuer.  The ANGRY ADULT 
MALE raises the bat to strike, and TWELVE-YEAR-OLD HARRY 
raises his forearm to fend off the blow --



Bosch comes out of the memory -- too painful to stay there. 
Brasher is still sound asleep. 

He slowly gets up and gently puts her hand down on a pillow. 
He starts to get dressed in the dark.



As Bosch approaches Courtroom 4 he sees Lt. Pounds on a bench 
sitting next to CHASTAIN, an IAD investigator who will be a 
witness in a latter episode.  Bosch despises both.

BOSCH
Good to know, Chief.

He goes in.



All parties are in place and ready to start the trial.  Bosch 
sits staring, preparing himself for the onslaught of 
testimony that will depict him as a wanton killer.

KEYES

Chandler goes to the lectern.58.

No.

BOSCH

BELK
If you refuse to answer one single 
question in front of this jury you 
will lose the case.  A refusal is 
the same as a lie. 

KEYES

Bosch gets up and goes to the witness stand, passing a very 
pleased looking Chandler.  He is sworn in by the court clerk.59.

will tell the truth, the whole 
truth and nothing but the truth, so

CHANDLER
Detective then.  Can you tell the 
jury, please, how many people you 
have killed?

Sucker punched.  Bosch stares at Chandler.  Chandler stares 
at Bosch.  The jury stares at Bosch.  Out in the gallery all 
eyes are on Bosch.  He moves his stare from Chandler and 
looks out and clocks Rosa Flores, Tyler, Irving.  He sees a 
new face staring at him:  FBI AGENT LILLY, late thirties, who 
examines Bosch with intense interest.  Bosch doesn t know who 
the mystery man is but he recognizes him as law enforcement.

CHANDLER (CONT D)
Detective?  Do you understand the 
question? 60.


Bosch breaks his eye lock with Lilly and turns his gaze back 
to Chandler.

BOSCH
Yes.

CHANDLER
Then please answer it.  How many 
people have you killed?

A whispered buzz goes thru the court room.  Chandler milks 
the moment for as long as possible.  

CHANDLER

Bosch hesitates, thinking.
