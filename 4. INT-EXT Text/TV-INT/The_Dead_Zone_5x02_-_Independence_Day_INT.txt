                        This is Jammin' Jack, keepin' you
                        hoppin' and boppin' to the music
                        that helped make us the land of
                        the free, home of the brave and
                        birthplace of the five dollar
                        cup'a coffee!  It's one o'clock
                        and it's time to be good... Johnny
                        B. Goode.  This is Chuck Berry!

          A HAND SWITCHES THE RADIO OFF just as the music is about
          to kick in.  We PICK UP a young, attractive WAITRESS (25),
          MOVING through the hustle and bustle of the lunch crowd,
            balancing full plates above her head...

          FINDING JOHNNY and BRUCE in a corner booth.  Presenting
          Bruce with a ridiculously oversized burger.

                                        WAITRESS
                        Double bacon chili cheeseburger
                        and fries for tall, dark, and
                          handsome.

          Sliding a diminutive salad over to Johnny.

                                        WAITRESS
                        Garden salad, dressing on the
                        side for blondie.  So, where you
                        boys headed?

                                        BRUCE
                        Biggest fireworks display on the
                        East Coast.

                                        WAITRESS
                                (smiling at Johnny)
                        Sounds like fun.  Maybe I'll head
                        over with one of my girlfriends
                        after work.

          She lingers a beat, then realizing he's not taking the
          bait, sets the check down on the table.

                                        WAITRESS
                                (dejected)
                        You can pay at the counter.

          She walks away.  Johnny dives into his salad under Bruce's
          incredulous gaze, finally...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What?

                                        BRUCE
                        What?  She was totally into you.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (oblivious)
                        She was?

          Bruce shakes his head.

                                        BRUCE
                        Y'know, you might be able to see
                          everything, but sometimes you are
                        completely blind.  Come to think,
                        she reminds me of a girl I used
                        to date in high school.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah?

                                        BRUCE
                                (remembers fondly)
                        Marsha Harris.  Man, that poor
                        girl was crazy about me.  Took
                        her to the Junior prom.
                                  (confident)
                        A night she never forgot.

          moment; their hands connecting.  We hear a WHOOSH!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that right?

          Johnny can't help but smile.

                        What's so funny?

          A decisive beat.  Johnny relents, the opportunity ripe...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was just wondering which part
                        of the prom you think Marsha
                          remembers most?  Your Mom drivin'
                        you guys around in the family
                        station wagon or you comin' up
                        short on the good-night kiss?

          Johnny enjoys the moment.  Bruce is mortified.  He sets
          down the burger, rising to his feet. 

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll get the check.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You barely took a bite.

                                        BRUCE
                        Lost my appetite.

          Bruce walks off.  Johnny is left holding his fork...



          The car has been CRASHED, the windshield shattered. 
          Observer Johnny, steps up to the open passenger window,
          as he glances over to SEE Bruce crushed down in the driver
          seat, still gripping the broken steering wheel; his gaze
          locked ahead.  There's a SURREAL quality to everything,
          like TIME HAS SLOWED DOWN and SOUND ECHOES.

          Bruce slowly turns to him... a trickle of blood escapes
          the corner of his mouth.  Two similar streams materialize
          from his nostrils.  His eyes flicker as he eases back in
          the seat, taking a final strained breath as he passes
          away...

          Observer Johnny looks to his right, spotting an EXIT SIGN
          that reads, "BAYVILLE ROAD EXIT"... 



          watching with frustration as endless vehicles eclipse
          them.  Shifting his attention to Johnny at the controls.

                                        BRUCE
                        Dude, you think we can try and
                        make it before July fourth of
                        next year?

          Johnny's preoccupied with the Teaser Vision; lost in his
          own thoughts.  Bruce watches him, annoyed.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (snapping back)
                        Huh?

                                        BRUCE
                        It'd be nice if we get to the
                        harbor today.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm doing the speed limit.

          Bruce reaches for the radio, fiddling with the controls...

                        That's what he said.

                                        BRUCE
                        We have to get off this road.

                        That might be a problem.

          Bruce stares out the window in disgust.

                        Could this day get any worse?

          Johnny considers the question, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen, I really need to tell you

                          Whatever it is, I'm sure you'll
                        set it right.  Just let it die.

                        I'm sorry.  I had to tell you.

          A beat.

                        I don't know.  I've been touching
                        the inside of the car, but I just
                        keep seeing the same thing over

                        Don't worry.  We'll figure this
                        out.  In the vision you were

                        Must be the air conditioning.  I
                        better turn the engine off.

          Johnny kills the motor, simultaneously stifling the flow
          of cold air into the cabin.  Another beat of silence. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we should get some fresh
                        air.  Stretch our legs.

          Bruce stares off.  Preoccupied.  Annoyed.

                        I'm staying right here.  Thanks

          futon, perusing a magazine.  Wearing a tie-dyed maternity
          dress, a daisy crown riding atop her head.  The RV's
          furnishings are decidedly retro, right down to the shag
          carpet.  She looks up as...

          The side door opens to reveal Brian...

                                        BRIAN
                        Baby, are you dressed?  I got
                          somebody you need to meet.

          Nikki has her back to the door as she's slipping into a
          loose fitting shirt.

                                        NIKKI
                        Brian, I'm trying to...
                                (TURNS, stunned)
                        Oh my God!  No way!


          REVERSE

          Johnny enters behind a beaming Brian.

                                        BRIAN
                        Can you believe it?  It's really
                        him.

                                        NIKKI
                                  (starstruck)
                        This is such an incredible honor. 
                        Brian and I have every article
                        ever written about you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You do?

                                        BRIAN
                        We're way into the whole spiritual
                        nature of the cosmos thing.  Man
                        versus Nature.

          Johnny nods, but isn't sure what this guy's talking about.

                                        NIKKI
                        You probably already knew that...
                        being you.  Hey, why don't you
                        sit down?  We got plenty of room.

          Johnny hesitates, looking back; searching futilely for an
          out.  He finally relents; uncomfortable...

                                        JOHNNY

          Johnny sits across from the young couple.  They stare
          back at him, mesmerized.  An awkward scenario as they
          launch rapid-fire inquiries....

                                        NIKKI
                        So, do you see your visions in
                        black and white or in color?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well...

                                        BRIAN
                        Is there sound?

                                        NIKKI
                        Stereo.

          They smile at each other as they are clearly loving this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not exactly like that...

                                        NIKKI
                        Can you tell how something's gonna'
                        turn out?  Like if there's going
                        to be a happy ending?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Happy ending?

          Brian and Nikki share a conspiratorial look.

                                        BRIAN
                        We don't mean to be rude or
                          anything, but would you mind?

          Nikki lifts her baggy t-shirt exposing her very ripe belly. 
          Johnny's taken aback by such a personal gesture.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gee, I don't know...

                                        NIKKI
                        We just wanna' know if everything's
                        cool with the little one.

                        Nikki gets these feeling sometimes. 
                        Like when something bad is going
                        to happen.

                                        NIKKI
                        Not like you.

                                        BRIAN
                        It would sure make us feel better.

          Johnny hesitates, but the look on their faces is too much
          for him to ignore.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess I could give it a try.

          The young husband and wife take each other's hand, then...


          CLOSE ON NIKKI'S STOMACH

          Johnny's fingers hover over her belly.  Gentle contact...
          WHOOSH!

          Nikki screams in tremendous pain, a blood curdling shriek. 
          Sweat pours down her ashen face.  Her breathing strained
          and uneven. Intense labor underway... still in the RV,
          still stuck in traffic.

                                        NIKKI
                                (excruciating pain)
                        There's something wrong!  There's
                          something wrong with my baby!

          Johnny is emotionally rocked as he flashes out of the

          Two sets of expectant eyes locked on him.  Johnny musters
            a reassuring smile...

                                        BRIAN
                        I love you, too.

          Brian and Nikki smile and kiss; concerns assuaged.  They
          evolve into a passionate kiss.  Off Johnny's look as he
          feels like a third wheel at a make-out session...

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        It's called the sciatic nerve...



          Bruce and Brian try to comfort a panting Nikki; suffering
          through painful contractions.  Labor underway.

                                        BRUCE
                                (checking his watch)
                          Contractions are fifteen minutes
                        apart and getting stronger.

                                (panting, in discomfort
                                and sweating)

                        Means you have time.

          Bruce looks over his shoulder; heightened concern.

                                        BRUCE
                        She's okay... for now.


          REVEAL JOHNNY AND MASSEY

          side by side, watching things unfold from the doorway.

                                        MASSEY
                        How could you know this was going

                        He's psychic!

          Massey scoffs; a non-believer.

                        It's true.  See for yourself...

          He hands Massey a folder with some of Johnny's press
          clippings.  Massey studies them, then...

          Johnny drives frantically, pedal pinned.  He slowly looks

          HIS HAND

          comes away from his side, revealing a smear of blood. 
          He's been shot.  FLASH! 



            A frantic Brian wipes the matted hair from Nikki's
            perspiration drenched forehead.

                                        BRIAN

                          Something's wrong with my baby.

                        The baby's fine.  It's you.  You're

                        Just diet soda.  We were gonna'

          He turns back to Johnny... but he's already gone.



          Bruce wipes a wet cloth across Nikki's forehead.  Her
            condition has clearly worsened.

          Bruce climbs out of the RV, joining Johnny.

                        is, too.  We have to get her

          Johnny and Bruce share a slightly confused look.



          The DRIVER sits in the cab, perusing an open newspaper. 
          He looks up... alarmed by what he sees.

          Johnny approaches on a direct intercept course; followed
          by a swarm of other motorists led by the Bikers.



          Bruce sits in the driver seat, gripping the wheel; his
          hazy gaze locked ahead.  Johnny leans in through the open
            passenger side window.

          Bruce slowly turns to him... a trickle of blood escapes
          the corner of his mouth.  Two similar streams materialize
          from his nostrils.  His eyes flicker as he eases back in
          the seat, taking a final strained breath as he passes
          away.  Johnny takes it in; horrified.  He TURNS and again
          sees the highway sign that reads, BAYVILLE ROAD EXIT...
          WHOOSH!

          as he passes...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's going on?

                                        BIKER #1
                        Radio's sayin' the highway's about
                        to reopen.  We're goin' home.

          The Biker moves off.  Bruce reads Johnny's concern.

                                        BRUCE
                        Cops must've caught Felps.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (decisive beat)
                        I have to find Massey.  You start
                        warning everyone.  Keep them out
                        of their cars as long as you can.

                                        BRUCE
                        What do I tell them?

                                        JOHNNY
                        How 'bout the truth?

          Bruce hesitates at the suggestion, then relents and runs
          off.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (calling out)
                        Bruce!

          Bruce stops, looking back.

          He rights himself, pulling the door shut; yanking the gun*

          His breathing erratic, his skin pasty and pale; sweating*

          reacting to the shocking ramifications of the vision.



          Johnny peers in.

          REVERSE

          Massey is lying across the back seat of the cruiser;
            unconscious.  His gun tightly in hand, folded across his
          chest.  A pool of blood has seeped through the fabric of
          his uniform.


          JOHNNY

          reacts; Massey is Felps.

          He tries the driver's door... unlocked.  He slips in.          DEAD ZONE: "Independence Day" - ACT FOUR - 6/6/05 - PINK 46.



          Johnny eases into the driver's seat.  He casts a look
          back at Massey, then goes for the car keys.  They're not
          there.  He turns his attention to the radio, fiddling
          with the dials... more STATIC.  Something O.S. draws his
            attention...

                                        JOHNNY
                        What the...

          He reaches under the dash...


          CLOSER

          the radio's wiring harness has been disconnected.


          RESUME ON JOHNNY

          He reconnects the wiring, then sits back as we see the
          barrel of a pistol press against the nape of his neck.


          REVEAL MASSEY

          glaring at him from behind.

                                        MASSEY
                          I warned you.



          Johnny behind the wheel.  Massey now riding shotgun, the
          pistol held low; trained on Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Felps.

                                  (sarcastic)

                                        JOHNNY
                        The radio was never broken.  You
                          could've called for an ambulance
                        at anytime.

                                        MASSEY
                        Drawing police attention was not
                        in my best interest.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The real Massey is tied up in the
                        trunk.

                                        MASSEY
                        You should take your act on the
                        road. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Every law enforcement officer in
                        the State is looking for you.

                                        MASSEY
                        True.  But now I have an insurance
                          policy... a genuine clairvoyant. 
                        That's gotta' count for something.

          Massey grimaces in pain, shifting uncomfortably.  Holding
          his wounded midsection.  Johnny takes note...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need a doctor.

          Massey tightens his grip on the gun.

                        drive.  Now!

          Johnny starts the engine as we hear a cacophony of car
          HORNS... 



          Massey scans the horizon; pure desperation.

                                        MASSEY
                        Let me worry about that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This isn't gonna' end well.  I
                        know, I've seen it.

                                        MASSEY
                        Just keep that foot on the gas.

          Johnny's eyes scan the horizon.  His expression falls...

          It reads, BAYVILLE ROAD EXIT 1 Mile.

            appealing to Massey with an impassioned urgency...

          Massey lashes out, grabbing Johnny's arm; tight...

          Johnny stares back him; utter disdain.  Then his eyes
          shift beyond Massey, registering alarm.

                                        JOHNNY

          Bruce races alongside in the Murano.  Locked on them with
            a determined glare.

          He jams the gun through his open window.  Aiming at Bruce,
          he fires.  BANG!  BANG! 


  5858NEW ANGLE - THE MURANO

          Bruce's window explodes in a hailstorm of projectile glass. 
          One of the slugs catches him in the shoulder.  He swerves
          hard, losing control of the car...

          The Murano bucks wildly, spinning around to a jarring
          halt; across lanes.  Blocking the road.  Horns BLARE and
          tires SQUEAL with urgency, as fast approaching cars swerve
          past.

          The tremendous roar of a HORN calls his attention...

            A tractor trailer (or other large vehicle) barrels towards

                        And I can't let this happen.

          He reaches across his body, securing his seatbelt.  Massey
          takes curious note, cocking the gun; jamming it at
            Johnny...

          Johnny slams hard on the brakes.  The car jerks, thrusting
          the unbelted Massey into the dash; jarring the gun from
          his hand.

          Bruce shoots past in the Murano, clearing the cruiser.  
          Johnny yanks the wheel hard right...



          Johnny leans back into FRAME; scratched and bruised but
          without serious injury.
