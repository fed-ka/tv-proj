      A ROOFLESS SIGHTSEEING TOUR VAN rides past Dre's house as he 
      and the kids play outside.  A TOUR GUIDE on a PA SYSTEM 
      speaks to the TOURISTS in the van. 

                                DRE (V.O.)
                Like in my neighborhood, we re sort of 
                an oddity...

                                TOUR GUIDE
                And if you look to the left you ll see 
                the mythical and majestic Black family 
                out of their natural habitat, yet 
                still thriving.  Go ahead and wave, 
                they ll wave right back.  They are 
                just... just amazing.

       THE MYTHICAL AND MAJESTIC BLACK FAMILY - WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD - 
      (CIRCA 2014)  is SCRIBBLED in underneath Dre and the kids.

      Dre s cruising the parking lot looking for a space.  As he finds 
      one it s SWOOPED IN on by a WHITE SOCCER MOM in a MINI VAN.

                                DRE (V.O.)
                And look, I m not saying I miss the days 
                of being the  Big Scary Black Guy ...

      Dre SHOOTS the Soccer Mom his MEANEST 'BIG SCARY BLACK GUY' 
      MUG he can muster.  Unfazed, and without missing a beat, the 
      Soccer Mom SHOOTS HIM BACK THE BIRD.  On DRE'S GRIMACE we, 
      MATCH CUT TO: 


      Dre and Andre Jr. are riding in the car. 

                                DRE 
                Why did you need to get to school 
                early, Junior?

                                ANDRE JR.
                Tryout s are today.  Wanted to get a 
                little extra work in so I d be ready.

      Dre beams over to Andre Jr., and nods proudly.

                                DRE
                Okay, okay!  I heard that!  Work on 
                your handle.  Make sure you lock up 
                that point guard spot. 

                                ANDRE JR.
                No point guards in Field Hockey, Dad.

                                DRE
                      (not getting it)
                Right, right.  True.  Definitely got a 
                point there.
                      (then)
                Not really sure what that at all has to 
                do with what we re talking about though.

                                ANDRE JR.
                That s what I m trying out for. 

                                DRE
                For Field Hockey?!  Isn t that a 
                woman s sport?

                                ANDRE JR.
                Nope.   Lotta people think that though.

                                DRE
                A lot of people do not think about 
                Field Hockey, Son! 
                      (then, hurt)
                What happened?!  We ve been hooping 
                together all summer!  I thought you 
                were gonna go out for the team.

                Give those Valley Prep boys some of 
                the  Johnson family Jumper ? 

                                ANDRE JR.
                The  Johnson Family What?   Dad, I 
                don t think I remember you hitting one 
                  jumpshot.  We had to change  HORSE  to 
                   EQUESTRIAN  and you still never gave 
                me an  E .

                                DRE
                      (beat, complete denial)
                I m not talking about the accuracy, 
                I m talking about the form!  The form 
                is what the family is known for.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Right.  Anyway, I thought about 
                playing hoop, but all my friends are 
                  Fee-Hocking it this year so I figured, 
                you know, when in Rome.

                                DRE
                You re not in Rome!  You re in L.A.  
                No one in L.A. plays field hockey!   

                                ANDRE JR.
                Not true.  It s a real sport, Dad.

                                DRE
                      (mocking)
                Oh, yeah?  It s a real sport?  Maybe  
                I ll catch a game tonight.  What 
                  channel s it on again?

                                ANDRE JR. 
                      (searching his phone)
                  Okaaay...  ESPN Deportes, is showing a 
                game at three thirty five in the 
                  morning... next month.  Good one too.  
                Grudge match between the Crystal 
                Geyser Vixens and the Dasani Tigers.  

      Dre throws his hands up, exasperated, as he pulls into the 
      DROP-OFF LINE at VALLEY PREP and Andre Jr. prepares to go 
      into the SEA OF WHITENESS that is his school.

                                DRE
                Okay, fine.  Not gonna let you ruin my 
                day.  You wanna play  Field Hockey  over 
                the greatest sport in the world?  Go for 
                it.  Least you re playing sports, right?  

                                ANDRE JR.
                Thanks Dad.      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       9.


      Andre Jr. grabs his bag and begins to EXIT THE CAR.  As he 
      does, a neighborhood friend, ZACH, 13, (White, laid back, 
      perpetually matter-of-fact) walks by. 

                                ZACH 
                What s up, Mr. J.  Sup, Andy!    

      Zach walks into the building as Dre glares back to his son 
      through the ROLLED DOWN CAR WINDOW.

                                DRE
                      (re: Zach)
                Andy?!

                                ANDRE JR.
                Nice, right?  I think it says;  I m 
                edgy... but approachable.   

                                DRE
                I think it says;  I m an idiot... who 
                plays Field Hockey.  
                      (then)
                Andy s not even a derivative of Andre!

                                ANDRE JR.
                  Derivative or not, that s my new 
                handle and I think the ship s sailed 
                on it.  Nicknames have a lot of 
                  stickiness.  
                      (then`)
                And to be honest Dad, Andre s your 
                name.  It s who you are.  I ve never 
                really felt like it fit me.

                                DRE
                You re twelve!  You don t know what 
                fits you!  When we went to buy shoes, 
                the salesman said you ve been wearing 
                sneakers that were 3 sizes too small!

                                ANDRE JR.
                  I thought I was tying them too tight.  
                Still doesn t mean I m a Dre though. 
                      (then, getting ready to go)
                Oh and don t forget, we have to talk 
                about what we re going to do for my 
                birthday party next week.  

                                DRE
                Maybe I can find you a  throwback  
                Field  Hockey Jersey to wear to it.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Pssh... Yeah, good luck with that.  It s 
                mostly a European sport so getting--      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       10.


      Dre ROLLS UP THE WINDOW and and shakes his head, disgusted, 
      as he drives off from Andre Jr. and WE GO TO:


      The pristine mirrored finish of the RELEVANT ADVERTISING offices.  


      Dre sits in his car. Rainbow s in the passenger seat.  They 
      have been pulled over by a POLICE CAR whose lights are on 
      behind them.  A COP approaches Dre's window.  

                                COP
                The reason I pulled you over is because 
                you didn't have your headlights on.  

                                DRE
                But it's daytime! 

      Off this, Dre turns and shoots Rainbow another INCREDULOUS LOOK. 


      The backyard s been transformed into what appears to be a  mock 
      AFRICAN VILLAGE as the classic Ugandan ceremonial hymn, 
       Ngayaya  plays on an iPod as Dre, in ridiculous looking AFRICAN 
      GARB, goes over traditional African  Rites of Passage  practices 
      with a clearly unhappy, Andre Jr., who s holding a WOODEN STAFF.

                                DRE (V.O.) 
                  Operation Keepin' It Real was in full 
                effect.  And although it was off to a 
                rocky start, I still had high hopes. 

      Pops, watching on, is in a BLACK PANTHER UNIFORM (black turtle 
      neck, black beret, black leather jacket and black jeans).

                                POPS 
                What is this mess you re doing?  

                                DRE
                It s not  mess.   It s our culture.

                      (re: Andre s African garb)
                That ain t  our  culture! 
                      (re: his Black Panther fit)
                This is our culture.  We're Black.  Not 
                African.  Hell, Africans don't even like 
                us.  What you need to do is to turn on 
                some James Brown or better yet, have 
                this boy learn past the third verse of, 
                'We Shall Overcome'.  Damn song has 
                seven verses.  People forget that. 

                                ANDRE JR.
                Dad, not that this song that you ve 
                had on loop for seven hours isn t 
                great, and I m sure James Brown s nice 
                too, but since I m the one having to 
                go through this meshugaas, can I make 
                  a request?  How  bout some Macklemore?  

                                POPS

                hundred!  You should ve been eating

      Pops and Dre s BICKERING is interrupted by Rainbow, home from 
      work, comes outside to the scenario of Dre, dressed in his 
      African garb, arguing with Pops dressed as a Black Panther, 
      while Ugandan music blares and Andre Jr. holds a large stick.

                Not in the mood right now, Bow.  

                                RAINBOW
                Well, that s just too bad because 
                this, this has to be talked about.

                Come on, Junior.  Let me introduce you 
                to the Godfather of Soul.  

      Pops grabs Andre Jr. and crosses indoors.  Dre turns to Rainbow.

                                DRE
                Know this doesn t look great, but I could 
                really use a little support right now.  

                                RAINBOW 
                You know what?  I was actually trying 
                to be supportive when I called you at 
                work today to apologize.  But my 
                apology got a little derailed when the 
                  receptionist rerouted my call to 
                  Corporate Security who questioned me 
                for thirty minutes on my family s 
                  political affiliations and my 
                  husband s mental state.

                Um, well, Mr. Stevenson failed to fully 
                grasp the irony of my pitch.  So we 
                mutually decided to take the weekend 
                and think about whether or not Relevant

                Guess if you need to over simplify it--

                                RAINBOW
                You re about to blow this, Dre!  You 
                and your nonsense is about to send our 
                kids to public school!  I am the co-
                chair of a very prestigious, 
                  deliciously catered PTA!  Do you know 
                what the PTA meetings are like at a 
                public school?!  No.  You don't.  No 
                one does.  Because nobody goes! 

                                DRE
                So what do you suggest I do?  Bow down 
                and give up what I believe in just so 
                I can hold onto a job that allows me 
                to keep my family in this crazy world 
                we re really not even a part of? 

                                RAINBOW
                This isn t about us and the kids.  This 
                is about you.  And there s no winning 
                with you.  You're mad that Relevant gave 
                you the job because you're Black, but if 
                they'd given it to a White guy, then 
                YOU'D BE MAD SOMEONE BLACK DIDN'T GET IT!  

      Rainbow takes a deep breath and composes herself.

                You know what?  Do what you want with

                      (then)
                I ll support you, but this  keeping it 
                real  BS you re on, stops now.  I m not 
                going to have you running around, 
                  torturing my family.  Whatever issues 
                your working through... get over them!  

      Rainbow turns and heads inside, leaving Dre to his thoughts.  


      Dre, clearly bothered by everything, is shooting hoops by 
      himself when Pops and Andre Jr. come outside to join him.      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       29.


                                POPS
                I just hid another grape soda in the 
                  refrigerator next to something called 
                 Almond Milk.   If someone takes this 
                one, we re gonna have problems.  

      Andre Jr., sensing his father s mood, speaks to him sincerely.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Dad, listen, I get it.  You feel like 
                I m turning into a White boy.  But I m 
                not.  I m just being me.  I m just not 
                quite sure who that is yet.  Since I 
                skipped second grade, I m like the 
                youngest and shortest kid in my class.  

                                DRE
                Son, I know how difficult it must be 
                to feel like the different one at 
                school, but it s important for you to 
                hold on to your culture and realize 
                how special it is. 

                                ANDRE JR.
                And not that I don t appreciate what 
                you re trying to do, but honestly Dad, 
                all I m trying to hold onto right now 
                is my first boob.  
                      (then)
                You think I don t know Field Hockey isn t 
                exactly the sexiest sport around?  Trust 
                me, I know!  But I also knew that because 
                of that I had a great chance of making 
                the team.  I m a ninth grader, playing 
                Varsity.  That means something!  

                                DRE
                So... this was all part of your plan?

                                ANDRE JR.
                Yes!  Me and the Field Mob--

                                DRE
                --Please stop calling yourselves that.

                                ANDRE JR.
                Fine.  Me and my boys figured that if 
                we could just get our foot in the door 
                with the other jocks, we could get in 
                there and really make some noise. 

                                DRE
                So you actually do want to play 
                  basketball?      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       30.


                                ANDRE JR.
                      (smiling)
                Yeah, Dad.  But I suck at it.

                                DRE
                And Michael Jordan.  You do know who he is?

                                ANDRE JR.
                Yes!  Mock turtlenecks, Mom Jeans, Big 
                suits...

                                DRE
                Right.  We went over this.  You do 
                know him.  And the Bar Mitzvah?  You 
                don t actually want to have one?

                                ANDRE JR.
                Oh no.  I totally want one of those.  
                They re awesome!  
                      (then)
                But if the Rites of Passage thing 
                really means that much to you, I ll do 
                it.

      Andre Jr. gives his Dad a SHAKE AND A POUND as he crosses 
      back in.  Dre, shocked, turns to Pops who s overheard the 
      whole thing.  Pops equally shocked, SHRUGS, IMPRESSED.

                                POPS
                      (re: Andre Jr.)
                Hmph.  Who knew?  He wants to hold a 
                boob?  Woulda swore he was gay.

      Dre, reeling a bit, takes a seat in the chair next to Pops.

                                DRE
                How the hell did you manage to keep it 
                real with us when we were growing up?  

                                POPS
                  I didn t.  I kept it honest.   Keeping 
                it real  is just something some rapper 
                said in a song and your generation has 
                been running around for the last twenty 
                years swearing they were doing it.

                                DRE
                I really did screw this up, didn t I?

                                POPS
                Screwing things up is what being a 
                father s all about.  That s how we learn 
                to fix stuff.  Just remember son, whatever 
                you do make sure that it s right for who 
                you are.  
                                (MORE)      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       31.

                                POPS (CONT'D)
                And more importantly, who your kids are.  
                They re all different.  We try and have 
                our kids be little carbon copies of us.  
                But that s not possible.  Every time I 
                walk past that herb garden of yours over 
                there, I m reminded of that. 
                      (then, sincere)
                You re a good Dad, and I m proud of 
                you son.  Always.  

      Pops gives his son a sincere  POUND,  SHAKE, and HUG.   As 
      the two men sit for a beat, they re interrupted by Jack and 
      Diane who walk through the living room, TALKING.

                                JACK
                Did you see what Mexican Phillip did 
                to Armenian Johnny?

                                DIANE
                No, I saw what he did to Johnny the Jew.

                                JACK
                Oh, yeah!  That s who I meant.

                                DIANE
                Oh, well then, yeah, I saw it.  I was 
                with fat, White Mary when it happened. 

      As the Twins continue their conversation into the next room, 
      Pops looks to Dre.

                                POPS
                Still proud of you.  But not you re 
                greatest moment.   

                                DRE
                That s fair.

      As Dre looks to his Twins and hears his father s words, he 
      realizes that maybe he s made some mistakes.  On this we, 


      A YOUNG, HIP LATINO KID DJ begins to BLAST Drake's,  Started 
      From The Bottom  as Andre Jr. steps out, and sees a sign that 
      says,  Welcome to Andre s Hip Hop Bro Mitzvah  and all his 
      FRIENDS dressed in the same, but different colored, ADIDAS 
      SWEAT SUITS as he is.  

      Andre Jr. s face lights up with excitement as he looks on at 
      a CREW OF DANCERS, made primarily of ethnically ambiguous 
      ASIAN KIDS, who put their modern twist on break-dancing.  
      Dre s buddy, Zach, who's MC'ing the event, stands in front of 
      the DJ booth with a mic in hand rapping along to the chorus 
      of,  Started from the bottom, now we here,  while ironically 
      dressed in a six hundred dollar Maison Martin Margiela 
      hoodie.  A stealth VIDEOGROPHER quietly captures it all.  

                                ANDRE JR.
                      (to Dre)
                What is this?  

                                DRE
                Bar mitzvah, African Rites of Passage, 
                figured a  Bro Mitzvah  was the best 
                of both of those.  Sorry about the old 
                school hip-hop theme, I just couldn t 
                do the Macklemore thing.        BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       33.


                                ANDRE JR.
                What?  I love it!  Can I go change?  

      Dre nods as he and his son share a warm hug and Andre Jr. 
      crosses to go change.  Rainbow turns to Dre, with a smirk. 

                                RAINBOW
                Not bad. 
                      (then, to Pops)
                And you were in on it too?  Nice.  
                Might actually fry fry you some 
                chicken for this. 

                                DRE
                And babe, I m sorry for this week.  Just 
                don t know if I m ever going to get used 
                to how different everything is now.  But 
                I m glad you re here with me while I try.  

      The moment is interrupted as Zach, again hypes the crowd.  

                                ZACH
                      (into mic)
                Yo, yo, yo, big Bro Mitzvah shout out 
                to my boy Andy!

                                POPS
                If that kid had called me  boy  back 
                in my day, I d have had one of those 
                Asian dancers kick him in the head.  

                                RAINBOW
                Well it s not your day anymore, it s 
                theirs.  And like it or not, this is 
                them  keeping it real.     

      Off Rainbow s comment, Dre narrows his eyes as an idea sparks 

                                DRE
                      (re: party)
                You know, you might be on to something. 

      As the DJ scratches a seamless transition into JAY-Z S  Hard 
      Knock Life  and Dre stares on at this COLORFUL TABLEAU of 
      homogeneity that is his children's lives we, MATCH CUT TO:

      INSERT: A very similar, but more glossy, professionally 
      produced version of that same COLORFUL TABLEAU we just saw, 
      paired seamlessly on beat to Jay Z's,  Hard Knock Life.   
      After a beat, the scene fades and a SAMSUNG LOGO comes over 
      the images with a CHYRON that reads:  SAMSUNG BRIGHT:  CAUSE 
      KEEPIN  IT REAL IS COLORFUL.   Off this we,

                                                                PULL OUT / REVEAL:      BLACK-ISH     "Pilot"      1/9/14       34.



      THE SAME PICTURE WE SAW FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW.  
      After a FLASH, the picture COMES ALIVE and Pops walks next to 
      Dre and PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HIM.  

                                DRE (V.O.) 
                I felt like a father who was willing 
                to lose a battle here and there for 
                his family.

      The Johnson family BREAKS FROM THEIR POSE and goes about their 
      business, Dre watches as Rainbow HOPS INTO HER WHITE RANGE 
      ROVER, Zoey TAKES A SELFIE with her phone, Jack and Diane TEND 
      TO THEIR PERSONALIZED BONSAI TREES, as Andre Jr. PICK UP HIS 
      FIELD HOCKEY STICK.  

                                DRE (V.O.)
                And that felt pretty good.

      Dre SHAKES his head at his family but then smiles, satisfied.  

                                                 FADE TO BLACK-ISH:  

                                      END OF SHOW
