Debbie runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer
JASON. Her friend BARB trails behind.
JASON
Come on.
BARB
Coming.
JASON
You've got to keep up with us,
sweetheart. That's why your body
looks like your body and her body
looks like her body. Before, after.
Before, after.
BARB
You guys just go on without me. I'm
just gonna... fuck.
We see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San
Vicente. Pete's friend BARRY is part of the group.
BARRY
Hey, thanks for letting me join
this team.
8.
PETE
It's not really a team, it's just a
bunch of guys who get together and
ride.
BARRY
I know, I know.
A car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting
him. Pete bangs on the back of the car.
PETE
Bike lane, asshole! It's always the
guy in the fucking Infiniti.
Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her
feet down. In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball.
JASON
So why on earth is Pete taking
Viagra? What's going on?
DEBBIE
I don't know. I think maybe he just
isn't attracted to me anymore.
JASON
That is ridiculous. If you were my
girlfriend, I would not need a
Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra
pill. To try not to get a boner.
DEBBIE
But everyone gives you a boner.
JASON
Don't sell yourself short like
that. You give me a boner.
(whispers)
Barb doesn't give me a boner.
DEBBIE
Maybe things are just getting
stale. That's why maybe I work out
really hard. Maybe he'll be able to
get a boner again.
BARB
Why do you need to have sex, Deb?
Sex is the number one thing people
fight about.
(MORE)
9.
BARB (CONT'D)
You stop having sex, there will be
no more fights. I am living proof.
I have no sex, and I am the
happiest I've ever been.
JASON
I knew it. I knew you were not
having sex. I can see it on your
face. It's all puckered and pained.
BARB
I'm enjoying our non-sex period,
that's all I'm saying.
JASON
Don't you miss it?
BARB
Well, I wouldn't know, because I
don't have any feeling down there
anymore. I have nerve damage from
my C-section so everything is just
kinda-
DEBBIE
She's numb down there.
BARB
I could sit down hard on a fire
hydrant, and I wouldn't even know
that I was sitting. I could get
stung by a hornet down there, and I
would not feel it. You could put
anything in there, and I would not
know what the object was. I used to
pee in a nice stream, and now it
just kind of goes like a shower
head.
JASON
That is the saddest thing I've ever
heard.
DEBBIE
I think you need a family. Don't
you want a family?
JASON
No, I think I want to Clooney it.
DEBBIE
Clooney it?
10.
JASON
Yup.
DEBBIE
He doesn't seem happy.
JASON
Yeah, he is.
DEBBIE
No. He's lonely.
JASON
No, he's not.
DEBBIE
See, I think he has sad eyes.
JASON
Aw, you sweet little thing. He's
doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the
next lady. I can do it too, watch.
Jason demonstrates.
DEBBIE
I bet George Clooney is really
lonely. Just him and his pig.
JASON
You'd fuck him.
DEBBIE
I wouldn't.
JASON
So would you.
BARB
I would. I wouldn't feel it but-
JASON
You'd fuck him with your numb
vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's
thirteen inches, that's what you'd
find out.
DEBBIE
Do you think?
11.
Pete and Debbie get out of the car and walk down the street.
PETE
It's your birthday, you don't need
to go to the store.
DEBBIE
I know, just five minutes. I think
Desi and Jodi are fighting.
PETE
All right, five minutes. But then
I'm pulling you out.
We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the
trampoline outside. She does a full flip and lands on her
feet. Pete is nowhere to be found.
DEBBIE
Woo! Where's daddy?
SADIE
I think he went to poop.
DEBBIE
Pete!
A sign outside reads: "Tonight Only: Graham Parker"
Debbie drives the kids to school.
22.
Debbie runs Charlotte into the school. Along the way they see
a lot of parents. Debbie says "Hi" to them in the way that
lets us know that she does not know anybody's name. Debbie
says "Hello" to a PREGNANT FIFTY-YEAR-OLD PARENT, towing a
seven-year-old boy.
DEBBIE
Hi, any day now, huh?
PREGNANT FIFTY-YEAR-OLD PARENT
Not really. Three more months!
Another parent, BETH, and her adorable child walk over.
BETH
Katie's dying for a play date.
Let's hook these two up.
DEBBIE
That would be great, I'll call you.
Beth and Katie walk off.
CHARLOTTE
No.
DEBBIE
"No" what?
CHARLOTTE
No.
DEBBIE
What? She's sweet.
CHARLOTTE
She's evil.
As they walk into class, the teacher pulls Debbie aside.
TEACHER
Hi. Listen, Charlotte really needs
to get here on time because she
needs the extra time to just settle
in.
DEBBIE
Oh. We are on time.
23.
TEACHER
Being on time means being early.
DEBBIE
Oh. Okay.
TEACHER
Well, it's nice to see you in
class. We'd like to see more of
you.
DEBBIE
I come to--
The teacher walks away before Debbie can defend herself.
GRANDMA MOLLY
Hi Debbie!
DEBBIE
Hi, Grandma Molly.
GRANDMA MOLLY
How are you? I'm so happy about the
science fair. It's going very well
I heard. I love you. You look so
beautiful. Happy birthday! I just
learned it's your fortieth. Are you
forty?
DEBBIE
Yeah.
GRANDMA MOLLY
I remember when I was forty, and
then I blinked and there I was,
going to be ninety. My god, where
did it go? One day you're going to
blink, and you're going to be
ninety, and I won't be around to
see it. And that makes me very sad.
I'm telling you, I'm warning you.
Don't blink. Don't blink.
As Debbie pulls out of the lot, she lights a cigarette.
Debbie and Pete begin their "fresh start." Debbie tosses her
cigarettes in the garbage cans outside. Pete tosses a packet
of M&M;'s in the garbage. He throws out all of his cupcakes
except for one. He takes a bite, tries to throw it but again,
can't. He takes another bite, holds it over the garbage, then
takes one last bite before dumping what little remains.
Pete walks to the front door. His father, LARRY, greets him.
LARRY
Hey, Boychik.
A low flying 747 lets us know he lives too close to the
airport in a small house.
LARRY (CONT'D)
That's the eleven o'clock from
London.
(yells up at the plane)
Drop something valuable, you shit.
(back to Pete)
How are you?
PETE
That's loud.
LARRY
Every eight minutes, buddy.
Larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose.
LARRY
Line up! Line up for murder! Come
on! Who wants to be killed?
TRIPLET #1
I do!
LARRY
Okay, we're eliminating one, we're
cheaper already.
Larry sprays him with the hose.
TRIPLET #2
Murder me!
LARRY
Boom, dead. You're dead.
TRIPLET #2
I'm dead!
LARRY
All right, the kids are murdered.
That will save us some money.
PETE
Why would you have three kids,
anyway? I mean, you're sixty years
old. You have no money.
LARRY
Because Claire wanted a baby. If we
didn't at least try, she would have
left me. She was forty-five years
old. Nobody thought it would take.
(MORE)
45.
LARRY (CONT'D)
The doctor when we were doing in
vitro was winking at me like,
"Don't worry, don't worry." We were
very unlucky. And now we have these
three beautiful children... Come
on, I've got to tell you something.
The family's hanging out, relaxing at dinner.
48.
DEBBIE
Daddy and I are making some changes
so that we can be happier and
healthier, and we're starting with
this meal that I prepared.
PETE
I think it looks great.
DEBBIE
Doesn't it look good?
PETE
What is that, grilled cheeses?
DEBBIE
No, baked tofu. It's actually
really tasty. And the lettuce is so
fresh and tasty that you forget how
good lettuce tastes on its own
without dressing.
PETE
Yeah, dressing always gets in the
way of the natural taste of the
lettuce.
DEBBIE
And another thing we've decided is
to cut back on all of the
electronics we use. What we're
going to do is get rid of the wi-fi
and only use the computer from
eight to eight-thirty at night.
SADIE
How are we going to go on the
computer?
DEBBIE
We're going to have a hard line in
the kitchen.
PETE
Yeah, we'll supervise that.
SADIE
You can't do this. You can't take
away the wi-fi.
Charlotte holds her iPhone to her face using an app that
animates her mouth to look like a talking monkey's.
49.
CHARLOTTE
(from behind her iPhone)
No wi-fi! Ha-ha-ha!
DEBBIE
You don't spend enough time with
the family when you're constantly
on your iPhone and your computer.
You're only here five more years.
SADIE
So you won't see me after five
years?
DEBBIE
No, but you won't be living with
us. And you should get to know your
little sister.
PETE
You've got the perfect friend right
here.
SADIE
I don't want to be friends with her
now. I'll be friends with her when
she's twenty and a normal person.
CHARLOTTE
I don't want to hang out with her
when I'm in my twenties.
PETE
You're on your computer too much as
it is. You need to get outside
more.
DEBBIE
Yeah. You can build things. You can
build a fort.
SADIE
What?
DEBBIE
Yeah, build a fort. Play with your
friends.
SADIE
Make a fort?! Outside? And do what
in the fort?
50.
DEBBIE
When I was a kid we used to build
tree houses and play with sticks.
SADIE
Nobody plays with sticks.
PETE
You and Charlotte can have a
lemonade stand.
DEBBIE
Play Kick the Can.
PETE
Look for dead bodies.
DEBBIE
It's fun.
PETE
Get a tire and then take a stick
and run down the street with it.
SADIE
Nobody does that crap. It's 2012.
DEBBIE
You don't need technology.
Charlotte holds the iPhone monkey app to her lips again.
CHARLOTTE
No technology!
DEBBIE
Charlotte, put that down.
SADIE
I don't need to be monitored all
the time on the computer. I don't
do anything bad.
DEBBIE
Nobody said you were bad.
SADIE
I don't do things I'm not supposed
to. I don't illegally download
music. I don't look at porn like
Wendy.
51.
DEBBIE
She is up to no good. She's not
allowed to come over here anymore.
CHARLOTTE
What's porn?
PETE
No, she said "corn."
DEBBIE
This isn't turning out the way I
wanted it to.
SADIE
I'm not hungry.
Sadie gets up and stomps off.
DEBBIE
No computer.
PETE
Listen to your mom.
SADIE
I need to use it for my homework.
She walks off.
PETE
She's outplaying us.
DEBBIE
I know. She's tough.
Pete and Debbie drive down the Pacific Coast Highway.
DEBBIE
This is the best birthday present.
PETE
It's good to get away, you know? We
haven't been to Laguna without the
kids in years.
The car pulls up to a beautiful hotel in Laguna.
DEBBIE
I miss them already. Should we go
home?
PETE
Nah.
LAGUNA HOTEL - MONTAGE
Pete and Debbie hold hands as they walk the hotel grounds.
They enter their room, which has a beautiful ocean view.
Debbie jumps on the bed. Pete jumps on top to kiss her.
Pete and Debbie jump into the hotel pool together.
Pete holds Debbie in the water. They kiss.
Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna. They could not look
happier or more refreshed. They hold hands and smile at each
other. It is a beautiful day.
They pull up to their house, shut off the car and sit for a
beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of
the real world, not wanting their peaceful, loving time to
end.
PETE
That was nice.
DEBBIE
That was nice.
Sadie walks outside. Jodi follows her.
SADIE
Mom! Charlotte's crying. She's got
an ear infection again.
JODI
I didn't know what to do.
PETE
(to Debbie)
We're home.
Pete cycles with the crew.
Sadie and her friend WENDY run around the yard with Charlotte
and the triplets.
Larry answers the door. Pete is there with a framed drawing
made by John Lennon.
PETE
Hey, why are you in a bathrobe?
It's the middle of the afternoon.
Debbie is walking through the campus upset. She sees a kid
and darts over to him.
DEBBIE
Hey!
JOSEPH (13), the kid who insulted Sadie on her Facebook,
turns and sees Debbie.
JOSEPH
Yo, sup?
DEBBIE
I'm Sadie's mom.
JOSEPH
Sadie...?
DEBBIE
Sadie, the one you chat with on the
internet?
JOSEPH
Nah, man. That ain't me.
DEBBIE
Well, it was you, I saw your
picture. Did you make a "Hot" list
and not put Sadie on the "Hot"
list?
JOSEPH
She was not on my list, no.
81.
DEBBIE
You know what I'm going to do? I'm
going to make my own "Hot" list,
and you know what? You're on the
"Not Hot" list. How does that feel?
JOSEPH
It doesn't bother me. I'm
comfortable with the way I am.
She gets even quieter, scarier and more in his face.
DEBBIE
Maybe you shouldn't be so
comfortable with yourself. You know
why? You look like a miniature Tom
Petty. How's that feel? Huh? You
think that haircut's cool? It's
not. It looks like you put your
Justin Bieber wig on backwards. You
still comfortable with yourself?
Why are you wearing a tank top?
Huh? So you can show off your bald
pits, you little hairless wonder?
Cool tank top, man. So next time
you think about writing something
nasty on my daughter's Facebook
page, just remember me. Remember
me. I will come down here, and I
will fuck you up.
Joseph looks upset.
JOSEPH
Okay, I'm sorry.
DEBBIE
Wait a minute. Hey. Are you crying?
JOSEPH
Just let me go.
DEBBIE
I'm sorry. I'm not in my right
head.
JOSEPH
I understand. My mom is going
through menopause, too. It's a hard
time.
DEBBIE
What did you say?
82.
JOSEPH
You're going through menopause?
DEBBIE
I'm not going through menopause!
I'm not going to go through
menopause for twenty years. I'm
pregnant you little bitch. God damn
it!
She storms off.
Pete on his iPad laying in bed. Debbie comes in to talk.
DEBBIE
What are you doing?
PETE
I'm returning some emails.
DEBBIE
What time do you have to go to
work?
PETE
Like ten minutes ago.
DEBBIE
Want to be late?
Debbie's shirt is unbuttoned and she is topless.
92.
PETE
(not looking up)
No, I can't be late. Not today.
Pause.
DEBBIE
Do you see me? Standing here in
front of you? Half-naked?
PETE
Yeah.
DEBBIE
And does that make you feel
anything?
PETE
Come on. Are you trying to start a
fight?
DEBBIE
No, I'm not trying to start a fight
with you. I'm trying to fuck you!
PETE
Oh god, you know what? Today of all
days you need to give me a break,
all right?
DEBBIE
Whatever.
She exits into the bathroom. There's silence.
PETE
I didn't realize it was
intentional! I didn't say anything
because I didn't want you to be
embarrassed. I thought I was being
gallant.
No response.
PETE (CONT'D)
All right, fine, I'm an asshole.
Debbie returns, dressed.
DEBBIE
You know what your problem is?
You're never in the moment, you're
never present. You're never in your
body.
93.
PETE
That's not true. I am in the
moment. You know how I know? I want
to get the fuck out of the moment.
I swear, I can't win with you.
Pete walks out of the room. Debbie follows.
DEBBIE
You can't just walk away.
Pete walks Charlotte in. He gives her a kiss then walks back
towards his car. On the way he bumps into Joseph and his mom,
CATHERINE.
CATHERINE
Peter!
PETE
Hey.
CATHERINE
Catherine. I'm Joseph's mother.
PETE
(pleasantly lying)
Oh, right. No, I know. Hi,
Catherine.
CATHERINE
Our kids have gone to school
together for eight years.
PETE
Sorry.
(to Joseph)
Hello, Joseph.
(to Catherine)
(MORE)
100.
PETE (CONT'D)
I hear our kids have been chatting
online.
CATHERINE
Yeah? I heard that your wife has
been screaming at my son and I
don't appreciate it.
PETE
Excuse me?
CATHERINE
She screamed at my son.
(to Joseph)
Right? She threatened you?
(to Pete)
She cursed at him. He's thirteen
years old for god's sake. What the
hell is the matter with her? You
better check her meds and get them
right.
Pete thinks for a moment, not sure how to handle this.
PETE
Okay, why don't you back the fuck
off, because that's my lovely,
sweet wife you're talking about.
CATHERINE
Oh, I need to back off?
PETE
Yeah, you need to back off because
your kid is an animal. Why don't
you put him on a leash?
CATHERINE
(to Joseph)
Turn around!
PETE
If he insults my daughter again,
I'm going to hit him with my car.
Got it? In fact, if you insult my
wife again, you know what I'm going
to do? I'm going to show up at your
house when you're sleeping, and
I'll take your iPad and your iPod
or your iMac and I'll shove them up
your fucking iCunt. I've got
nothing to lose. Your kid is the
problem. My kid is a fucking angel.
I don't have time for this shit.
(MORE)
101.
PETE (CONT'D)
So I'm keeping it together. But if
I wasn't at school right now...
He pokes her shoulder.
CATHERINE
Don't touch me.
PETE
I didn't touch you.
CATHERINE
You touched my upper breast!
PETE
I didn't. I got right below your
shoulder.
CATHERINE
You got right here.
(to Joseph)
He hit my nipple!
JOSEPH
You what?
PETE
You're insane.
CATHERINE
Why would you do that?
JOSEPH
Did you just touch my mom's nipple?
CATHERINE
He just touched my nipple! Why
would you do that?
PETE
I poked you on the shoulder.
CATHERINE
I have very high nipples.
PETE
I touched your shirt.
CATHERINE
What do you think is under my
shirt? My breasts are under my
shirt.
(to Joseph)
He just touched my breast.
102.
PETE
Your shoulder, your shoulder.
CATHERINE
That's a funny place to put a
shoulder. My boob!
PETE
Hello! There are children around.
CATHERINE
This isn't over. You're going to be
sorry.
(to Joseph)
Let's go!
Pete and Debbie leave the school together, surpressing
smiles. They get in separate cars and drive off.
Debbie is speaking with Barb as they set up the kitchen for a
barbecue for Pete's fortieth birthday.
DEBBIE
I am so glad you're here. I need a
buffer in case it gets weird.
BARB
Well, I'm ready to buff.
DEBBIE
Here, grab these napkins.
Desi jumps in the pool in a small bikini. She is playing in
the water with the kids.
ANGLE ON BARRY AND PETE
BARRY
So that's the girl who works for
you.
PETE
Yeah, that's her.
BARRY
Seems nice. My wife would never let
me have a hot employee like that.
(MORE)
113.
BARRY (CONT'D)
Everyone that works for us looks
like they've been in some kind of
horrible accident.
Angle on Barb and Debbie.
BARB
You're comfortable with that around
your husband?
DEBBIE
Pete wouldn't know what to do with
that.
Angle on Barry and Pete.
BARRY
You think our wives are looking at
us right now?
PETE
Oh, definitely.
Angle on Barb and Debbie.
DEBBIE
They look like pedophiles.
Barry and Pete turn toward their wives, smile and wave.
Pete and Ronnie are talking in the backyard.
DEBBIE (O.C.)
Hey, Pete!
Debbie walks over with Jason.
DEBBIE (CONT'D)
Jason's here.
JASON
Peter, hi.
PETE
Hey, how's it going?
114.
JASON
Great, you look well. How do you
like what I've been doing to your
girl? How do you like Debbie's
after body?
RONNIE
It's nice.
JASON
Come on, show `em. Look at this.
(points to her ass)
It's beautiful. Look at that after-
ass. Now it starts here, but it
used to start here. And I brought
it up. You're welcome.
RONNIE
Are you a trainer?
JASON
Yes, well, but not just physical.
Spiritual. I'm sort of a guide.
PETE
You guys should talk. I think
you'll get along. Come here, honey,
I have to tell you something.
They leave Ronnie and Jason alone. The guys spot Desi
swimming in the pool.
JASON
Who's that in the pool?
RONNIE
Mine.
Debbie and Pete open the front door. Standing there is
Oliver. He gives a nervous smile.
Debbie looks at him and tries to be nice, but we feel her
effort.
DEBBIE
Hello.
OLIVER
Hello, Debbie.
She opens the door wider. They do not hug.
115.
DEBBIE
Remember my husband, Pete?
OLIVER
Oh, yes. I didn't recognize you
with the long hair.
PETE
(people pleasing)
I've been growing it.
OLIVER
Happy birthday.
He hands him a bottle.
PETE
Thank you so much.
OLIVER
Very old scotch.
PETE
Oh, wow. You know, I hope it hasn't
expired.
OLIVER
No, scotch doesn't expire. It
improves with age.
PETE
No, I know. Thank you so much.
The party is in full swing. Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry and
Barb are getting food from the buffet. Barb and Barry are
trying to help keep the conversation going.
BARRY
What do you do in Chino, Oliver?
OLIVER
I am a surgeon.
BARB
Wow, what kind?
OLIVER
Mainly of the spine. My specialty
is scoliosis surgery.
116.
BARRY
My mom used to talk to me like I
had scoliosis because I'm a little
hunchy, but that's a different
thing.
OLIVER
Well, you definitely don't look
right.
Larry arrives, with Claire and the triplets. Claire is
holding two of them, while Larry carries one.
The triplets now have very different HAIRCUTS so he can tell
them apart. One has a faux hawk, one has bangs, and one has a
buzz cut.
LARRY
Hello everyone! I'm sorry we're
late. I was in the lab cloning
myself. We're going to have another
seven more tomorrow... Look, we cut
their hair different so we can
finally tell who they are.
Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms,
simulating an elevator.
LARRY (CONT'D)
You like the new haircut, Travis?
TRIPLET #1
I'm Jack, damn it.
LARRY
Of course you are.
Larry puts Jack down and he runs off.
DEBBIE
Larry, this is my father.
LARRY
Really? How are you?
OLIVER
Oliver.
LARRY
Oliver. "Can I have some more?
Please, Oliver, I need a little
morsel." I love that movie. You
must get that all the time.
117.
OLIVER
Not really.
CLAIRE
I'm Claire, Larry's wife. Very good
to see you, but excuse me, I'm
going to go get the kids.
Claire runs off.
LARRY
We won't see her now for the whole
day. I'd help honey, but I've got
the blood pressure, and I don't
want to.
PETE
Dad, you want a drink?
LARRY
Yeah, a little white wine.
PETE
White wine? Okay, heavy stuff.
LARRY
So, who knew that Debbie had a dad!
Where have you been for fifteen
years? Never seen you at Hanukkah,
Christmas, Ramadan, nothing. How do
you get out of all that stuff? Do
you have a wife?
OLIVER
My wife is at home.
DEBBIE
Why didn't she come?
OLIVER
Construction. They're sanding our
deck.
LARRY
You let the woman sand the deck?
OLIVER
She supervises it, yes.
Sadie, Charlotte and Desi walk over.
DEBBIE
Hey guys.
118.
LARRY
Look how big the kids are. Sadie!
He gives Desi a hug.
DESI
Hi, Larry.
LARRY
(to Sadie)
Hi, Sadie.
SADIE
Mom. Who is Oliver?
DEBBIE
What do you mean?
CHARLOTTE
Is he your dad?
DEBBIE
He is my biological father.
CHARLOTTE
What does that mean?
DEBBIE
He and my mom had a baby and that
was me.
SADIE
Oh, so you're our grandpa.
OLIVER
Why don't you ask your mother?
DEBBIE
Yes, well, that would make him your
grandpa. Do you want him to be?
CHARLOTTE
Yes. Then we get another grandpa.
Come on!
Oliver gets up. Charlotte, Sadie and Desi run off. Oliver
follows.
LARRY
That was deeply uncomfortable.
Thank god the pretty girl was here
to divert our attention.
119.
Desi is gracefully swimming under water. She looks gorgeous.
She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look
grotesque, red-faced and awkward. They both reach for each
other and come to the surface.
JASON
Oh, hi. I did not see you there.
RONNIE
I saw you there.
DESI
Did you guys come together? Are you
a couple?
RONNIE / JASON
No, we didn't come together.
Absolutely not.
DESI
Sorry, the mustache is a little--
JASON
That's fair.
DESI
I just assumed.
RONNIE
This is a straight man mustache.
DESI
What is the different between a gay
man's mustache and a straight man's
mustache?
Pause.
JASON
The smell.
DESI
Excuse me.
Desi swims away.
Larry is talking to Oliver.
120.
LARRY
So, spinal surgery just seems to me
to be at the top of the surgery
chain.
OLIVER
Well, we're not cardio, we're not
neuro, but I like to think we're an
important part of the spectrum.
LARRY
Do you operate every single day?
OLIVER
Most days.
LARRY
Multiple times a day?
OLIVER
Three, four times.
LARRY
So what's the price range? Like if
I wanted--
OLIVER
Oh, I'd rather not say.
LARRY
It's so big you're embarrassed to
say.
OLIVER
I wouldn't say embarrassed.
LARRY
Are there hunchbacks today?
OLIVER
Of course.
LARRY
I've never seen one.
OLIVER
Well, that's because there are
spinal surgeons.
LARRY
That's because of you. Each time I
don't see a hunchback, you're
getting that much richer.
121.
Oliver smiles, amused.
LARRY (CONT'D)
You like The Beatles, don't you?
OLIVER
Who doesn't like The Beatles?
LARRY
Nobody.
Jason and Ronnie are talking to Desi.
DESI
So what's your sun sign?
RONNIE
Libra.
JASON
Oh, boy.
DESI
That's not good.
JASON
No, sir.
DESI
Not for me, that's not good.
Sexually we are completely
incompatible.
RONNIE
That's not true.
JASON
That's such a shame. That's as bad
as it gets.
DESI
What's yours?
JASON
I'm a Cancer.
DESI
Really?
JASON
Is that good?
122.
RONNIE
What does it mean?
DESI
That's really strange. Well, Taurus
and Cancers are sort of soul mates
of the Zodiac. We're like perfectly
compatible. I balance what you
lack, and you make up for what I
lack. And a quiet Cancer almost
always has a huge penis.
JASON
(quietly)
You're making me embarrassed.
Debbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb and Barry are eating.
DEBBIE
I wanted to make a toast. Thank you
guys so much for coming... Pete's
turning forty.
PETE
Weird.
DEBBIE
And we're ready to start this new
phase of our lives with open
hearts. Ready to just choose joy
and forgive everybody, so thank you
all for coming.
LARRY
Wait. Forgive who?
PETE
I think she just meant generally.
You know? Put the past behind us.
DEBBIE
And live without resentments.
LARRY
But specifically who are you
forgiving? I like to know the
details before I toast.
DEBBIE
Well, you and my dad and others.
123.
LARRY
I see. I know you have some issues
with me, but I'm curious, what's he
in for? Before today nobody even
knew he existed.
DEBBIE
My parents divorced when I was
really young and we don't spend
that much time together and I'd
like to work on that. Just like
we'd like to work on how you have
financial issues.
BARRY
(to Larry)
She means all the lending. And the
borrowing...
LARRY
I know what she meant.
Ronnie, Jason, and Desi talk.
JASON
You are a beautiful woman, but you
are not totally maxed out. I would
say honestly, you're a six. Six and
a half. I could make you an eleven.
DESI
Really?
JASON
When I found Deb, she was a seven.
And now she's a twelve.
DESI
I want to be a twelve.
JASON
You can't be lazy.
DESI
I don't want to be lazy.
JASON
Look at me. You cannot be lazy.
DESI
I won't be lazy.
124.
JASON
Do you know how she got her body?
Bodies By Jason.
DESI
Wow.
JASON
Say it.
DESI
Bodies By Jason.
JASON
Say it again.
DESI
Bodies By Jason.
JASON
And now just say Jason.
DESI
Jason.
JASON
Again?
DESI
(whispers)
Jason.
JASON
That sounds right, doesn't it?
DESI
Yeah.
RONNIE
What the fuck is happening right
now?
LARRY
When was the last time you two saw
each other, if you don't mind me
asking?
OLIVER
Actually, we had lunch together
last week.
125.
LARRY
And before that?
OLIVER
It's been about seven years.
LARRY
Seven years? That's a joke, right?
That's like two Olympics. And I'm
the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't
understand is that it's not bad to
help out a parent. And it's
certainly not bad for a parent to
help out a child. I'm sure Oliver
would agree.
DEBBIE
Are you really doing this right
now?
LARRY
Am I doing what? I didn't start the
toast.
DEBBIE
Are you really about to hit up my
dad for money?
LARRY
What? He does four operations a
day. It's perfect. It helps
everybody, and it relieves his
guilt from all the abandonment
issues.
DEBBIE
You can't buy forgiveness, right
Pete?
PETE
I don't think anyone's looking for
handouts... We'd pay him back.
OLIVER
If you two are in a bind I'd be
more than happy to help.
DEBBIE
No. It's not good to borrow money
from family members because it
causes resentment, remember?
PETE
Yeah.
126.
LARRY
What do you want me to do? Admit
that my life is shit? Is that what
you want me to say? You happy?
Aren't I allowed a little joy with
these children I never wanted to
have?
DEBBIE
You have never once stopped asking
us for money.
LARRY
Family helps family.
PETE
It's true. Family helps family.
Look, I don't expect you to fully
understand. Your dad left. You're
broken inside. It's not your fault
you can't feel love. There's
something that you can't -- this is
coming out wrong.
DEBBIE
You know what? I would rather have
my dad than your dad, because he
doesn't drive me crazy. You know
the best quality my father has? He
asks for nothing. I don't know what
the fuck he's thinking right now.
Look at that. Nothing. I don't even
know him. And I turned out
perfectly fine without his input.
LARRY
I just figured out what your
problem is. You hate Jews. Which is
so odd because your children are
Jewish.
DEBBIE
Don't play the Jew card, Larry.
LARRY
I'm not playing any Jew card.
DEBBIE
Seriously, it's used up.
LARRY
You can't use up a Jew card. That's
the whole point of a Jew card.
127.
BARRY
That's right. You can't use it up,
it goes forever.
OLIVER
You know what? I have to go.
Oliver gets up to leave.
PETE
Great. What a big surprise. Bye
Oliver. See you later. See you in
another seven years. Make sure to
say goodbye to the grandkids, who
you met today. You know, nothing I
do is right because of you?
Nothing. No matter how hard I try,
I'm just the asshole here, but you
know what I realized? It's you.
You're the asshole.
OLIVER
Good luck working that out. Happy
birthday and go fuck yourself.
Oliver walks out.
LARRY
See you when the Cubs win the
Pennant.
BARB
I'm going to light the candles. Get
it going.
LARRY
Maybe we should try the toast
again.
DEBBIE
Can you be quiet?
(to Pete)
You just threw me under the bus.
PETE
No. We agreed to let go and
forgive, but then you started
ripping into my dad like a crazy
person.
DEBBIE
I'm not ripping into your dad. I'm
just saying to him what you say to
me.
128.
PETE
Don't be such a ball buster.
DEBBIE
I am not a ball buster. You make me
one! I am a fun girl! I am fun-
loving! I am a good time Sally! I
dance hip-hop. I cannot believe
I've wasted my whole life busting
the balls of people who have no
balls. I am the only one here who
has any balls.
Graham Parker sings "Happy Birthday" to Pete as Charlotte
accompanies him on a keyboard. The party is tense.
Debbie looks over and sees that Oliver never actually left.
He stands in the back looking uncomfortable, quietly singing.
She's shocked he's still there.
Debbie smokes a cigarette at the side of the house. Sadie
appears.
SADIE
Mom?
Debbie turns, caught.
SADIE (CONT'D)
Mom! What are you doing?
DEBBIE
What?
SADIE
You're smoking? In the front yard?
DEBBIE
No, they're Barb's.
She walks away towards the house. Sadie follows.
Sadie storms through the front door after Debbie.
129.
SADIE
Mom! Since when have you been a
smoker?
DEBBIE
I'm not a smoker.
Debbie keeps walking down the hall. Sadie follows her.
SADIE
I thought you said smokers die.
DEBBIE
I wasn't smoking.
SADIE
I saw you.
Barb is in the kitchen with Pete and Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE
Mom, you're smoking?
BARB
Deb, you can't smoke, you're
pregnant. You've been doing so
well.
CHARLOTTE
You're pregnant?
SADIE
No f-ing way. I don't want another
sister.
CHARLOTTE
I don't want her as a sister.
BARB
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It just
slipped out.
Debbie turns the corner to find Pete standing in front of the
fridge, stress eating.
PETE
(mouth full of cupcake)
Are you really pregnant? Since when
are you pregnant?
DEBBIE
Since when do you care? You don't
want another baby.
130.
PETE
You have no idea what I want.
CHARLOTTE
I want an Asian baby.
SADIE
We're not going to have an Asian
baby.
CHARLOTTE
Yes, we are!
SADIE
They're not Asian.
DEBBIE
Sadie.
CHARLOTTE
We'll buy one.
SADIE
Shut up, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE
You shut up!
DEBBIE
Shut up, Sadie!
SADIE
Shut up, Charlotte!
CHARLOTTE
Shut up!
DEBBIE
Okay, Sadie. Shut up.
SADIE
Shut up, Charlotte!
DEBBIE
Okay, stop saying shut up!
PETE
Since when are you pregnant? When
did you find out?
DEBBIE
Will you stop eating cupcakes,
please! Stop eating cupcakes. Stop
eating cupcakes!!
131.
Debbie storms off back towards the foyer. Larry pops out from
the living room, stopping Debbie in the foyer. Claire and the
triplets are right behind him.
LARRY
Hey! We just heard. You're having a
baby! See, it can happen to
anybody.
CLAIRE
That is so wonderful. We're so
happy for you.
DEBBIE
Hey, wait a minute. You did leave.
And you didn't come back.
OLIVER
(getting agitated)
My first life was ruined. I did my
best with my second.
DEBBIE
So I ruined your life? I was eight.
133.
OLIVER
People do better when I stay out of
their lives. That's what my son
tells me. You think my life is so
perfect? I've got a thirteen-year-
old who's a pot head, I've got a
wife who's keeping Zoloft alive.
DEBBIE
You never said that before.
OLIVER
You don't think I want to talk to
you about this? To share it with
you? It's just not our way! We
don't talk to each other, we don't
know each other. I thought that's
the way you wanted it. How do I get
out of this? How do I get you all
to just help me down off the cross?
Debbie looks at him for a moment.
DEBBIE
You sound just like Sadie.
OLIVER
Who's Sadie? No. Your daughter,
your younger?
DEBBIE
The big one.
OLIVER
Your older. I know that! She's a
wonderful girl.
Larry opens the door and peeks out. We reveal that everyone
at the party (except Pete) is still standing in the foyer.
LARRY
Hi, guys. Some of us need to leave.
Would this be a good moment to
sneak out?
From the side of the house we see Pete storming by on his
bike, wearing his street clothes and a helmet.
SADIE
Where's Dad going?
134.
Pete exits his home riding his bike. He is very angry. He
rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the
frustration out of his body.
PETE
Best birthday ever!
Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard.
Pete rides down the street. A CAR passes by him. When it does
a fifteen-year-old TEENAGER sticks his head out the window
and yells to scare Pete.
TEENAGER
Bike lane, asshole!
Pete almost falls.
PETE
Fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass
motherfuckers!
There is no bike lane and cars going very fast have to swerve
to avoid Pete. A car honks when traffic clogs up behind him.
PETE
Go around!
A car makes a right turn, and Pete almost rides right into
it.
PETE (CONT'D)
Watch it!
He pulls up alongside Jason's van. Desi is riding with Jason.
DESI
Hey, Pete. Great party!
They speed off.
PETE
Yeah. The best!
Oliver and the kids are playing with an iPhone.
SADIE
Then you shake it. And then a
restaurant comes up.
Debbie walks outside.
136.
DEBBIE
Dad? Excuse me. I'm going to go
look for Pete. Would you mind
staying with the girls for just a
little bit?
OLIVER
(shocked)
Well, if you want me to.
DEBBIE
If you don't mind. You don't have
to.
OLIVER
Sure.
(beat)
Can I let Sadie show me the last
episode of Lost? She asked me if
I'd seen it, I haven't.
DEBBIE
That would be nice. Thank you.
OLIVER
Thank you.
Debbie exits.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
(to Sadie)
She said we could watch it.
Sadie turns to Charlotte, puts her arm around her.
SADIE
I'm going to let you watch Lost.
Come on.
Charlotte smiles, delighted to be accepted by her sister.
CHARLOTTE
Is it scary?
SADIE
I'll cover your eyes if it gets too
scary.
137.
Pete starts riding really fast and passes a car. When the car
stops for a red he keeps going, tears off to the left,
crosses four lanes of traffic in both directions and almost
gets hit.
Pete rides his bike up a steep hill.
He passes some other bikers almost hitting them.
Pete flies down a steep hill going crazy fast. Close up of
his front wheel shaking. It is as if he wants to crash.
He rides down the street when suddenly a MAN IN A RANGE ROVER
opens his door to exit his car and Pete slams directly into
the man's car door -- hard, breaking the man's window and
falling to the ground.
The man is an incredibly thick fifty-five-year-old.
MAN IN RANGE ROVER
Are you fucking kidding me?
PETE
You opened your door on me.
MAN IN RANGE ROVER
I didn't open my fucking door on
you. I opened my door!
Pete slowly gets to his feet.
PETE
I was right there! You are supposed
to look before you open your door.
I was in the fucking bike path.
138.
MAN IN RANGE ROVER
That's a blind spot. There's no
fucking bike path. This is a
residential section. Get your head
out of your ass.
PETE
Pay attention!
MAN IN RANGE ROVER
Open your god damn eyes. What are
you doing, sleepwalking?
PETE
You're supposed to look to see if a
biker is coming through. You're
supposed to look!
MAN IN RANGE ROVER
It's not my job to look out for
you. You look out for yourself. I
don't look out for you. I don't see
you. I don't now where the fuck you
are and what you're doing.
PETE
No one is ever looking out for me!
MAN IN RANGE ROVER
I need your name and number.
PETE
Why?
MAN IN RANGE ROVER
Because you're going to pay for my
door.
PETE
Why don't you pay for my bike --
and my face, you fucking prick!
The man punches Pete in the face where he's already bleeding.
139.
Pete looks stunned.
He punches the man in the gut, to no effect. The man punches
Pete back in the stomach. Pete sinks to the ground.
MAN IN RANGE ROVER
Don't disrespect me.
As the man starts his engine, Debbie runs toward Pete.
PETE
(in pain)
I'm going to write down your
license plate number.
The car drives away, revealing that it is new and has
dealer's plates with no numbers.
PETE (CONT'D)
"Range Rover of Sunland."
Debbie reaches him and holds his head up.
DEBBIE
What are you doing?
PETE
Ow.
