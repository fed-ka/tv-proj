  (RITA, SHANNON)

  RITA PARKS IN FRONT OF AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  SHE S STILL 
  IN HER WORK CLOTHES -- KHAKIS, RUNNING SHOES AND A BLUE 
   BED, BATH & BEYOND  SMOCK.  RITA'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTING 
  WIFE AND MOM WHO'S CHARISMA SHINES THROUGH HER MUNDANE 
  WORLD OF MINI-VANS AND BULK SHOPPING.  EVIDENCED BY THE 
  MULTITUDE OF COSTCO BAGS IN THE BACK OF HER VAN.  SHE 
  CHECKS THE CAR S CLOCK.  IT READS 4:58.

                                  RITA

                Two whole minutes.  Sweet.

  SHE QUICKLY TAKES OUT MULTI-COLORED POST-ITS AND CATCHES UP 
  ON COLOR CODING HER DAY-PLANNER.  SUDDENLY THERE S TAPPING
  ON THE WINDOW.

                                  RITA (CONT D)

                  (STARTLED) Aah!

  IT S HER DAUGHTER SHANNON, A CHUBBY NINE YEAR OLD WITH 
  FRIZZY HAIR, STUFFED INTO HER TOO TIGHT KARATE UNIFORM.
  SHE HAS BOUNDLESS OPTIMISM, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO 
  BACK IT UP.  SHANNON HOPS IN THE CAR.

                                  SHANNON

                Okay, how many have you had?

                                  RITA

                None. (OFF HER LOOK) You're not going 

                to make me pee in a cup, are you?

                                  SHANNON

                Mom, you gotta stop drinking in the 

                middle of the afternoon.

  SHE HOLDS UP SOME EMPTY CANS OF DIET PEPSI FROM THE FLOOR 
  OF THE CAR.                                                                                    2.



                                  RITA

                Least I m not with the other Moms at 

                  Starbucks mainlining lattes to get 

                through the day.  Buckle up, sweetie.

  SHANNON BUCKLES UP.

                                  SHANNON

                Oh.  Mrs. Foner says it s your turn to 

                be the school crossing guard Friday.

                                  RITA

                (RE: DAY-PLANNER) Friday, friday,

                  friday. Work.  Maybe Marlene can 

                manage the store for me.  Oh wait, I 

                know.  I ll just ask the Nanny.

                                  SHANNON

                Uh, we don t have a Nanny.

                                  RITA

                We don t?  Then who s that girl I keep 

                bugging to clean the house?

                                  SHANNON

                (PLAYING ALONG) My stupid sister?

                                  RITA

                No wonder she won t leave when I fire 

                her.

  THEY SHARE A LAUGH AS RITA DRIVES OFF. 

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    3.

  RITA ENTERS, JUGGLING THE COSTCO BAGS, HER HUSBAND S DRY 
  CLEANING AND THE CELL UNDER HER CHIN.  A CUTE, SEVENTEEN 
  YEAR OLD BOY, KIP, TALKS ON THE KITCHEN PHONE IN THE BACK 
  PANTRY WHILE DRUMMING ON THE SHELF WITH A PENCIL.  HE WEARS

  OF HIS FACE.  SHANNON ENTERS, PRACTICING HER KARATE MOVES.

                                  RITA

                Hai! (KICK) Hai! (KICK)  Ow!

  SHE ACCIDENTALLY KICKS OVER THE PHONE BOOK STAND.

                                  RITA

                Shannon, no karate in the house. (BACK 

                INTO PHONE) What if I handle 

                  Bridezillas all week?... Really?

                Thanks, Mar.  I owe you big time.

  SHE HANGS UP AND NOTICES A FLYER ON THE BULLETIN BOARD, 
  WHICH IS JAM PACKED WITH HER FAMILY S ACTIVITIES.

                                  RITA (CONT D)

                Rita, what is wrong with you?  You ve

                got the  Re-Sod the Playground Pot 

                Luck  Friday.

                                  SHANNON

                You know you re talking to yourself.

                                  RITA

                Am I?  No, I m not.                                                                                    4.



  RITA UNPACKS THE GROCERIES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PREPARING 
  DINNER.  SHANNON TRIES TO BALANCE IN THE KARATE KID 
     GRASSHOPPER  STANCE.

                                  SHANNON

                My health teacher says you're probably 

                having menopause.

                                  RITA

                Your health teacher?  When did my 

                ovaries become "Show and Tell"?

                                  SHANNON

                Yesterday.

                                  RITA

                Well, you just tell Mrs. Lenhoff I ve

                got a lot on my plate right now, but 

                it s definitely not menopause.

    HALLIEENTERS.  HALLIE IS A PRETTY, TERMINALLY BORED 
  FIFTEEN AND A HALF YEAR OLD, WITH JET BLACK HAIR AND 
  PLATINUM BLONDE BANGS.  SHE WEARS BROWN CORDUROY HIP 
  HUGGERS AND A T-SHIRT WHICH BARELY COVERS HER MIDRIFF THAT 
  READS -- "PIST."  SHE ALSO HAS A NOSE AND BELLY RING.

                                  HALLIE

                Yeah, you went through that last year 

                when you were a raging bitch all 

                summer.

                                  RITA

                Oh, do I hear the sweet loving voice 

                of my good daughter?  (TO HALLIE) 

                Would you mind boiling the peas for 

                me?                                                                                    5.



                                  HALLIE

                Could you be anymore sexist?  Just 

                cause I m a girl?

                                  RITA

                No.  Because you re a girl who eats 

                here and sleeps here and doesn t lift 

                a finger to help around here.

                                  HALLIE

                You really want me to lift a finger?

                                  KIP

                (CRACKING UP) Good one.

  HALLIE HEADS FOR KIP.  THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF EACH 
  OTHER.

                                  RITA

                Shannon?

  RITA STICKS THE BOX IN FRONT OF SHANNON, WHO KARATE CHOPS 
  IT OPEN.  RITA TOSSES THE PEAS IN A POT OF BOILING WATER.

                                  KIP

                (INTO PHONE) Hold on, call waiting. 

                (PRESSES BUTTON) Yeah?... who?... 

                Never heard of her...

  RITA STARTS SHREDDING LETTUCE FOR A SALAD.  SHANNON DIGS 
  INTO A COSTCO BAG AND PULLS OUT A PACKAGE OF CRISPY ONIONS.

                                  RITA

                Honey, don't.  The Crispy Onions are 

                for the casserole.

  SHE TAKES THE BAG AWAY FROM SHANNON.                                                                                    6.



                                  KIP

                (INTO PHONE) Kev? Wrong number.  Some 

                lady looking for a Rita.  Loser.

                Anyway, you get your car fixed yet?

                                  RITA

                Kip!

                                  KIP

                (INTO PHONE) Hold on, bro. (TO RITA) 

                Huh?

                                  RITA

                That call was for me.

                                  KIP

                  Nuh-uh. They wanted some chick named 

                "Rita."

                                  RITA

                I'm that chick.

                                  KIP

                You sure?

                                  HALLIE

                Rita.  That's her name.  Can you 

                believe it?

                                  KIP

                No way.

                                  RITA

                What'd you think my name was?                                                                                    7.



                                  KIP

                  (SHRUGGING) I dunno. Mrs. Clements... 

                Hallie's Mom.

                                  RITA

                Let me get this straight.  You've 

                dated my daughter two years, used this 

                house as your personal 7-11, and you 

                didn't know I had a first name?

                                  KIP

                Weird, huh? (BACK INTO PHONE) Anyway 

                Kev, you buying amps for the back 

                seat?

                                  RITA

                (TO HALLIE)  Honey, I know things are 

                tough at his house, and I don t mind 

                him hanging out here, but could he at 

                least use his own phone?

  SHE S ABOUT GRAB KIP S CELL PHONE OFF HIS BACKPACK, WHEN 
  HALLIE LUNGES FOR IT.  BUT IT S TOO LATE.  RITA S ALREADY 
  SEEN WHAT S ON HIS WALLPAPER.

                                  RITA (CONT D)

                (RE: PHONE) Oh my -- Is that you?

                Naked?

                                  HALLIE

                No!  (BEAT) I m in my underwear.

                                  RITA

                Hallie?  How could you?                                                                                    8.



                                  HALLIE

                It's my body, I can do whatever I 

                want.  Or aren't you Pro-Choice 

                anymore?

                                  RITA

                Give it up, Hal.  You can t go around 

                sending pictures like this.  What if 

                they got out?

                                  HALLIE

                I just sent it to Kip.  God.  And 

                aren t you the one who taught me to be 

                proud of my body?  That my vagina was 

                a beautiful thing?

                                  SHANNON

                Mom, she said vagina.

                                  KIP

                Dude, it s like  The View  over here.

                                  RITA

                Hallie, this is...  I m just so 

                  disappointed in you.  I thought you 

                had better judgement than this.

                                  HALLIE

                You didn t even hear my judgement 

                before you got all judgemental.

                                  RITA

                Fine.  Explain it to me then.                                                                                    9.



                                  HALLIE

                The way I see it, my body s at it s 

                physical peak.  I mean, look at me.  I 

                totally rock.  But one day, let s face 

                it, I m gonna get all old and look 

                like you.

  THIS HITS RITA HARD.

                                  RITA

                That s it.  You're grounded.  For a 

                week.  And no t.v.

                                  HALLIE

                Tragic.  I might miss "America s Next 

                Top Boring Mom".

                                  RITA

                Alright, no t.v. and no... no...  I'll 

                think of something, something good,

                something you'll really hate me for.

                                  HALLIE

                Don't bother.  I already do.

                                  RITA

                That's it.  Go to your room.

                                  HALLIE

                No.

                                  RITA

                Yes.

                                  HALLIE

                No.                                                                                    10.

                                        SCENE C

  (JAY, RITA)

  THE ROOM IS DARK.  A SHAFT OF LIGHT ILLUMINATES RITA'S 
    HUSBAND, JAY, IN THEIR IKEA BED.  JAY IS A HANDSOME FORMER 
  JOCK WHO NOW SPENDS HIS DAYS WORKING 9 TO 5 IN A JACKET AND 
  TIE.  HE HAS A WARPED SENSE OF HUMOR, WHICH COMES IN HANDY 
  IN KEEPING UP WITH HIS FAMILY OF WARPED WOMEN.  JAY WAKES 
  UP AND FEELS AROUND THE BED FOR HIS WIFE.

                                  JAY

                Rita...? (SITTING UP) Reet?

                                  RITA (O.S.)

                I still have an amazing ass, don t I?

                                  JAY

                Huh?

  JAY TAKES THE CLOCK AND SQUINTS TO SEE THE TIME.

                                  RITA (O.S.)

                And my breasts.  I mean, they aren t 

                as perky, but they have personality, 

                right?

  WE PAN OVER TO SEE THE SHAFT OF LIGHT IS COMING FROM THE 
  OPEN CLOSET DOOR.  ONLY RITA'S FUZZY SLIPPERED FEET STICK 
  OUT ALONG THE FLOOR.  JAY SITS UP IN BED.

                                  JAY

                You feeling sick or something?

                                  RITA (O.S.)

                Sort of.

  JAY WALKS OVER TO THE CLOSET.  RITA WEARS A LARGE T-SHIRT 
  AND SWEATS AND HAS OLD YEARBOOKS, PHOTOGRAPHS, AND LETTERS 
  SPREAD AROUND HER.

                                  JAY

                Want a Tylenol PM?                                                                                    12.



                                  RITA

                Not that kind of sick.  More like sick 

                of my life.  I don't know who I am 

                anymore.  Mrs. Jay Clements?  Hallie's 

                Mom?  The lady in the shapeless blue 

                smock at Bed, Bath & Beyond? 

                                  JAY

                  Okay, I'mgonna need the Tylenol PM.

                                  RITA

                I'm serious, Jay.  What happened to 

                Rita?  You know,  life of the party, 

                sex, drugs, rock  n roll, first girl 

                to embrace the acid washed look  Rita.

                I wanna find her again.

                                  JAY

                And you think you'll find her in 

                there?

                                  RITA

                No.  In here.

  RITA HANDS JAY ANOTHER PICTURE.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                And here.

  RITA HANDS JAY ANOTHER PICTURE.

                                  JAY

                (RE: PICTURE) At a Fleetwood Mac

                concert at Pine Knob?                                                                                    13.



                                  RITA

                Look at me.  Look how cool I was.

                                  JAY

                Honey, if you want to acid wash your 

                Mommy jeans, go for it.

                                  RITA

                Not the look of my clothes.  The look 

                in my eyes. (SHE HOLDS UP A POLAROID 

                PICTURE) I had a sparkle then.  I was 

                so free and I don't know... I thought 

                I could do anything.

                                  JAY

                You were stoned.

                                  RITA

                (RE: PICTURE) Oh.  That explains why 

                I'm clutching two candy apples and 

                Screaming Yellow Zonkers.

  JAY SITS DOWN ON THE CLOSET FLOOR OPPOSITE HER, 
    INTERTWINING THEIR LEGS.  THEY EXHIBIT A COMFORTABLE, 
  LOVING FAMILIARITY. 

                                  JAY

                Wild guess.  Did you pull out another 

                grey hair today?

                                  RITA

                I just want to be a little happier.

                It's as simple as that.

                                  JAY

                  Well, how're you gonna do that?                                                                                    14.



                                  RITA

                Wish I knew.

                                  JAY

                You open for suggestions?

  JAY RUBS HIS FOOT ALONG HERS, THEN UP HER CALF TO HER KNEE.

                                  RITA

                Jay...

  HIS FOOT REACHES HER THIGH.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                Jay, this isn't going to fix anything.

                                  JAY

                Usually does.

  WITH A GLEAM IN HIS EYE, JAY REACHES UP AND PULLS THE 
  STRING TO THE LIGHT BULB.  THE ROOM GOES DARK.

                                  RITA (V.O.)

                Well, actually it hasn't... not for a 

                while.

  THE LIGHT COMES BACK ON.

                                  JAY

                Excuse me?

                                  RITA

                Come on, when was the last time we had 

                sex?

                                  JAY

                Saturday.

                                  RITA

                No. Youhad sex Saturday.                                                                                    15.



                                  JAY

                You didn't?

  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD.

                                  JAY (CONT'D)

                Then a couple weekends ago, after Owen 

                and Audrey s barbecue. (OFF HER LOOK) 

                Not then either?  Okay, how 'bout...

  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD AGAIN.

                                  JAY (CONT'D)

                So I'm not satisfying you.  That's 

                what this is about?

                                  RITA

                No, I'm not satisfying myself.  I 

                don't seem to be enjoying anything 

                lately.  Even when we re in bed, I m 

                thinking about the zillion unchecked 

                things on my  To Do  list.  (PATTING 

                HIS FOOT) You can relax, your 

                manhood's intact.  This is about me. 

                (LOOKING AT PICTURE) Whoever that is.

  JAY TAKES THE BOX OF PICTURES AWAY FROM RITA.

                                  JAY

                  I'm gonna put these back, honey.  You 

                shouldn't dwell on the past.  It 

                always looks better than it really 

                was.  I mean, Fleetwood Mac? C'mon,

                they sucked.                                                                                    16.



                                  RITA

                We re not having the Beatles-are-the-

                    best-band-ever conversation now.

                                  JAY

                Go on, name one group that's sold more 

                albums over more decades.

                                  RITA

                  Goodnight. I'm going to bed.

  SHE RUFFLES HIS HAIR, THEN STARTS OUT OF THE CLOSET.

                                  JAY

                That's because you know I'm right.

                                  RITA

                It's because I'm tired and I have to 

                be up in four hours to feed the kids 

                and supervise a shipment of Swiffers.

                (LOOKING BACK AT HIM) You coming?

  JAY IS LOOKING THROUGH THE BOX OF PICTURES.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                Jay?

                                  JAY

                I'm getting transplants.

                                  RITA

                What?

                                  JAY

                Look how much hair I had.  I miss my 

                bangs.  I miss doing this.

  HE FLICKS IMAGINARY BANGS.                                                                                    17.



                                  RITA

                Oh boy...

                                  JAY

                (RE: PICTURES) And check out me in 

                  these Speedos...

  SHAKING HER HEAD, RITA CLIMBS IN BED AND TURNS OFF THE 
  LIGHT.

                                  JAY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

                Does our HMO cover liposuction?

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    18.




                                      SCENE D

  (RITA, PATTY)

  THE GARAGE IS FILLED WITH YEARS OF SUBURBAN RESIDUE.
  GARDEN TOOLS MIXED IN WITH SPORTS EQUIPMENT, UNFINISHED 
  HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS, DISCARDED DOLLS AND TOYS.  RITA 
  ENTERS AND DUMPS CLOTHES INTO THE WASHING MACHINE.  AS SHE 
  REACHES FOR THE DETERGENT, SOMETHING CATCHES HER EYE.
  PERCHED UP IN THE RAFTERS, BEHIND A GARDEN HOSE, IS AN OLD 
  DUSTY GUITAR CASE.

  RITA CLIMBS ONTO THE WASHING MACHINE AND SWATS AT THE CASE.
  SHE MANAGES TO KNOCK IT OUT, BUT AS IT FALLS, SHE LOSES HER 
  BALANCE AND HAS TO GRAB A RAFTER FOR SUPPORT.  AS HER LEGS 
  REACH FOR THE WASHING MACHINE, HER FOOT HITS A BUTTON WHICH 
  CAUSES THE GARAGE DOOR TO OPEN.

  STANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY, SORTING THROUGH HER BAG OF MAIL, 
    IS PATTYMANNIX, THE LOCAL POSTAL CARRIER.  SHE IS A 
    CHARISMATIC, AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO CAN'T SEEM TO STAY 
  OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.  SHE WEARS THE STANDARD 
  UNIFORM -- BLUE SHORTS, SHIRT AND KNEE-HIGHS.

                                  RITA

                Help.

                                  PATTY

                Uh-uh.  Can't get involved.

                                  RITA

                The ladder.  Over there.

                                  PATTY

                Sorry.  That's how I got transferred 

                to this neighborhood.  They said, 

                'Patty, you get too involved with 

                people on your route.'  I said, "that 

                is a bunch of bull -- "

                                  RITA

                Hurry.                                                                                    19.



                                  PATTY

                Okay, there was one incident.  But as 

                God is my witness, I was only trying 

                to help Mrs. G. Wilner stuff those 

                garbage bags in the can.  How was I 

                supposed to know Mr. Wilner was in 

                 em?

                                  RITA

                Please!  I'm going to fall!

                                  PATTY

                  I m gonna lose my pension.

  PATTY QUICKLY DRAGS OVER THE LADDER AND HOLDS IT STEADY 
  WHILE RITA CLIMBS DOWN.

                                  RITA

                (OUT OF BREATH) Thank God you came.

                                  PATTY

                So next Christmas you'll do better 

                than that Happy Meal gift certificate?

                                  RITA

                I was trying to get my guitar.  I used 

                to play.

                                  PATTY

                You?

                                  RITA

                What do you mean "you"?

                                  PATTY

                I mean, you don't look the type.                                                                                    20.



                                  RITA

                What about me's not the type? C mon,

                be brutal.  I can take it.

                                  PATTY

                Don t you have any friends who can do 

                this intervention?

                                  RITA

                Sure... well, not really.  Most of my 

                friends now are  Mommy friends .  And 

                my old gang?  They stopped emailing

                somewhere between potty training and 

                training bras.

  PATTY SIGHS, PUTS HER SACK OF MAIL ON JAY S TOOL TABLE, 
  THEN GIVES RITA THE ONCE OVER.

                                  PATTY

                Okay, let's start with those clog 

                slippers you ordered from Land s 

                End...

                                  RITA

                Forget it.  I can't take it.

  DEJECTED, RITA SITS ON A RUSTY AB CRUNCHER.

                                  PATTY

                Now don't get all unglued, Mrs. R. 

                Clements.

                                  RITA

                It's Rita. R-I-T-A. Why can't 

                anybody remember that?!                                                                                    21.



                                  PATTY

                Now look what I've done. (RUMMAGING 

                THROUGH HER BAG) Would a free sample 

                  of Jergens hand lotion chill you out?

  RITA SHOOTS HER A LOOK.

                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                I was being kind.  I could've offered 

                you the Nivea anti-aging serum.

  PATTY SITS DOWN NEXT TO HER ON A LAWNMOWER.

                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                You know,  Rita , just because you 

                don't look the type, doesn't mean you 

                can't be the type.  For instance, I 

                happen to play a mean musical 

                instrument myself.  Organ.  For Temple 

                  Beth Acheim.

                                  RITA

                You're Jewish?

                                  PATTY

                Oh no, I belong to First Baptist over 

                on Six Mile and Dequinder.

                                  RITA

                Why don't you play there?

                                  PATTY

                Banned from the premises.  Like it's 

                my fault I saw Reverend Campbell 

                embracing more than just the Lord.                                                                                    22.



                                  RITA

                I better check on my laundry.  Thanks 

                for the help.

  RITA RETURNS TO THE WASHER.

                                  PATTY

                Well, now that I'm off my feet, let me 

                hear you play something.

  PATTY OPENS THE JERGENS SAMPLE AND APPLIES THE LOTION TO 
  HER ELBOWS AND KNEES.

                                  RITA

                Now? Nah, I couldn't.

                                  PATTY

                Why not?  You practically killed 

                yourself getting the damn guitar.

                                  RITA

                I'm pretty rusty.  It's been a few 

                years.

  RITA PUTS THE GUITAR IN A CORNER BY THE SHOVELS AND RAKES.

                                  PATTY

                Listen, I'm not one to pry...

                                  RITA

                Yes, I can tell.

                                  PATTY

                ... but you learn a lot about folks in 

                this job, and seems to me you're on 

                the verge of a meltdown.  If I were 

                you, I'd quit feeling sorry for myself 

                and do something about it. 

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    23.


                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                (RE: HAND LOTION) Whew-ee! This stuff 

                stinks.  No wonder they have to give 

                it away.

                                  RITA

                Well, thanks again.  I'll just take my 

                mail.

                                  PATTY

                Now I know what type you are.  The 

                "all talk, no action" type.

  PATTY DROPS RITA'S MAIL ON A SOLOFLEX MACHINE AND STARTS 
  DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.

                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                (CALLING BACK) At least Mrs. G. Wilner

                had enough guts to do something about 

                her problem.

  SHE EXITS.  A BEAT.  RITA LOOKS AT THE GUITAR CASE.  SHE 
  WALKS OVER AND OPENS IT.  INSIDE, SHE FINDS HER OLD GUITAR 
  AND DECIDES TO TRY IT ON FOR SIZE. SHE STRUMS A FEW 
  CHORDS.  OVER THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S FENCE, PATTY'S HEAD 
  POPS UP.  SHE SEES RITA AND SMILES TO HERSELF.  SOMETIMES 
  IT PAYS TO GET INVOLVED.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    24.




                                      SCENE E

  (RITA, JAY, SHANNON, KIP, HALLIE)

  RITA SETS THE TABLE BETWEEN STIRS OF TOMATO SAUCE ON THE 
  STOVE.  SHANNON WATERS HER POTATO PLANT SCIENCE PROJECT.
  KIP LOOKS AT A CAR MAGAZINE, WHILE DRUMMING ON THE TABLE 
  WITH HIS SILVERWARE.  JAY ENTERS IN A SHORT SLEEVE BUTTON 
  DOWN SHIRT AND LOOSENED TIE.  HE PUTS DOWN HIS BRIEFCASE 
  AND IMMEDIATELY GETS A BEER FROM THE FRIDGE.

                                  RITA

                Hey.

                                  JAY

                Hey hon, how you feeling today?

  HE KISSES HER, THEN LICKS HIS LIPS.

                                  JAY (CONT'D)

                Mmm, homemade 'sketti sauce.  That's a 

                good sign. (KISSES SHANNON) Mmm,

                  Reeses pieces.  Not a good sign.

                Remember what Dr. Maroney said.

                                  SHANNON

                He said I need to keep my blood sugar 

                up for karate.

                                  JAY

                Karate's tomorrow, Shan.

                                  SHANNON

                But I have to practice tonight.  Hai! 

                (KICK) Hai! (KICK) Ow!

  SHANNON ACCIDENTALLY KICKS THE REFRIGERATOR.  A BUNCH OF 
  KITCHEN MAGNETS FALL OFF.                                                                                     25.



                                  RITA

                Jay, can you leave work early tomorrow 

                and pick Shannon up from karate?

  RITA POURS THE SAUCE OVER THE SPAGHETTI.

                                  SHANNON

                Why can't you pick me up?

                                  RITA

                Because I'll be busy.

                                  SHANNON

                Doing what?

                                  RITA

                Doing... stuff. 

  RITA PLACES THE PLATTER OF SPAGHETTI ON THE TABLE.

                                  KIP

                Meatballs.  Awesome.

                                  SHANNON

                But I m  lergic to --

                                  RITA

                Don t worry, yours are gluten-free, 

                Hallie s are vegan and the rest of us 

                get greasy ol  meat meatballs.

                                  JAY

                (TO RITA) What stuff you doing 

                tomorrow?

                                  RITA

                Just stuff.  But if you can't pick her

                up, I ll figure something else out.                                                                                    26.



  RITA PLACES THE PILLSBURY CRESCENT ROLLS ON THE TABLE.

                                  SHANNON

                Could you pass the spaghetti?

                                  RITA

                (CALLING UPSTAIRS) HALLIE!  DINNER!

  HALLIE'S DOOR OPENS UPSTAIRS. A RAP CD BLARES.

                                  HALLIE (O.S.)

                HELLO!  YOU SAID I'M GROUNDED!

  HALLIE'S DOOR SLAMS SHUT.  THE MUSIC STOPS.

                                  RITA

                WELL, I'M UNGROUNDING YOU FOR DINNER!

  HALLIE'S DOOR OPENS AGAIN. THE MUSIC BLARES.

                                  HALLIE

                TOUGH!  I'M GONNA STAY IN HERE AND 

                STARVE TO DEATH!

  THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT.  THE MUSIC STOPS.

                                  RITA

                Jay, remind me.  Did I conceive her 

                with you.  Or was it Satan?

                                  SHANNON

                Could you pass the spaghetti?

                                  JAY

                Can't you move your stuff to the 

                weekend?

                                  RITA

                All we re talking about is two hours.

                Four to six.  Just for myself.

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.


                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                You'd think I was asking for a year to 

                bum around Europe.  Which by the way, 

                we were supposed to do, (LOUD, FOR 

                EFFECT) 'TIL I GOT PREGNANT WITH AN 

                UNGRATEFUL DAUGHTER! 

                                  SHANNON

                Can someone please pass the spaghetti?

                                  JAY

                (JOKING) You're not having an affair 

                are you?

                                  RITA

                Yes.  You caught me.  I'm having a hot 

                fling with the bag boy at Krogers.

                                  KIP

                  Darnell? (THUMBS UP) Way to go.

                                  RITA

                (FINALLY) I invited my friend Patty 

                over to... play some music.

  HER FAMILY LOOKS AT HER CONFUSED.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                That's right.  You heard me.  I'm 

                gonna start playing my guitar again.

  HER FAMILY CONTINUES STARING BLANKLY AT HER.  A BEAT.  THEY 
  START LAUGHING.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                You guys think it's funny?                                                                                    28.



                                  JAY

                No, it's a great idea.  Maybe we'll 

                join you.  We can be the new Partridge 

                Family. (SINGING) "I THINK I LOVE YOU!

                SO WHAT AM I SO AFRAID OF..."

  THEY LAUGH EVEN HARDER.  MILK COMES OUT OF SHANNON'S NOSE.
  RITA WATCHES THEM, FEELING BELITTLED, THEN --

                                  RITA

                Do you find this funny too?

  RITA PICKS UP THE PLATTER OF SPAGHETTI AND HEAVES IT 
  AGAINST THE WALL.  THE PLATE CRASHES TO THE FLOOR AND THE 
  SPAGHETTI SLIDES DOWN THE WALL.  RITA STANDS THERE, NOT 
  BELIEVING WHAT SHE JUST DID.  A BEAT.  SHE TURNS AND EXITS
  THE ROOM.  THEY'VE ALL STOPPED LAUGHING.

                                                                            FADE OUT:
                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    29.




                                      ACT TWO

                                      SCENE A

  (RITA, PATTY, SHANNON, OWEN, KIP, HALLIE)

  THE DRYER WHIRS.  RITA, IN JEANS AND FLANNEL SHIRT, TUNES 
  HER GUITAR.  PATTY, STILL IN HER POSTAL UNIFORM, SETS UP 
  HER KEYBOARD ON AN OVERTURNED GARBAGE CAN.

                                  RITA

                ... then Jay asked me if I was having 

                an affair.  You believe that?

                                  PATTY

                Well, are you?

                                  RITA

                What!?  That is the most ridiculous -- 

                What?!  I'm married.

                                  PATTY

                So, just 'cause you've had supper, 

                doesn't mean you don t have room for 

                dessert.

                                  RITA

                I take it you're not married.

                                  PATTY

                Twice.

                                  RITA

                And did you ever fool around?

                                  PATTY

                I'll try anything once.                                                                                    30.



                                  RITA

                Really?

                                  PATTY

                But I fooled around six times.

                                  RITA

                No, Jay and I may be in a bit of a 

                rut, but it s a really comfortable 

                rut.  I wouldn t jeopardize everything 

                for a cheap quickie.

  RITA SEARCHES FOR A PICK IN HER GUITAR CASE.

                                  RITA (CONT D)

                You know, "B.C.", before children, I 

                did what I wanted, when I wanted.

                Now, I m so busy being everything to 

                everybody, I have nothing left for 

                myself.  Well, no more.  If I want to 

                play the guitar, I'm damn well going 

                to play the guitar.

  THERE IS A "DING" FROM THE WASHING MACHINE.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                Right after I do a load of whites.

  RITA PUTS THE GUITAR DOWN.

                                  PATTY

                Hold it, Missy!

  RITA STOPS.                                                                                    31.



                                  PATTY (CONT'D)

                As my people say, the whites can help 

                  themselves.  Now get back here.  We 

                only got an hour left to jam.

                                  RITA

                Jam.  Yeah, I've always wanted to jam. 

                (BEAT) How do you jam?

                                  PATTY

                Thought you said you used to play.

                                  RITA

                Well, not with other people.  Mostly 

                alone in my room.  Fantasizing I was 

                on "Saturday Night Live", performing 

                the title track from my latest hit CD.

                                  PATTY

                Uh-huh.  And what kind of songs were 

                on this hit CD?  Wait, don't tell me.

                Some angry white girl I-don't-fit-in-

                      have-a-bad-haircut-can't-get-laid

                songs?

                                  RITA

                Well, I did go through a Sinead

                O Connor period.  Which was somewhere 

                between my Stevie Nicks shawl years 

                and my Patti Smith, stop shaving my 

                armpits phase.                                                                                    32.



                                  PATTY

                No wonder you couldn't get laid.

  PATTY BEGINS TO RIFF.  RITA CAUTIOUSLY JOINS IN.  THEY TRY 
  TO GROOVE TOGETHER, BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING.  THEY STOP.

                                  RITA

                  (HOPEFULLY) Not bad.

  PATTY RAISES AN EYEBROW.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                I know what's wrong.  We didn't do the 

                countdown thing.

                                  PATTY

                Then hit it, girl.

                                  RITA

                A one, two, one-two-three-four!

  THEY START PLAYING AGAIN.  THIS TIME A LITTLE MORE RELAXED.
  YOU CAN TELL RITA KNOWS HER WAY AROUND A GUITAR.

                                  SHANNON (O.S.)

                Mom!  I got green!  I got green!

  SHANNON RUNS INTO THE GARAGE, WAVING A STRIP OF GREEN 
  FABRIC.

                                  SHANNON (CONT'D)

                See!  See!

  SHANNON SHOVES THE FABRIC IN RITA'S FACE.  RITA AND PATTY 
  STOP PLAYING AGAIN.

                                  RITA

                That's great, Shan.  So proud of you.

  SHE HUGS SHANNON.

                                  SHANNON

                Sew it on for me, 'kay?                                                                                    33.



                                  RITA

                Sure.  Later though.

                                  SHANNON

                Now.

                                  RITA

                No.

                                  SHANNON

                Why?

                                  RITA

                Because.

                                  SHANNON

                 Cause why?

  FROM DOWN THE STREET WE HEAR THE ICE CREAM TRUCK 
    APPROACHING.

                                  RITA

                  (FRUSTRATED) Here's a couple bucks, 

                sweetie.  Go get a Klondike bar.

  SHANNON GRABS THE MONEY, JUMPS ON HER BIKE AND RACES OFF.

                                  SHANNON (O.S.)

                HEY, WAIT UP!

                                  RITA

                (OFF PATTY'S LOOK)  I know, I know.

                You're thinking I'm the worst mother 

                ever.

                                  PATTY

                No, I'm thinking you're the worst 

                hostess ever.  Where's myKlondike

                bar?                                                                                    34.



                                  RITA

                Let's play some more, then we'll "take 

                five".  I always wanted to say that.

  THE WOMEN PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFF, RIFFING WITH A 
  BLUESY, R&B BEAT.  THEY SMILE AT EACH OTHER, WITH A LOOK 
  THAT SAYS -- "WE'RE COOL."  SUDDENLY, A PAIR OF WHITE SOCKS 
  IN BROWN SANDALS CUTS THROUGH THE BUSHES OF THE ADJOINING 
  YARD.  IT'S OWENJAKOWSKI, RITA'S GOOD NATURED, MID-
  THIRTIES NEIGHBOR.  HE'S PURE WHITE BREAD, FROM HIS MADRAS 
  SHORTS TO HIS EVER PRESENT DETROIT TIGER'S CAP.  RITA AND 
  PATTY STOP PLAYING AGAIN.  PATTY THROWS UP HER ARMS.

                                  OWEN

                Just returning Jay s mesquite 

                  briquettes.  Tell him he was spot on 

                about that rich, smokey flavor.

  HE PUTS THE BAG OF BBQ BRIQUETTES DOWN BY THE WATER HEATER.

                                  OWEN (CONT D)

                And hate to be a party pooper, but I 

                can hear you all the way from my 

                house.  You know, a guy likes to relax 

                after a hard day at work.

                                  PATTY

                Should be plenty relaxed.  You were 

                canned three months ago.

                                  OWEN

                Down sized.

                                  PATTY

                (REACHING IN MAIL BAG) Here's your 

                  unemployment check.  Save me the walk 

                over.

  OWEN GRABS THE CHECK FROM PATTY.                                                                                    35.



                                  OWEN

                Hey, it s not easy being a stay-at-

                home-Dad.  At the plant, I could knock 

                back a couple beers at lunch and still 

                run the hydraulic press.  But man,

                  Nintendo DS with the kids takes all 

                your concentration.

                                  RITA

                Sorry Owen, we'll try and keep it 

                down.  See ya.


                                  OWEN

                You know what your band's missing?

                                  RITA

                Actually, we're not a band...

                                  OWEN

                An accordion.  Got one in the basement 

                the wife s been threatening to sell on 

                Ebay.

                                  RITA

                ... We're really just fooling around.

                                  OWEN

                Why don't I zip on home and get it?

  OWEN STARTS OUT.                                                                                    36.



                                  RITA

                Owen.  Wait.  It's sweet that you 

                wanted to join us, but we don't really 

                need anyone else.

                                  OWEN

                (HITTING A NERVE) Oh really?  And 

                why's that?  'Cause you're not hiring 

                right now?  Or I'm too old to flip 

                burgers?  Or is it just that I'm not 

                "Gap material"?

  PATTY AND RITA EXCHANGE LOOKS.  THIS GUY COULD SNAP.

                                  RITA

                You know, the accordion is kind of 

                  underrated.

                                  PATTY

                Who doesn't love a good polka?

                                  OWEN

                You guys really want me to join ya?

                Right on.  We're gonna rock this 

                'hood!

  HE HOLDS UP HIS HANDS IN THE SURFER  SHAKA  SIGN AND MAKES 
  THE SOUNDS OF AN AUDIENCE ROARING AS HE EXITS THROUGH THE 
  BACKYARD.

                                  PATTY

                And they say wego postal.

                                  RITA

                (SIGHS) Welcome to my world.

  KIP ENTERS WITH AN ARMFUL OF DIRTY CLOTHES.                                                                                    37.



                                  PATTY

                Would your world happen to have any 

                beer in it?

  RITA STARTS INSIDE.

                                  RITA

                Man, that is so rock  n roll.  We ll 

                throw back a few, then trash the 

                garage. (LOOKING AROUND) Oh, wait.  It 

                already is.

  AS SOON AS SHE S GONE, KIP HURRIES OUT THE GARAGE AND LOOKS 
  UP TO A SECOND STORY WINDOW.

                                  KIP

                Yo, she's gone!

  A BEAT.  THEN HALLIE CLIMBS DOWN THE TRELLIS.

                                  HALLIE

                (TO KIP) Keep her occupied.  I'm going 

                to McDonald's.

                                  KIP

                I'll miss you, babe.

  HALLIE KISSES KIP HARD THEN CLIMBS OVER THE FENCE.

                                  KIP (CONT'D)

                (TO PATTY)  Swear you won't say 

                nothing.

                                  PATTY

                (LOOKING UPWARD) Lord, why me?  I was 

                just getting used to this route.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    38.




                                      SCENEB

  (JAY, RITA)

  JAY IS PATCHING THE WALL RITA DENTED FROM LAST NIGHT'S 
  DINNER.  RITA ENTERS AND CROSSES TO THE CUPBOARDS.

                                  JAY

                Hey.

                                  RITA

                Hey.

  RITA BENDS DOWN AND SEARCHES THROUGH SOME POTS AND PANS.

                                  JAY

                So how long is this going to last?

                                  RITA

                About another half hour.  We're trying 

                to get through a whole song.

                                  JAY

                I meant us not talking.

                                  RITA

                We talked this morning.

                                  JAY

                "Move, I have to spit" isn't talking.

                                  RITA

                (TRYING TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD) I 

                could've gotten the toothpaste all 

                over you.

                                  JAY

                Rita, you threw a plate of food.  We 

                gotta deal with this.                                                                                    39.



  RITA STANDS UP WITH THE HIDDEN SIX PACK.

                                  RITA

                You laughed at me.

                                  JAY

                I'm sorry, but I don't know what to do 

                here.  You gain a few pounds, I know 

                how to make you feel pretty.  Your Mom 

                visits, I know to get your Xanax

                  prescription refilled.  But this...

  HE SHRUGS.

                                  RITA

                Just understand me, Jay.  That s all.

                                  JAY

                I understand plenty.  You think my 

                dream is to sell car insurance?  I'd 

                rather be making seven figures playing 

                guard for the Pistons.  But that's not 

                reality.  We're adults.  We got a 

                family, bills, responsibilities --

  RITA PUTS HER HANDS OVER HER EARS AND TRIES TO DROWN HIM 
  OUT WITH NONSENSICAL SOUNDS.

                                  JAY (CONT'D)

                Rita, cut it out!

                                  RITA

                Well, stop lecturing me like I'm one 

                of the girls.                                                                                    40.



                                  JAY

                Then stop acting like them.  You can 

                play in the garage all you want, but 

                you can't avoid growing up.

                                  RITA

                There's a difference between growing 

                up and giving up.

                                  JAY

                Oh great.  So now I'm a loser and

                lousy in bed.

                                  RITA

                JAY!

                                  JAY

                WHAT?!

                                  RITA

                Forget it.  I'm tired of this.

                                  JAY

                This conversation?  Or me?

  JAY JAMS THE PUTTY KNIFE IN THE WALL AND BRUSHES PAST HER.
  ON RITA'S EXASPERATED EXPRESSION, WE:

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    41.




                                      SCENE C

  (OWEN, PATTY, RITA, KIP)

  OWEN IS BACK, WARMING UP ON HIS ACCORDION.  HE ALSO WEARS A 
  HARMONICA AROUND HIS NECK.  PATTY JAMS WHILE KIP DOES 
  WHEELIES ON HALLIE S BIKE IN THE DRIVEWAY.  RITA ENTERS.

                                  OWEN

                Jump in Rita, we're hittin' a groove!

  PATTY TAKES ONE LOOK AT RITA'S FACE AND STOPS PLAYING.

                                  PATTY

                Owen, give her a minute.  The woman 

                just had a fight with her husband.

                                  RITA

                We weren't fighting, we were just -- 

                How'd you know we were fighting?

                                  PATTY

                I'm blessed with a gift.  Some people 

                call it a sixth sense.

                                  KIP

                We heard you from the heating vent.

                                  PATTY

                God works in mysterious ways.

                                  RITA

                Sorry, guys.  Today's not going to 

                work out.  Today or any day.

  RESIGNED, SHE PUTS HER GUITAR BACK IN IT'S CASE.                                                                                    42.



                                  PATTY

                That's it?  You're gonna give up?

                Just like that?

                                  RITA

                Yep.  Just like that.

                                  PATTY

                What happened to doing something for 

                yourself?  Getting your groove back? 

                Singing on "SNL?"

                                  RITA

                They're just dreams.  Jay's right.

                I'm too old to go chasing after them.

                                  PATTY

                You?  Old?  It's not like you have any 

                grey hairs.

  RITA CRINGES.

                                  KIP

                Yeah, most Moms just pork out and 

                shriv up.  But my buds definitely 

                consider you a MILF.

                                  RITA

                Kip, can you go back to thinking of me 

                as Hallie's bitchy Mom?

                                  PATTY

                I got news for you, Rita.  The 

                quickest way to get old is to stop 

                chasing your dreams.                                                                                    43.



                                  OWEN

                Ihad a dream.  To be a dancer.  My 

                Dad said it wasn't manly.  What did he 

                know?  He's not the one who has to lie 

                awake at night, resisting the urge to 

                put on a pair of tights and jete  

                across the backyard like Baryshnikov.

                                  PATTY

                  Something s in the water in this 

                  neighborhood.

                                  RITA

                I appreciate what you're all trying to 

                do, but this isn't worth ending my 

                marriage over.

                                  PATTY

                I'm not one to butt in, but your 

                marriage is over if you're not happy.

                You gotta fight for what you want.

                                  RITA

                I'm sick of fighting.

                                  PATTY

                Then what about singing?

                                  RITA

                What good's that going to do?

                                  PATTY

                Only one way to find out.

  PATTY NODS TO THE HEATING VENT, THEN WINKS AT RITA.                                                                                    44.



                                  RITA

                (WHEELS TURNING) You guys know any 

                Beatles?

                                  KIP

                Who?

                                  PATTY

                (LOOKING THROUGH HER BAG) Where's that 

                damn anti-aging serum?

  RITA PICKS UP HER GUITAR AND STRIKES THE OPENING CHORDS OF 
  A SONG.  PATTY FOLLOWS HER LEAD.  RITA STARTS SOFTLY AT 
  FIRST, BUT HER VOICE IS FULL OF EMOTION AS SHE TURNS TO THE 
  VENT.

                                  RITA

                (SINGING SLOWLY) "WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, 

                SO MUCH YOUNGER THAN TODAY.  I NEVER 

                NEEDED ANYBODY'S HELP IN ANY WAY..."

  OWEN ADDS A UNIQUE TOUCH WITH HIS ACCORDION.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                (SINGING) "BUT NOW THOSE DAYS ARE 

                GONE, I'M NOT SO SELF ASSURED.  NOW I 

                FIND I'VE CHANGED MY MIND AND OPENED 

                UP THE DOOR."

  KIP GRABS BARBECUE TONGS AND BANGS TO THE BEAT ON THE 
  DRYER.  THEY ACTUALLY SOUND GOOD TOGETHER.  RITA BEGINS TO 
  LOOSEN UP AND SING WITH MORE CONFIDENCE.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    45.




                                      SCENE D

  (RITA)

  JAY, IN CUT OFF SWEATS AND SNEAKERS, PUTS HIS BASKETBALL ON 
  THE TABLE AND OPENS THE FRIDGE.  HE GRABS A BOTTLED WATER 
  AND IS ABOUT TO START OUT, UNTIL HE HEARS WHAT RITA'S 
  SINGING.

                                  RITA (O.S.)

                (MUFFLED SINGING) "HELP ME IF YOU CAN 

                I'M FEELING DOWN.  AND I DO APPRECIATE 

                YOU BEING ROUND.  HELP ME GET MY FEET 

                BACK ON THE GROUND.  WON'T YOU PLEASE 

                PLEASE HELP ME?"

  A WISTFUL LOOK COMES ACROSS HIS FACE.  HE SITS DOWN TO 
  LISTEN.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                    46.




                                      SCENE E

    (RITA, RITA/PATTY, JAY, PATTY, OWEN, KIP, HALLIE)

  AS RITA GETS INTO IT, SHE PICKS UP THE TEMPO AND ROCKS TO 
  THE BEAT.  NOW IN HER SLEEVELESS TEE, SHE S SEXY AND FREE 
  AND GLOWING.  AS THE SONG BUILDS, OWEN ADDS FLOURISHES ON 
  THE HARMONICA.  PATTY PIPES IN WITH GOSPEL BACKGROUND 
  VOCALS.  EVEN KIP GETS AMBITIOUS AND STARTS BANGING ON A 
  COOLER, AN EMPTY SPARKLETT'S BOTTLE, A TOOLBOX, ETC. (A LA 
  "STOMP").

                                  RITA

                (SINGING) "AND NOW MY LIFE HAS CHANGED 

                IN OH SO MANY WAYS.  MY INDEPENDENCE 

                SEEMS TO -- "

                                  RITA/PATTY

                  (HARMONIZING) "VANISH IN THE HAZE."

                                  RITA

                "BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN I FEEL SO 

                INSECURE.  I KNOW THAT I JUST NEED YOU 

                LIKE I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE."

  JAY ENTERS.  RITA, SINGING WITH EYES CLOSED, DOESN'T NOTICE 
  HIM.  BUT THE OTHERS DO.  PATTY STOPS PLAYING.  THEN OWEN.
  THEN KIP.  RITA IS SO INTO THE SONG, SHE KEEPS GOING.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                "HELP ME IF YOU CAN I'M FEELING..."

  RITA OPENS HER EYES AND SEES JAY STANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY.
  SHE IMMEDIATELY STOPS SINGING.

                                  JAY

                Hey.

                                  RITA

                Hey.

  PATTY CLOSES DOWN HER KEYBOARDS.                                                                                    47.



                                  PATTY

                Looks like we're done for the day.

                                  OWEN

                Now?  This could get good.

                                  KIP

                It's not pretty, man.  Got so bad here 

                last night, I had to have dinner at my 

                own house.

  PATTY, OWEN AND KIP START OUT.

                                  PATTY

                I was wrong about you, Rita.  You not 

                only got guts, you got soul. C'mon,

                guys.

  THEY EXIT.  RITA AND JAY STAND THERE AWKWARDLY.

                                  JAY

                I saw it.

                                  RITA

                Saw what?

                                  JAY

                The sparkle.  In your eyes.  Forgot 

                how beautiful it was.

  RITA S TOUCHED.

                                  JAY (CONT D)

                Look, if it's a couple hours you need, 

                whatever, I ll take up the slack.

                Like picking up Shannon today.  I 

                really want this to work out.                                                                                    48.



                                  RITA

                The music?  Or our marriage?

                                  JAY

                Both.

  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER, THEN HUG.

                                  JAY (CONT D)

                Love you, Reet.

                                  RITA

                Love ya  back.

  SHE RUBS THE BACK OF HIS HEAD TENDERLY.

                                  RITA (CONT D)

                Know what?  (IN HIS EAR) You re way 

                hotter without bangs.

                                  JAY

                Really?

                                  RITA

                Yeah.  They looked better on Dorothy 

                Hamill.

  HE LAUGHS.

                                  JAY

                So this music thing... you re pretty 

                serious, huh?

                                  RITA

                Jay, it's not like I'm going to quit 

                my job and run off to open for U2.

                We're just having fun in here.

                                  (MORE)                                                                                    49.


                                  RITA (CONT'D)

                Like you shooting hoops with the guys.

                Know what I mean?

                                  JAY

                No.

                                  RITA

                No?

                                  JAY

                Why would you want to open for U2?

                They're totally overrated.

  SHE SMILES.

                                  JAY (CONT D)

                So we re good?

                                  RITA

                Weare.  But about taking up that 

                slack... Can you deal with Hallie?

                I ve tried everything.  I m at a total 

                loss.

                                  JAY

                She's just pulling the same crap you

                did with your Mom.

                                  RITA

                Ain t karma a bitch?

                                  JAY

                I say we don't cave.  She stays 

                grounded 'til she stops mouthing off.

                                  RITA

                Mmm. Tough love.  Show me more.                                                                                    50.



  RITA NUZZLES HIS NECK, SEDUCTIVELY.

                                  JAY

                Reet. It's still light out.

                                  RITA

                  (MISCHIEVOUSLY) Maybe it s good we 

                shake things up a little.

  RITA HITS THE GARAGE DOOR BUTTON.  BEFORE IT SHUTS, A 
  BACKPACK FLIES OVER THE NEIGHBOR'S FENCE.  THEN A LEG, THEN 
  HALLIE, CLUTCHING A MCDONALD'S TAKE-OUT BAG IN HER TEETH.
  SHE LANDS ON HER FEET AND PULLS OUT A HANDFUL OF FRIES.
  SHE SCARFS THEM DOWN AS SHE STARTS UP THE TRELLIS.

                                  JAY

                Did you just see Hallie?

                                  RITA

                Uh-huh.

  SHE BEGINS PULLING OFF JAY'S T-SHIRT.

                                  JAY

                Shouldn't we do something about it?

                                  RITA
