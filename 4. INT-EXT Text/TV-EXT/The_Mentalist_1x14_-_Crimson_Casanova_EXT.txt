      Nestled amongst the rolling hills of Steinbeck Country, 
      California, lies the serene and picturesque Calistoga Canyon 
      Resort & Spa.  Spanish Mediterranean architecture.  Luxurious 
      suites with private patios opening onto landscaped 
      courtyards.  An oasis of relaxation, far from the hectic life 
      its upscale patrons lead.

      Looking in on one of the private villas, we see the low 
      flicker of light from candles glowing behind sheer curtains.  
      MAKE-OUT MUSIC PLAYS very softly.  The mood is quiet, 
      romantic -- that is until THREE SHOTS ring out in the night.  
      Muzzle flashes lighting up the room.


      JANE, LISBON, RIGSBY and VAN PELT walk the grounds of the 
      resort, heading to the crime scene...

                                  LISBON
                          (off notebook)
                    We ve got Claire Wolcott, female 
                      Caucasian, 32 years old.  Found 
                    shot to death in her room.  Her 
                    husband has friends in the 
                      Governor s office.  He called in 
                    some favors, wants the 
                      investigation to be kept discreet 
                    and low key. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    His wife is murdered and his 
                    priority is discretion?  

      Lisbon leads the way into...


      Jane crosses the courtyard searching the ground.  Lisbon 
      heads out from the room after him.

      Jane finds a tiny spot on the pathway.

                                  JANE 
                    There we go.

      Sure enough, there s a spot of blood, then another; like a 
      trail of bread crumbs leading down the path.  The trail leads 
      to A PARKING LOT, and disappears.  They comb the lot for more 
      spots.  

                                  LISBON
                    Anything?

                                  LISBON
                    No.

      Jane eyes the car nearest the last blood spot.  A high-end 
      white CADILLAC.  Its license reads "DOCLADY."


      Staff and guests watch coroner s men take Claire Wolcott 
      away.  Among them is KATIE, (20 s) a waitress. 


      Rigsby s outside the door talking with a hotel manager - 
      KEVIN HAIGHTLY, (40 s) well-groomed, plain.

                                  HAIGHTLY
                    I know we can t expect to get the 
                    room back, but when might the 
                    walkway be open for use, d you 
                    think?

                                  RIGSBY
                    Depends when forensics gets done. 

      Haightly s trying to look inside at the crime scene...

      He shuts the door on Haightly.  

      Paul Fricke is being questioned by Lisbon, Jane and Van Pelt.  
      He seems quite calm given the situation.

                                  FRICKE 
                    It was a cold night.  So we lit a 
                    fire and made love on the rug 
                    there.  We went to sleep 
                      afterwards.  Then suddenly there s 
                    like a sharp pain, and bang I wake 
                    up and there s blood everywhere and 
                    I m shot in the arm and Claire s 
                    dead.  You know?  I freaked.

                    Yes, we know.  And Dr. Jill

                    parking lot and asked her for help.

                                  LISBON
                    A total stranger took you back to 
                    her room, treated your wound, and 
                    then had sexual intercourse with 
                    you.

      Fricke shrugs modestly.  Yup.

                                  FRICKE
                    What can I say?  The Hippocratic 
                    oath is a beautiful thing. 

      Lisbon and Van Pelt are puzzled.

                    How well did you know Claire

                                  FRICKE
                    I didn t, really.  I met her a few 
                    weeks ago.  She was at a bar and I 
                    picked her up.  Since then I ve 
                    seen her occasionally for sex.

                                  LISBON
                    Is that what happened tonight?

                    Yes.  I called and asked her to 
                    meet me for a drink.  We came here.

                    Could be someone was trying to kill 
                    him, not her.

                                  LISBON
                    Not likely.  The room was in Claire 
                    Wolcott s name.  Nobody knew he was 
                    here.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What was she thinking?  She was 
                    beautiful and he s so creepy.

                                  RIGSBY
                    That Dr. Rubenstein was hot too. 
                    How does he do it?

                                  JANE  
                    All you need is a basic 
                      understanding of the evolutionary 
                      psychology of women, rigorously and 
                      fearlessly applied.  You just have 
                    to know what buttons to press.

      Rigsby s intrigued, but the women are vexed.  They get in the 
      car.

                                  LISBON
                    Like we re toasters.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Like men don t have buttons too.

                                  JANE
                    Men are like toasters.  Women are 
                    more like accordions.

      MOS CLAIRE WOLCOTT is an almost incidental part of the 
      footage, which features a newly purchased DOG.   

      We PULL BACK to REVEAL...


      Jane and Van Pelt arrive outside a stucco apartment complex.  
      NATALIE EDREAU, 22, a spoiled sorority girl, answers.

                                  VAN PELT

                    We re with the CBI.  Can we come 
                    in?

      Natalie looks reluctant, barring the door.

                                    NATALIE
                    I already told the cops I didn t 
                    steal anything from that bitch.

                                  VAN PELT
                    By bitch, are you referring to 
                    Claire Wolcott?

                                    NATALIE
                    Yeah, so?

                                  JANE
                    She was murdered last night.

      Natalie reacts.  Shocked more than upset.  Jane breezes past 
      her into the apartment.


      Jane studies the room closely.  Rigsby waits. 

                                  JANE
                    Something isn t right.  But I can t 
                    quite see what it is. 

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Me neither.
                          (beat)
                    Don t take too long.  I m hungry.

                                  JANE
                    They have an excellent restaurant 
                    here.  Worth the drive.

      Jane goes to the glass patio door, opens it, steps outside to 
      the patio.  Shuts the door, then finds that it can t be 
      opened from outside.  He gestures to Rigsby, who opens the 
      door for him.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Let s go eat.


      Manager Kevin Haightly, spots Jane and Rigsby coming in.

                                  HAIGHTLY
                    Ah, glad to see you again.  Is 
                    there any news?  The owner keeps 
                    asking when we ll be able to reopen 
                    the villa.

                                  JANE
                    No news.  We re here for lunch.

                                  HAIGHTLY
                    Oh, of course.  Right this way.

      Haightly leads Jane and Rigsby into the dining room.  

      Inside, Rigsby points out Paul Fricke sitting alone at a 
      table.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Look who s here.

                                  JANE
                    Just the man.  I have a question I 
                    need to ask him.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST      "Crimson Casanova"     GOLD 12/09/08     23.

      A young waitress -- KATIE -- leans over Fricke, taking his 
      order.  Upon seeing the two together, Haightly becomes a 
      little tense.  His jaw clenches shut.  Jane clocks this.

                                  FRICKE
                    My old friends from the CBI.  Have 
                    a seat.

      Rigsby and Jane slide in with Fricke.  Jane gives Katie a 
      smile, studies her for a beat.  Haightly sees this.

                                  HAIGHTLY
                          (softly)

                                  KATIE
                    Yes sir.

      Katie hurries away.  Jane watches Haightly follow after.

                                  JANE 
                    Surprised to see you back here so

                    This is my number one hunting 
                    ground.  Loaded with my kind of 
                    women -- beautiful, rich, married 
                    and unhappy.

                                  JANE

                    A woman died.  A woman you were 
                    close to.  That doesn t give you 
                    pause?

                                  FRICKE
                    Sure it does.  Yes.  I have 
                    feelings.  But this gunshot wound 
                    is a genius opener.

                    Was the door closed?  Yes.  It was 
                    a cold night.  They lit a fire.  
                    Why leave the door open?  

                                  RIGSBY
                    No, I mean is he right about how to 
                    deal with women.  

                                  JANE
                    No.  He s one hundred percent 
                    wrong.  
                          (beat)
                    Unless all you want is a lot of 
                    casual sex with strangers. 
                    Then he s right.

      Rigsby s conflicted.


      Rigsby and Van Pelt crossing the grounds...

                                  RIGSBY
                          (muttering to himself)
                    Contempt, control, excitement.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What?

                                  RIGSBY
                      Nothing...

                                  VAN PELT
                    This place is sooo nice.  Eight 
                    hundred dollars a night minimum, 
                    can you believe that? 

      Rigsby doesn t even glance at Van Pelt, just hmmphs in reply. 

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Hello?  You re not talking to me? 
                    You barely said a word the whole 
                    way down.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (loftily)
                    I ll talk to you.  When you have 
                    something interesting to say.

      Van Pelt, hurt, has no idea where this is coming from...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Fine, be a jerk.  

      Van Pelt pushes through a gate.  A confused Rigsby follows 
      after.THE MENTALIST      "Crimson Casanova"     GOLD 12/09/08     34.



      Where we find Paul Fricke dangling his legs in a hot tub in 
      which TWO WOMEN are immersed. 

                                  FRICKE
                    I d come in with you, but I have to 
                    keep my injury dry. 

      The women don t respond.

                                  FRICKE (CONT D)
                    Gunshot wound. 
                          (still nothing)
                    But don t worry, you re not in any 
                    danger.  I m a lover.  Not a 
                    fighter.

      Skeeved out, the two women get out of the hot tub and split.  
      Fricke turns to find Van Pelt and Rigsby looking at him 
      sourly.

                                  FRICKE (CONT D)
                    Not you guys again.

                                  RIGSBY
                    The old magic not working so good 
                    today?

                                  FRICKE
                    It s like baseball.  Most of the 
                    time, even in the Major Leagues, 
                    you swing and you miss.  You have 
                    to keep swinging.  I hit on ten 
                    women a day, I m going to have 
                    sexual intercourse with one of 
                    them.  At least.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    That is gross.  

                                  FRICKE
                          (to Rigsby)
                    She s intrigued by me, she s just 
                    too proud to admit it.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Shoes on Romeo.

      car.

                                  FRICKE
                    I didn t notice before.  You re not 
                    bad looking.  Shoulders are a bit 
                    too wide, but otherwise pretty 
                    nice.   

                                  VAN PELT
                    You re kidding right?  You re 
                    trying to hit on me?

                                  FRICKE 
                    What man in his right mind wouldn t  *
                    hit on you?    *

      Van Pelt smiles despite herself.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Leave her be.  Get in the car.


      The resort glows romantically under a dark blue canopy of 
      stars.


      Rigsby puts surveillance equipment into the back of the CBI 
      vehicle, parked close to the guest rooms.


      Jane unable to open the patio door.

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    And they can t be opened from 
                    outside.

      END FLASHBACK


      Katie leans over Fricke, taking his order.  Upon seeing them, 
      Haightly becomes tense.  His jaw clenches shut.

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    You hate him for using and abusing 
                    her, the woman you love.
