ACT ONE


  FADE IN:

1 INT. VINCENT'S CHAMBER - DAY

As a strange VOICE gently intones words from Shakespeare's
"Henry IV," camera PANS over books, maps and other
artifacts of learning which fill this gracious place...

VOICE (0.S.)
'... thou makest me sad, and
makest me sin in envy that my Lord
Northumberland should be the
father to so blest a son-- a son
who is the theme of honor's
tongue...'

It's a classroom situation where we FIND ZACH, GEOFFREY,   
SAMANTHA, BROOKE (a clear-eyed teenage tunnel girl) and
several other CHILDREN listening.

2 MICHAEL

A grown child of the tunnels, now 20, recites the words
of this speech as if it bears on him with a terrible,
personal weight...

The young man is a prized pupil, teaching assistant, and
friend of Vincent's, who idolizes his mentor unabashedly.

MICHAEL
	'... 0 that it could be proved
	that some night-tripping fairy
	had exchanged in cradle-clothes
	our children where they lay...
	Then would I have his Harry and
	he mine.'

Michael looks up from the aged volume he's reading.

MICHAEL
	It's a very moving speech...

ZACH
	(unconvinced)
	It didn't make me sad.
	
MICHAEL
	Something about it troubled you,
	Zach?
SAMANTHA
	(agreeing)
	You said the king loved his son.
	So how come he wants to trade
	Harry for someone else?

MICHAEL
	The king was a leader of men,
	Samantha.  He bore an obligation
	he knew was greater sometimes than
	what he owed his flesh and
	blood...
	(sadly)
	The obligation to his people.

BROOKE
	But what about love, Michael?
	Vincent always says love is more
	important than anything...

MICHAEL
	It's true... but none of us lives
	in a world made up only of loved
	ones.. 

Vincent and Father appear now at the door.  They stop to
let Michael finish before entering...

MICHAEL
	... Harry's father loved him, but
	he knew one day Harry would have
	to lead a nation.  He never really
	wanted to trade his son away --
	he just wanted Harry to be better
	prepared for his destiny...

Vincent and father watch the children ponder this for a
beat, then father clears his throat.

FATHER
	Excuse us.  May we interrupt for
	a moment..?

MICHAEL
	Of course.  Come in...


VINCENT
	We have some wonderful news to
	share...

BROOKE
	Really..?  What?

Vincent produces a piece of paper and hands it to
Michael...

VINCENT
	... This just came from Catherine.

As Michael reads it...

FATHER
	(to the class) 
	... Because Michael scored so
	highly on his scholastic aptitude
	test, Brayfield College has
	agreed to waive their usual
	application requirements and
	admit him into the freshman
	class for the winter term...

They all look up at Michael.  He appears stunned...
Vincent now embraces him.

VINCENT
	I'm very proud of you... It's an
	auspicious beginning.

Michael smiles despite himself...

Brooke now jumps up and wraps her arms around Michael's
neck...

BROOKE
	It's terrific, Michael... But I
	just can't picture it here without
	you.

Michael nods somewhat sadly...

MICHAEL
	I know...

Now everyone chimes in with congratulations.  Father shakes
Michael's hand, immensely proud...

FATHER
	It's quite an honor... You do us
	all very proud.

		
MICHAEL
	Thank you. Father...

Michael smiles uneasily.  It's clear he has misgivings.
Vincent takes note of this as we:

3 INT.  WHISPERING GALLERY - DAY						

FINDING Michael, sitting in deep contemplation at the edge
of a foot bridge.  VOICES filter down to him, and he cocks
his head to hear certain of them better, as if listening
for something in particular... PULL BACK to reveal Vincent
sitting beside him...

MICHAEL
	(quietly)
	All the voices -- they sound like
	what's going on inside my head...

VINCENT
	You're apprehensive about
	leaving..?

MICHAEL
	(torn)
	I know it's a great opportunity.
	(shakes his head)
	I just don't know...

VINCENT
	Tell me -- tell me what you're
	feeling...

MICHAEL
	I'm just not sure about it.  This
	is my home... I've been happy
	here.

VINCENT
	You're part of us, Michael -- you
	always will be.  Wherever you
	go...

VINCENT 
	(from the heart)
	And there are times when we must
	go -- when great possibilities
	cannot in good faith be denied.
	The world above has much to offer
	you -- gifts of imagination and
	learning.  And you have the mind
	and the heart to cherish those
	gifts.  You're on the brink of
	a wonderous adventure...

Vincent clasps Michael's shoulder, warmly...

VINCENT
	(continuing, a beat)
	... But every adventure must begin
	in farewell...

MICHAEL
	(sadly)
	Some adventures don't end happily...

VINCENT
	All we can do is proceed with the
	faith that they will.

MICHAEL
	It's not even the unknown that
	worries me.  It's what I know is
	up there.

VINCENT
	You're thinking of your old life,
	above...

MICHAEL
	It wasn't so long ago, I swore
	I'd never go back.

VINCENT
	That was seven years ago, Michael.
	It was the oath of a child...

MICHAEL
	I still feel the pain.  I still
	remember where it came from.

VINCENT
	But this time you won't be alone.
	Catherine will be there -- you'll
	have friends.  And all of us,
	wishing you well -- waiting to
	hear your tales...

MICHAEL
	(painfully)
	... I want to do it for you.

VINCENT
	No... This must be for you.
	It's your journey, Michael.

Michael looks at Vincent, his eyes full of trepidation and
doubt...

DISSOLVE TO:

4 EXT. CATHY'S BALCONY - NIGHT
	
Vincent looks out over the city, sharing his concerns about
this with CATHY...

VINCENT
	... Perhaps I've done him a
	disservice.

CATHY
	By encouraging him to embrace his
	future?

VINCENT
	By assuming it was what he wanted.

CATHY
	Vincent, he's come this far
	because of his desire, because
	you believed in him.

VINCENT
	I always believed Michael would
	want this opportunity.

CATHY
	(tenderly)
	... you dreamed he would have what
	you couldn't have.

Vincent acknowledges this, touched by her understanding...

CATHY
	(continuing)
	It's a little frightening when
	dreams finally come true...

VINCENT
	(moved)
	Yes...
	(a beat)
	We mustn't forget how Michael came
	to us -- the loss he suffered.

CATHY
	His mother's death..?

VINCENT
	(nods)
	... And his father's rejection.

CATHY
	Was he abandoned?

VINCENT
	We only know that when we found
	Michael wandering the streets,
	he begged us not to contact his
	father.  He would only say the
	man didn't want him.

CATHY
	He lost both parents...

VINCENT
	He lost his sense of hope...
	Michael blames not only his father
	but a world that would leave
	a child alone, in grief.

CATHY
	Then Michael must come back to
	that world -- to face those
	disappointments -- to make his
	peace.

VINCENT
	(concerned)
	Yes...

CATHY
	You know I'll do everything to help him.

VINCENT
	He'll need a friend...

CATHY
	Don't worry, Vincent.  Michael
	comes above with a great advantage
	over almost everyone else up here...

He looks at her...

CATHY
	(smiling reassuringly)
	He has your faith in him.

7 INT.  MICHAEL'S CHAMBER - DAY

MARY and Brooke fuss over Michael, helping him pack and
disagreeing about what his school wardrobe should be.
Father stands nearby, holding a stodgy brown suit he can't
see why Michael wouldn't want.

FATHER
	Honestly, I don't see what's wrong
	with this.
	(to Brooke)
	Didn't I hear you girls chattering
	something about nostalgia in the
	fashions today?  Old styles coming
	back again?

BROOKE
	Not that old, rather.

MICHAEL
	(joking)
	Maybe that's what I need.
	The distinguished look...

Brooke is pulling a slightly worn blue seersucker suit coat
off Michael and replacing it with a rattier black jacket
with padded shoulders (all of it obviously found clothing).

MARY
	(objecting)
	What are you doing, Brooke? That
	thing is hideous!

missing scene 7

MICHAEL
Thank you, Samantha. The first
thing I'll write in it is a letter
to you.

SAMANTHA
	Don't forget...

MICHAEL
	I won't... I promise.

The little girl gets choked up.  Michael gets a little
misty himself. Brooke comes over and stands him up.  She is
brave with her feelings...

BROOKE
	Now listen to me Michael.  There
	are some very pretty girls up top
	who'll act friendly to you, but
	that doesn't mean they like you
	the way we do... if you take my
	advice, you won't even talk to
	them.

MICHAEL
	(playful but kind)
	Girls as pretty as you, Brooke?
	I can't believe it.

She blushes deeply.  Other in the chamber chuckle.
Michael gives her a brotherly embrace...

8A INT. MICHAEL'S CHAMBER - LATER

Everyone has left except Michael and Father.  They sit on
Michael's bed sharing a close moment...

MICHAEL
	... I can't help thinking -- no
	matter what I find up there, it
	can't possibly match the beauty
	of our world here... So what am
	I to gain?
	
FATHER
	Knowledge, Michael.  Knowledge
	of the world, of yourself, of the
	many paths that lie ahead of you.

MICHAEL
	(shakes his head)
	But if the price I have to pay
	for that knowledge is to live in
	that world up there...

FATHER
You may grow to love it.

MICHAEL
	But you tell us all the time how
	dangerous it is up there.  All
	the cruelty and inhumanity...

Father looks a bit guilty, realizing he's been unfair on
the subject.

FATHER
	... If I've spoken only of the
	limitations, I haven't been
	fair... The world above is also
	filled with beauty and great
	joys...
	(reminiscing)
	I remember going away to college
	-- my first day, on my own, in
	New York...  It was a clear, cool
	autumn afternoon.  It was
	magical... I saw Van Gogh's
	sunflowers at the Metropolitan
	Museum -- then, walked through
	the park where a man on an apple
	crate sang the entire score of
	"La Traviata"... I found myself
	walking down Broadway, swept up
	in the Saturday evening crowds.
	I was under a spell.  I remember
	being drawn into a dance hall
	where they were playing Dixieland
	jazz.  It was Louis Armstrong...
	I'll never forget that day.  It
	opened the door to a new world of
	experience -- a new way of
	seeing things...

A moment of silence.  Michael absorbs all this, then looks
at Father and nods appreciatively...
            
FATHER
	(fighting his own
	emotions)
	I'm not going to say goodbye,
	Michael... Just, savor every
	moment...
	(embracing him)
	God speed...

as they embrace...

9 INT. CATHY'S SUB-BASEMENT - ANGLE DOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT

Vincent and Michael approach the threshold point
together...

MICHAEL
	This is where she lives?

VINCENT
	Right above us...

MICHAEL
	Do I go up to meet her?

VINCENT
	No..

Michael stops short as he sees approaching from the
darkness

10 A SILHOUETTED FIGURE

with the familiar soft hair and slender shape of
Catherine... and she steps into a shaft of light, revealing
herself with a gentle, welcoming smile...

CATHY
	Hello...

Michael reacts, his breath slightly taken.  Vincent notes
this.  A beat.

VINCENT

	Catherine... you remember
	Michael...

CATHY
	  (remarking)
	of course...
	(offering her hand)
	Welcome, Michael...

MICHAEL
	(nervous; takes the
	 hand)
	I'm very grateful to you for
	everything.

CATHY
	I'm happy to be able to do it.

An awkward moment or two.  Vincent clasps Michael's arm.

MICHAEL
	(to Vincent)
	How can I thank you?

VINCENT
	You already have...

Michael looks through the threshold and keeps holding
Vincent's hand for a long beat.

VINCENT
 (emotional)
I will miss you, Michael...

They embrace... This is the hardest goodbye of all.  After
a beat, Cathy intervenes, taking Michael by the shoulder.

VINCENT
	Go now... the world awaits you...

Michael steps through the doorway and walks toward the
light.  Catherine gives Vincent a last look and turns to
follow... She puts a hand on Michael's arm to guide him
and they disappear together into the light...

Vincent watches this, then turns and walks away, suddenly
very alone...

11 INT. CATHY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Cathy leads Michael into her dark apartment and switches
on the light.  Michael reacts to the surroundings -- it's
a stark contrast to the tunnels, but it also reminds him
of a place he used to live in.  Cathy carries one of his
bags over to the couch and drops it there.

CATHY
	(smiling)
	Make yourself at home... I don't
	have a guest room, but that couch
	happens to be great for sleeping...

MICHAEL
	(a bit uncomfortable)
	Thanks -- it's fine...

He casts his eyes about the place...

MICHAEL
	(continuing)
	It's nice...

CATHY
	(sensing)
	Michael, if there's something you
	want to do, someplace you want
	to go -- or if you want to be left
	alone -- just tell me... alright?
	I want you to feel comfortable
	here...

MICHAEL
	Alright...
	(beat, loosening up)

	It's been a long time since I've
	been anywhere like this...

CATHY
	I thought we could go out and get
	something to eat.

MICHAEL
	That sounds good...

CATHY
	Great.  Let me get my coat...

She leaves. He looks around, notices the balcony doors
and moves to them. we FOLLOW to share his POV as he opens
the doors, REVEALING:

14 EXT. CATHY'S BALCONY - NIGHT - NEW YORK NIGHTSCAPE

Shimmering millions of lights wash over the balcony wall...

15 REVERSE - MICHAEL

can't possibly resist a tiny gasp of wonder, It's
beautiful. He moves slowly to the edge, revealing for
himself and us the expanding view...

16 CATHY

appears at the door behind him. She watches him a beat,
letting him enjoy the view undisturbed...

CATHY
	It's something, isn't it?

MICHAEL
	(despite himself)
	It is...

CATHY
	You must have missed it...
	(off his silence)
	At least a little...

MICHAEL
	(shakes his head against
	the idea)
	There's a lot of ugliness behind
	those lights, too...

CATHY
	(shrugs)
	Maybe... but to me they always
	promised something... hope, I
	guess...

MICHAEL
	(reflecting)
	Vincent says something like that,
	too... but I don't know...

Michael looks away.  She sees this needs to be taken
slowly.  A long beat.

CATHY
	Why don't we take a walk...?

Michael smiles bravely, as a peace offering.

MICHAEL
	Okay.

DISSOLVE TO:

17 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Michael and Cathy sit at a table for two near the window of
this New York bistro.  He watches her somewhat warily, but
his defenses seem to be flagging more and more...

CATHY
	(smiling at him)
	... Suddenly you're above --
	sitting in a restaurant, trying
	to decide what to order.  This
	must all seem pretty strange,
	Michael...

MICHAEL
	(nods)
	... Strange and familiar.  I used
	to live not far from here.  There
	used to be a toy store down this
	block.  My mother used to take
	me to it...

CATHY
	After dinner we can walk by, see
	if it's still there...

MICHAEL
	(uncertain)
	That's okay...

Michael is distracted momentarily by the appearance of a
miserable-looking PANHANDLER outside, who passes in front
of their window as he works the street -- with little
success...

CATHY
	... in New York, your memories
	become a part of everyday life,
	whether you like it or not.  My
	high school sweetheart broke up
	with me on a corner two blocks
	down...

MICHAEL
	(smiles)
	I'll bet he's sorry.
	(seeing the Panhandler
	again)
	Catherine... why doesn't anybody
	help him?

Cathy notices the Panhandler.

18 HER POV - PANHANDLER
     
being ignored by all PASSERSBY...

19 BACK TO SCENE

CATHY
	It's a terrible problem...

Just now the WAITER brings their food.  During the
following, as she speaks of the problem, Michael keeps
looking back and forth between the well-dressed PATRONS
surrounding him, the frustrated Panhandler outside, and his
own expensive meal...

CATHY
	There are so many like him, it
	just overwhelms people -- it makes
	you feel like there's nothing
	any one person could possibly
	do to make a difference--

Suddenly Michael takes his plate and stands up.

CATHY
	Michael... what are you--
	Michael heads for the door, ignoring looks from patrons, waiters,
	and the manager...

20 THROUGH THE GLASS

we watch Michael approach the Panhandler with the food.
At first the man refuses it, but Michael persist ,
following and entreating him.  Finally the man stops.  A
barrier is broken.  Michael helps him sit, spreads a napkin
over his lap and places the plate there.  The man looks
up at Michael, real gratitude in his eyes.  Michael smiles.

21 CATHY

throughout this, reacting very moved...

22 MANAGER

Not so impressed.  He starts for the door.  As Michael
tries to re-enter, the Manager restrains him with a hand
on his arm.

MANAGER
	What the hell are you doing?  I've
	got enough problems keeping them
	away from the door.  The food is
	for paying customers...

Cathy now arrives, pulls the manager's hand from Michael's
arm and addresses him discreetly but firmly.  Michael
watches her with growing admiration...

CATHY
	He was trying to do something
	decent.  Can you understand that?
	Now, would you let us get back
	to our meal?

MANAGER
	He's embarrassed my patrons.  I'm
	not running a soup line here.
	I'm sorry...

CATHY
	(cutting)
	An act of generosity embarrasses
	your patrons?  I don't think I
	want to be counted among them.

She stuffs some bills into his hand, grabs their coats from
a rack and steers Michael out the door.  The manager looks
at the money, perhaps a little ashamed...

CUT TO:

23 EXT.  STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Cathy and Michael stalk away from the restaurant
wordlessly.  After a few paces she starts to shake her head
and a big grin breaks over her face.  He sees this, but he
isn't sure what it means.

CATHY
	I can't believe you did that...

MICHAEL
	I'm sorry if I embarrassed you--

CATHY
	Are you kidding?  That was
	wonderful! I wish I had that much
	nerve...

		MICHAEL
I couldn't help myself...

CATHY
	(smiles)
	... Vincent would have done the
	same thing.

She stops at a hot dog vendor's cart and holds up two
fingers.  As she pays for the dogs another panhandler
appears ahead of then.  They see him and Cathy hands
Michael his hot dog with a look.

CATHY
	Now you hold onto this hot dog,
	Michael.  I'm not buying you three
	dinners tonight...

He smiles at her with deep appreciation, but doesn't laugh.
He's beginning to feel a new and much bigger 
emotion...

DISSOLVE TO:


23A INT. CATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Michael lies in the darkness on the couch, now made up as a
bed.  Catherine has drawn the sliding French doors that
separate the living room and bedroom.

23B ANGLE - THROUGH THE LOUVERS

We can SEE her shadow moving about as she prepares for
bed... Michael lies there watching the shadow play, HEARING
the rustle of her robe, with a look of enchantment...

DISSOLVE TO:

24 INT. D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY

Cathy sits at her desk catching up on some paperwork.

25 ACROSS THE ROOM

Michael approaches, looking around, being told where to find her...

26 WITH CATHY 

MICHAEL (O.S.)
	Hi.

She looks up and smiles.

CATHY
	Hi.  How's your day going?

MICHAEL
	(enthused)
	Great.  I went to the Metropolitan.  I wanted to see
	Van Gogh's sunflowers.

CATHY
	Only Van Gogh could paint a
	sunflower that makes your heart
	pound.

MICHAEL
	That museum is mind-boggling.

CATHY
	I know.  I usually get lost in
	the Egyptian section...

MICHAEL
	Do you still want to go to lunch?

CATHY
	Sure.  I'm just finishing up...


	NOW Joe comes up holding a bound deposition... He's too
	intent to immediately notice Michael.

JOE
	(agitated)
	Hey Radcliffe, I'm looking at this
	deposition you took for the Willis
	case.  Where' re you going with
	this line of questioning about
	where he does his shopping??

CATHY
	(calmly)
	The death threats came from a pay
	phone at a grocery about three
	blocks from Willis' apartment...

JOE
	(chastened)
	Oh.  Yeah -- right...

NOW he notices Michael, standing near Cathy's desk.  He
looks from Michael to Cathy to Michael...

CATHY 
	Joe, this is Michael Richmond.
	Michael, meet my boss, friend and
	chief tormentor, Joe Maxwell...

JOE
	(a bit off guard)
	Hi.  How you doin..?

MICHAEL
	Fine.  Good to meet you...

And awkward beat...

CATHY
	(enjoying it)
	... Michael's a friend from out
	of town.  He's come here for
	college.

JOE
	(to Michael, relaxing)
	Do me a favor -- stay out of law.
	We've got too many lawyers
	already.
	(to Cathy)
	Gee, for a minute Radcliffe I
	thought maybe your life had taken
	a new turn...

Cathy grabs her purse...

CATHY
	(chuckling)
	I won't say anything to spoil your
	fantasies...
	(to Michael)
	Let's get some lunch...

MICHAEL
	(happily heading off
	with her)
	So long, Joe...

Joe watches them walk out with a puzzled look on his face.

CUT TO:


26A EXT. STREET - DAY

Cathy and Michael are taking a walk after lunch.

CATHY
	Does the city feel any better to
	you?

MICHAEL
	Yes.,. It does.

CATHY
	(moved)
	I'm glad... Some things just take
	a little time.

MICHAEL
	And a little faith, I guess...

CATHY
	That, always...

MICHAEL
	(beat)
	... I'm moving into the dormitory
	tomorrow.

CATHY
	I know... Another new experience.

MICHAEL
	I still haven't figured out what
	classes I'm taking.

CATHY
	We'll go over the schedule
	tonight.  I can help...

MICHAEL
	Okay...

CATHY
	Don't worry, we'll figure
	everything out...

Cathy takes his arm and they continue on their way...

CUT TO:

27 - 35 OMITTED 

35A   EXT. CATHY'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT

Michael stands on the balcony gazing out at the city.  The
look on his face is that of a man whose world has opened --
a young man riding the crest of a powerful wave of
feeling...

35B   ANGLE - INSIDE

We SEE Cathy enter wearing her coat.  She then steps out
on the terrace... The crisp fall air invigorates them.
She turns -- he smiles...

MICHAEL
	So much energy out there...

CATHY
	  So it's different than you
	  remember it?

MICHAEL
	What's different -- is me...  The
	things that frightened me then,
	are beginning to thrill me now...

CATHY
	Because you're no longer blinded
	by your disappointment.

MICHAEL
	I owe that to you.

CATHY
	Are you thinking about seeing your
	father?

MICHAEL
	(slowly nods)
	... Today I went by the house
	where I used to live.  I don't
	know if he still lives there...
	(drifting off)

CATHY
	How did it feel?

MICHAEL
	(from the heart)
	It brought everything back -- more
	feelings than memories -- feeling
	helpless and alone...  And for
	a minute I didn't think I could
	deal with it -- but I could, and
	I did... And then things started
	to sort of make sense.  I guess
	my father did what he had to do
	-- and so did 1.  Maybe he was
	feeling helpless and alone, too.
	I tried to understand that. I
	even tried to forgive him...
	(looking at her)
	I think I'm finally ready to see
	him again...

She clasps his arm, happy for him...

CATHY
	(touched)
	Good... I brought Chinese.
	C'mon, we can work on your
	schedule.

DISSOLVE TO:

35C   INT. CATHY'S APARTMENT - DINING AREA - NIGHT

Amid an array of opened Chinese food containers that litter
Cathy's dining table, she and Michael consult his course
catalogue and make notes, trying to work out a schedule...

CATHY
	... Okay let's see...
	(consulting notes)
	Tuesday and Thursday you have

Cathy and Michael sit on the sofa.  The catalog and

wine... Cathy raises a glass.

CATHY
	(tenderly)
	... Here's to the beginning of
	a great time in your life... May
	all good things come to you.

Michael looks touched as he clinks glasses with her...

MICHAEL
	... I'll never know how to thank you.

CATHY
	You don't have to... Just watching
	you begin to open up and accept
	life has been really wonderful.

MICHAEL
	But it wouldn't have happened
	without your kindness.

CATHY
	You deserved it.  I feel lucky
	to know you.

MICHAEL
	You do?

CATHY
	(nods)
	... I really do.

Michael reaches behind a cushion on the couch and brings
out an old book...

MICHAEL
	I found this today at the

He gives her the book...

	"To The Evening Star")
	Thou fair-hair'd angel of the
	evening,/ Now, while the sun rests
	on the mountains, light/ Thy
	bright torch of love; thy radiant
	crown/ Put on, and smile upon our
	evening bed!/ Smile on our loves;
	and, while thou drawest the/ Blue
	curtains of the sky, scatter thy
	silver dew/ On every flower that
	shuts its sweet eyes/ in timely
	sleep.  Let thy west wind sleep
	on/ The lake; speak silence with
	thy glimmering eyes,/ And wash
	the dusk with silver.  Soon, full
	soon,/ Dost thou withdraw; then
	the wolf rages wide, / And the lion
	glares thro' the dun forest:/ The
	fleeces of our flocks are cover'd
	with/ Thy sacred dew: protect them
	with thine influence.

As she reads, Michael watches her with love and
admiration... When she finishes...

MICHAEL
	You read that so beautifully...

CATHY
	It's one of my favorites, too...

They both smile...


CATHY
	Listen, you've got a big day,

In the darkened living room, Michael lies on the couch,
under the covers, still awake... He turns and looks toward
Cathy's bedroom...

37 ANGLE - FRENCH DOORS

We see Cathy's silhouette moving about behind the french
doors... Now the doors open and she's standing there
wearing a translucent nightgown -- moonlight streaks
through from the bedroom behind her... She comes toward
Michael with eyes full of love and reassurance... She
takes him by, the hand -- and then leads him toward her
bedroom...

38 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

in the moonlight, Cathy and Michael lay beside each other,
staring into each other's eyes... Then, slowly their lips
meet and they begin to drink each other in... Michael,
now beyond control, envelopes her in a hungry embrace.

39 ANGLE - THROUGH THE DOORS TO THE TERRACE

Vincent moves to the bedroom window, looks in and sees
what's happening inside and is utterly crestfallen...

Now turns, sees Vincent. Michael looks to be struck by
lightening...

Suddenly changes -- now filling with a wild rage. He
shatters the bedroom doors, bursting through with a blood
curdling roar...

Reacts in terror. Suddenly Cathy is no longer there --
Michael tries to get away...

Snarling terrifyingly, he takes Michael by the throat, picks
him up -- and brings his claws back to slash. He slashes...

Vincent teaches the sane class we saw before.  Now Samantha

	Piping songs of pleasant glee
	On a cloud I saw a child.
	And he laughing said to me.
	Pipe a song about a lamb;
	So I piped with merry cheer,
	Piper pipe that song again-
	So I piped, he wept to hear.

As she reads, we SEE Michael appear at the door,
uncertainly, as if he isn't sure he wants to be here.
Brooke looks up and sees him, though, and jumps to her
feet.

BROOKE

She runs over and hugs Michael.  The class reacts to him
with joy.  Vincent is also pleased.  But despite the
positive reaction, Michael is clearly a little awkward...

	You aren't unhappy?

MICHAEL
	No...

VINCENT

VINCENT
She's a rare person.  You
couldn't have a better guide.

MICHAEL

	Yes... that's true...

Vincent watches him closely now, perhaps guessing the real
problem here...

VINCENT
	Michael, what's troubling you?

MICHAEL
	Nothing...

Vincent looks at him, knowing better...

Vincent's getting too close.  Michael dissembles.

MICHAEL
	It's just... school, I guess.
	You know -- all the courses,
	decisions, new people... it's a
	lot to think about...

VINCENT
	To leave a safe place and find
	your way among strangers -- is
	a difficult passage for anyone.

A part of Michael wants Vincent to know the truth...

MICHAEL
	Yes... I know that...

VINCENT

	Is it the past?

MICHAEL
	No... I don't know...

Vincent studies Michael a long moment.

VINCENT

pipes in from somewhere.  A mixed crowd of STUDENTS and
older-looking ALUMNI mingles.

Cathy and Michael stand near a refreshment table.  They're
talking to BETH, an old friend of Catherine's...

CATHY

Michael stands frozen in fear.  It's a moment he's dreaded
the last seven years... He summons all his nerve...

	Michael... your son.

listening.
