  11EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce finish up a light jog.  As they walk
          toward the front door, Johnny stretches a tight back.

                                        BRUCE
                        You crampin' up?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nah, it's just weird -- I barely
                        ditched my cane, now I'm a jogger
                        again.

                                        BRUCE
                        Gotta find some way to work off
                        that pent-up energy.
                                (then)
                        Loren says you haven't called her
                        back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, yeah.  Loren's a nice girl. 
                        I just wasn't feeling it.

                                        BRUCE
                        You weren't 'feeling' it?  You
                        had dinner.  Once.  Whatever
                          happened to 'let love grow'?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Whatever happened to 'love at
                        first sight'?

          With that, they arrive at the front door to find a large
          BOARD-LIKE OBJECT wrapped in BROWN PAPER.  Bruce tears
          off a card attached to it.

                                        BRUCE
                        'Mr.  Smith.  I hope you can help.' 
                        There's no name.

                                        JOHNNY
                        See?  Somebody out there loves
                        me.

          Bruce makes a face, and--          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TEASER - 2/1/05 - PINK  2.


  22INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          RIIIP!  Bruce tears the brown paper away to reveal...


          A PAINTING OF A GIRL NAMED CHLOE

            A captivating young woman, 20-ish, brown-haired, lies on
          an antique sofa in a white dress.  Her arms are up and
          behind her, as if she tossed herself down for a nap.

          She is in a RAMSHACKLE ROOM.  Wooden walls.  PEELING PAINT. 
          It is NIGHT.  Through a nearby window, a glow of moonlight
          hits her.  (See Wyeth's "Helga" paintings.)

          Chloe looks at us... but almost through us.  And through...

          Johnny, who is transfixed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's incredible.

                                        BRUCE
                        You have no idea. 
                                  (pronounced "Line")
                        This is an Andrew Lyne original.

          As he says this, Bruce points out an "AL" in the bottom
          right corner of the frame.  Johnny comes out of his moment:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Lyne...  Isn't he from Maine?

                                        BRUCE
                        Part of the artists' colony down
                        on the coastal line.  Big-time
                          recluse.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Long fingernails and bad hygiene?

                                        BRUCE
                        He's a recluse, not a hermit. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds like he was a patient. 

                                        BRUCE
                          Actually, a subject.  Art history --
                        Junior year of college.  The man's
                          a legend, Johnny.  Painted solid
                        for seven years, then stopped.

          Bruce gets closer to the girl's image, studies it.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TEASER - 2/1/05 - PINK  3.


    2CONTINUED:2

                                        BRUCE
                        Made his name on a series of
                          paintings called "Daughter". 
                          Inspired by his girl...
                                  (recalling)
                        Think her name was Julia.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why'd he stop?

                                        BRUCE
                        She died.  Drowned or something. 
                        But this isn't her.  At least, I
                        don't remember this painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's working again.

                                        BRUCE
                        If he is, that's a big deal.  I
                        mean, like, huge.  Question is,
                        who sent this and why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  But it's gonna
                        look great over the mantel.

          Johnny goes to move the painting, but -- WHOOOSH!


33A VISION - CONTINUOUS

          When he looks down, Johnny's hands and arms have taken on
          the color and character of Andrew Lyne's artwork.  It's
          Johnny in brushstrokes.

          The BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT overtakes Johnny and....

                                                                              FLASH TO: 


  44INT. RAMSHACKLE ROOM - VISION - NIGHT/DAY

          Johnny is in the painting.  Same wooden-walled room with
          peeling paint.  Chloe on the sofa in front of him. 
          Everything remains in brushstroke effect....

          Chloe shifts on the sofa.  Smiles.  Poses.

          But as Johnny gets closer, she looks straight at him. 
          Her eyes go wide...

          And then they are still.  Deathly still.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TEASER - 2/1/05 - PINK  4.


    4CONTINUED:4

          A spot of blood appears on the front of her white dress.

          Johnny freezes.  What's happening?  Where's the blood
          coming from?

            Suddenly, blood trickles down Chloe's forehead.  It 

          Dabbles onto her dress... joining the previous stain.

          Her skin goes ASHEN....

          And then the SUN is in the window, NOT the moon.  Night
          becomes day.

          Johnny looks up.  The SUNLIGHT is BLISTERING.  Johnny
          tries to shield himself, but it's too bright.  BURNING. 
          WASHING OUT, and...  

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:


  55JOHNNY AT THE PAINTING - INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          He sets it down, emotionally sucker-punched.  He takes a
          moment to nearly touch the image of Chloe....

                                        JOHNNY
                        We have to find her, Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think she's going to die.


  66INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce move through bustle to Walt's office.

                                        BRUCE
                        We're wasting our time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll get him to listen.

                                        BRUCE
                        And he'll say what he always says. 
                        'I need more than visions, Johnny.'

          They are cut off by Walt.  On his way out.

                        ones over the years, but you gotta
                        hear me out on this.

                        Sure, but let's walk and talk. 
                        Gotta make it down to the coastal
                        line.

                        Andrew Lyne.  Claims his daughter's
                          missing.

  88EXT. LYNE HOUSE - DAY

          A stunning property.  Slightly shabby, but expansive. 
          And lived-in.  Walt's cruiser pulls up.  Bruce and Johnny
          get out of Johnny's Rover.  Walt reacts to the spread:

                                        WALT
                        So much for the starving artist.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, the good ones live large,
                        Walt.  Look at this place.  No
                        wonder he never leaves.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The man buried his first daughter. 
                                (then)
                        There's no escaping that.   

          Bruce frowns at the downer moment -- but Johnny is clearly
          taken by the spooky mystery of the place. 

          Johnny and Walt progress toward the front door, but Bruce
          hangs back, spotting the lighthouse

                                        BRUCE
                        I think that's where he works. 
                        I'm gonna check it out.

          Bruce is already taking off.  Walt's happy to let him go:

                                        WALT
                        Knock yourself out.
                                (then)
                        And Bruce -- we're guests, not
                        fans.

                                        BRUCE
                                (messing with him)
                        Damn.  Forgot my autograph book.

          And he goes.  Johnny and Walt approach the front door. 

          Johnny, still focused, knocks on the door.  No answer.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - ONE - 2/1/05 - PINK  7.

          Grabs the doorknob.  These guys have been doing it long
          enough to have that silent language: Walt looks at Johnny --
            anything?  Johnny shakes his head.

  1010EXT. BEACH - LYNE HOUSE - DAY

          Find ANDREW LYNE, a gruff older man with a shaggy beard,
          tennis shoes and paint-splattered shirt. 

          Lyne eyes something in the sand.  As he squats down to
          touch it, REVEAL Johnny and Walt approaching.

                                        WALT
                        Mr. Lyne?

          Lyne doesn't look back.  He's riveted by what he finds --
          a metal camping LANTERN.  Rusted beyond recognition.

                                        LYNE
                                (eyeing the lantern)
                        What do you think?  Maybe a jilted
                        lover was scouring the beach at
                        night, searching for a lost soul. 
                        But the flame flickered away and
                        died.

          Johnny and Walt exchange a look, then...

                                        WALT
                        Maybe somebody just threw it away.

          Lyne slowly turns.

                                        LYNE
                        Sheriff Bannerman.

          They shake hands.

                        Sir.

                                        LYNE
                        And Johnny Smith.  The not-so-
                        secret weapon.  I'm honored.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (hates the notoriety)
                        You've read about me in the papers.

                                        LYNE
                        My daughter admired your gift. *
                        What happened to your cane?*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Outgrew it.

                                        LYNE
                          I see...
                                (he liked the cane)
                        It gave you an air of mystery.

          Lyne wipes his hand on his shirt. 

                                        LYNE
                        Your power of precognition.  I*
                        understand it works by touch.*

                                        JOHNNY
                        It does.  But not always on demand. 

          Lyne holds out his hand.  Johnny isn't sure how to react...

                                        LYNE
                                (quiet intensity)
                        My daughter's missing, Mr. Smith. 
                        I need someone to find her.

          Johnny shakes his hand.  Nothing.

                                        LYNE
                          Sheriff, you'll have to do it the*
                          old-fashioned way.

          Lyne moves toward the LIGHTHOUSE, they follow. 

                                        WALT*
                        Mr. Lyne, one of your paintings

                        You've met Chloe. *


  1111INT. LYNE'S STUDIO - LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

          An ocean of Chloe imagery -- she's in every one of Lyne's
          paintings.  The studio is a classic artist's space, with
          clutter and paint splatter all about.  Lyne's images of
          Chloe feature her in rustic scenes, evocative, not photo-
          realistic.  Blurry focus, muted tones.  Like Wyeth with a
          dash of Monet.

          REVEAL Bruce, standing across from the paintings.  Slightly
          in awe.  Johnny and Walt enter behind him. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Check this, man.  He really is
                          painting again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We figured that out.

                                        LYNE (O.S.)
                        Make yourself comfortable,
                        gentlemen.

          Bruce hears the voice, gets slightly tense.

                                        WALT
                                (to Bruce)
                        No autographs.

          Lyne enters.   

                                        BRUCE
                        Mr. Lyne.  It's an honor. 
                                (shaking hands)
                        Name's Bruce.  I'm a friend of
                          Johnny's.  Studied your work in
                          college.

                                        LYNE
                        Ah.  You should have gotten a
                        real education.

          Lyne puts the rusted lamp with his clutter.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - ONE - 2/1/05 - PINK  10.


    11CONTINUED:11

                                        BRUCE
                          Actually, I'm an occupational
                          therapist by trade, but I have
                        many diverse interests, fine art
                        being one of them....

          Bruce trails off as he catches a glare from Walt.

                                        WALT
                        Mr. Lyne.  How long has Chloe
                        been missing?  

                                        LYNE
                        Nearly three days.  Feels like
                        weeks.

          Johnny's eyes are on Chloe in the paintings:

                                        JOHNNY
                        How old is she?

                                        LYNE
                        Barely twenty.

                                        WALT
                        She's no longer a minor.  Which
                        means there's not much I can do. 
                        Or you, for that matter.

                                        LYNE
                        It's not that she left.  It's who
                        she might have left with.  Her
                        friends are, well... I'm concerned. 

          Johnny is about to touch a painting, but--

          A NOISE offscreen.  Through some of the clutter: NORA
          COLLINS, 40, taskmaster, assistant, works behind a canvas
          in a corner of the studio.  She uses a large brush with
          white paint.  She wears a stained apron, too.

                                        NORA
                        Sorry. 

                                        LYNE
                        It's alright, Nora. 
                                (introducing)
                        My assistant, Miss Collins.

                                        NORA
                        Please.  I won't interrupt.

          Johnny sees her canvas.  A painting half-covered in white.

                                (to Lyne)
                          Starting over?

                                        NORA
                          Actually, we're re-priming the
                        canvas.  Mr. Lyne didn't love the
                        first draft. 

          Guess that makes sense -- but then Johnny's attention
          moves past the canvas...and a realization: The wooden
          walls of the studio.  Ramshackle.  Paint peeling.  And
          there's a window.  This is....


          THE PAINTING SPACE

          where the TEASER painting was created.  Below the window,
          Johnny spots... a sofa.  Same one as in the painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The painting I received -- this
                        is where Chloe posed for you.

                                        LYNE
                                (nods)
                        One of our first efforts.  And
                        one of her favorites.  

          Johnny goes toward it.  There's some clutter in the way.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Nora)
                        May I?

                                        NORA
                        Please.

          Nora gets some things out of his way.  Among them, a rack
          of dresses.  Johnny looks them over.

                                        JOHNNY
                        These are Chloe's?

                        Mr. Lyne bought them for her. 
                        For the paintings.

                        She was wearing white....

                        There was blood on it.

                        much.

          Before she hands it over, she trades a look with Lyne.  A
          little weirded out.  Lyne nods, it's okay.  Nora gives
          Johnny the dress, and the instant he touches it--

                                                                                FLASH TO:


  1212MATCH, MOVE MORPH AROUND JOHNNY - VISION

          Everyone else disappears and Johnny is in the same spot. 
          Except now Johnny is in a paint-splattered T-shirt and
          jeans -- he is Lyne. 

          He is joined by Chloe, wearing the white dress from the
            painting.  She sits on the couch.  Johnny/Lyne stops her.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        Let's do it this way, kiddo.

          He positions her arms above and behind her.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        You're hanging out.  Like a lazy
                        girl on a summer's day.

                                        CHLOE

                        Okay.  But I'm not lazy.

          Johnny/Lyne goes to his waiting canvas.  Grabs a brush. 
          He's about to start, but--

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        It's been so long.  I'm not sure
                        I have it anymore.

                                        CHLOE
                        It's going to be amazing.

          Johnny/Lyne smiles, starts working.  Pollock-like
          intensity, focus... and style.  He is driven.  He is Lyne.

          He stops for a second.  His daughter smiles at him.

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:


  1313LYNE'S STUDIO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Lyne, intrigued, waits for a response. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Lyne)
                        Must be exciting.

                                        LYNE
                        What's that, Mister Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To be painting again.  Maybe even
                          overwhelming.

          Johnny has struck a nerve with Lyne.

                                        LYNE
                        It was like living in the dark,
                        those years after Julia passed. 
                        You might say I was wandering the
                        beach with an old rusty lantern. 
                        Chloe helped me find my way.

                                        WALT
                        How did she come back into your
                        life?

                                        LYNE
                        I'd been sending money since she
                        was an infant.  Chloe's mother
                        only informed her of my existence
                        in the last few years.  She located
                        me and we were reunited.

                                        WALT
                        Could Chloe have gone back to be
                        with her mother?

                                        LYNE
                        Dear God, I hope not.  Her mother's
                        dead.  Cancer.

          Johnny remains focused on Chloe in a painting:

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's your muse.

    13CONTINUED:13

                                        LYNE
                        She is everything.
                                (re: paintings)
                        In my younger days, I painted
                        still lifes, Mr. Smith.  It was
                        only after my first portrait, of
                        my daughter Julia, that anyone
                        took notice.  But I lost her.  I
                        don't intend to lose Chloe.

          Johnny stares at an image.  Chloe seems to look at him. 
          It only makes his determination stronger:

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll need something else that
                        belongs to her.


  1414INT. LYNE HOUSE - CHLOE'S ROOM - DAY - ON SKETCHES

          Rustic landscapes -- but abstract and modernist.  HARSH
          ANGLES.  Johnny and Walt move among the drawings, torn
          pages taped to walls or part of open sketch books.  They
          are the main decor of Chloe's room, which is tastefully
            shabby-chic, but with a sparse feel.

          Johnny is about to touch one of the drawings, but --

                                        LYNE
                        Before you 'see' something, I
                        should  make a confession -- Chloe
                        and I weren't always on good terms. 
                        Her mother and I never were.  The
                        classic broken family I'm afraid. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          I understand.

          Johnny notices a corner of a sketch.  Initialed: "CG".

                                        JOHNNY
                        C.G.?

                                        LYNE
                        Chloe uses her mother's maiden
                        name, Gelman.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        To not compete with her famous
                        father.

          Johnny moves around the room, touching Chloe's work.  The
          sketches give him nothing. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - ONE - 2/1/05 - PINK  15.

          But when Johnny touches the double-door on the closet --


  1515VISION - INT. LYNE HOUSE - CHLOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Chloe is suddenly there... And Johnny is beside her.  She
          dials her cell phone -- at the same time she yanks open
          the closet and finds a suitcase. 

          Lyne comes to the door -- and she immediately hits "END." 
          We're in an argument from Chloe's past -- a loud one. 

                                        LYNE
                        Where could you possibly go?

                                        CHLOE
                          Anywhere but here.

                                        LYNE
                        You have no money, Chloe -- and
                        you won't get a single penny from
                        me... not a single penny!

                                        CHLOE
                        Keep your money.  I'm leaving.

                                        LYNE
                        We haven't finished our work.

          But Chloe begins to fill the suitcase.  Seeing how serious
          she is, Lyne changes his tack:

                                        LYNE
                        Chloe, please. 

          Chloe takes the slightest pause -- but forces herself to
          keep packing.  And she's done.  She is heading out, but
          stops to grab her cell phone. 

          Johnny's focus turns to the phone -- and suddenly, the
          VISION REWINDS.  Chloe SPEEDS BACK to the start of the
          VISION, holding up her cell phone to dial.  FREEZE VISION. 
          Johnny looks over her shoulder at --


          THE CELL PHONE SCREEN - CONTACT READS: "DYLAN"


  1616BACK TO REALITY - INT. LYNE HOUSE - CHLOE'S ROOM - DAY

          Johnny releases the closet door.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Dylan deals drugs.  Nothing
                          substantial, just enough to pay

                        I can have my people do some 
                          digging, John, but she's basically
                        a runaway.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw what I saw this morning. 
                          Something's not right.  

          Bruce comes up.

                                        BRUCE
                        This place is amazing.  He's got
                          peacocks.

          That's Walt's cue to go:

                                        WALT
                          Alright, you boys find anything
                        solid, call me.  Just be careful.

          Walt gets in his car and drives away.

            shoulder.  He walks with Johnny and Bruce.

                        I told you.  She's just a friend.

          They arrive at Dylan's car, a slightly tricked out little
          Japanese number.  As he fumbles for his keys and drops
          them, Johnny picks them up... on purpose.

                        His name's Graydon.  Promised to
                        put my stuff in a show... yeah
                        right.  Guy gives snakes a bad
                        name.

          As Johnny takes in this new info:

                                        GRAYDON (V.O.)
                                (prelap)
                        Of course I'll make it happen...


  2121INT. ART GALLERY - BAR HARBOR - DAY

          TOM GRAYDON, 45, sharp talker, sharp dresser, is on the
          phone at the desk of his sleek but understated gallery. 
          Even for an art dealer, Graydon is a mid-grade salesmen
          in a high-grade world.  There's an air of schmooze.

                                        GRAYDON (CONT'D)
                        You have my word as a gentleman. 
                          Absolutely.

          He hangs up.  The door opens behind him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thomas Graydon?

          Without looking, Graydon holds his hand to his head, in
          mock psychic mode.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Lemme guess.  The enigmatic Johnny
                        Smith.
                                (spins around)
                          Correct!  I guess you're not the
                        only psychic in town.

          Johnny has instant dislike for this guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You heard I was helping Mr. Lyne.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - ONE - 2/1/05 - PINK  20.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Spoke to Andrew this morning.  He
                        was impressed.  "A young man of
                          infinite vision," I think he said.

          Graydon shakes Bruce's hand -- but stops at Johnny's.

                                        GRAYDON
                                (it's the schmooze)
                        Can you tell me if there's any
                        loose change in my sofa cushions?

          Johnny shakes his hand.  Small WHOOSH.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've had a good year.

                                        GRAYDON
                        It's only going to get better.

                                        BRUCE
                        Once you show the new 'Daughter'
                        series.

                                        GRAYDON
                                (annoyed)
                        And you are....

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's an art critic.  You seen
                        Chloe, Mr. Graydon?

                                        GRAYDON
                        Not since she broke her father's
                        heart.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure about that?

          Johnny looks past Graydon -- to a modernist piece on the
          wall.  Very angular.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This looks an awful lot like her
                        work.

                                        GRAYDON
                                  (surprised)
                        You have an eye for detail, Mr.
                        Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm learning.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - ONE - 2/1/05 - PINK  21.

          Graydon seems apprehensive.  Which is Johnny's cue to go
          over to Chloe's art.  And touch it.

                                                                              WHOOSH TO:


  2222INT. LYNE'S HOUSE - CHLOE'S ROOM - VISION

          Chloe works on the same image.  Graydon behind her.  Heated
          discussion in progress.

                                        GRAYDON
                        That would look great in my
                          gallery.

                                        CHLOE
                        Forget it.  I just want what I
                        was promised.  It's my money.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Did you ask him? 

                                        CHLOE
                        He told me it wouldn't be a
                          problem.
                                (then)
                        He said to ask you.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Well, everything is negotiable.

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:


  2323INT. ART GALLERY - DAY

          Johnny releases the painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Money's a recurring theme with
                        Chloe, isn't it?
                                (off Graydon's look)
                        You fought about it.

                                        GRAYDON
                        We had a conversation.

          Johnny just looks at him.  Then--

                                        GRAYDON
                        She wanted part of her inheritance
                        before she took off.

                        But that's not up to Dad, is it?

                                        GRAYDON
                        You must have a name. 
                                (back to Johnny)
                        Mr. Lyne put me in charge of his
                          finances ten years ago. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        So you gave her nothing.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Not much to give.  Lyne lives on
                        that spread because he owns it
                          outright.  Everything else is
                          leveraged to the moon. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Who's fault is that?

                                        GRAYDON
                        The new daughter paintings are
                        Lyne's first significant work in
                        years.  They're going to make him
                        a very wealthy man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you?

                                        GRAYDON
                        It's a team effort, isn't it?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (writing it down)
                        You hear from her, that's my
                        number.

          As they go:

                                        GRAYDON (CONT'D)
                          Careful, Johnny Smith.  Chloe's
                        not what she seems.

          And we're....


  2424INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          ...ON Chloe's eyes, in the painting Johnny was captivated
          by in the Teaser.  Chloe on the sofa, under the window,
          moonlit night.  Johnny hangs up his cordless phone.

                        I keep tryin' her cell.  She's
                        not picking up.

          Bruce is here, having opened some coffee table books about
          Lyne around the room.

                                        BRUCE
                        The first cycle of daughter
                          paintings were estimated to be
                        worth around twenty million. 
                                (re: painting)
                        He could see some serious cash
                        for this bunch.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: Chloe)
                        Maybe she sent it to me.

                        Lyne did say it's one her
                        favorites.  But why play games? 
                        If she wants your help, she can
                        pick up the phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe she's afraid.  I think she's
                        trying to tell me something.

                                        BRUCE
                        What? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure.

          It's enough to make Johnny approach the painting again. 
          This time, he doesn't grab the frame, he touches the actual
          paint.  The BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT moves up his arm and
            overtakes Johnny, and he's....


  2525INT. LYNE'S STUDIO - VISION - IN THE PAINTING - NIGHT/DAY

          But this time, Johnny wears paint-splattered T-shirt and
          jeans.  Lyne garb.  Johnny approaches Chloe on the sofa. 
          He's got a paintbrush in his hand.

          The BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT fades away. 

          Blood appears again.  Flowing down her face.  Horrifying. 
          And just as before....

            MOONLIGHT becomes SUNLIGHT in the window.  Blinding.

          Suddenly..  .Johnny/Lyne hears SEAGULLS.  And there's
          water at Johnny's feet.  In the room.  Like tide coming
          into the house.  Weird.

          And finally, Johnny feels something in his hand.  It's
          not the paintbrush. 

          Johnny has a LARGE ROCK in his hand.

          With BLOOD on it.  He raises it, SWINGS at Chloe and--

                        I was the killer, Bruce.  And

          Bruce reacts, and....

                          daughter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was standing over her, Walt. 
                                (working it through)
                        I was painting her -- I was wearing
                        his clothes.

                        It doesn't make sense.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (taken aback)
                        I saw them argue.  Maybe Lyne
                        threatened her.  What else could
                        spook Chloe enough to make her
                        take off?

                                        WALT
                        I don't know, but wherever she
                        went, she's gone.  I had Roscoe
                        check out the bus station.  She
                        didn't buy a ticket, didn't show
                        up on security video.  Nothing.
                                (re: files)
                        And her college file.  No emergency
                          contacts except her dead mother. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Wait a second -- maybe daddy did
                          threaten her. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You just said it didn't make sense.

                                        BRUCE
                        Not to us -- but to crazy artist
                        guy.  Think about it.  Lyne's
                        career was made by these portraits. 
                        After he lost the first daughter,
                        he was in the dark.  For years.

                        Scott Peterson called the cops,

                                        WALT
                        Point taken, but you know the
                        drill, John -- I can't arrest a
                        man for a murder he might commit. 
                        We haven't even found the victim.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (slightly hard)
                        My visions aren't some kind of
                          alternate reality, they are reality --
                        unless we change it.

                        on the sonofabitch. 

          Walt reads Johnny's agitation.

                                        WALT
                        Go easy, John.

                        I'll go easy when Chloe's safe.

          Johnny charges out.  Off Bruce and Walt's traded concern...

          Johnny gets in his Range Rover.  Emotionally, he's at a
          brick wall.  Bruce, right behind him, also reads his
          friend's frustration.

                        I'll see ya.

          Johnny closes the door.  Then, he spots....


            A NOTEPAD ON THE WINDSHIELD

          One of those suction-cup things, for jots.  Clip-on pen.


          JOHNNY

          pulls the pad off the window, but he doesn't write.  He
          draws.  Focused.  Intense.  The way he was as Lyne in
          that vision.  He creates a woman's hair.  Her face.  We
            recognize her.  It's....


  2929INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Chloe.  We're back on THE PAINTING.  REVERSE on Johnny,
          still in his robe.  Staring at Chloe.  Johnny hasn't slept
          much.  Been a long night.  But he remains transfixed.  He
          touches the painting --


  29A29AAND WE'RE IN A VISION - CONTINUOUS

                                        CHLOE (O.S.)
                        It's my turn now.

          Johnny spins around.  Chloe is in the room with him, in
          her WHITE DRESS.  Johnny notices leaves blowing by his
          feet.  Right here in his house.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Chloe?

                        I'm not sure I want you to see
                        this.

          Chloe walks, Johnny follows.  And the room bleeds away in
          a MATCH, MOVE, MORPH to become...          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TWO - 2/1/05 - PINK  28.


  29B29BEXT. YANKEE HOUSE - DAY

          ...The yard of a very DISTINCTIVE MANSION.  The ground is
          covered with leaves that FLUTTER past.  When Chloe looks
            back...Johnny is Lyne now.  Same garb as before.

  3131INT. YANKEE HOUSE - DAY - VISION

          An antique-filled, Yankee-style Maine house.  Chloe leads
          Johnny/Lyne to a window, and her easel... with her
            modernist artwork on it.  He stops cold, smiles.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        Why didn't you show me this before? 

                                        CHLOE
                        I was afraid.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        Don't be silly.  We have no
                          secrets.

            A moment.  She's eager to hear what her father thinks.

                                        CHLOE
                        Well.

                                          JOHNNY/LYNE
                        It's... fascinating.

                        You say that like it's a bad thing.

                          Painting isn't just about the
                          picture, Chloe.  You must control
                        the canvas.  Your angles and colors
                        are appealing.  But it's only the
                          surface.

                        It's always beautiful.  And it's
                        almost always a lie.

          As Chloe takes this in, we BLEED BACK INTO...


  3232INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - MORNING

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't trust the surface...

          A KNOCK at the door.


  32A32AINT. FOYER/LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

            A haggard Johnny opens the front door.  It's Bruce, two
          coffees in hand.

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn, boy.  Tell me you called
                        Loren and she kept you up all
                        night.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not Loren.

          Johnny busies himself, finding paper and pencil.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw Chloe again.  I was with
                        her -- I mean, Lyne was.  They
                        were at this creepy old place.

          With that, Bruce stops cold.  The room is littered with
          more insane "jots" of Chloe, drawn on any available piece
          of paper, from bills to faxes to Sunday circulars.  Her
          image is eerily repeated.  As Bruce finds stuff, TIGHT
          SHOTS reveal many of the Chloe images also have the BLOOD
          drawn on them, along with frozen eyes of death.

                                        BRUCE
                        This the part when you start saying
                          "Redrum"?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I get these images in my head,
                        Bruce.  Drawing them helps.

                                        BRUCE
                          I thought you couldn't draw.

                          I can't.

          It would be funny if it weren't creepy.  Johnny quickly
          begins one of his jots.

                                        BRUCE
                        These visions are having some
                        kind of residual effect.  You
                        said you became Lyne, right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So I picked up his talent?

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe more.  If you feel compelled
                        to draw these things, maybe you're -- 
                        I don't know -- picking up his
                        obsession.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you, Dr. Phil now?

                        What are you doin', fool?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shows him drawing)
                        This is it.  She said it was their
                          'special place.'

          Johnny shows Bruce his paper -- an image of the distinctive
          YANKEE HOUSE.  And a good one.  Bruce eyes it, then a
          light bulb goes off.  As he digs through Johnny's crazy
            drawings, he finds his coffee table books on Lyne.

                                        BRUCE
                        I've seen it before....

                        Yeah, so?

                                (skimming)
                        Some pretty legendary shindigs
                          happened at this house.  Still do
                        if you believe the rumors.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The rumors?

  3636EXT. YANKEE HOUSE - DAY

          Dead empty.  Leaves blow across the yard, as Johnny and
          Bruce approach, having just exited the Land Rover.

                                        BRUCE
                        Gamble House ranks with some of
                        the great salons in history. 
                          Algonquin Round Table's got nothin'
                        on this place.

                                        JOHNNY
                        All this from the one book?

                                        BRUCE
                        I did some more digging.  The,
                        uh, parties were a little... you
                        know... twisted.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Twisted.

                                        BRUCE
                                (whispers)
                        Freaky.  Like in 'Eye's Wide Shut'.

    36CONTINUED:36

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ah.  Twisted.

                                        BRUCE
                        Which would be fitting with Lyne's
                        view of the world.  Calm and
                          sophisticated on the surface --
                        but underneath, distorted,
                          unexpected, out of control.  That's
                        why he paints with blurred focus. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        To obscure the truth.

          At that moment, Johnny pushes through the gate at the
          bottom of the steps, and WHOOSH he sees --


  3737CHLOE IN A WINDOW - VISION - DAY

          Johnny rushes to the front door. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's here.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Chloe!  

          Johnny finds the door locked.  Gets frustrated.  He is
          intent on getting in.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny, easy, man--

          Johnny checks another window.  Chloe's in that one, too. 
          (This time we see she's in the white dress.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hang on, Chloe!  

          Johnny tries the door again, and suddenly....


  3838THE WORLD GOES DARK

          Johnny looks back, and Bruce is gone -- and DAY BECOMES
          NIGHT IN THREE SECONDS.

          When Johnny looks back to the door, it opens, as a well-
          dressed couple heads out.  Inside: The ANTIQUE-FILLED
          HOUSE (as we saw before).          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TWO - 2/1/05 - PINK  33.


  3939INT. YANKEE HOUSE - NIGHT - VISION - CONTINUOUS

          A sumptuous little soiree in progress.  Beautiful People
          in tailored suits and barely-there cocktail dresses. 
          Artistic and critic types are in the mix, with partygoers
          and hangers-on clustered around them.

          But here's the thing:  Johnny moves through the party at
          normal speed.  Everyone else is slightly OVERCRANKED.  
          Johnny glimpses --


          DOWN A CORRIDOR

          Through a doorway.  A MAN and WOMAN.  Making out.  The
          Man slips down the strap of the woman's dress, kissing
          her bare shoulder.  And then, a SECOND WOMAN joins them.


          BACK ON JOHNNY

          He moves on, then spots Chloe among the partygoers.

          In that dress.  Stunning.  Johnny walks up to her.  Still
            OVERCRANKED, she looks through him.  Past him.

          Johnny follows her gaze to...

          Tom Graydon.  The art dealer.  He smiles at Chloe, motions
          her toward a corridor.

          As Johnny follows them, the PARTY GOES TO NORMAL SPEED
          and Johnny stays behind them.  

                                        GRAYDON
                        I'm so happy you came.  Anyone
                        ever tell you you're stunning? 

                                        CHLOE
                                (awkward)
                        Not today.

                                        GRAYDON
                        I still can't get over it -- you
                        really are like something out of
                        an Andrew Lyne painting.  The
                          resemblance is uncanny.

                                        CHLOE
                        Mr. Graydon, about tonight.  I'm
                        not sure I can...

                                        GRAYDON
                        Just relax.  Play it like we
                        discussed.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - TWO - 2/1/05 - PINK  34.


    39CONTINUED:39

          Chloe nods, but she's clearly uneasy.  Graydon arrives at
          a door to one of those corridor rooms.  He opens it to
          reveal....

          Andrew Lyne.  In a tuxedo.  Dashing and compelling. 

                                        CHLOE
                                  (recognizes him)
                        Is that...?

                                        GRAYDON
                        That's him. 

          Lyne approaches.  He gently touches her face, his hand
          tracing down along her neck in way that feels
            inappropriate.

                                        LYNE
                        My God, it's like a rebirth. 
                        It's Chloe, right?  

          Chloe can only nod.  Lyne and Graydon share a silent
          moment, then...

                                        LYNE
                        Would you like to sit for me,
                        Chloe? 

                                        CHLOE
                        Me.  Sit for you. 

                                        LYNE
                        We could create something memorable
                          together. 

          Chloe is like a little girl lost.

                                        GRAYDON
                        She's an artist, too, sir.

                                        LYNE
                        We'll have to share our work then. 
                        From one fraud to another.

          He smiles at his own joke. 

                                        CHLOE
                        That would be amazing.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Chloe has agreed to come aboard. 
                        To be a part of your new family.

                        Yes, a daughter reborn. 

          Lyne reaches to touch her face again as tears well in his
          eyes.

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:


  4040THE FRONT DOOR - EXT. YANKEE HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny lets go of the front door.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                        She's not his daughter, Bruce...
                        Chloe's not Lyne's daughter.

          The revelation hits them, and we....

          FADE IN:

  4141INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          On the CHLOE painting.  Johnny and Bruce once again face
          off with it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Graydon must have recruited her. 
                        To be Lyne's new muse.  To replace
                        the daughter he lost.

                                        BRUCE
                          Julia... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        The old man couldn't paint without
                        her.

                                        BRUCE
                        He's the one who found her body....

          Bruce digs through his trusty books. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Julia had gone out alone on the
                        water.  She fell in the boat and
                        hit her head.  Her body washed up
                        on the beach near the house.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The shoreline....

          Johnny moves back toward the CHLOE PAINTING.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw it.  In this painting.

          Bruce looks at the canvas.  Chloe in a room.  Night. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Dude.  There's no beach in that
                          painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was there, under my feet.

          Johnny touches it.  BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT consumes him,
          and....  


  4242INT. THE PAINTING - LYNE'S STUDIO - NIGHT/DAY

          Johnny is at the sofa again -- but Johnny is Johnny, not


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - THREE - 2/1/05 - PINK  37.


    42CONTINUED:42

          Lyne.  Chloe is posed.  And as before, the transformation
          begins....

          Night becomes Day.  Moonlight in the window becomes
            SUNLIGHT.  The light is BLINDING.

          Johnny hears SEAGULLS.  Then there's WATER at Johnny's
          feet.  Lapping in.  Like the tide.   

          He looks at Chloe.  She stares at him.  Those eyes that
          go still with death....


          TIGHT ON THE EYES

          They change color.  From Chloe's brown, to blue.  And
          they're different eyes.


          BACK ON JOHNNY

          first time he notices that.  He waits for the blood to
          erupt from her forehead, as before, but without warning....


          EVERYTHING GOES WHITE

          Johnny finds himself in a BLANK, Matrix-like VOID!  What
          the hell? 

          And then... The sky begins to BLEED in behind Johnny.  An
          entire coastline appears.  We recognize it as the coast
          behind Lyne's house.

          Johnny is at the shore.

          And at his feet, on the sand, against some rocks....

          Julia's corpse.  Blood down her face.  And on her dress.

          She lies against the rocks.  A skiff beyond her in the
          sand.

          Johnny stands in this entirely NEW PAINTING.  Tide hits
          his feet.  When he looks down, there is one object NOT IN
          BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT:

          A BLOODY ROCK.  The murder weapon.  The water washes away
          the crimson.  When Johnny tries to touch it....

                                                                        FLASH BACK TO:          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - THREE - 2/1/05 - PINK  38.


  4343INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          As Johnny comes out of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There was another painting.  It
                        was Julia. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You saw a different painting?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Everything went white.  Blank. 
                        Like it had been... Painted over.
                                (hits him)
                        He re-primed it.

          Johnny gets an idea.  Bruce isn't sure what it is, but...


  4444EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny leans the Chloe painting against the house.  Johnny
          has his mini-chemistry-set thing going out here -- and
          he's got Bruce mixing chemicals in a container.    

                                        BRUCE
                        I can't believe I'm agreeing to
                        this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It'll work.  The older paint's

                        It's nuts, Johnny!  This is
                          priceless art and you're about to
                        go Mr. Wizard all over its ass. 
                        I will not be a party to this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then don't.

          Johnny pulls the jug from his hand.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh, man.  Wait, wait!

          Bruce can barely watch --

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, but if God's an art lover,
                        you better be prepared to do a
                        lot of explaining.

          As Johnny pours the CHEMICAL SOLUTION along the top of
          the painting.  It streaks down...

          And bleeds the Chloe painting away.

          It REVEALS another painting beneath.  The sky and the
          rocky shore behind Lyne's house.  Johnny pours a second
          wave of the stuff.

          And Julia emerges -- posed exactly, and positioned in the
          same part of the canvas as Chloe.  It's as if Julia emerges
          directly from under her.

          Eerie. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn.  She could be Chloe's twin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the idea.

          ON the image of Julia, we hear:

                                        WALT (V.O.)
                                (prelap)
                        Julia Lyne died fifteen years
                        ago.


  4545INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - WALT'S OFFICE - DAY

          Walt at his desk with a file, Johnny and Bruce across.

                                        WALT
                        Lyne is listed as the father on
                        the death certificate.  He and
                        the mother were never married.

          Johnny opens the file to reveal a black-and-white CRIME
          SCENE PHOTO of Julia on the beach.  He holds it up to the
          JULIA PAINTING, which he and Bruce brought with them.... 
          Photo and painting are an exact match. 

                                        WALT
                        And he did find the body.  But he
                        was cleared of any involvement. 
                        As far as the world is concerned,
                        Julia's death was an accident. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's because they never found
                        the murder weapon.

                        He killed her, Walt.  I saw it.

                                        BRUCE
                        You said you saw Chloe die.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The rock was in both visions --
                        which is why he painted over her. 
                                (it's hitting him now)
                        To obscure the truth.  The surface
                        is a lie.  Don't you see the
                          pattern?

                          Daughter becomes muse.  Muse
                        becomes obsession.  Obsession
                        becomes murder.

          The reality sinks in. 


  4646EXT. LYNE HOUSE - DAY

          Sheriffs cruisers parked outside.  DEPUTY ROSCOE leads
          several other deputies toward the house.  They cross
          Johnny, Bruce and Walt.

                                        WALT
                                (to Roscoe)
                        I want a full sweep, inside and
                        out.

                                        ROSCOE
                        On it, boss.

          Johnny and Walt move on, toward the studio, as Graydon
          meets them.

                                        GRAYDON
                        I'm not going to allow --

                                        WALT
                                (hands him a paper)
                        That's a warrant, Mr. Graydon.  I
                        suggest you read it.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Based on what?  You are not going
                        to put my friend through this.

                        Friend, or benefactor?

                                        BRUCE
                        You just had to have some new
                          paintings to sell, didn't you? 
                        So you found the right girl and
                        turned her into his long lost
                          daughter.

          Graydon freezes at the realization.  They know. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (holds out hand)
                        Wanna shake my hand now?

          Graydon is a deer in the headlights, when--

                                        LYNE (O.S.)
                        Tom.

          Lyne is at the large open doors to his studio.  More
          disheveled and unshaven than we remember.

                                        LYNE
                        It's alright.  Let them look.  A
                        word Mister Smith, if you wouldn't
                        mind?


  4747INT. LYNE'S STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

          Lyne's assistant, Nora, moves some canvases around near
          the wall.  Prominent among them, an UNFINISHED PAINTING. 
          The shape and sketch of Chloe is unmistakable.

          Lyne walks in front of it, facing off with Johnny, Walt
          and Bruce.

                                        LYNE
                        This is why I need Chloe to come
                        home.  To finish the new
                          collection.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about Julia?  Did you need
                        her, too? 

                                        BRUCE
                        I think she served her purpose. 
                        He didn't need the muse anymore.

                                        LYNE
                        What are you trying to imply?

                        Mr. Lyne.

                        Julia was my life.  And Chloe
                        will always be, even though she's
                        not my flesh and blood.  Ask Nora.

                        Tell them.

                                (beat, uneasy)
                        I remember Julia.  I also remember
                        the day Mr. Lyne found her on the
                        beach.  It was terrible.  He
                          couldn't have hurt her.  Or Chloe.

                                  (accusatory)
                        Chloe's still useful.

                        I love her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You used her.

                                        LYNE
                        I was her teacher.  We had a
                          mutually beneficial relationship --

                        Then why did she run away?

                                (snaps)
                        I don't know.

            A moment.  Lyne gathers himself.  Nora tries to act like
          the help -- invisible. 

                                        LYNE
                        Compassion isn't a crime,

          Lyne exits.

  4848EXT. LYNE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Roscoe regroups with Johnny, Walt and Bruce.  They are
          out in front, near the cars.

                        Nothing out of the ordinary. 
                        Unless you count unfinished
                          sketches of the missing girl in
                        every corner of the place.

                                        BRUCE
                        We must be missing something.

                                        WALT
                                (to Johnny)
                        We're still dead in the water.

          Johnny doesn't want to believe that.  He eyes Graydon on
          the front steps of the house, arguing with a DEPUTY. 

          It gives Johnny an INSTINCT, which he promptly acts on...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Roscoe.  Did Graydon give you
                        back the warrant?

                                        ROSCOE
                        Still got the slime on it.

          Roscoe finds it in his shirt pocket, folded up.  Hands it
          back to Johnny.  The second Johnny touches it...


  4949VISION - NEW ANGLE ON JOHNNY - NIGHT

          NIGHT FALLS and Walt and Roscoe are already gone -- as
          Chloe suddenly rushes past Johnny.  She has her favorite
          SUITCASE in hand...and she heads for Dylan's car out by
          the street.  Dylan, inside, hasn't spotted her.   



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - THREE - 2/1/05 - PINK  44.


    49CONTINUED:49

          It's right before the Act I moment when Chloe left with
          Dylan, but now we have Graydon's perspective -- as he
          appears from the shadows, stopping her. 

                                        GRAYDON
                        Chloe, this is nuts.  Don't do
                        this to him.  To yourself.

          Graydon takes her by the arm -- then touches her. 
          Intimately.

          This guy is all sleaze.  Chloe pushes him away.

                                        CHLOE
                        I'm not the one hurting him. 
                        He's a great man -- and you're
                        destroying him.  

                                        GRAYDON
                        You really fell for it, didn't
                        you.  The Andrew Lyne mystique.

                        People should know his life is
                        controlled by a sleazy --

          Graydon slaps her.  Johnny instinctively wants to help,
          but obviously can't. 

                                        GRAYDON
                        Listen real close.  Mr. Lyne's
                        got his secrets, but you know
                        what?  I control them.  And you're
                        one of those secrets now.  You
                        even think about going public --

                                        CHLOE
                        You can't hurt me any more than
                        you already have.

                                        GRAYDON
                        What about the old man?  You think
                        I could hurt him? 

          Chloe hadn't considered that.  She wriggles herself free.

                                                                      FLASH BACK TO:


  5050OUTSIDE LYNE'S HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny, still holding the warrant, watches Graydon.  Walt
          and Roscoe look on.

                        Walt.  I'll be in touch.

          Johnny walks away, as Bruce follows him.  Off Walt....

                                                                                CUT TO:


    5151EXT/INT. ART GALLERY - BAR HARBOR - NIGHT -(VISION)

          Where Bruce and Johnny met Graydon in Act I.  It's after
          hours.  The place is empty.  Graydon hurries to the front
          door and taps the number code lock as the door buzzes and
          open.  He enters.  

          We're behind him, FOLLOWING HIM.  He rushes to his desk
          and opens a drawer.

          INSIDE: A locked compartment.  He opens it with a key he
          has hidden under a vase.

          He extracts paperwork jammed into a file.  Got what he
          wanted.  But as he rushes out....

          He crosses with Johnny.  But Graydon doesn't acknowledge
          him.

          This has all been a VISION.

                                                                              WHOOSH TO:


  5252EXT. ART GALLERY - AT THE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          Johnny and Bruce outside.  Johnny releases the handle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's worried.  He's gonna show up
                        any second and pull something out
                        of his desk.

                                        BRUCE
                          Something he doesn't want us to
                        find.

          Yep.  Johnny quickly enters the correct code into the
          door lock and it opens.

                                        BRUCE
                        Remind me to bring you along on
                        my next bank heist.

          They slip inside...          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - THREE - 2/1/05 - PINK  46.


  5353INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT - ON LOCKED COMPARTMENT OF
            GRAYDON'S DESK

          as Johnny uses a key hidden under a vase on the desk (he
          watched Graydon use in during the vision).

          Johnny extracts the folder and papers we saw Graydon
            retrieve.  He flips through.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Penobscot County papers.  Birth
                          certificates.  Name change
                        documents.  For Lyne's daughter.

          Johnny seems frozen by something.

                                        BRUCE
                        So come on -- what's Chloe's real
                        name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not Chloe.  Julia.

                                        BRUCE
                        Julia?  The dead one?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not going to believe this. 
                        She wasn't his daughter either.

          As the moment hits them, the front door opens.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT THREE          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - FOUR - 2/1/05 - PINK  47.

          START on the painting of Julia, dead on the beach.  REVEAL
          Johnny, Walt and Bruce are in here.  They toss a look --


          THROUGH A WINDOW

          where Graydon is cuffed.  In a holding room.  Walt has
          the documents Johnny and Bruce found.

                                        WALT
                        I'm not going to ask how you came
                        to have these documents in your
                          possession.

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay.

                                        WALT
                        You better be right, John, or
                        this'll all come back to haunt
                        you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's already haunting me, that's
                        why I have to end it.

                                        WALT
                        Make sure.

          Johnny approaches the Julia painting.  Touches it.  WHOOSH!


  5555EXT. BEACH - DAY - VISION

          NO BRUSHSTROKE EFFECT.

          Johnny, as Lyne, walks onto the beach... but Julia is NOT
          at his feet...  The brown-haired girl walks in front of
          him, just turning around -- but wait, it's Chloe, not
          Julia!  In her white dress!

          Johnny/Lyne SWINGS the rock at Chloe's head!  He hits her
          again!  The murder is interspersed with HARROWING POV as
          we --

                                                                        SMASH BACK TO:          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - FOUR - 2/1/05 - PINK  48.


  5656INT. WALT'S OFFICE - ON JOHNNY

          as he lets go of the painting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's sharper than ever.  We have
                        to find her.

                                        WALT
                        That's one way to guarantee there
                        won't be a murder.

                                        BRUCE
                        If we've got Graydon in custody,
                        then we know he can't be the
                        killer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But he is the man with all the
                          secrets.  Let's find out if he
                        knows any more.


  5757INT. WALT'S OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

          Graydon in a chair -- across from the Julia painting. 
          Walt and Johnny are right beside it.  Roscoe's at the
          door.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Julia and I never met.

                                        WALT
                        But you had this file.  Sealed 
                          information concerning her real
                          identity.  Pretty good insurance
                        against the old man letting you
                        go. 

                                        GRAYDON
                        Lyne isn't letting me go.  His
                        life's gonna have a second act -- 
                        thanks to me.

          Johnny looks up from a piece of paper -- where he's been
            compulsively drawing Chloe again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And the new daughter you created.

                                        GRAYDON
                                (hard)
                        I did what had to be done. 
                                (off their looks)
                        He picked up the brush, didn't
                        he?  All I did was feed the need.
                                        (MORE)

    57CONTINUED:57

                                        GRAYDON (CONT'D)
                        Why do you think he created Julia
                        the first time around?  The crazy
                        old buzzard can't work without
                        his muse.  So I gave him Chloe --
                        and trust me, that girl was a
                        willing participant. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Until you started hitting on her.

          Graydon doesn't respond.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That is the real reason Chloe
                        ran, isn't it?  You were all over
                        her.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Last I checked, making unwanted
                          advances wasn't a crime. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (hard)
                        Where is she? 

                                        GRAYDON
                        I have no idea. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think you do.  You let her run,
                        but you're not gonna let her out
                        of your sight.  She's one of your
                          secrets.  If she gets exposed
                        that's very bad for business.

          Graydon stays mum. 

                                        WALT
                        Last I checked, obstruction of
                        justice was a crime.
                                (to Roscoe)
                        Call Judge Cafferty, tell him I
                        need another search warrant...

          Graydon, feeling cornered, comes to his decision.

                                        GRAYDON
                        Alright... her name is Laura. 
                        Laura Tierney.  She's staying

  5858INT. CHLOE/LAURA'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Johnny, Bruce and Walt at the door.  Walt knocks.  No
          answer.  Traded looks -- Walt checks the door, which is
            unlocked.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Bruce)
                        Did you hear somebody scream?  I
                        swear I just heard somebody scream.

                                        WALT
                        You boys are a menace.

          They ENTER.

          The walls are dotted with sketches and art work.  Johnny
          touches a coat rack.

          WHOOSH -- 


  5959CHLOE (LAURA TIERNEY) APPEARS - VISION

          Chloe's CELL PHONE.  It RINGS.  She steps out from the
          bathroom and looks at the screen.  She recognizes it.

                                        CHLOE
                        Hey.

          Chloe takes a moment.  Emotion overcomes her.

                                        CHLOE
                        No, no, it was good to see your
                          number... I never wanted this,
                        either.  Really?  That's great
                        news.  Of course I'll come back.

          Chloe fights tears.  She rushes out.  For the coat rack. 
          When she reaches it, WHOOSH BACK TO:


  6060JOHNNY AT THE TABLE

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come back... She's going back to
                        him, Walt.
                                  (realizing)
                        She's going back to Lyne.

                                        BRUCE
                        You cannot be serious.

          Johnny hurries out, but when he touches the doorknob--

                                                                              WHOOSH TO:          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - FOUR - 2/1/05 - PINK  51.


  6161INT. LYNE'S STUDIO - DAY - VISION

          Johnny watches as Chloe enters.  As she moves further
          inside, she spots someone.

                                        CHLOE
                        I'm so glad you called.  I came
                        as quick as I could.  

          REVEAL it's Nora, not Lyne, across from Chloe. 

                                        NORA
                        He needs you.

                                        CHLOE
                        How is he feeling?  

                                        NORA
                        Like he wants to make things right.  

                                        CHLOE
                        Maybe we could work a little. 
                        Get his mind off things.

                                        NORA
                        Why don't you put on his favorite
                        dress?

          Nora finds the white dress on the rack.  As Chloe considers
          it, Nora takes off her apron.  Beneath, her usual clothing:
          We see a paint-stained T-shirt and jeans.  Exactly the
          way Johnny saw himself dressed in the vision of Chloe's
          murder.


  6262INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Johnny comes out of his VISION.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was Nora.

                        She called?

                          I thought it was Lyne, but it was
                          Nora....

          Nora walks toward the rocky coast.  Reveal Chloe in front
          of her.  In the white dress.

                        Are you sure he's okay?  On the
                        phone you made it sound like he
                        might hurt himself.

                                        NORA
                        He's been so lost without you. 
                        He needed to take a walk, to clear
                        his head.

                                        CHLOE
                        What you said about Mr. Graydon. 
                        It's true?  He's been fired?

                                        NORA
                        Your leaving put everything in
                          perspective.  You won't have to
                        worry about Tom Graydon.  Ever
                        again.

          Walt's cruiser pulls up.  He and Johnny and Bruce rush
          out.

                        Let's check in here.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait--

          Johnny spots Nora's apron.  Discarded near the door on
          the way out. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is Nora's.

          Johnny touches it.  WHOOSH!


  6666VISION - MATCH & MOVE AROUND THE CANVAS

          As Nora appears, at a canvas, putting her apron on to
          start a day of work.

    66CONTINUED:66

          Johnny is at a canvas, beside Nora, watching in THIRD
          PERSON.  This is her memory.  Lyne enters, a spring in
          his step.

                                        LYNE
                        Did you see that sunrise? 
                          Magnificent!  

                                        NORA
                          Someone's full of energy today.

          Lyne sips coffee. 

                                        LYNE
                        I've been thinking.  Chloe's an
                        art student.  And she knows her
                        way around a studio.  She has an
                          extraordinary eye for color.

          Nora stops priming.

                                        NORA
                        What are you saying? 

                                        LYNE
                        Perhaps it's time for a change. 
                        Time for you to fly on your own. 
                        God knows I've taught you all I
                        can.

                                        NORA
                        But I like it here.  I like being
                        with you.

                                        LYNE
                        It's best for both of us if you
                        go.  You'll be free.  

          Now Nora looks at him, betrayed and hurt.

                                        NORA
                        She's not even family. 

                                        LYNE
                        Nora --

                                        NORA
                        Why do we have to live this lie? 

                                        LYNE
                        It's the truth.  My truth.

                        I tell everyone I'm your assistant. 
                        But it's lie.
                                (then)
                        You're my father.

                        You are my flesh and blood, Nora.

          He touches her face.

                                        LYNE
                        But you know this -- you can never
                        be my muse.  

          Nora is quietly crushed.  Johnny sees this, and WHOOSH! 


  6767BACK OUTSIDE THE STUDIO

          Johnny comes out of it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora... She was his only real
                          daughter...


  6868EXT. BEACH - DAY

          ... Nora, on the rocky coast.  Chloe looks out, now wearing
          that familiar white dress.

                                        CHLOE
                        Are you sure he's on his way back?

                                        NORA
                        He'll be here. 

          Chloe feels good about what's coming.

                                        CHLOE
                        I'm glad you called.  You've always
                        been so good to me, Nora.  In a
                        way, I feel like we're almost
                          ...sisters.

          Chloe smiles, feeling at home.  Nora smiles back.

          As Chloe looks back at the coastline, Nora looks down.

          Nora eyes a ROCK.  Big one.  Perfect for bludgeoning.

          We recognize it as the one Johnny held in his vision.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "STILL LIFE" - FOUR - 2/1/05 - PINK  55.


    68CONTINUED:68

          ... Nora picks up the rock.

          Chloe looks down the beach.  She spots a lone figure. 
          Lyne is approaching.

                                        CHLOE
                        I see him.

                                        NORA
                        Good.  I want him to look at you. 
                        I want him to find you exactly
                        where he found her.

          Chloe stops and turns... 

                                        CHLOE
                        Who?

                                        NORA
                        Julia.

          Nora hits Chloe in the forehead with the rock.  Chloe
          falls to the sand.

          Just then, Johnny, Bruce and Walt rush toward the rocks.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora!

          Nora sees them.  But doesn't care.  She is over a
          dumbstruck Chloe.

                                        NORA
                        He's my father.  And I'm his only
                        muse.

          Nora raises the rock, as...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nora, wait!  You don't want to do
                        this.

          Nora shivers, the cold wind whipping around her.  She
          suddenly seems torn -- confused.

                                        NORA
                        It's not right.  He should be
                        mine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, it's all been a lie.  And
                        you wanted me to see that lie,
                        didn't you, Nora?  That's why you
                        sent me the painting.

          We realize he's right.  She did send him the painting.

                        So you could stop hurting.

          Johnny eases closer, as Nora breaks into tears...

                                        NORA
                        I just wanted him to love me.  To
                        think that I was beautiful.

                        I know.

          Johnny gently takes the rock from her hand as she crumbles
          into his arms.  Walt and Bruce react.  The moment Johnny 
          touches her...

          Johnny lets go of Nora.  By now, Walt has pitched in,

          Johnny goes to a dazed Chloe, a slight trickle of blood
          moving down her face.  For a moment, it reminds him of
          his VISION.

          badly drawn images of two men.  Bruce furrows his brow.

                        He called me today.  Said I could
                        move on if I wanted to.  That
                        he'd help me out with money.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that what you want?

                                        CHLOE
                        There's this art school for kids
                        near my apartment.  I'm gonna
                        teach.  Save up.  Maybe go to
                        France and study the masters.

          She smiles nervously, then...

                                        CHLOE
                        I still can't believe I did what
                        I did.  But it was something...
                        to to see 'the great Andrew Lyne'
                          painting again.  He seemed so...
                          amazing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        On the surface.

          She can't deny that.  She takes a final sip.

                                        CHLOE
                          I should get going.

          She hands him the tea mug, Johnny takes it.  A slight
          WHOOSH.  Chloe starts away...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Laura?

          She turns...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Try Italy.  I think you'll do
                        very well there.

                                        CHLOE
                        Italy?  Ciao!

          She smiles.  And Johnny watches her go.

                                                                      FINAL FADE OUT.
