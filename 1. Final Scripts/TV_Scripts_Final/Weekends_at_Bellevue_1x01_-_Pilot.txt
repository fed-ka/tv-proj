      FADE IN: 


      EXT. NYC PARTY CRUISE - NIGHT

      ELLIE HARLOW (30s, attractive, slight edge) is on the deck of 
      a huge yacht circling New York Harbor, a raucous record 
      release party for a hip hop artist.  It s a warm and breezy 
      evening, a tattooed shoulder peeks out of Ellie s sleeveless 
      top.  Near the DJ booth, Ellie pours champagne from her glass 
      over the railing of the ship.  Her sexy, artsy, hipster 
      friend, VANESSA (early 30s, ethnicity open, lavender streak 
      in her hair) approaches, winded from dancing.

                                    VANESSA
                    Hey.  Why aren t you dancing?  The 
                    DJ is amazing.  And hot.

      Ellie pours some more champagne over the side and watches the 
      liquid drop two stories to the water below.  

                                  ELLIE
                    It s so weird.  The drops hang in 
                    the air for a split second before 
                    they fall.  

                                    VANESSA
                    He keeps making eye contact with me 
                    on the dance floor.  

      Ellie pours the rest of her drink over side.

                                  ELLIE
                    See?  They just hang there.
                          (off her look)
                    You think that happens to people? 

      Ellie intentionally drops the empty champagne glass over the 
      side, watches it fall.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    No.  They probably just fall.  
                          (then)
                    Guess I need another drink. 

      Vanessa can sense Ellie s a little off.

                                    VANESSA
                    Ellie, are you alright?                          Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 2


                                  ELLIE
                          (smiles)
                    More than alright.

      Ellie looks out to the twinkling lights of the New York 
      skyline.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    Look at the lights, the city... 
                    it s a perfect Friday night.

      Ellie throws a look to the DJ, smiles.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    You should go talk to the hot DJ.  

                                    VANESSA
                    Are you sure?

                                  ELLIE
                    Seize the moment, Vanessa.  This is 
                    why we live in New York.

                                    VANESSA
                          (after a beat)
                    You re right.

      Ellie smiles as Vanessa moves off.  But once Vanessa is gone, 
      Ellie s expression changes, turns serious.  Ellie STEPS UP on 
      to the railing and balances precariously.  The wind whips her 
      hair as she takes a long look at the lights of the city.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


      INT. CAR - NIGHT

      A clean-cut MAN in his 30s in a corporate suit and tie is 
      determined as he zooms his car down a highway.  He passes a 
        graffiti-covered semi and zooms into the mouth of the HOLLAND 
      TUNNEL.  A sign reads:  WELCOME TO NEW YORK. 


      EXT. NYC PARTY CRUISE - NIGHT

      Ellie takes a last look out at the city, takes a breath and 
      then DIVES off the ship, INTO THE BLACK WATER BELOW!


      EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

      The Man walks down a bustling street with a briefcase and 
      confidently heads into an office building with a sign:  
      CAPITAL PARTNERS.                          Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 3


      INT. VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

      The Man opens his briefcase in the Conference Room of a big, 
      corporate office.  He takes out a sheaf of papers and walks 
      over to a huge WHITE BOARD covering one wall.  Meticulously, 
      he begins to transcribe a set of numbers from the paper he s 
      holding with a dry-erase marker.


      EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

      Ellie is submerged under the dark, cold water of the East 
      River, a half-mile away from shore.  She opens her eyes in 
      the blackness, looks up to the surface, sees the flicker of a 
      an oncoming headlight accompanied by a LOUD, OMINOUS HUM.


      INT. VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM - NIGHT

      The white board is filling up with orderly NUMERICAL 
      STATEMENTS as the Man transcribes more of his document onto 
      the board.  A CORPORATE SECURITY GUARD appears at the door.  
      The Man takes a sip of coffee from a communal kitchen mug.

                                  GUARD
                    Sir, we re locking up.  

                                  MAN
                    Go ahead, I m good here.

                                  GUARD
                    Do you have a keycard?

      The Man doesn t answer.

                                  GUARD (CONT D)
                    Because I can t let you stay after 
                    hours without a keycard.

                                  MAN
                    I ve got clearance.

                                  GUARD
                    From who?  What department?
                          (no response)
                    Sir?

      The GUARD steps into the room and for the first time, he and 
      we SEE that the Man s calculations have COVERED every inch of 
      the white board, as well as the SURROUNDING walls.  Off this 
      chilling tableau--                         Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 4


      EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

      Ellie surfaces to see a huge BARGE coming right towards her.  
      She floats passively, RIGHT IN ITS PATH.  As the massive 
      barge BEARS DOWN on her we--

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      EXT./INT. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL ER - DAY

      It s morning as the Man is unloaded from a police car by two 
      cops, BREEN and SOUTHERLAND, outside Bellevue Hospital s ER.  
      The man is agitated, hands cuffed behind his back.  

                                  MAN
                    It s all the zeros and the ones and 
                    the zeros.

                  MAN (CONT D)BREEN
      Technological singularity is Hang in there sir, we are 
      upon us.  Evolution has been  here.*almost
      leading us to this.*

      We can exist forever with the Just a little detour and then 
      zeros and the ones and the you ll be able to go beddie-
      zero zero ones.bye.

      As they burst through the double doors, we EXPERIENCE the 
      bustle of the ER from the POV of a man in the midst of a 
      psychotic episode:  colors are brighter, sounds are 
        exaggerated.  It s a woozy, distorted view of the blood and 
      chaos in the ER.  ER nurse DAHLIA takes one look and can 
      immediately tell it s a psych case.  She points down the 
      hall.

                                  DAHLIA
                    Psych ER is that way.

      They round a corner, go through a set of doors into--

      ER nurse CHUCK FRANKLIN (40s, African American) steps up. 
      Tall and hulking, he s been at Bellevue for 18 years, nothing 
      phases him.                           Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 5

      Chuck also happens to be a Sci-Fi buff.  He calls out to 
      triage, where a woman does paperwork with her back to them.

                    the zeros and the ones.

      Doctor BEN JACOBS (mid 30s, Ivy-League) approaches.  He s 
      harried, unshaven, having been on call overnight.  

                                  BEN
                    Sorry, Chuck, hung up with our OCD

      The woman turns around-- It s Ellie!  Funkily dressed but 
      professional.  Ben looks shocked to see her.  

                                  BEN
                    Ellie?

      Ellie gives him a quick smile and then heads to the patient.

      FADE IN:


      INT. PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

      Ben is on the move, tailing Doctor DIANE WALLACE (40s), the 
      Department Head of Psychiatry,  through the halls of the 
      psych ward.  Warm, outgoing and wearing a prairie skirt from 
      1995, Diane s obviously not a native New Yorker.  Ben is a 
      junior attending, rumpled but nerdy-cute in his slept-in 
      shirt and tie.  

                                  BEN
                    You weren t even going to tell me?  

                                  DIANE
                    Tell you what?

                                  BEN
                    Ellie and I trained at Columbia 
                    together.  

                                  DIANE
                    Coffee.  I need coffee.

      Ben follows Diane into--


      INT. PSYCHIATRIC ED - BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Ben follows Diane into a grimy break room with a wall of 
      lockers and a ten-year-old Mr. Coffee maker.  Diane chooses 
      from a mismatched cluster of mugs, pours two cups.

                                  BEN
                    You could have asked me about her.

      Next to the coffee maker is an old copy of the New York Post.

                                  DIANE
                    Three weeks, three days.

                                  BEN
                    What?

                                  DIANE
                    For three weeks and three days, 
                    this copy of the Post has been 
                    sitting on this table.                         Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 8


                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    I threw it into the recycling bin 
                    and somebody actually fished it 
                    back out.  Now I m just fascinated 
                    to see how long it lasts in here.

                                  BEN
                    Diane-- Why didn t anyone ask me 
                    about her?

      Diane hands a mug to Ben.

                                  DIANE
                    Because junior faculty aren t 
                    consulted for new hires, that s 
                    why.
                          (off his look)
                    She comes out of an excellent 
                      residency, she knows New York, 
                    knows the patient population.  

                                  BEN
                    Okay, forget about me, did you talk 
                    to anyone at Columbia?  

                                  DIANE
                    No, Ben, I hired her because I 
                    liked her boots.  
                          (off his look)
                    I know things got messy at Columbia 
                    but life is messy, that shouldn t 
                    be news to you.  I had three 
                    meetings with Ellie, I talked to 
                    all her advisors.  She was hired 
                    because I want her here.  I think 
                    she ll fit right in.
                          (then)

      INT. PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT - FISHBOWL - DAY

      The FISHBOWL is a glass enclosure that allows the staff to 
      keep an eye on the patients and vice versa.  The staff avoids 
      eye contact with the patients, trying to pretend they re not 
      being watched.  Ellie, Chuck and others are gathered for the 
      MORNING REPORT, a daily meeting where psychiatrists, nurses 
      and social workers discuss the new admissions and strategize 
      a plan for the day.                          Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 9

                    Morning everyone.  Somebody tell me 
                    about the overnight admissions.

                                  BEN
                    We got a self-inflicted stab wound, 
                    a guy with a bullhorn and a 
                    loincloth in Washington Square 
                    Fountain, our favorite member of 
                    the royal family swallowed another 
                    pen and Mister Jennings bounced 
                    back after feeding his meds to 
                    pigeons in Central Park. 

                                  ELLIE
                    With the help of medication, the 
                    pigeons have made some serious 
                      breakthroughs.

      Diane and others are amused-- Ben, not so much.  The Manic 
      Man from the Teaser bangs on the glass of the Fishbowl in a 
      desperate attempt to get their attention.

                    It s weird he said that, right?  Is 
                    he implying that he should know 
                      everything about me or that this 
                    hospital somehow sucks?

                    That one s mine.  Came in this 
                    morning with the police, no ID, 
                    claims to have figured out how to 
                    turn our bodies into pure electron

                    Interns-- what s the differential?  

      A fresh-faced psychiatry intern, CLAIRE COHEN (25) shoots her 
      hand up.  She s upbeat and outgoing, obsessed with the 
      psychodynamic approach to psychiatry.  She s read a ton on 
      the subject and wants everyone to know.  Her fellow intern 
      MANEESH SARMA (26, Indian, dryly understated) rolls his eyes.

                                  CLAIRE
                    According to Winnecott s theory, 
                    mania is a desperate defense of the 
                    ego against despair.

                                  BEN
                    That s not what she asked.
                          (then)
                    What are the DSM criteria for a 
                    diagnosis of mania?

      Maneesh opens his mouth to answer but Claire jumps in before 
      he gets a word out.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Pressured speech, delusions of 
                    grandeur, flight of ideas...

                    Don t tell me you are still making 
                    the interns memorize The DSM?

                                  BEN
                    It s the basis for a common 
                    language they need to learn.  You 
                    disagree?

                    Fine.  Learn the DSM but then 
                    unlearn it.  It s limiting.   
                    Designed by committee.  And totally 
                      unnecessary.

                    Headdress equals mania until proven

      INT. MEDICAL ER - DAY

      Ellie and her interns, Claire and Maneesh, move through the 
      huge medical ER adjacent to the psych ED.  Bloody patients 
      are wheeled by on gurneys, trauma teams run past, it s all 
      part of the chaotic, gory landscape of a busy ER.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    I love working weekends.

                    Less competition for cases, more 
                      opportunity to learn.

      Ellie is annoyed by Claire s upbeat manner and her perfect 
      hair held back with a preppy headband.

                                  ELLIE
                    Fewer residents, no teaching 
                      conferences, easier to get real 
                    work done.

                                  CLAIRE
                    If you hate teaching, why are you 
                    working at a teaching hospital?

      Ellie pauses for a beat as a bloody patient on a gurney

                    But mental illness is everywhere, 
                    in every specialty.  When you re a

      This is Doctor JARED KNOX.  Knox is 32, scruffy and sexy, the 
      kind of ER doc who works like a dog eight months a year so he 
      can spend the other four surfing in Fiji and skiing in Vail.

                                  CLAIRE
                    He calls psych for any patient who 
                    wants to talk for more than thirty 
                    seconds.

                                  ELLIE
                    Doctor Knox?

      He looks up, flashes a friendly, seductive smile.  Ellie 
      notes his huge eyes, puka shell necklace.  Dangerously hot.  

                                  KNOX

      consults.

                    he started throwing free weights at 
                    an invisible threat.

                                  KNOX
                    Negative for drugs and alcohol.
                    But there s a family history of 
                      schizophrenia.

                                  ELLIE
                    He s the perfect age for a first

                    Shhh!  They re everywhere!  You re 
                    part of it.  THEY CAN HEAR YOU!

      Ellie knows Claire s approach won t work.  She leans in, 
      whispers, playing along.

                                  ELLIE
                    Who s everywhere?  Who are they?

                                  DAVID
                    Find another Joe, another Tom, 
                    another Dan.  I m not a jobber, I m 
                    not going back.

                                  ELLIE
                    You don t have to.  I m here to 
                    make sure of that.

      David puts the pillow over his own head.  

                                  DAVID

      INT. ICU - DAY

      Ben is talking to LUCINDA WEBB (50s.)  Lucinda is sweet, 
      maternal, putting lipstick on in a compact as Ben talks.

                                  BEN
                    Ms. Webb, I m not convinced you 
                      understand the risks of your

                    I need your full attention.  
                    Please.

      Ellie appears at the doorway.

      He was going to suggest that she leave, but Ellie pulls up a 
      chair, sits, before he finishes his sentence.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    -- pull up a chair.

                                  ELLIE
                    Ms. Webb, I m Ellie Harlow, I work 
                    with Doctor Jacobs.  I ve been 
                    reading your chart and I m 
                    wondering why you are refusing 
                    surgery.  

                                    LUCINDA
                    Not refusing, just postponing.

                    it. 

      Ellie puts Lucinda s chart down, leans back in her chair.

                    Well, I m not leaving until you do.

                    My daughter Maggie s wedding is in

                    I m sure Maggie wouldn t mind

                    That would require telling her.  
                    And once I do that... everything

                    helpful to people in times like 
                    this.  But maybe the two of us,

      Lucinda forces a tight smile.

                    Are you making fun of me?

      INT. BELLEVUE INPATIENT PSYCH WARD - COMMUNITY ROOM - LATER

      Ellie stands in the hallway, looking into the Community Room, 
      an open, central room where psych patients are able to talk, 
      mingle, watch movies, etc.  Diane sits in a circle of chairs 
      with 8 other inpatients conducting a  goals  meeting-- a type 
      of small group therapy where patients lay out their plan for 
      the day.  LOUISE, a disheveled and childlike woman in her 
      40s, is speaking.

                                  LOUISE
                    Today, I m going to eat three 
                    square meals because you are what 
                    you eat.

      VICTOR (30s), severe and sharp-tongued with a shaved head and 
      chiseled features, is sitting next to Louise.

                                  VICTOR

                    Oh, I m supportive, Doctor D.  I 
                    don t want Louise turning into 
                    whatever the hell that was they 
                    served us for lunch.

      The other patients laugh.  Diane turns to STEVEN, a sad, 
      quivering dock worker in his 30s sitting on the other side of 
      Victor.  There s a cast on his leg.

                                  DIANE
                    Steven, let s hear from you.  What 
                    are your goals for the day?

      Steven mumbles something inaudibly.

                    Steven?

                    Oh, man, here we go again.  She s 
                    leaving, you idiot.  She s done.

      Ellie is listening intently from the doorway.  Something 
      changes on her face, she suddenly seems miles away.


      EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

      It's a continuation of Ellie s night in the East River the 
      night before.  Ellie lies motionless as the GIANT BARGE 
      passes by her, mere inches away.  It s a chilling, scary 
      tableau.  Over this, we hear a female voice.

                    Join us... come join us.

      The voice is garbled, dreamlike.  As if it s emanating from 
      the watery depths. 


      INT. BELLEVUE INPATIENT PSYCH WARD - BACK TO PRESENT

      The voice belongs to Diane, who s standing in front of Ellie 
      at the door.  Ellie snaps back into the moment.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 21

                    We belong together.  If she goes, I

                    No.  She ll move on--

                    on because that s what people do.

                    No.  But I do know this:  you can t

                    It doesn t work.

      FADE IN:


      EXT. UNDERWATER - FLASHBACK

      In what appears to be a further continuation of the prior 
      night in the East River, we see Ellie submerged in cold, blue 
      water.  We are in Ellie s POV as she looks up, the light on 
      the surface collapsing to a pinpoint, then disappearing all 
      together.  


      EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - PATROL BOAT - DAY - 2002

      22-year-old unconscious Ellie is abruptly YANKED from the 
      water and PULLED up on to the deck of a coast guard boat.  We 
      realize we are not seeing NY Harbor the night before-- It s 
      daytime, six years ago, Lake Michigan.  The Mackinac Bridge 
      is visible in the background.  The wind whips the jacket of 
      the weathered COAST GUARD who pulls her out.  He checks her 
      vitals, then turns to his partner.  

                                  COAST GUARD
                    She s breathing.  Call it in.

      The coast guard throws a thermal blanket on her as his 
      partner radios:

      MATCH CUT to Ellie as she watches Nurse Chuck meticulously 
      count pennies on the admit desk.  The contents of a newly 
      admitted patient s shopping cart are arranged around him:  a 
      mannequin head, a pile of change, a croquet mallet.

                                  CHUCK
                    Thirty three, thirty four...

      Chuck slides a giant pile of pennies into a plastic bag.

                    Just trying to make a strong first 
                      impression.  What are you doing?

                    Four dollars and thirty seven 
                    cents.  We document and store every 
                    item the patients bring in with 
                    them.

      Ellie notices the shopping cart in front of the desk.

                                  ELLIE
                    And where are we going to keep the 
                    shopping cart?

                                  CHUCK
                    The real question is...

      He picks up a plastic animal crate from the cart and turns it 
      so Ellie can see something is ALIVE inside.  Ellie jumps 
      back.

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    What are we supposed to do with a

                      floundering over there.

      Ellie looks over to see Maneesh trying to talk to the Manic 
      Man from the teaser.  The Man is gesticulating wildly, 
      pacing, speaking a mile-a-minute, clearly running the show.

      Ellie steps up.  She has an affinity for these types of 
      patients.

                                  ELLIE

                    the unequivocal support.  It 
                    doesn t do anyone any good.

                                  DIANE
                    Oh, and provoking a psych patient 
                    into a violent outburst is 
                      effective? 

                                  ELLIE
                    Give me the guys hearing voices or 
                    barking like a dog, I can help 
                    them.  But let someone else talk to 
                    them about their childhood.  That s 
                    why I chose Bellevue instead of 
                    some cushy private practice--

      They cross the street and head into...


      INT. KJ S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER

      The cafe is crowded, bustling.  Diane is a regular, knows all 
      the people working behind the counter.  

                                  DIANE
                    Therapy is part of your job.  You 
                    don t want to be here, let me know 
                    now before I waste any more time.

      Ellie can sense Diane is serious.

                                  ELLIE
                    Diane.  I want to be here.  I...  
                    I ll be more careful.

                                  DIANE
                    Good.  Because the first rule of ER 
                    psych is don t die.

      They walk up to the counter where JUDGE BERNARD CHAVEZ (45, 
      Hispanic, hipster glasses) orders a coffee from a gregarious 
      35-year-old Italian named NICO behind the counter.  

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Double latte, low foam.

                                  NICO
                    You got it, Judge. 

      Ellie clocks the Judge.  Chavez nods to Diane as he heads 
      over near the condiment counter to wait for his drink.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 30


                                  CHAVEZ
                    Diane.

                                  DIANE
                    Bernard.

      Nico hands Diane a cup of black coffee.

                                  NICO
                    Here you go, Doctor D.  The usual.

                                  DIANE
                    Thanks, Nico. 
                          (turns to Ellie)
                    Anything for--

      Ellie is gone, having followed Judge Chavez over to the 
      condiment counter.  Diane leaves two dollars on the counter 
      and watches Ellie from a distance for a moment.  Ellie is 
      animated, on her game.  Diane joins them, mid conversation.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    She understands the risk of 
                    delaying surgery?

                                  ELLIE
                    Yes, in a way, but--

                                  CHAVEZ
                    But nothing.  She s competent.  

      Nico holds up a cup behind the counter, his coffee is ready.

                                  NICO
                    Judge Chavez!

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Excuse me.

      Chavez starts to claim his coffee, Ellie steps into his path.

                                  ELLIE
                    No, no, no, here s the thing.  

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Excuse me.  You re standing between 
                    me and my latte.

      Ellie doesn t budge.

                                  ELLIE
                    The aneurism could, theoretically, 
                    be impairing perfusion of her 
                    frontal lobe.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 31


                                  CHAVEZ
                    In English, please.

                                  ELLIE
                    The frontal lobe controls 
                      personality.  Which means her 
                      willingness to take risks might be 
                    falsely elevated by the aneurism 
                    itself.  It s like asking a patient 
                    to make a life or death decision 
                    when they re drunk.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    You re saying she s acting drunk?

                                  ELLIE
                    No.  I m saying there s no way 
                    anyone in their right mind would 
                    refuse to reschedule a stupid 
                    wedding for something like this.  
                    I m saying we d all be committing 
                      malpractice if we didn t at least 
                    explore the possibility that--

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Tomorrow morning.  9 AM sharp.

      Chavez moves off.  Diane smiles to herself as she squeezes 
      honey into her coffee.  This is exactly why she hired Ellie.

                                  DIANE
                      Convincing the judge to hold a 
                      competency hearing on a Sunday is 
                    no small feat.  

      Diane licks her stirrer and chucks it into the trash as she 
      starts for the door.  Ellie follows.  On the move:

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Question for you.  Have you ever 
                    tried ecstasy?

                                  ELLIE
                    Tablet or powder?

      Diane smiles, the answer implied.  

                                  DIANE
                    Then I ll assume you know all about 
                    its therapeutic potential for 
                    patients with PTSD.  Of course, the 
                      establishment will never fund 
                    studies using MDMA so we have to be 
                    creative.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 32


                                  ELLIE
                    We?

      Diane and Ellie exit the cafe, emerge on to--


      EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

      They continue walking down the street.

                                  DIANE
                    When you interviewed here you said 
                    you were interested in research.  I 
                    need a partner on this project.  
                    It s part of why I wanted you here.

                                  ELLIE
                    Sounds like professional napalm.

                                  DIANE
                    Clearly you re not afraid of 
                    rustling a few feathers.  And I 
                    need a partner who s brave enough 
                    to take a chance.

                    Why?

                                  DIANE
                    There will be a myriad of potential 
                    donors, policy makers there who can 
                    get us funding, push legislation... 
                    We can help a lot of people with no 
                    other options.

      Ellie s PAGER goes off.  

                                  ELLIE
                    911 from the ER.  I have to go.  

                                  DIANE
                          (as she goes)
                    See you at NYPS.  7 pm.  Cocktail 
                    attire.  It ll be fun.

      Ellie hurries off.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 33


      INT. MEDICAL ER - DAY

      Claire and Maneesh help Knox take care of David Bellinger, 
      the hallucinating boy, who is SEIZING violently.  ALARMS 
      BLARE, it s a full-on ER trauma scene.  Maneesh is on a 
      nearby phone.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Sats down to 89!

                          (hangs up)
                    Scanner will be ready in five.

      Ellie steps up, alarmed.

                                  ELLIE
                    What happened?

                                  CLAIRE
                    We paged you three times.

                                  ELLIE
                    What the hell is going on?

                                    MANEESH
                    Nurse just found him seizing.

                                  ELLIE
                    What was the sodium?

                                    MANEESH
                    We never got it.

      The seizing stops.

                                  KNOX
                    Alright, atta boy.

                                  ELLIE
                    What do you mean, you never got it?

                                    MANEESH
                    Knox cancelled the order, said it 
                    was overkill.  

                                  ELLIE
                    And you let him?                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 34


                                  CLAIRE
                    What were we supposed to do?  He s 
                    the attending.  

                                  ELLIE
                          (re: David)
                    He s your patient.  He is who 
                    matters.

      Ellie walks over to Knox who is charting at the bedside.  She 
      grabs the chart out of his hands to get his attention.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    Why the hell did you cancel the 
                    labs I ordered?

                                  KNOX
                    It s the standard psych move-- you 
                    guys order a bunch of unnecessary 
                      diagnostic tests and refuse to take 
                    the patient until the results are 
                    back and the patient is  medically 
                    cleared.   

                                  ELLIE
                    I wasn t trying to block the 
                      admission.  The kid was talking 
                    about being  a jobber -- it s a 
                    wrestling term.  It got me thinking 
                    that maybe he d been dieting and 
                      over-exercising which led to his 
                      electrolytes being seriously out of 
                    whack.

                                  KNOX
                      Reasonable theory.

                                  ELLIE
                    Which is why I ordered the sodium!

      Knox smiles, flirtatious.

                                  KNOX
                    You know, I like you.

                                  ELLIE
                    SHUT UP!

      Maneesh wheels David s gurney toward them.

                                    MANEESH
                    CTs ready for him.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 35


      Ellie takes the gurney over from Maneesh and starts to roll 
      down the hall, passing Knox as she goes.

                                  ELLIE
                    I know your type.  The ER shifts 
                    fund the surfing in Fiji and the 
                    rafting and the heli-skiing but you 
                    don t care about the work.  
                          (off his look)
                    If you ever cancel a lab on one my 
                    patients again I will report you to 
                    the Chief of Staff and strangle you 
                    with that ridiculous puka shell 
                    necklace, got it?

      Claire and Maneesh look on, impressed.  She turns to Claire 
      and Maneesh.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    Let s go. 

      We STAY WITH Ellie as she wheels the gurney down the hall.

      INT. SWANKY HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

      The New York Psychiatric Society cocktail party is in full 
      swing.  Ben is there, looking good in an expensive suit.  He 
      works on a whiskey at the bar alongside a distinguished 
      couple in their 60 s, HENRY and GENEVIEVE, who sip Cabernet.  

                                  BEN
                    She just got here and already she s 
                    managed to alienate half the staff.

                                  HENRY
                    Are you in the alienated half or 
                    the unalienated half?

                                  BEN
                    I heard she completely lost it in 
                    the small group session today.

                                  GENEVIEVE
                    But you weren t actually there.

                                  BEN
                    No.  But it s clear Ellie Harlow s 
                    got impulse control issues.  

                                  HENRY
                    You ve mentioned her name five 
                    times and you haven t even finished 
                    one drink.

                                  BEN
                    Stop.

                                  GENEVIEVE
                    Sorry, honey.  I can smell 
                      sublimated attraction from across a 
                    room and you re standing right next 
                    to me.

                                  BEN
                    I m NOT--
                          (stops himself)
                    God, I hate seeing you two at these 
                    things.  Have you thought about 
                    retiring?

      He downs the rest of his drink and turns to put his glass on 
      the bar.  As he does, he sees--                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 37


      ELLIE.  Dressed up in a clingy, vintage-y black cocktail 
      dress.  Beautiful and sexy without trying too hard.  She sees 
      Ben and smiles, beelines in his direction, to the delight of 
      Henry and Genevieve.

                                  GENEVIEVE
                    Ah.  I wonder who this could be.

                                  BEN

                                  ELLIE
                    Ben, hi, guess what?  Judge Chavez 
                    agreed to a hearing on Lucinda Webb 
                    tomorrow.

                                  BEN
                    You re kidding.  On a Sunday?

                    Yup.

                                  ELLIE
                      Impressed?  Grateful?  Sorry you 
                    ever doubted me?

      Ellie senses Henry and Genevieve watching.

                    Ellie, meet Henry and Genevieve

      The conversation is interrupted when Diane approaches.  

                                  DIANE
                    Hello, everyone, have you tried the 
                    sliders?  Amazing.  Vegetarian for 
                    15 years and then I up and ate a 
                    burger.  What do you think that s

                    You obviously haven t met my

                    Can I borrow Ellie a minute?  Thank

      INT. SWANKY HOTEL BALLROOM - BAR - CONTINUOUS

      We STAY WITH Diane and Ellie as they move off to another part 
      of the bar.  

                                  ELLIE
                    So where s the ecstacy crowd I m 
                    supposed to schmooze with?

                                  DIANE
                    Let s get a drink first.
                          (to a bartender)
                    Two tequilas please.  No ice.
                          (to Ellie)

                                  DIANE (CONT'D)
                    I m a believer in the power of 
                      substances to make people more 
                    receptive to certain types of 
                    personal work.  Sometimes it s 
                    prozac, sometimes it s ecstacy...

      The bartender pours, Diane hands one to Ellie.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Sometimes it s Blue Agave.  Cheers.

      Diane knocks back her shot.  Ellie doesn t know where Diane 
      is going with this but downs her drink too.  Diane smiles, a 
      little tipsy.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    So tell me.  What makes someone 
                    turn down a schizophrenia 
                      fellowship at Harvard to spend 
                    weekends in a stinky psych ER?

                                  ELLIE
                    How did you... I didn t tell anyone 
                    about the fellowship.

                                  DIANE
                    We only get to hire new faculty 
                    every few years so I did my 
                    homework.  And I chose you.  But 
                    the real question is... why did you 
                    choose us?  

                                  ELLIE
                    Like I said this morning, Bellevue 
                    is hardcore--

                                  DIANE
                    And what is it about you that needs 
                    things to be hard?

                                  ELLIE
                    I didn t say hard, I said--

                                  DIANE
                    Maybe the patients here make you 
                    feel sane in comparison.  Maybe you 
                    have a hero complex.  Maybe you 
                    like puzzles that can break your 
                    nose.  

                                  ELLIE
                    What, exactly, is your point?                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 40


                                  DIANE
                    Every patient interaction is a 
                    window into yourself and you might 
                    not always like what you see.  
                    Embrace that.  Use it to make 
                    yourself better.  

      Diane rummages through her purse, pulls out a pen.

                                  ELLIE
                    Look, I m--  

      Diane writes something down on a cocktail napkin.

                                  DIANE
                    You terminated your relationship 
                    with three different therapists 
                    during your time at Columbia.

                                  ELLIE
                    I told you, talk therapy isn t my 
                    thing.

                                  DIANE
                    I can see that you are attracted to 
                    conflict.  And that can be a great 
                    thing.  It can make you an amazing 
                      psychiatrist.  But you have to 
                    manage it.  You re like Luke 
                    Skywalker in Empire Strikes Back.  
                    Powerful but out of control.  

                                  ELLIE
                    How many tequilas have you had?

                                  DIANE
                    I can help you but I can t do it 
                    alone.

      Diane hands her the napkin.  Ellie looks-- it s a name, Cate 
      Drayton, MD, and a phone number.

                                  DIANE (CONT D)
                    Cate Drayton.  I think she d be a 
                    good fit for you. 

                                  ELLIE
                    What?

                                  DIANE
                    We all have our hotspots, Ellie,  
                    and believe me, your patients will 
                    find them.

                                  DIANE (CONT'D)
                    Get there first and do the work, 
                    or, I assure you, you will drown 
                    here.

      Ellie takes the napkin with a tense, disingenuous smile.

                                  ELLIE
                          (with an edge)
                    Thanks, Diane.  Appreciate it.  

      Miffed, Ellie moves off.  We STAY WITH her as she looks at 
      the napkin again before chucking it into the trash and 
      heading for the door.  Ben watches her go, realizing he s a 
      little too aware of her position in the room.  He shoots a 
      look to his parents.  Dammit, they were right.


      EXT. SWANKY HOTEL - NIGHT

      Ben comes outside to find Ellie sitting on a bench by a 
      fountain.

                                  BEN
                      Everything alright?  

                                  ELLIE
                    Yeah.

                    You look upset.

                                  ELLIE
                    Thank you, Doctor Jacobs.  Between 
                    you and Diane I ll be cured in a 
                    week.

                                  BEN
                    Cured?

                                  ELLIE
                    She went at me pretty hard.  Seems 
                    to think I m some kind of ticking 
                    time bomb.

                                  BEN
                    Are you?

                                  ELLIE
                    Am I what?

                                  BEN
                    Ellie, can I be totally, completely 
                    honest here?  You at Bellevue... it 
                    worries me.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 42


                                  ELLIE
                    Why?

                                  BEN
                    You know why.

                                  ELLIE
                    Is this about Columbia?  Ivan?
                          (off his look)
                    We had a thing, it didn t work out.  

                                  BEN
                    Ellie, you seduced the department 
                    head.  The married department head.  

                                  ELLIE
                    I seduced him?  Like he was just 
                    some helpless bystander?

      Now that Ben has unlocked this door, there s no turning back.  

                                  BEN
                    And when he finally left his wife 
                    and became available to you for 
                    real, you broke it off.

      Ellie s anger percolates to the surface.

                                  ELLIE
                    I never asked him to do that.

                                  BEN
                    Do you have any idea how 
                      destructive all that was?  How 
                    reckless?  For all of us?

                                  ELLIE
                    All of who?

                    The whole residency, Ellie.  Ivan 
                    was a mentor.  A friend.  Six 
                    months after you arrive he s 
                      hospitalized for an overdose.

                                  ELLIE
                    It was an accident.

                                  BEN
                    What, you destroying the guy?

                      A psychiatrist does not 
                      accidentally overdose.

                                  ELLIE
                    What do you want me to say?

                                  BEN
                    That you re different now.  That 
                    you ll be careful.  That you ve 
                    grown up.

                    What about you, Ben? !Are you 
                    different now? !The whole time we 
                    were at Columbia you were just 
                    running to get somewhere else. 
                    Somewhere better. !Did you make it 
                    there? !Or are you just pissed that 
                    all that work, that all that... 
                    "being careful ,!didn't get you any 
                    further than the slut who almost 
                    killed your poor, completely 
                    innocent mentor.

      She starts back inside.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    Now excuse me, I need to go back in 
                    and hustle up some drug money.

      We PUSH IN on Ellie s face as she walks into the night, 
      turbulent, lost in thought--


      INT. AMBULANCE - LAKE MICHIGAN ROAD - DAY - 2002

      Ellie opens her eyes to find herself in the back of a moving 
      ambulance.  She takes in her surroundings, sees a PARAMEDIC 
      riding alongside her.

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    Hey there.  You re awake.  

      Ellie tries to sit up but strains against the surgical tape 
      holding her head to the gurney.

                                  ELLIE
                    I don t need a hospital.

                                  PARAMEDIC
                    Sit tight, Ma am.  We ll be there 
                    soon.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 44


      In the front seat, the DRIVER is listening to a baseball game 
      on the radio.  He calls back to the Paramedic.

                                  DRIVER (V.O.)
                    Tigers lost, six-three.

      The Paramedic scoots up towards the front so he can talk to 
      the driver through the partition.

                                  PARAMEDIC     
                    You owe me ten bucks, man.

      Ellie peels off the surgical tape holding her head and sits 
      up.  She glances over her shoulder at the Paramedic who s 
      still wrapped up in sports talk with the Driver.

                                  PARAMEDIC (CONT D)
                    When the hell are they going to 
                    dump Randy Smith?

      As the rig slows for a red light, Ellie sees an opportunity.  

                                  PARAMEDIC (CONT D)
                    59 games?  I mean, come on!

      She rips the wires out of the monitor and in a fluid move, 
      THROWS OPEN the back door of the ambulance and LEAPS OUT, 
      SMASHING the side of her head into the asphalt as she lands.  


      INT. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL - ICU - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT

      Ellie, a fitted coat over her cocktail dress, walks briskly 
      through the ICU.  Ellie seems a bit adrift as she stops at 
      Lucinda Webb s room.  Lucinda is awake, a notebook in hand.

                                  ELLIE
                    Hey there.  You re awake.

                                    LUCINDA
                    Yeah.  A million things to do the 
                    week before a wedding.  Don t you 
                    ever go home?

                                  ELLIE
                    I came back to give you one last 
                    chance to change your mind.

                                    LUCINDA
                    Doctor.  I thought I was clear.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 45


                                  ELLIE
                    Ms. Webb, tomorrow morning I am 
                    going to go before a judge and 
                    argue that you are incompetent to 
                    make this decision for yourself.

                                    LUCINDA
                    You can do that?

                                  ELLIE
                    I m going to say that your aneurism 
                    is affecting your judgement.  And 
                    since this is impossible to 
                    actually prove or disprove, there 
                    is a very good chance the judge is 
                    going to agree with me and force 
                    you to have the surgery.

                                    LUCINDA
                    What?  Why?

                                  ELLIE
                    Because your daughter s wedding is 
                    not worth dying for.  She wouldn t 
                    want you to take this chance.

                                    LUCINDA
                    You don t understand.

                                  ELLIE
                    That s where you re wrong.  I do. 
                    I do understand.  You die, a part 
                    of her dies too.

      In one swift move, Lucinda YANKS her IV out of her arm, 
      causing blood to leak out onto the floor.  

                                    LUCINDA
                    I m leaving.

                                  ELLIE
                    No, you re not.  I ve placed you on 
                    a hold until after the hearing.  

      Lucinda sees a security guard at the door, starts crying.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    This seems extreme because it is.  
                    But that s how important I think--                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 46

                      psychiatrist when you have no 
                    sympathy, no understanding of other 
                    people?

      EXT. HOSPITAL STREET - NIGHT

      Visibly shaken, Ellie heads out into the NY night, just as 
      Doctor Jared Knox is heading back to the ER with a coffee.  

                                  KNOX
                    I was hoping I d run into you.  
                    About earlier--

      Ellie avoids eye contact, tries to hurry past him.

                                  ELLIE
                    It s fine.  Forget it.

                                  KNOX
                    Seizing kid turned out to be 
                      hyponatremic.  I m sorry.  You were

      Ellie stops, emotional.

                                  ELLIE
                    Maybe being right isn t enough.

      INT. PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT - FISHBOWL - DAY

      It s Sunday morning in the Fishbowl.  Ellie is in charge, 
      running through cases with Claire as Chuck feeds chunks of a 
      day old donut to the squirrel in it s cage.  As she talks, 
      Ellie cleans up coffee cups, candy bar wrappers and other 
      detritus from the night shift.

                                  ELLIE
                    It s like after midnight, the

                    Freudian theory says obsessions are 
                    sexual urges that the mind can only

                                  ELLIE
                    Claire, this is Bellevue, not some

                    what we do.

      Ellie s about to chuck a few old tortilla chips but Chuck 
      stops her.

                                  CHUCK
                    Uh-uh.  Florence likes those.

                                  ELLIE
                    Florence?  I thought it was a boy

      Ellie and Claire approach David Bellinger, the seizing boy 
      from earlier.  He s sitting up in bed, lucid and texting.

                    I m Doctor Harlow, this is Doctor

                    Totally normal.  Did anyone explain 
                    what happened?

                                  DAVID
                    Not really.

                                  ELLIE
                    The sodium level in your blood was 
                      dangerously low.

                    Can I go now?

      David s not the sharpest knife in the drawer.

                                  ELLIE
                    Soon.  But listen... last night you 
                    mentioned  jobbing .  Are you a 
                    wrestler?

                                  DAVID
                    Yeah.

                                  ELLIE
                    My brother was a wrestler.  
                    Sometimes he did some pretty crazy 
                    things to get his weight down.  
                    Rubber sweatsuits.  Diuretics.  

      David s eyes widen at the mention of diuretics.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    You see, there just aren t that 
                    many ways for a healthy guy like 
                    you to throw his electrolytes so 
                    out of whack.  Diuretic abuse is 
                    kinda my leading theory here. 

                                  DAVID
                    You re not going to tell my coach, 
                    are you?

                                  ELLIE
                    No.  You re an adult, you can do 
                    whatever you want.

                                  DAVID
                    Really?

                                  ELLIE
                    Really.

                                  DAVID
                    Because what I d really like to do 
                    is bend you over the sink.  

                                  ELLIE
                    What?                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 50


                                  DAVID
                    Sorry, but you guys are the hottest 
                    doctors I ve ever seen.

      Claire and Ellie react.  The guy is a misogynist prick.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Dude, we are way out of your 
                    league.  And you know what?  My 
                      boyfriend s a cop and he s right 
                    down the hall.  One word from me 
                    and he ll come here and beat your 
                    ass blue.  Understand?

      David is shocked into submission.

                                  DAVID
                    Um, yeah...

      Ellie turns to Claire approvingly as they walk out. 

                                  ELLIE
                    Now that s what I m talking about.  
                    Listen.  Improvise.  Deal with the 
                    problem in front of you.  


      INT. HOSPITAL COURTROOM - DAY

      Ben and Lucinda sit at different tables across from a bench.  
      Lucinda is back in street clothes but still has an IV in her 
      hand.  A young but already haggard public defender, CRAIG 
      TRAVERS (late 20s) is at her side.  Lucinda notes the guard 
      at the door as Ellie takes a seat next to Ben.

                                  ELLIE
                    Morning.

                                  BEN
                          (avoiding eye contact)
                    Morning.

                                  ELLIE
                    Look... I hope that we can--

                                  BEN
                    I... there were things I just 
                    needed to say.  I said them, we can 
                    move on.

                                  ELLIE
                    Good.

      Judge Chavez enters and approaches his bench.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 51


                                  CHAVEZ
                    Ms. Webb.  This is a competency 
                    hearing.  Do you understand what 
                    that is?

                                    LUCINDA
                    Yes.     

                                  CRAIG
                    Your honor, these doctors are 
                    trying to make a case that Lucinda 
                    Webb lacks decision making capacity 
                    but it s a ridiculous claim.  

                                  BEN
                    Sir, Ms. Webb needs emergent 
                    surgery to repair a leaking brain 
                    aneurism.  

                                  ELLIE
                    If she waits, the risk of a 
                      catastrophic head-bleed could be as 
                    high as twenty percent.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Ms. Webb, anything you want to say?

                                    LUCINDA
                    I don t understand any of this.  I 
                    mean, I ve made my decision.  I 
                    don t know why none of you can 
                    respect that.

      Lucinda is emotional.  Ellie seizes an opportunity.

                                  ELLIE
                    Your honor, her lesion may be 
                    causing emotional lability.

                                    LUCINDA
                    My husband... he left me two years 
                    ago... It wasn t just that there 
                    was another woman.  He actually 
                    went to a dating site to find 
                    another woman.  He went looking for 
                    someone younger.  Someone much 
                    younger who likes football and 
                      snowboarding.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    Get to the point, Mrs. Webb.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 52


                                    LUCINDA
                    For the past two years, I ve felt 
                    like a carton of milk sitting in 
                    the fridge past it s expiration 
                    date.  And it wasn t just that I 
                    was old... older.  It was that 
                    there was nothing left.  My husband 
                    was gone.  My daughter was gone, 
                    working at her crazy law firm, 
                    eating Chinese food at her desk 
                    every night.

                                  CHAVEZ
                    What is your understanding of the 
                    risk?  That is the question here.

                                    LUCINDA
                    My understanding is that risks are 
                    part of living.  

                                  ELLIE
                    Your honor, the aneurism may also 
                    be creating a distorted sense of 
                      invincibility.

      Lucinda glares at Ellie.

                                    LUCINDA
                    I know I m not invincible. 

      Close on Ellie, Lucinda s words resonating.


      EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN HOUSE - 2002 - FLASHBACK 

      Ellie is sitting alone on a dock in front of her childhood 
      home, a blanket wrapped around her.  She holds an ice pack to 
      a bloody gash on her head, incurred in the ambulance jump.  A 
      25-year-old man, TOM, approaches the front steps.

                                  TOM
                    Are you crazy?  You could have 
                    died.

                                  ELLIE
                    But I didn t.

                                  TOM
                    The cops are looking for you.

                    I didn t jump, Tom.  I fell.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 53

                    What s the difference?  You were 
                    climbing suspension cables.  For 
                    fun.

                                    LUCINDA
                    For those years after he left, I 
                    barely went out of the house.  But 
                    then, slowly, I started doing 
                    things.  A book club.  Playing 
                    scrabble online with strangers.  
                    Nothing big.  But these were things 
                    I never would have done before.

                                  ELLIE
                    Judge, I don t see how this--

      Lucinda refuses to be shut down.

                    -- And then, over time, I got 
                    bolder.  A trip to Italy.  A 
                    singles mixer.  Dance lessons for 
                    Maggie s wedding.  

      Off Ellie we--

                    screwing that coke dealer... Tell,

                    years, I feel awake.  I understand 
                    the risks and I ve decided.  I ve

      Back in the courtroom, something clicks for Ellie.

                    She s not incompetent. 

      Ben is totally blindsided.  What the fuck is going on?

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    She knows what she s doing.  And 
                    she needs to be there.

                    Doctor Harlow can t unilaterally 
                    make this decision.

                    we re done.

                    I m sorry.  But all of a sudden it 
                    made sense.  This court order would 
                    have made us feel better but it 
                    would have done absolutely nothing 
                    for her.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 55

                      Seriously, you belong in private

                    for investment bankers, not at 
                    Bellevue where people can actually 
                    get hurt.

                                  ELLIE
                    Look, I m not perfect, alright?  
                    But you clearly have some 
                      conflicted feelings about me that 
                    you re going to have to work out--

                                  BEN
                    Don t-- just don t.  I am sick of 
                      psychiatrists trying to out psych 
                    each other.  I grew up with that my 
                    whole life.  No.  The problem is 
                    not some kind of psycho-trigger.

      INT. ICU - DAY

      Ellie appears at the door of Lucinda s room.  Lucinda is 
      dressed, ready to go.  Daughter MAGGIE (20s) and future son-
      in-law LEO (20s) are there to pick her up.

                                  ELLIE
                    Knock, knock.  

      Lucinda isn t sure what to make of Ellie at the door. 

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    I just wanted to say goodbye.

      Ellie steps in, Lucinda looks nervous.  Leo and Maggie don t 
      know the whole story about why she was here.

                                    LUCINDA
                    Doctor Harlow.  This my daughter, 
                    Maggie, and her fiance Leo. 

                                  ELLIE
                    Hello.  And congratulations.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Thanks.  And thanks for taking care 
                    of my mom. 

      Lucinda tries to act casual.

                                    LUCINDA
                    We should get going, honey.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I m glad it s nothing serious but 
                    how come nobody has any idea why 
                    she passed out?

      Ellie hesitates.  Either she betrays Lucinda s confidence or 
      corroborate with this dangerous gamble.  Ellie takes a 
      breath.

                                  ELLIE
                    Sometimes tests don t tell the 
                    whole story.  But the one thing we 
                    do know is that your mom is a very 
                    strong woman.  
                          (then)

      Lucinda is hugely relieved not to be outed.  

                                    LUCINDA
                    Thank you, Doctor Harlow.  For 
                      everything.

                    I ll go get the car.

      Lucinda gives Ellie a hug as Leo and Maggie file out.  Ellie 
      returns the embrace--

                    If you re not back here five 
                    minutes after that bouquet is 
                    thrown I m hunting your ass down, 
                      understood?

                                    LUCINDA
                      Understood.  

      With a grateful smile, Lucinda goes to join her family.


      INT. PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT - FISHBOWL - DAY

      Maneesh and Claire watch as Chuck holds out an almond to  
      Florence the squirrel who s now out of the cage.

                                  CHUCK
                    Watch this. 
                          (to Florence)
                    Pray.

      Florence puts her head down, paws together.  

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    Amazing, right?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Not really.  Animal training is 
                        cognitive-behavioral therapy in 
                    it s most basic form. 

      Maneesh sees some patients outside the Fishbowl watching.

                                    MANEESH
                    Does anyone else think that a 
                    praying squirrel in a ward full of 
                      hallucinating psychotics is a bad 
                    idea?  Or is that just me?

      Ellie steps in with an unassuming 33-year-old, MIRA KENNERLY.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 58


                                  ELLIE
                    Maneesh--  This is Mira Kennerly.

                                    MANEESH
                    Oh.  Hi.  That was fast.

                                  MIRA
                    Got on the first plane out of 
                      Charlottesville when you called.  
                          (then)
                    Can I see him now?


      INT. PSYCHIATRIC ER - DAY

      Ellie, Maneesh take Mira to a gurney where her husband, 
      Charles Kennerly, AKA Manic Man, sleeps.  

                                  ELLIE
                    He s gonna be out for a while.  
                      Combination of meds and the fact 
                    that he probably didn t get much 
                    sleep the last few days.

                                  MIRA
                    Thank you so much for finding me so 
                    fast.  Last year he was missing for 
                    over a week.

                                    MANEESH
                    How long have you been married?

      Ellie gets a chair for Mira.  She sits, takes Charles  hand.

                                  MIRA
                    Nine years.  We met when we were 
                    both getting our PhDs in 
                      engineering.  He was so amazing-- 
                    he could memorize an entire 
                    chemistry text in a day.  We didn t 
                    realize that it was the onset of... 
                    this. 
                          (collecting herself)
                    You know, when he s on his meds, he 
                    wins teaching awards.  Makes great 
                      cappuccino.  Reads Tolkien to me in 
                    bed.  All the rest... I just try to 
                    accept it as part of the deal.

                                  ELLIE
                    That s incredibly hard to do.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 59


                                  MIRA
                          (emotional)
                    The key is to let go of an illusion 
                    of perfection, you know?  Your life 
                    is your life.  There is no normal.
                          (then)
                    Can I wait here until he wakes up?

                                  ELLIE
                    Of course.

      Ellie and Maneesh move off.  Ellie has clearly been affected 
      by Mira s words.  Maneesh notices.

                                    MANEESH
                          (smiles)
                    This is all just a power trip for 
                    you, huh?

      Ellie gives him a playful shove.  

                                  ELLIE
                    Tell anyone and you re dead.
                          (then)
                    Check it out.

      They see Claire LEAVING the ward with Mike the Cop.  

                                    MANEESH
                    No way.

      Diane steps up.

                                  DIANE
                    Ready to sign out?

                                  ELLIE
                    Hell, yeah.

                                  DIANE
                      Congratulations, Ellie.  First 
                    weekend at Bellevue.  You survived.


      EXT. BELLEVUE ROOF - DUSK

      Ellie stands on the roof of the hospital, looking out to an 
      expansive view of the East River.  

                                  MALE VOICE
                    What the hell are you doing up 
                    here?

      Ellie looks back and sees Knox.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 60


                                  KNOX
                    I saw you in the hallway, you went 
                    into a utility closet.  When you 
                    didn t come out, I got curious.  
                    Thought you might be Wonder Woman 
                    or something.

                                  ELLIE
                    ... I came up to see the view.  
                    A janitor told me about the hatch 
                    to the roof.   

                                  KNOX
                    I can think of easier ways to see 
                    the river, psycho.  Have a drink at 
                    the Onyx Cafe.  Go running on York 
                    Avenue.  Hell, get right out there 
                    on a kayak.

                                  ELLIE
                    I don t know... 

      Ellie looks out at the water, seems pensive as the wind blows 
      her hair.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    ... Sometimes I have a weird need 
                    to do things the hard way.  


      EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN DOCK - DAY - 2002

      A continuation of the earlier flashback.  Tom is angry.

                                  TOM
                    You want to be like her?  Go buy a 
                    pack of razor blades, it would be 
                    easier.  Because I m sick of the 
                    cops calling about my suicidal 
                    sister.

      Ellie looks at him, adrift.  Tom instantly regrets his words. 

                                  TOM (CONT D)
                    Sorry, El.  I m sorry.  I know it s 
                    been hard.  But you know what?  
                    We re all hurting.

                                  ELLIE
                    I m not.  I m not hurting.

                                  TOM
                    Then what the hell is this about?                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 61


                                  ELLIE
                    It s about just that-- I m not 
                    hurting.  Something changed.  
                      Something s wrong with me.

                                  TOM
                    Nothing s wrong with you.  You re 
                    in shock.

                                  ELLIE
                    It s been over a year.  And all I 
                    know is... numbness... 
                      nothingness... it s so much worse 
                    then grief.  

                                  TOM
                    So, what?  You want to give up?  
                    You want to die?

                                  ELLIE
                    No.  I don t.  Bridges, cliffs, 
                    drugs, sex-- it s all the same.  
                    All about one thing...


      EXT. EAST RIVER - BACK TO PRESENT

      Ellie seems inexplicably emotional, shaken, as she turns back 
      to look Knox in the eye.

                                  ELLIE
                    ... I want to feel like I m alive.  

      Ellie collects herself, smiles.

                                  ELLIE (CONT D)
                    So where does one rent a kayak?


      INT. MIDTOWN BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

      MUSIC STARTS as Ellie and Knox knock over a row of kayaks and 
      have sex among the boats and paddles of a boathouse.  It's 
      fun and hot and... very much alive.   

      EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING

      The next morning.  Ellie walks down a busy NYC street.  Her 
      phone buzzes, it s Vanessa.  INTERCUT WITH:


      INT. VANESSA S LOFT - MORNING

      Vanessa sits up in bed, sexy in a sea of white.                      Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 62


                                    VANESSA
                    Hey.  Sorry about Friday, I got 
                    wrapped up with the DJ and sorta 
                    lost track of you.

      From Vanessa s POV we see the HOT DJ from the Teaser is 
      lounging at the other end of the bed, painting Vanessa s 
      toenails black.

                                  ELLIE
                    That s okay, I went home early.  

                                    VANESSA
                    Lunch at Tartine?  We need to catch 
                    up.

                                  ELLIE
                    Perfect.  Meet you there at one.

                                    VANESSA
                    Isn t it great to be free on a 
                    Monday instead of locked to a desk 
                    like normal people?

                                  ELLIE
                    You know, Vanessa... there is no 
                    normal.  

      Ellie hangs up as she approaches a beautiful prewar building.  
      She takes a breath and walks in through the doors...  MATCH 
      CUT WITH:

      INT. MIDTOWN ROWING CLUB - DUSK

      Ellie comes into an office-- we see from a sign it's the 
      MIDTOWN ROWING CLUB.  She's joining, getting her own kayak.  
      A CLERK hands her a form and a pen.  MATCH CUT WITH:


      INT. FANCY PREWAR BUILDING - MORNING 

      Ellie signs in at the desk and heads into an elevator as-


      EXT. EAST RIVER DOCK - DUSK

      Ellie emerges from the rowing club building, heads down a 
      dock, surveying the kayaks.


      INT. HALLWAY - FANCY PREWAR BUILDING - MORNING

      Ellie walks down a long hallway.  She stops at a door marked 
      Cate Drayton, MD, Psychotherapy.                        Revised Studio/Network Draft  1/12/11    pg. 63


      It's the therapist from the napkin that Diane gave her.  
      Ellie knocks.  Dr. CATE DRAYTON (late 40s, expensive 
      pantsuit) opens the door.    

                                  ELLIE
                    Doctor Drayton?  I m Ellie Harlow. 

                                    DRAYTON
                    Come in.

      Ellie steps into the gorgeous minimalist office.

                                  ELLIE
                    I m afraid I m not very good at 
                    this.

                                    DRAYTON
                    That s okay.  I am.

      Ellie looks out to sweeping views of the Hudson, emotional--

                                  ELLIE
                    A few nights ago... I dove off a 
                    party cruise into the East River.

      Doctor Drayton takes this in.

                                    DRAYTON
                    That sounds like a good place to 
                    start.


      EXT. EAST RIVER - DUSK

      Music continues.  Ellie rows out on the river, taking in the 
      expansive views of the city.  She picks up speed as her oars 
      slice cleanly into the water, embarking on a new chapter of 
      her life.     

                                                                          FADE OUT.
