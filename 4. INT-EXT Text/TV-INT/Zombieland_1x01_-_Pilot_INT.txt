      Cubicles divide a sedate office.  We re on the FIRST FLOOR, *
      looking through a huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW onto a PARKING LOT *
      outside.  Two pasty OFFICE WORKERS, AINSLEY and FRED, sit in *
      FRONT of the window, BACKS to it, in the midst of a full-on *
        white-collar American moan-and-groan.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    No coffee.  Yeah.  So I drive to *
                      Starbuck s.   Cause I can t *
                    function.  I get out of the car.  *
                    Phone flies off my lap onto the *
                    asphalt.  Screen cracks.*

                                  FRED*
                    Oh, man.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    I m staring at the crack.  Pissed *
                    as shit.   Cause I just got the new *
                    5S.  And a new plan.*

                                  FRED*
                    Take it back, tell them it came *
                    that way.  They might replace it.  *
                    If you find the right Genius.*

      In the parking lot BEHIND Ainsley and Fred, a woman silently *
      SPRINTS in HIGH HEELS toward her CAR, chased by a hungry *
      ZOMBIE.  Thus begins a marvelously intricate, chaotic, *
      gruesome ACTION SCENE kicking off the zombie apocalypse.*

      WE HAVE A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE MADNESS OUTSIDE, BUT AINSLEY *
      AND FRED HAVE THEIR BACKS TO IT, OBLIVIOUS AS THEY BITCH.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    And of course what do I notice - *
                    this isn t even part of the story - *
                    one of my apps is missing.  The *
                    icon.  From the home screen.  *
                    Somehow I deleted it.*

                                  FRED*
                      Butt-deleted.*                                                                                      2.


      The woman outside squirms into her car and slams the door.  *
      The zombie dives through the glass of the DRIVER S WINDOW.  *
      Its legs dangle out the window.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                      Butt-deleted.  Yeah.  Only I can t *
                    remember which one s gone,  cause *
                    it s gone.  And I won t figure it *
                    out-*

                                  FRED*
                          (nods)*
                    - til you need to use it.  I hate *
                    that.*

      The woman PEELS OUT of her space.  A truck speeds past, a *
      BUSINESSMAN ZOMBIE hanging off its back bumper.  The truck *
      SMACKS the LEGS of the first ZOMBIE, RIPPING it IN HALF.*

      The truck goes over a SPEED BUMP.  The businessman zombie *
      lets go, FACE-PLANTS, SKIDS across asphalt, notices the *
      disembodied legs of the first zombie, and starts to EAT them.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Fucking.  Hate!  So it gets better.  *
                    I order at Starbuck s.  And they *
                    ask my name.  No one ever hears my *
                    name right.  Ainsley.  No one ever *
                    gets that.  So I say Jill.  And he *
                    writes Jill on the cup.  Only now *
                    my coffee s ready.  They call out *
                    Jill.  I ve forgotten I m Jill!  *
                    Which wouldn t be a problem...*

                                  FRED*
                    Lemme guess...*

        A LANDSCAPER runs into frame with a JANITOR ZOMBIE on his *
      heels.  The landscaper is trying desperately to start a gas-*
      powered double-bladed HEDGE TRIMMER.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                          (nods)*
                    Another fucking Jill.  She walks *
                    off with my soy chai latte.  And I *
                    end up with her whole milk whatever-*
                    the-fuck.  But of course I don t *
                    realize it  til I m back in the *
                    car, and I m two thirds through the *
                    venti, thinking this tastes a *
                    little different.*

                                  FRED*
                    Wait, aren t you-?*                                                                                      3.


      The LANDSCAPER starts the HEDGE TRIMMER, turns, SWINGS, and *
        HALF-DECAPITATES the JANITOR ZOMBIE.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                          (nods)*
                    Lactose intolerant.  And now I ve *
                    finished a venti of cow s milk.  So *
                    I gotta pull into Walgreen s for *
                    some Lactaid so I don t get *
                    diarrhea.   Cause that s what dairy *
                    gives me.  Diarrhea.*

                                  FRED*
                    Oh my freaking God.  So-?!*

      The businessman zombie abandons its meal and runs after the *
      landscaper, who fails to extricate his hedge trimmer from the *
      janitor zombie s neck.  The businessman zombie TACKLES the *
      landscaper, who is IMPALED on the hedge trimmer.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Still haven t shit my pants.  *
                    Genius of Lactaid.  But day ain t *
                    over yet.  I know, I know.  Hash-*
                    tag,  First-world problems.   Some *
                    poor soul s actually suffering out *
                    there...*

      A MAN runs past the window ON FIRE, chased by a 400-POUND *
      FEMALE ZOMBIE.*

                                  FRED*
                    It s OK to get irritated.  You re *
                    used to the life you re used to.  *
                    You re allowed to get annoyed.  Ah, *
                    lunch...*

        TALLAHASSEE, 40 s, square-jawed, wearing khakis and a green *
      polo shirt,  WHICH SANDY?  embroidered onto the chest,  pulls *
      a SANDWICH CART up to the cubicles.  He s just as oblivious *
      as Ainsley and Fred to the chaos outside.*

      Tallahassee hands over 2 wrapped sandwiches, NAMES in MARKER.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                     Fred.    Aisley?    Ashley?    Ass-*
                    ?  *

                                  AINSLEY*
                    It s mine.*

      The 400-pound zombie fails to catch the man on fire.  It *
      stops, catches its breath, and turns to look IN the WINDOW.*                                                                                      4.


                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Can I interest you in dessert?*

      Ainsley shakes her head, reaches across her desk, and holds *
      up a TWINKIE.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Already hit the vending machine. *
                          (to Fred)*
                    On the Lactaid, figured why not a *
                    Twinkie.*

                                  FRED*
                    Go, girl.*

      The 400-pound zombie catches sight of the Twinkie, TURNS, and *
      BEELINES for the PLATE GLASS WINDOW.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Mm!  Can t remember the last time I *
                    had a Twinkie!*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Shut the fuck up.  Pickles in the *
                      tuna-fish?!*

      Inspired by the tuna, the 400-pound zombie gets closer...*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    You don t like pickles?*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Pickles make everything else taste *
                    like pickles.  I specifically asked-*
                          (tosses sandwich down)*
                    Could this day possibly get any *
                    worse?!*

      On cue, the 400-pounder SMASHES through the WINDOW... and we *
      FREEZE FRAME.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    Call me crazy, she may be about to *
                    get an answer to that question.  *
                    You know what they say about zombie *
                    attacks.  You always remember your *
                    first time.  Any guesses who s *
                    gonna survive this one?  Choose *
                    fast!*

      The action STARTS again.  The 400-pounder takes AINSLEY DOWN.  *
      Then turns and BELLY-SPLASHES Fred.*                                                                                      5.


      Tallahassee recovers from the shock, thinks fast, *
        aggressively RAISES his SANDWICH CART ABOVE his HEAD, and *
      SMASHES it over the zombie s noggin.  The zombie FALLS STILL.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    Maybe you woulda chosen the *
                    sandwich guy if you knew where this *
                    scene took place.  Little state *
                    called Florida.*

      Tallahassee stands tall and spies the BUSINESSMAN ZOMBIE *
      approaching the broken window.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                     Little town called... Tallahassee.*

      Tallahassee picks up a broken piece of the cart, brandishes *
      it like a weapon... and steps out the window to DO BATTLE.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                      Welcome... to Zombieland.*

      The FOURSOME finishes climbing into a BLACK CHEVY YUKON, *
      Tallahassee s ubiquitous number  3  on the side.  Tallahassee *
      and Little Rock sit up front, Wichita and Columbus in back.*

      Tallahassee reaches UP and hits the ON-STAR button (GM s *
      roadside service).  After two rings, a sassy, young AFRICAN-*
      AMERICAN WOMAN S VOICE comes over the car SPEAKERS.*

                    We were hoping you might be able to *

                    of mindless meat-lovers in between.*

      Little Rock and Columbus look defeated.  Then an idea quickly *
      rekindles his enthusiasm.*                                                                                    11.

      Our HEROES are back in the YUKON, weaving through DOWNTOWN 
      L.A. on the hunt for another community member.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (to Little Rock)
                    This may be news.  But there was *
                    actually life before Y2K.  Ms. Pac 
                    Man kinda looked like Pac Man in 
                    drag.  She had red lipstick.  And 
                    mascara.  And a bow in her hair.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    She had hair?                                                                                    22.


                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Actually, you re right.  She was 
                    bald.  They were both bald.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    And she had a mole on her cheek.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    A big facial mole.  Right there.  
                    And she and Pac Man would just go 
                    around and eat.  All they d do was 
                    eat.   Til they met each other.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    And then they kissed.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    So picture a yellow bald guy 
                    stuffing his cheeks, and then 
                    macking out with another yellow 
                    bald guy.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    With a big mole on his face.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    In drag.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    I m sorry I missed that.

                                    WICHITA
                    If Detroit s right... that s the 
                    place.



        TALLAHASSEE, WICHITA, COLUMBUS, and LITTLE ROCK ride an open-
      air, heavy-duty CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR UP to the 6th floor.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Listen up, dammit.  Eugene... is 
                    the president.  We... are the 
                    secret service.  I ll take a bullet 
                    if I have to... taste his food... 
                    lay down my life.  But he is not.  
                    Dying.  On our watch.

                                  COLUMBUS
                      Understood.

      Little Rock nods, all business.  But Wichita doesn t look 
      nearly as concerned.  Tallahassee and Columbus notice.

                                    WICHITA
                      Understood.  What!



      We re now on the unfinished 6TH FLOOR of the condo building.  
      Temporary wood floors.  Open walls.  Etc.  EUGENE finishes 
      zipping up his DUFFEL BAGS and slings one over each SHOULDER.

                                  EUGENE
                    So fired up.  Some folks to play *
                    Boggle with!  It s lonely.  You get *
                    to thinking, if something happens *
                    to me.  No one s even gonna know.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Hey, don t go all vagina.*
                          (a  4  is superimposed on-*
                            screen)*
                    Nothing s happening to you.  Trust *
                    us.*

      TALLAHASSEE tentatively takes the lead.  The others subtly, 
      awkwardly form a PROTECTIVE CIRCLE around EUGENE, GUNS DRAWN.

      Eugene finds this a little ODD.  Everyone BEAMS fake SMILES 
      at him.  The FIVESOME slowly crosses toward the ELEVATOR.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    You re one of us now, Eugene.  And 
                      membership has its privileges.  
                    Tell him what he s won, Columbus.                                                                                    24.


                                  COLUMBUS
                    Yes.  I have these rules for 
                    surviving Zombieland.  Very handy.  
                    One might even say foolproof...

      FROM NOWHERE, a SNARLING CONSTRUCTION WORKER ZOMBIE (complete 
      with hard hat) DROPS DOWN INTO FRAME from the open floor 
      ABOVE and TRIES to LAND on EUGENE s BACK...  

      ...only to lose its GRIP.  The zombie BREAKS THROUGH the 
      temporary wooden floor and SMASHES down through MULTIPLE 
      floors, all the way to concrete...

      ...leaving Eugene UNSCATHED.  His HEELS protrude over the 
      edge of the hole behind him.  A BEAT of silence and RELIEF.

                                  EUGENE
                    Whew.

      Suddenly, the EDGE of the damaged floor GIVES WAY, and Eugene 
      PLUMMETS after the ZOMBIE to his death.

      We look UP through the hole from BELOW as... one new head at 
      a time... our four heroes PEER down into the abyss.

      TALLAHASSEE closes his eyes.  Then throws an ANGRY TANTRUM, 
      PUNCHING and KICKING the air.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    We re cursed!  Like we picked up 
                    Bobby Brady s ass-reaming Tiki *
                    idol!
                          (to Little Rock)
                    Do not say who s Bobby Brady!

      Wichita chokes down a nasally trace of a GIGGLE.*

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Not funny.

                                    WICHITA
                    The tiniest bit funny.

                                  ACT THREE



      We re INSIDE the QUAINTLY DECORATED MOTOR HOME when we hear 
      KNOCKING.  The side door OPENS from the outside, revealing 
        TALLAHASSEE, COLUMBUS, LITTLE ROCK, and WICHITA, guns drawn.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Anybody home?
                          (shrugs)
                    Probably making a Metamucil run.

                                                                    TIME CUT TO:

      Our HEROES exploring the MOTOR HOME.  There s a wall of 
      PHOTOS.                                                                                      27.


      At the center is a HUGE PORTRAIT of the SWEETEST OLD COUPLE:  
      2 adorable frost-tops, arm-in-arm, posing for a warm JC-
        Penney-style picture.  A bronze label on the portrait reads:

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Bubbie...
                    (the  u  sounds like the  u  in 
                    sugar)

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    ...and Pee-Paw.

                                    WICHITA
                          (genuinely touched)
                    Aww.

      Columbus looks at Wichita WISTFULLY.  It s cool to see her 
      moved by something emotional.

      The other pics show Bubbie and Pee-Paw surrounded by adoring 
        GRANDCHILDREN... wearing  I  HEART  Bubbie  and  I  HEART  
      Pee-Paw  t-shirts.  B&P push little kids on swings, blow out 
      birthday candles, frolic, etc.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Omigod.  They re, like, sooo cute.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Gotta admit, it s touching.  God 
                    bless the  Greatest Generation. 

                                  COLUMBUS
                    They remind me of Nana and Zayde.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    And Granmoo and Gampoo.

                                  LITTLE ROCK AND WICHITA
                          (share a warm look, 
                              interlocking arms)
                    And Gray-gray and Muffer.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                       Gray-gray and Muffer? 

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                     Granmoo and Gampoo? 

                                  COLUMBUS
                    The point is, everyone had their 
                      grandfather and grandmother... and 
                    now they re gone.

                                    WICHITA
                    Kinda bringing down the room.                                                                                    28.


                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    I can t wait to meet Bubbie and 
                    Poopie.

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (corrects)
                    Pee-Paw.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Right.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (wipes misty eyes, covers)
                    Little dusty in here.



      COLUMBUS opens the door to the BEDROOM and sees a big BED, 
      upon which sit TWO HEART-SHAPED PILLOWS, one with a picture 
      of Bubbie s smiling face, the other with Pee-Paw s.  He 
      SMILES and walks past, NARROWLY MISSING...

      ...an OLD PERSON s HAND protruding from UNDER the BED.  
      Columbus reaches the MASTER BATH, peeks inside, then rests 
      his SHOTGUN against the wall outside the bathroom.



                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    One thing about Zombieland.  You 
                    can never feel clean enough.

      COLUMBUS washes his face in the BATHROOM, then reaches for 
      two TOWELS, one with an embroidered  B,  one with a  P.   He 
      pulls off the  P  towel, dries his face.  When he goes to 
      replace the towel on the rack, it SLIDES off onto the floor.

      He kneels to GRAB it when he SENSES SOMETHING, then raises 
      his head to find himself staring out the bathroom at TWO 
      FEET.  We TILT from TOE to HEAD to REVEAL...

      ...BUBBIE, standing by the bed.  She sports a BATHROBE with a 
      big  B  on the chest.  She s the cute old woman from the 
      picture, only RECENTLY ZOMBIEFIED.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    B-bubbie?

      Another ZOMBIE stands up from BEHIND the BED... an OLD MAN in 
      a bathrobe with  P  on the chest.  Yes...

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Paw-Pee?  Sorry, Pee-Paw?!                                                                                    29.



      TALLAHASSEE is visible OUTSIDE the R.V. s windshield, 
      CLEANING it with PAPER TOWELS and WINDEX.  LITTLE ROCK opens 
      a CUPBOARD and pulls down  World s Best Grandma  and  World s 
      Best Grandpa  COFFEE MUGS.  Hands one to WICHITA.

                                    WICHITA
                          (means it)
                    So precious...



      COLUMBUS stands up in the bathroom.  His shotgun leans 
      against the bedroom wall outside, out of reach.  He faces 
      down BUBBIE and PEE-PAW.  Pee-Paw has an almost gentle look.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    C-can you guys can still hear me?  
                    If so, you should know.  My Nana 
                    once mistakenly wrote me a birthday 
                    check for ten thousand dollars.  
                    And I did not cash it.

      Bubbie sweetly reaches out.  But then... her fingers clench 
      MENACINGLY.  BOTH she and PEE-PAW widen their EYES and SCREAM 
      BLOODY MURDER, the most terrifying WAILS ever.

      Columbus SCREAMS himself... and BUBBIE and PEE-PAW ATTACK!

      These two are hardly frail old things.  In fact, they re the 
      baddest-of-bad zombies.  Total Terminators.

      Columbus dives for his SHOTGUN, but TRIPS on the WET TOWEL 
      and FACE-PLANTS.  B&P land on Columbus and WRESTLE with him.  
      He kicks them off, but they still LOOM OVER HIM when...

      ...CRASH!  One of the COFFEE MUGS SMASHES into the back of 
      Pee-Paw s head... thrown by WICHITA.  He DROPS.

      Little Rock throws the SECOND MUG - BASH! - into Bubbie s 
      head.  Bubbie, too, drops.

                                    WICHITA
                    Not as cute as Gray-Gray and 
                    Muffer.

      Columbus bounces up and tries to STEP OVER B&P, when... Pee-
      Paw s EYES OPEN, and he GRABS Columbus s SHOE.

      Columbus pulls away, but his shoe POPS OFF at the HEEL.  He 
      tries to stomp it back on.                                                                                    30.


      Like lightning, B&P scramble to their feet.  Wichita and 
      Little Rock RUN toward the front of the R.V., Columbus hop-
      stomping behind them.  He KICKS OFF his shoe.

      Bubbie and Pee-Paw LUNGE.  Columbus, Wichita, and Little Rock 
      go down in a DOG-PILE.  Everyone ROLLS AROUND in MID-GRAPPLE.

      BUBBIE is about to BITE Little Rock s neck.  Columbus and 
      Wichita SEE this.  Columbus heroically DIVES BETWEEN Little 
      Rock and Bubbie.  Bubbie BITES HIS NECK INSTEAD.

      Bubbie pulls back, and her DENTURES come out, clamped 
      harmlessly onto Columbus s shirt collar.  Little Rock grabs 
      B&P s PORTRAIT off the wall and SMASHES it over Bubbie s 
      head.  It remains there like a necklace.

      Pee-Paw grabs Wichita by the HAIR.  So she grabs HIM by the 
      HAIR... only it comes right off - a TOUPEE!  Wichita, too, is 
      in trouble.  Columbus DIVES and KNOCKS Pee-Paw off, when:

                                    TALLAHASSEE (O.S.)
                    Pee-Paw!  Bambi!

      B&P look up to see the INTIMIDATING FIGURE of TALLAHASSEE 
      standing tall inside the door:  world s finest ZOMBIE-KILLER.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Bubbie.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Right.  I love you two old birds.  
                    Don t make me do this.

      ANGLE ON:  A METAL TIRE-JACK in Tallahassee s HAND.  Pee-Paw 
      abandons Wichita.  Bubbie abandons Little Rock.  They step 
      toward Tallahassee aggressively.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (genuinely upset)
                    Please!

      Pee-Paw BELLOWS and SPRINTS at Tallahassee.  Bubbie, too.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Fine, you get the horns.

      Tallahassee SWINGS from his HEELS with the TIRE-JACK, like 
      BABE RUTH, or PAUL BUNYON, beating the living shit out of 
      these blue-hairs.  It s AWESOME to behold.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (anguished)
                    I m very!
                          (BAM!)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    31.

                                    TALLAHASSEE (CONT'D)
                    Very!
                          (BAM!)
                    Sorry!
                          (BAM!)

      B&P lie STILL on the floor.  Tallahassee, chest heaving, bows 
      his head in sorrow... and BRUSHES BUBBIE s HAIR OVER HER EAR.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    They were too good for this world.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    There are 2 more angels in heaven.

      But as Tallahassee TURNS, B&P s eyes OPEN.

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (points frantically)
                    Pee-Paw and Boobie!

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                          (corrects him)
                    Bubbie!

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Right!

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (irritated)
                      Seriously?



      The OTHERS watch TALLAHASSEE START up the R.V. and RUN BUBBIE 
      and PEE-PAW OVER.  SQUISH.  They go under the FRONT wheels.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Wait for it.

      A long pause.  Then SQUISH.  The BACK wheels.  Tallahassee 
      engages reverse.  SQUISH... they go under the back wheels 
      again.  A long PAUSE.  And SQUISH.  The FRONT wheels.                                                                                    32.

                          (bows head, a beat)
                    There s nothing more romantic than 
                    an old couple dying within a few 
                    minutes of one another.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    That s because you smashed their 
                    heads in with a tire-changing jack.

                                    WICHITA
                    And ran them over with an R.V.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (solemn)
                    I know.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    A close second, actually...

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:



      COLUMBUS walks back into the R.V. BEDROOM, where he collects 
      his SHOE, puts it back on his foot, stands, and TURNS...

      ...nearly BUMPING INTO WICHITA, who FOLLOWED him into the 
      bedroom.  Her expression is one of GRATITUDE and ATTRACTION.

      She REACHES as if to brush Columbus s hair over his ear... 
      and instead REMOVES the DENTURES SNAGGED on his collar.                                                                                    33.


                                  COLUMBUS
                    Thank you.

                                    WICHITA
                    Thank you.

                    Bottled water.

      We PUSH IN on Columbus, lit up with... HOPE.

        Superimposed on-screen:  a TITLE:  33.  Keep Hope Alive.



      The R.V. exits the park, a big  3  on the side and a piece of 
      SEE-THRU PLASTIC DUCT-TAPED into a  windshield.   TALLAHASSEE 
      drives.  LITTLE ROCK sits in front.  WICHITA and COLUMBUS 
      stand behind.  DETROIT s voice comes over the speakers.

                                    DETROIT (O.S.)
                    Don t say it.

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    We re still looking to meet that *
                    special someone.  And we just *
                    ditched our vaginas back in *

                          (a  5  pops up)*
                    ...so we re ready to aim for that *
                    paradise on the eastern seaboard.  *
                    A place to call home.*

                    Tell ya what.  You head east.  I ll *
                    find that place, get  em to leave *

      CLICK.  Our heroes smile.  Look at one another... and then 
      slowly, one-by-one... BACK UP at the ON-STAR BUTTON.

                                  LITTLE ROCK*

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    You thinking what I m thinking?

                                  COLUMBUS*
                    Somewhere between us and the *
                    eastern seaboard.  Lies the state *
                    of Michigan.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Hear it s nice this time of year.*

      Tallahassee smiles and steers the R.V. up a FREEWAY RAMP.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Pie?

      Columbus slides the pie tin out of the ZIPLOC BAG.

                                    WICHITA
                    Don t mind if I do.

      Everyone fights for PIE.



      A reprise of  Free to Be You and Me.   The R.V. ZOOMS east.  *
      The camera travels from face to face of our HEROES, purple-*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                      A semi-wise man once said:  Picture 
                    you ve been dead a long time.  And 
                    God comes to you.  And says, I m 
                    gonna let you go back down to earth 
                    and live.  For 5 minutes.  But only 
                    5.  Which 5 would you choose?  
                    Here s a hint.  Don t think about 
                    the where.  Or the when.  Think 
                    about the who.

      The R.V. heads toward the beckoning HORIZON.

                    This land is your land.  This land *
                    is my land.  This land is *
