      Rigsby tosses her the ultraviolet wand, starts packing.

      Lisbon eyes the photo of Christine on her computer screen.  
      The girl looks so happy.  

      Jane and Van Pelt near Lisbon, occasionally turning this way 
      or that.  Now Lisbon, puzzled, sees Jane has his hand lightly 
      on Van Pelt s wrist, as if taking her pulse while they walk.  
      Jane s very intense, eyes half-closed as if seeing something 
      no one else can.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)

                    Grace is mentally telling me where

                    No no.  It s all science. 

      Jane, still touching Van Pelt s wrist, pirouettes away with 
      her, an eerie, slow-motion waltz.  Lisbon and the others 
      can t help watching...

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A dark cluttered wreck of a room.  Decent TV.  Lisbon and Van 
      Pelt talk to JACK TANNER, mid-30's, Christine s father.  
      Hollow-eyed and beaten down, a drinker -- Christine s loss 
      only the latest blow.  Also in the room is LISA, a tough 12,  
      and MICAH, 7, playing on a battered old Gameboy.  Both are 
      pale and exhausted from weeping. 

      Van Pelt s watching Lisbon like a hawk, trying to learn.

                                  TANNER
                    Excuse the mess.  Chris was the 
                      house-proud one around here.

                                  LISBON
                    We understand.  Mr. Tanner, we may 
                    have to ask some tough questions.  

      She looks at the kids meaningfully.

                                  TANNER
                    Huh?  Oh, that s okay.  Can t tell 
                    Lisa nothing she hasn t heard 
                    before, and Micah don t give a 
                    damn.  Slow.  He s only sad because 
                    he sees Lisa is.

                                  LISBON
                    All the same... 

      At Tanner s nod, Lisa leads her brother out.  Lisbon watches 
      them go.

      Lisbon just stares at him, as if she had gone away somewhere 
      in her mind.  Van Pelt waits a beat, expecting Lisbon to take 
      up the questioning.

                    Nice uh?  What kind of freak drowns 
                    somebody?  

                                  LISBON 
                    You tell me.  Who does she know  *
                    that might have reason to do this?

      Darlene looks sly.

                                    DARLENE
                    Now that you mention it.  There was 
                    a guy... What was his name?

      Lisbon has heard that tone before.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes, Darlene.  If you help us, I ll 
                    talk to the prosecutor.  See if I 
                    can help you on these charges 
                    you ve got pending.  

                                    DARLENE
                    OK.  Last year, Chris was banging 
                    an older guy.  Like old.  She 
                    called him Pops.

                                  LISBON
                    No name?  Just Pops?

                                    DARLENE
                    Pops.  That was it.  One time, she 
                    said he was getting weird, and she 
                    was talking about dumping him.  
                    But I don t know if she ever did.  
                    Like I say, we haven t been tight 
                    for a while now.

      Lisbon thinks she has a live lead.

                                  LISBON
                    That s interesting.  But it s not 
                    enough for a call to the D.A.  
                    Didn t she say anything else about 
                    him?  Anything at all?

                                    DARLENE
                          (racking her brains)
                    Uh, he s good in bed.... And he 
                    likes fifties music.  You know -- 
                    like Elvis and stuff?

      To find Jane and PHILLIP HANDLER, the beach bum -- AKA 
      Flipper -- so deep into playing chess that they don t notice 
      anyone s arrival for a moment.  Handler looks up first.

                    way as the victim s.  She did his 
                     do.  


      A sullen  Flipper  in the chair.  Fancies himself a rebel  
        philosopher.  Lisbon and Jane seated opposite.  

                                    HANDLER
                    I guess you must be bad cop.

      Lisbon tosses some PHOTOS on the table between them.  A WOMAN 
      with horrible bruises on her face.

                    That was unfortunate.  But it was 
                    from a love situation.

                    that led to friction.  What can you

      Cho, Rigsby, Van Pelt working in the b.g. as Lisbon talks to 
      Jack Tanner.  Kids, Micah and Lisa, in tow.  Tanner is 
      agitated.  And drunk.

      He s loud.  The kids shrink back, but resignedly.  Used to 
      it.  Lisbon clocks it.  Her mouth tightens.

                                  LISBON

                    I m having someone take you home.

      She nods to a Deputy who tries to usher Tanner out.  But 
      behind Lisbon, Rigsby leads Handler out.  (Note:  Handler is 
      not under arrest so he is not handcuffed.)  Tanner sees them, 
      pushes by Lisbon, belligerent --

                    Is this him?  Is this him?

      Lisbon intercepts him.

                                  LISBON
                    Go home, Mr. Tanner.  Look after 
                    your children.

                                  TANNER

                    Go home!  Now! 

      Tanner busts into tears.  Lisbon stands and looks at him, 
      frozen.  Lisa, leading Micah, comes and takes her father s 
      hand.

                                  LISA

                    Coroner just told me Christine was 
                    put into the water sometime early 
                    Tuesday morning.  So this Monday 
                    night party is critical.  Somebody 
                    who was there must know what 
                    happened later that night.


      MINELLI and Lisbon walking and talking. 

                                    MINELLI
                    You brought him all the way back 
                    here why?

                                  LISBON
                    The local Chief begged me not to 
                    put him in his jail.  Kurtik s a 
                    big cheese down there.  

                                    MINELLI
                    That is a signal, is that not a 
                    signal to cut the man loose?  

                                  LISBON
                    He hit Jane pretty good.  People 
                    were watching.  I had to arrest 
                    him. 

                                    MINELLI
                    This guy is connected.  This guy 
                    has the governor s home number.

                    And we both know Jane asked for it.   *
                    You couldn t give Kurtik a stern  *

                    If Kurtik was having sex with her,  *
                    that s motive to kill.   *

                                    MINELLI
                    If.  It s a hunch.  Based on 
                      rockabilly.

                                  LISBON
                    It s a Jane hunch.  You keep him 
                    around for a reason.
                          (beat)
                    Let us work Kurtik until his lawyer 
                    arrives, maybe we ll get something 
                    more.

                                    MINELLI
                    Work him gently.  

      Minelli walks on.  Turns.

                                    MINELLI (CONT D)
                    Is Jane okay?

                                  LISBON
                    Bruised.  I ll tell him you asked.


      Kurtik sits opposite Cho.  Both silent, gazing placidly at 
      each other.  Finally...

                                  CHO
                    Do you have a thing for youngsters 
                    in general, Dane?  Or was it 
                    Christine in particular that 
                    appealed to you?  That, I can 
                      understand.  Because you know, you  
                    meet some fifteen-year-olds, 
                    they re just as smart and mature 
                    and articulate as any adult.  
                    Right?  They are adults, basically.  
                    Maybe Christine was one of them.

      He exits.  Lisbon sighs.

      Jane gathers his stuff, preparing to head out the door for 
      Santa Marta.  Dane Kurtik walks past with his fancy Lawyer, 
      enjoying the taste of freedom.  Kurtik sees Jane, tells the 
      Lawyer to wait and comes over.

                                  KURTIK

      He turns to go... Lisbon s right behind him.

                    Keep walking, Mr. Kurtik.  I might

      FADE IN:


      Morning.  Lisbon and Jane, near the big double doors, sipping 
      coffee and eating doughnuts.  Lisbon eyes her watch.

                                  LISBON
                    What do you think?  Did it work?

      Jane eyes his watch.

                    Three, two, one... Now!

      A beat.  Lisbon eyes Jane.  Jane laughs.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    How cool would it have been if one 
                    of them had walked in?

      Just then the doors open.  It s Hope.  She smiles diffidently 
      at Jane and Lisbon, shy and childlike in the unfamiliar 
      surroundings.

                    Hi.  Did you arrest him?  Did he

                    Held her under until she stopped

                                  HOPE
                    I m sorry, Danny.  I had to tell 
                    the truth.  You re only making it 
                    worse by lying.  You re only 
                    deceiving yourself. 

      Danny points at Hope.

                                  DANNY
                    It was her.  It was her who killed 
                    Chris.  Hope was jealous of her 
                    ever since she started hanging out 
                    with us.  Used to be it was Hope 
                    who was all that.  Then Chris 
                    arrives and we only hook up with 
                    Hope when, you know, Chris isn t 
                    around.

                                  HOPE
                    That s so distorted and not true.

                                  DANNY
                    No.  I m telling the truth now...

                                  DANNY
                    Killed her. 

                                  HOPE
                          (angrily to Danny)
                    I did it for you jerk.  I did it 
                    for you.   
                          (to Jane and Lisbon)
                    She was screwing his dad!  And 
                    she s acting as judge over his 
                    life?  Telling him his life is 
                    over?  He s going to jail because 
                    she, she s got to show integrity, 
                    and morals?  She was a prissy self-
                    righteous hypocritical bitch and 
                    she was going to ruin his life.  

      Danny s like -  there you go, it was her. 

      Van Pelt appears at the door, beckons.  Off Lisbon s look of 
      bemused -  What now?  


      Win and Andy wait nervously.  Lisbon and Jane join them.

                                  WIN
                    It was Flipper.

                                  LISBON
                    Really.

                                  ANDY
                    Yes it was.  Flipper.

                                  JANE
                    What if I said it was you, Andy? 

                                  LISBON
                    Jane?

                                  ANDY
                    What?  That s bull, that s 
                      ridiculous.

                                  JANE
                    Walk this way.

      Lisbon ushers them toward the interrogation room.        THE MENTALIST       "Red Tide"       GOLD 8/07/08       50.



      Jane and Lisbon usher in Win and Andy, whose faces fall on 
      seeing Hope and Danny; now seated glumly alongside each 
      other.  

                                  ANDY
                    I didn t kill her, man!

                                  JANE
                    Sure you did.

      Pointing to Win, Hope and Dale in quick succession --

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    And so did you.  And you.  And you.

      His smile doesn t reach his eyes.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    All four of you killed her.

      FLASHBACK


      Jane continues, Lisbon and the four kids listen...

                                  JANE
                    And now you re all equally under 
                    arrest.

      Off the four teenagers as Lisbon starts putting handcuffs on 
      them...        THE MENTALIST       "Red Tide"       GOLD 8/07/08       51.



      FLASHBULBS OF PHOTOGRAPHERS AND NEWS TV CREW LIGHTS flare on 
      the other side of double doors as Rigsby leads in Dane 
      Kurtik, shaken, in handcuffs.  Watching are -- Lisbon and 
      Jack Tanner, his two kids in BG.  

                                  TANNER
                    Statutory rape?  What ll he get?

                                  LISBON
                    I doubt he ll do time.  Not without 
                      Christine s testimony.  But we ll 
                    have fun trying.    

      Tanner nods.  Their attention turns to his kids.  

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    You have good kids.

                                  TANNER
                    Yes.

                                  LISBON
                    You are all they have.

                                  TANNER
                    I know that.

                                  LISBON
                    Be good to them, Mr. Tanner.

                                  TANNER
                    I am good to them.

      A defensive tone.  Don t get personal.  Tanner starts to walk 
      away and Lisbon is about to let him.  But then she goes after 
      him.

                                  LISBON
                    Mister Tanner.
                          (he pauses)
                    My father was a good man, like you,  *
                    and after my mom died, he became a  *
                      self-pitying drunk like you.   *
                    Killed himself and damn near killed 
                    me and my brothers, too.

      She hands him a card. 

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Get some help.  Your children 
                    deserve it.  And so do you.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST       "Red Tide"       GOLD 8/07/08       52.

      A beat, and Tanner grabs the card.  He and the kids exit.  
      Lisbon catches sight of someone at the doors watching.  Jane.  
      (Note:  He s in casual clothes.)  A moment between them, she 
      looks away.  Looks back.  He s gone.  Off Lisbon amid the 
      office bustle...
