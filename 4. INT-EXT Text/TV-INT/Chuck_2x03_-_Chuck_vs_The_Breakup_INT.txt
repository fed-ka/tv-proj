SUPER CLOSE as BRYCE LARKIN kisses SARAH WALKER, slamming her 
against a wall in a passionate embrace.  As they kiss, 
Sarah s eyes glance at a SECURITY CAMERA watching them 
overhead.    

TITLE READS:  Macau, China.  2005    

As the security camera rotates past them, Sarah and Bryce 
immediately end their embrace and head down the hallway.  As 
they pass a room, a GUN suddenly jolts out and nestles 
against Bryce s temple.  REVEAL an ANGRY CHINESE GANGSTER 
holding the gun.  A single red rose in his lapel pocket. 

CHINESE GANGSTER
(in Mandarin; subtitled)
Where s my money, Mr. Anderson?

Sarah draws her gun, but the gangster uses Bryce as a shield.  
For Sarah to hit the gangster without injuring Bryce seems an 
impossible shot.  Bryce calmly says, in English --

BRYCE
You got the shot?

SARAH
Yeah.  I got it.

Now, without hesitation, Sarah fires.  Perfect shot.  She 
hits the gangster between the eyes; ends his miserable life.  

BRYCE
Nice shot, Mrs. Anderson.

SARAH
Thank you, Mr. Anderson.

Bryce takes the rose from the gangster s lapel pocket.  Hands 
it to Sarah.  OFF the rose --

Chuck puts the bottle of Chateau Margaux down on a table as 
he enters.  REVEAL ELLIE and AWESOME watching an old Bond 
movie (something Connery).  

ELLIE
That was a fast date.  Everything 
okay with you and Sarah?

CHUCK
Everything except her ex s in town.  
Guy has this irritating habit of 
popping into my life at the most 
inopportune of times.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
The stalker ex.  Not awesome.

ELLIE
Does he know you and Sarah are 
dating? 

CHUCK
Not exactly...

ELLIE
Well, I m sure Sarah will tell him, 
and he ll be out of your lives 
before you know it. 

CHUCK
Something tells me it won t be 
quite that easy.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Don t sweat it, bro.  This guy 
can t hold a candle to you.  It s 
not like he s James Bond, right?

Chuck considers a beat.  Now A KNOCK on the door.  Chuck 
answers.  It s Sarah.

ELLIE
Why don t we give you two some 
privacy?

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Remember.  You the man, Chuck.

Ellie and Awesome head off to the Bedroom.

SARAH
You ran out so quick we didn t have 
a chance to talk.

CHUCK
Awkward situation.  Bryce being in 
your apartment and all.

SARAH
Maybe we should talk about that.

CHUCK
You sure you don t need to get back 
to him?  

Sarah indicates the bottle of wine on the table.

SARAH
Besides, it d be a shame to waste 
such a good bottle of wine.

OFF her smile --


A romantic setting.  Music from the stereo...  A great bottle 
of wine...  A pizza...?   

CHUCK
Not exactly the evening I had in 
mind but Bryce popping in meant 
calling an audible.

SARAH
A good spy knows how to think on 
his feet. 

CHUCK
I d take credit, but Sbarro really 
did all the work.   
(beat)
So... Is Bryce in town for business 
or pleasure?

SARAH
I don t know why he s here, Chuck.  
I came home and he just showed up.  

CHUCK
So it s pleasure.

Sarah takes Chuck s hand.  Reassures him --

SARAH
What Bryce and I had is in the 
past, Chuck.




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       4.

CONTINUED:

Chuck s happy to hear this.  Lifts his glass.  

CHUCK
A toast.  To a quiet evening.  No 
mission.  No Fulcrum agents trying 
to kill us.  Just you and me. 

The door opens interrupting them.  It s MORGAN.

MORGAN
This night s a complete disaster, 
Chuck.  Anna got called in to work 
at the last second.

CHUCK
And Morgan apparently...

Morgan grabs a slice.  Plops down next to them.  

MORGAN
So, what re we doing tonight?

Chuck considers the romantic moment gone awry --

CHUCK
(to Sarah)
We re doomed, aren t we?

OFF them --


MORGAN
We re doomed, aren t we?

REVEAL Chuck and Morgan watching LESTER at the far end of the 
store wipe a finger on the register desk and indicate dust to 
a REGISTER GIRL.  Fearful, she quickly wipes it down.  Now 
Lester turns and heads towards Morgan and Chuck.  

MORGAN (CONT D)
Lester is destroying everything we 
built here.  Years of doing nothing 
gone.  We ll never survive his 
nightmare reign as Assistant 
Manager.

Chuck sees Casey point to his watch, indicate for him to 
follow him out of the Buy More.

CHUCK
Could be worse.  It could be Casey.




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       5.

CONTINUED:

Chuck heads off with Casey.

CASEY
Lunch break.  Orange Orange.  

CHUCK
I m sick of yogurt.  I was thinking 
Meatball sub today.

CASEY
We re not eating, idiot.  We ve got 
a new mission.

CHUCK
Does it have anything to do with 
Bryce?  Why he s in town?

CASEY
I don t know.  But if I know 
Larkin, he s probably here for a 
roll in the hay with Walker.

Chuck lives with that for a beat as he and Casey exit past 
the Entertainment section --  

WE STAY here for a beat.  THREE  SPORTSJOCK!  EMPLOYEES play 
Madden  09 on PlayStation 3 and eat lunch.  The SportsJocks 
are big, muscled, jock types.  Their leader is MITT, 30 s.  
They re raucous, loud, and have no regard for the store.

Lester angrily watches them with Jeff.

LESTER
Look at them.  With their colas and 
their tacos.  They can t treat my 
store like a frat house.  

Lester starts to go over to them when JEFF stops them.  

JEFF
I wouldn t do that, sir.  

LESTER
Why not?

JEFF
Because I heard Mitt put the 
manager of the Sbarro in the ER 
last week when he asked him to stop 
doing grated Parmesan shots.

LESTER
Does Morgan know?
(Jeff shakes his head no)
Good.  Then I ll have him do it.

CUT TO:


An unwitting Morgan approaches Mitt and the SportsJocks as 
they play.  Mitt throws a completion on screen.  

MORGAN
Nice pass.  So guys... my manager 
wanted me to ask you to please try 
and share the game with some of the 
other customers when you re here.

Mitt and the guys keep playing.  Seem nonplussed by Morgan.  

MORGAN (CONT D)
And if you could just clean up your 
lunches before you leave also, we d 
really appreciate it.  

Mitt and SportsJocks finish the game.  Turn to Morgan.  
Mitt s not mean.  He s super-friendly. 

MITT
No problem.  Our lunch break s over 
anyhow.  Playstation s all yours.
(starts to leave; then)
Oh, almost forgot my lunch.

Mitt now grabs a half-eaten burrito.  He puts in Morgan s 
front pant pocket.  SMUSHES it for good measure.

MITT (CONT D)
There.  All cleaned up.

Now Mitt leans in close to Morgan s face.

MITT (CONT D)
And dude?  If you ever interrupt my 
game again?  It s gonna be your 
face that gets smushed.

OFF the SportsJocks laughing, Morgan scared --


Chuck, Sarah and Casey sit around a conference table.  
BECKMAN on the big screen.  Chuck whispers to Sarah. 



(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       7.

CHUCK
Bryce mention why he s here yet?  
He s not staying with you, is he?

SARAH
Not now, Chuck.

GENERAL BECKMAN
(clears throat)
Is there something you d like to 
share with the rest of the class, 
Mr. Bartowski?

CHUCK
Sorry, General.  Zipping it up.  
You re not gonna hear a peep out of 
me.  Zip.  Completely mum --

Casey growls.  Chuck finally shuts up.

GENERAL BECKMAN
It appears the Fulcrum threat is 
far worse than it originally 
appeared.  Not only did they 
destroy the new Intersect, but 
we ve learned an agent of theirs 
stole an encrypted microchip 
containing top-secret information 
out of the DNI.

On screen, we see the chip.  Super-thin, bright purple.  
Think a large digital camera memory stick.

GENERAL BECKMAN (CONT D)
The information on the chip 
contained highly classified 
intelligence.  A refresh.  Every 
secret we d gathered since the 
original Intersect was destroyed.

SARAH
Is there anything on that chip that 
could compromise our cover?

GENERAL BECKMAN
(grim nod)
Unfortunately, yes.  All of you, 
the entire Intersect project, is at 
great risk if the chip isn t 
recovered.

GENERAL BECKMAN (CONT'D)
Agent Larkin has learned that 
Fulcrum hired Von Hayes, a wealthy 
software magnate, to decrypt the 
chip and deliver the encoded 
information back to them. 

The screen shows VON HAYES.  40 s.  Handsome.  

GENERAL BECKMAN (CONT D)
Mr. Hayes is throwing a lavish 
party at his Bel Air estate this 
evening.  The finest food, music 
and champagne will be served.  Your 
job will be to pose as a married 
couple and steal back the chip.

Chuck considers the romantic possibilities with Sarah.

CHUCK
Now that s what I m talking about, 
General.  Finally a mission I can 
sink my teeth into.  I ll just dust 
off my tux, polish my dancing 
shoes...

GENERAL BECKMAN
-- No, Chuck.  This mission is 
going to require a real spy.

Suddenly we HEAR an AIR LOCK release from a secure door in 
Castle.  The door slides open.  A beat and out of the door 
steps BRYCE LARKIN.  Handsome, cool spy glasses.  

BRYCE
Sorry, I m late.  LA traffic s a 
bitch.  

GENERAL BECKMAN
Bryce will be posing as Sarah s 
husband.  Chuck, you ll be posing 
as a waiter.  Try and flash on and 
identify the Fulcrum agent.  

Chuck s heart sinks a bit as Bryce smiles at Sarah.  Now 
Bryce places a gorgeous engagement ring on Sarah s finger.  

BRYCE
Hello, Mrs. Anderson.

ACT ONE


Casey finishes selling a refrigerator to a young MARRIED 
COUPLE.  Both wear army fatigues.   

CASEY
You re gonna love the XL-250.  And 
congratulations on your marriage, 
Sergeant.

Casey actually smiles as they head off.  Chuck approaches.  
Sarah and Bryce on his mind --

CASEY (CONT D)
Nice kids.  Protecting the freedoms 
of upstanding citizens like that 
reminds me why I joined the NSA in 
the first place.

CHUCK
I thought it was so you could shoot 
bad guys and blow up terrorists.

CASEY
Who says you can t have it all.

CHUCK
So... what s the deal with the 
mission tonight?  Sarah says you ve 
been working on the plan.

CASEY
Yeah.  Making it so airtight that 
even you can t screw it up.

CHUCK
Appreciate the vote of confidence.  
So what s the deal with the 
Anderson s? 

CASEY
Why?  You worried Bryce is gonna 
take off with your girl?

CHUCK
First of all.  Sarah and I are pure 
professionals.  I resent the 
implication we re anything but.  
Second, I m simply taking an 
interest in a co-worker s mission 
plan.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
I figure if I m gonna be stuck 
being a spy I might as well learn 
from the master.

Casey can t tell if Chuck s being sarcastic so --

CASEY
The microchip is stored inside a 
vault in Von Hayes  mansion.  Bryce 
and Sarah simply need to slip out 
of the main ballroom and grab it.

CHUCK
Won t people ask questions if they 
slip out of the party?

CASEY
That s the beauty of their cover.  
The Anderson s are a couple big 
into PDA.  When they sneak out to 
get it on in another room... no one 
asks questions.  From what I hear 
they really know how to sell it.

CHUCK
That s not believable.  Adults 
aren t into PDA anymore.

Casey grunts.  Indicates for Chuck to look over his shoulder.

Chuck turns.  Sees Morgan and ANNA making out.  

CASEY
Any more questions?

OFF Chuck -- starting to get a little jealous/worried --


CLOSE ON: Sarah and Bryce at very close proximity.  Faces 
close so they can whisper.  Sarah s behind the counter.  
Bryce at a stool.  Bryce puts his hand on hers.

SARAH
We re not undercover yet, Bryce.    

BRYCE
You never know who could be 
watching, Mrs. Anderson.

SARAH
About the Anderson s...

Bryce, flirty, moves in for a kiss.  Sarah shies away.

SARAH (CONT D)
I m thinking we should keep it just 
a cover this time...  

BRYCE
It was never a problem before.

SARAH
Fulcrum s getting closer and 
closer, Bryce.  We need to be 
focused.  No distractions.  

BRYCE
You re right.  No distractions.

Sarah smiles, but Bryce registers something about her --

PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- ELLIE approaching.  

She stops in her tracks.  From her POV Sarah appears to be 
intimate with Bryce (whom Ellie can only see the side/back of 
his head). 

OFF Ellie turning around and leaving, worried for Chuck --


Mitt and the SportsJocks are back playing Madden and making a 
mess of the store.  Lester approaches Morgan and Anna.

LESTER
I thought I told you to toss those 
meat heads?

MORGAN
I tried.  Maybe they d respond 
better to a person in authority?  

LESTER
Maybe.  Or I could use my valuable 
time as Assistant Manager to finish 
this month s lunch schedule.  I saw 
you requested the one o clock with 
Anna.  Wednesday s with Chuck.  Or 
not...

OFF Morgan, Lester driving too tough a bargain --CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       12.



Morgan approaches Mitt and the jocks.  He s scared.  Nervous.  
Tries to fit in and be friendly.

MORGAN
Hey, fellas...  You guy s playing 
Madden?

They turn and look at him like he s an idiot.  Now they go 
back to the game.  Mitt s on offense.  He s leading his team 
down the field on a game winning drive.  He makes a pass and 
his receiver breaks free.  Is heading for the end zone...  

SPORTSJOCK
Ten seconds...  Nine seconds...  

MITT
I m taking it to the house!

SPORTSJOCK
Five...  Four...  

Morgan sees Lester tapping his foot impatiently.  Morgan 
tries to get Mitt s attention.  Steps in front of him.

MORGAN
Guys, look...

MITT
You re blocking the screen, wimp.

Mitt pushes Morgan out of the way.  Morgan backpeddles and 
his leg KICKS OUT the power supply.  The Playstation screen 
goes BLACK.  Mitt and three SportsJocks turn to him.  

MITT (CONT D)
That was a game winning drive.  I 
was on the two yard line.

MORGAN
I m sorry.  It was an accident.  I 
swear.

MITT
What did I say to you about 
interrupting my game...

Mitt tries to read Morgan s name tag.  He says the following 
not on purpose but because he can t read well.

MITT (CONT D)

MORGAN
Actually, it s Morgan.  Grimes.  

Mitt s face goes BLUSH RED.  He s embarrassed.  His feelings 
are hurt, but he has to tough up for his boys.

MITT
You making fun of me man cause I 
can t read Spanish, Grimmez?

MORGAN
No.  No.  Of course not.  Besides  
my name s not even Spanish.  It s 
English...

A collective  whoa!  from the SportsJocks.

MITT
Now I can t read English either, 
huh?   

MORGAN
No.  I didn t mean it like that. 
I...

MITT
Alright tough guy.  You and me.  
After work.  I m gonna be waiting 
for you.  You re a dead man, Grimm-

Mitt exits.  Morgan turns, terrified -- 

MORGAN

Chuck dressed in his tux.  Heading out as Ellie enters.

ELLIE
Chuck.  Don t you look nice.  

CHUCK
Thanks.  Sarah and I have a... 
tickets to the opera.

ELLIE
Did Sarah ever speak to that ex of 
hers?  

CHUCK
I think so.  Why?

Ellie pauses, debating whether to tell him or not. 

ELLIE
I m sorry I have to tell you this, 
Chuck, but I went to the Orange 
Orange to ask her to be a 
bridesmaid in my wedding this 
afternoon.  I kinda saw her holding 
hands with someone.  I thought it 
might be her ex.

CHUCK
Really?  What did he look like?

ELLIE
I didn t get a great look at him, 
but he seemed tall.  Dark hair.  
Sort of a classically handsome 
type.

CHUCK
I wouldn t call him classically 
handsome.  I mean maybe from a 
really weird angle or from a super 
long distance I could see it.

ELLIE
I m sorry, Chuck.

CHUCK
Don t be, Elle.  There s nothing to 
worry about.  Sarah s probably just 
letting him down easy.  Trust me.  
Things couldn t be better between 
us.


Chuck KNOCKS on Sarah s door.  Bryce, half-dressed, answers.

BRYCE
What, no rose for me this time, 
loverboy?   


Bryce closes the door behind him as he continues to get 
dressed.  

CHUCK
I was just protecting our cover.

That s not true.

CHUCK
What?  You didn t sleep with half 
the Tri-Delts?  

BRYCE
Maybe it is true.

Now Chuck s eyes are drawn to Bryce s open suitcase.  He eyes 
Bryce a beat.  Hair slicked back.  Tying his own bow-tie.  
This guy IS James Bond.  How can Sarah, or any girl for that 
matter, resist him?

CHUCK
You re staying with Sarah, huh?  

BRYCE
Enough about me.  How s your life?

CHUCK
Pretty good considering I ve lost 
track of how many times I ve been 
shot at, dangled from death defying 
heights, all the while constantly 
lying to my friends and family 
about my life while making eleven 
dollars an hour at the Buy More.  
But who s complaining?

BRYCE
How are things going with you and 
Sarah?

CHUCK
Good.  Why?  Did she say something?

BRYCE
No.  It s just she s a beautiful 
girl.  Pretending to be your 
girlfriend.  I was afraid you d let 
the lines get blurred and fall for 
her.

Now Sarah enters the front door.  She s wearing a beautiful 
RED GOWN.  She s stunning.  The male members of the audience 
feel their jaws drop -- as does Chuck.  He loves this woman.

SARAH
Hey, guys.  So how do I look?

Chuck seeing Bryce watching, covers, says nonchalantly --

CHUCK
Good.  Truth is red s really not my 
thing.

OFF Sarah, what s that about --


A CORK POPS!  Champagne flows.  PAN across a regal ballroom 
revealing the most romantic party you can imagine.  

A twelve piece ORCHESTRA plays classics.  KEEP PANNING across 
a table filled with caviar, lobster, sushi, wild flowers from 
the Amazon.  Camera continues to pan and we see Bryce and 
Sarah.  They re feeding each other strawberries lustily.  

Camera finally comes FULL CIRCLE to reveal:   

CHUCK.  Holding a tray of appetizers (Prosciutto and Melon).  
He wears a name tag that reads: Jorge.  

A WAITER sees Chuck staring at Bryce and Sarah.  Approaches.

WAITER
Get used to it.  They re the 
Anderson s.  The caterer worked a 
party in Bel Air a year ago.  Said 
they did it in every room. 

The waiter leaves Chuck with this.  Chuck s jealous eyes stay 
on Sarah.  

CLOSE ON SARAH AND BRYCE

We see and hear what Chuck can t from this angle.  Bryce and 
Sarah are not just feeding each other strawberries.  They re 
checking out the room for security.  

SARAH
Two security guards at six o clock.  
Two at midnight.

Eyes still on Sarah.  Jealous.  The head waiter, BARRY NYES, 
admonishes Chuck.

BARRY
Get to work, Jorge.  I m paying you 
to serve melons, not stare at them.


Casey s inside the mansion in a small security booth.  A 
small bank of monitors show us the various rooms and hallways 
inside the home.  He speaks into his watch --

CASEY
Quit screwing around, Bartowski.  
Von Hayes is at table eight.  Grab 
a bottle of wine and see if you 
flash on anyone.

OFF Casey s spy watch, SMASH CUT TO:


Morgan s watch.  He s staring at it, hoping it ll just stop 
ticking but now it reaches eight o clock.  Jeff and Lester 
are watching it tick with him.  

LESTER
Shift s over.  Nice knowing you.

JEFF
I ll look after Anna when you re 
gone.

ANNA (O.S.)
I d rather be drawn and quartered.

Anna approaches.  Jeff s bummed.  He and Lester head off.  
Lester consoles --

LESTER
It could be worse.  She didn t say 
she d rather be dead this time.

Morgan wipes the fear off his face as Anna approaches.

Anna starts to lead Morgan out of the store.  

JEFF

Deaddddd mannnnn walking!

Morgan, scared, musters all the bravery he can as he heads 
towards the exit.  Suddenly he stops.  

MORGAN
You know what?  I just remembered I 
promised Big Mike I d finish the 
inventory by tomorrow morning.

ANNA
Morgan... you knew about this last 
week.

Beat.  Morgan s bummed.  Sex... or death.  He chooses life.

MORGAN
I m sorry.  If I don t do it, Big 
Mike ll kill me.  

ANNA
Fine.  Your loss. 

MORGAN
Rain check?!   Anna...

But Anna s gone.  OFF the Buy More doors SHUTTING, 
imprisoning Morgan inside --


Sarah and Bryce in the middle of a very sexy lambada.  
They re dancing.  Dipping.  Twirling.  

What they re really doing is preparing to make their move. 
They re clocking the security cameras in the room.  

SARAH
The cameras on the east and west 
walls cross for about two seconds.

That s the blind spot.  Let s go.

They continue to dance.  Making their way over. 

ANGLE: CHUCK.  He s serving wine and looking at the guests at 
Von Hayes  table.  He keeps stealing jealous glances at Bryce 
and Sarah.   

Now he sees Bryce s hands are all over Sarah s ass, causing 
Chuck to DROP the bottle of wine.  It breaks on the floor.  
VON HAYES, 40 s, sophisticated, a distinctive British accent, 
is furious.  

VON HAYES 
That was a thousand dollar bottle 
of Lafite Rothschild, you moron!

CHUCK
I m so sorry, sir.  I ll have 
someone clean it up immediately.

VON HAYES
(to guests)
I apologize.  It s just so hard to 
get good help these days.

The other guests nod knowingly.  

ANGLE BARRY: Taking notice of Chuck s second screw up.

Chuck heads away.  Talks into his watch --

CHUCK
Didn t flash, Casey.  

CASEY (V.O.)
Keep looking.  And get your head in 
the game, Chuck. 

Chuck grabs another bottle of wine.  Starts to make his way 
to another table.  He notices all eyes in the room are on the 
dance floor so he looks over.  

ANGLE: Sarah, Bryce and the Lambada are heading to a sexy 
conclusion.  

BACK ON CHUCK: The waiter from before stops by again.  
Notices Sarah and Bryce doing the lambada.

incredibly passionate kiss.  

WAITER
Jeez, people.  Get a room...

The guests applaud, then turn back around to their meals.  

ON BRYCE AND SARAH -- Sarah pulls off the kiss.  The door 
next to them is ready to be breached.

SARAH
We got an opening.  Let s go.  

Bryce heads for the door.  Before Sarah can move, Chuck 
arrives.  Stopping Sarah.  He s got a bottle of wine and two 
glasses.

CHUCK
(to Sarah)
A little wine to go with that 
cheese, Mrs. Anderson?

SARAH
What are you doing?

CHUCK
A public service.  People are here 
for a party, not a live sex show. 

Bryce is by the door.  Indicates for Sarah to hurry up.

SARAH
It s just a cover, Chuck.  We 
talked about this.

CHUCK
We didn t talk about how you two 
did it in every room in Bel Air.

Now a hand grabs Chuck.  Reveal it s Barry.

BARRY
Is everything okay, ma am?  Is 
Jorge bothering you?

Sarah needs to protect her cover so --

rude waiter in my life.

Barry grabs Chuck by the ear --  

BARRY (CONT D)
That s it, Jorge.  You re fired!

CHUCK
For what?

BARRY
Hitting on the guests, you pervert.

As Barry drags Chuck out he hears a FEMALE VOICE behind him -- 

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Hello, Mr. Hayes.  

Something about the VOICE makes Chuck turn towards it.  All 
Chuck can see is the back of a WOMAN dressed in a 
conservative business suit.  She s talking to Von Hayes.  
Chuck tries to see her face, but he can t.

FEMALE VOICE (CONT D)
Perhaps we could talk somewhere in 
private?

As she continues to speak, her voice causes Chuck to flash.

CHUCK S FLASH: A SOUND WAVE ECHELONED.  VOICE RECOGNITION 
RADIO WAVES.  DEAD BODIES.  SECRET CODES.  CODE BREAKING 
MACHINES.  REDACTED PHOTOS.  CODE NAME: FULCRUM.

Chuck tries again to see her face but its futile.  Barry 
continues to drag Chuck out of the ballroom --

CHUCK
Wait, please... I really need this 
job.


Casey watches on a monitor as Chuck s tossed out of the 
house.  He s pissed --

CASEY
Only Bartowski could screw this up.

ACT TWO


Casey, stewing, watches Chuck on a security monitor.  Chuck 
gives a weak wave to the camera.      

CASEY
How can I help you, you idiot?

CHUCK (V.O.)
I got fired from the mission.

Casey walks over to the front door.  Opens it.  Chuck s 
outside looking up at the camera.  Casey grabs Chuck and 
pulls him inside.

CASEY
Bryce and Sarah are at the vault.  
Did you see the Fulcrum Agent?

CHUCK
I flashed on her, but I didn t see 
her face.

CASEY
We need to know what she looks 
like, Chuck.  You ve got one 
minute, then get out.  

Chuck starts inside.  Just as he does, he sees Barry up ahead 
talking to ANOTHER WAITER.  Chuck quickly ducks into a room.


Chuck s ducked into a small adjoining room to an office.  
Inside the office he sees Von Hayes and the Fulcrum Agent 
talking.  A BODYGUARD of Von Hayes  is with them.


Chuck now gets a good look at the Fulcrum Agent.  Late 20 s, 
conservative dress.  She s pretty.  Sexy.  Seems like just a 
regular business woman.   

FULCRUM AGENT
You promised us the decrypted chip 
two weeks ago.  Instead, you re 
throwing a party.  

VON HAYES
What s the point of being rich if 
you can t enjoy it?



(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       23.

CONTINUED:

FULCRUM AGENT
My bosses don t like to wait.  Have 
you decrypted the information on 
the chip?

VON HAYES
It s finished.  The question is 
where s my fifteen million dollars?

The Bodyguard gives an intimidating look to the Fulcrum 
Agent.  She appears scared for a beat.  Then -- 

FULCRUM AGENT
Forget the fifteen million.  

Fulcrum Agent now does a shocking turn as she pulls out a gun 
with silencer and without hesitation shoots the Bodyguard in 
the head.  BANG. 

FULCRUM AGENT (CONT D)
I think I ll just take my chip. 

OFF Chuck, hiding, freaked out --


Morgan, hiding, freaked out.  He s by the front door peering 
out, looking for Mitt and the SportsJocks.  Sees nothing.

He looks out again and this time Mitt and the SportsJocks are 
there.  Mitt taps on the glass door.  Indicates for Morgan to 
come out and fight.  Morgan shakes his head.   No.   

Mitt now pulls back a fist.  Starts to send a punch into the 
window towards Morgan when suddenly --

Morgan wakes up.  He s in the Buy More but what we just saw 
was a nightmare.

MORGAN
Chuck!  Help!


Chuck s dealing with his own nightmare.  He watches as the 
Fulcrum Agent starts to lead Von Hayes out of the room.  
That s when he sees Von Hayes  TIE CLIP.  

ANGLE: the microchip is attached (underneath) the tie clip.  

Chuck ducks down, hides under a desk.  Calls into his watch --

CONTINUED:

CHUCK
Casey.  The microchip s not in the 
vault.  


Bryce and Sarah working on the lock.  They immediately stop 
working on it.

CHUCK (V.O.)
It s in Von Hayes  tie clip.  I 
also got a good look at the Fulcrum 
Agent...

Sarah and Bryce exit the vault.  Rush off --


The Fulcrum Agent starts to lead Von Hayes out at gun point 
when she hears a CELL PHONE RING from the adjoining room 
(Chuck s).  She turns towards the sound.  The distraction 
allows Von Hayes to rush off.


Chuck s cell RINGS.   Morgan.   He quickly turns it off.  

CASEY (V.O.)
What does she look like, Chuck?

CHUCK
She s awful.  Incredibly creepy.  
Think psycho librarian...

A PISTOL HAMMER COCKS.  Chuck turns to see two feet under the 
desk.  Fulcrum Lady bends down, gun at Chuck s face. 

CHUCK (CONT D)
All that being said... I m sure she 
has a great personality.


Bryce and Sarah rush towards an intersecting hallway.

SARAH
Talk to us, Casey.  What s going on?


Casey eyes the monitors.  SEES Chuck being taken out one way 
by the Fulcrum Agent.  Von Hayes is exiting in another.




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       25.

CONTINUED:

CASEY
(into watch)
The Fulcrum Agent has Chuck.  

SARAH
Where?

CASEY
Chuck s to your left.  Von Hayes 
and the microchip to your right. 

Bryce and Sarah see Von Hayes rushing past to the right.

SARAH
Freeze!  Federal agents!

Von Hayes doesn t listen.  Rushes off to their right.  Sarah 
and Bryce now reach the Intersection.  

Bryce turns right.  Sarah turns left.  Bryce sees Sarah go 
left.  Stops.

BRYCE
What are you doing?

Sarah stops.  Turns to Bryce.

SARAH
Chuck s in danger.  The Fulcrum 
Agent could kill him.

BRYCE
Our covers are on that microchip.  
If Fulcrum gets it, all of us will 
be killed.

Sarah now takes off to the left towards Chuck.

BRYCE (CONT D)
Sarah!

But she s gone.  Bryce stays on mission.  Heads after Von 
Hayes.

Casey eyes the monitors.  Pissed.

CASEY
Bartowski.  The CIA.  How could it 
not go right?

OFF Casey rushing inside --CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       26.



Sarah in bed.  Chuck enters with a bouquet of Gardenias.  

CHUCK
I brought you some Gardenias.

SARAH
They re my favorite.  How d you 
know?

CHUCK
I saw them in your apartment.  I m 
not an entirely incompetent spy.

SARAH
Thanks, Chuck.  You can put them 
over there.

Sarah points behind him.  Chuck turns to see the entire back 
of the room is filled with flowers.  

CHUCK
Bryce, huh?  
(she nods)
I guess no matter what it is I ll 
always end up in second place when 
it comes to him.

SARAH
Not always.

She smiles and takes Chuck s hand.  He sits close to her now.  
An intimate moment.  

CHUCK
Ellie said you bruised some ribs.

SARAH
I m fine.  It s my ego that s 
bruised more than anything.  

CHUCK
This is my fault.  If I didn t get 
fired this wouldn t have happened. 

SARAH
Don t apologize, Chuck.  It s not 
your job to protect me.  




(CONTINUED)CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       29.

CONTINUED:

CHUCK
All things considered, I guess 
that s a good thing.

SARAH
Don t be so sure.  You do have 
certain qualities...

They smile.  OFF them holding hands, at this moment they 
look, and are, a REAL couple --


REVEAL a disguised Bryce, small cut near his eye, wearing a 
hat, his spy glasses, watching Chuck and Sarah be intimate. 


PULL BACK to reveal Awesome and Ellie watching Bryce.

ELLIE
I don t believe it.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
What s up, babe?

ELLIE
That s Sarah s ex.  He just won t 
back off.  Well, Chuck may be too 
sweet to say anything, but I m not.

Ellie starts to head over, but Awesome stops her --

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Hold on, Babe.  Let me handle this.


Bryce continues to spy on Sarah and Chuck when a hand grabs 
his shoulder.  It s Awesome.  He eyes Bryce s cut. 

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Hey, bro.  That cut looks infected.  
I better take a look at it.

OFF Awesome leading Bryce away --


Morgan slogs through work.  His hair a mess.  Back hurts.  
Barely slept a wink.  Anna, Jeff and Lester approach him.  
Jeff SNIFFS.

LESTER
Did you sleep in the Buy More last 
night so you could avoid Mitt?

MORGAN
No.  Of course not.

LESTER
(sniffs)
I don t know.  I smell the scent of 
cowardice, Jeffrey.  How about you? 

MORGAN
I m not afraid of Mitt.  And if he 
was here right now, I d tell him. 

Behind Morgan we see Mitt and the SportsJocks enter.  Lester 
points to them --

LESTER
Lucky for you, he s here.  Oh and 
since you re not afraid of him, 
tell him to leave and never come 
back.  

Morgan puts on a brave face for Anna.  Meets Mitt by the 
entrance.  Mitt s pissed.

MITT
Someone didn t show last night.  
Don t think you re gonna get away 
with insulting me, Grimmez.  You 
can t duck me forever.

MORGAN
Look, Mitt.  The way I see it, 
there s no need for violence.  
Can t we work something out here?  
Something that doesn t involve you 
beating me to a pulp? 

MITT
We could use some new iPods.

MORGAN
We?  I can t afford one for each of 
you.

Fine.  I just have to get an 
advance on my paycheck.

Mitt and the guys turn around and leave.  REVEAL Casey has 
overheard the conversation.  

MORGAN (CONT D)
(acting tough)
That s right.  And don t come back.

Morgan joins Jeff, Lester and Anna.  They re impressed.  

ANNA
Wow.  How d you do that?

MORGAN
You just gotta know how to speak 
their language.  Bully a bully.

OFF Morgan boasting --


Awesome applies Hydrogen Peroxide to Bryce s cut.  It stings.  

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Sorry.  Gotta lot dirt in there.  
Don t want it to get infected.

Bryce grimaces at the sting.  Still, he lets Awesome play his 
game.  Bryce is listening.  Spying for information here.

CAPTAIN AWESOME (CONT D)
So how do you know Sarah?

BRYCE
She s my ex.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Based on all the flowers you sent, 
I d say you still have feelings for 
her.

brother-in-law, Chuck.  

Bryce thinks quick --

BRYCE
I didn t know.  Sarah said she 
wanted to talk to me about 
something but then she got hurt.

Awesome puts more antibiotic on the cut.

BRYCE (CONT D)
Ouch...

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Sorry, bro.  Cuts pretty deep.

BRYCE
So Chuck and Sarah?  Is it serious?

CAPTAIN AWESOME
I m specializing in cardiothoracic 
medicine.  That means there are two 
things in this world I know best.  
Extreme sports and the human heart.

care about her, bro?  Set her free.

Sad thing is.  You didn t even try.  

OFF Morgan, considering this --


Chuck heads out for work.  Awesome enters with a bouquet of 
flowers in a vase. 

CAPTAIN AWESOME
Chuck.  Just the guy I wanted to 
see.  These are for you.

Chuck takes the vase.  

CHUCK
Thanks, Devon.  I ve never had a 
man give me flowers before, but 
there s a first time for everything 
I guess.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
They re not from me, Chuck.  

CHUCK
That s a relief.

CAPTAIN AWESOME

her room.  This guy doesn t take no 
for an answer.

CHUCK
No kidding.  Hey, thanks for 
looking out for me.

That s what bro s are for, Chuck.

The card reads:  Let s meet in private.  323-224-3421.

The voice interrupts --

VOICE
-- Who s Bryce?


Von Hayes, scared, hides in his motel room.  He s looking out  
the window to check for trouble.  His Ferrari is parked 
outside the motel in this rough and tumble neighborhood.

Chuck recognizes the voice --

CHUCK
Von Hayes...?  We ve been trying to 
find you.

VON HAYES
Who s this?

Chuck thinks a beat, realizes --

CHUCK
Jorge... Jorge Carmichael.

VON HAYES
Who?

CHUCK
Remember the waiter who dropped the 
bottle of Lafite Rothschild? 

VON HAYES
It was a thousand dollar bottle.  
How could I forget that imbecile? 

CHUCK
Yours truly.

VON HAYES
How did you get my number?  I sent 
those flowers to that female agent.

CHUCK
I m her supervisor.  Your case made 
its way up the food chain so you ll 
be dealing with me now.  So if you 
want to live, Mr. Hayes?  I suggest 
you tell me where the microchip is.

Don t worry.  I have it.  It s 
safe.  Just get me out of here.  
This place is horrible, Jorge.  It 
doesn t even have hand towels.

CHUCK
Then I suggest you stay away from 
the bathroom, Mr. Hayes.  Now, 
let s talk about that microchip...  


HANS, the Fulcrum Agent s driver, heads over to a nurse s 
station.  Says to a NURSE with a big smile --

HANS
Hi.  I m looking for Sarah Walker s 
room?

NURSE
Room 214.  Across the hall.

HANS
Thank you.

Hans heads towards Sarah s room.  She s asleep inside.  OFF 
Hans pulling out a gun, Sarah definitely not safe --


Chuck approaches Casey.  

CHUCK
I know you re pissed I screwed up 
your perfect plan but I got good 
news.  I found the microchip.

CASEY
How?

CHUCK
Doesn t matter.  Point is I did it.  

CASEY
What exactly did you do, Bartowski?

CHUCK
I negotiated the return of the 
microchip.  Of course I had to 
agree to certain terms.

CASEY
What terms?

CHUCK
One, he ll only make the exchange 
with me.  Two, he wants full 
immunity from any government 
prosecution.  

CASEY
I can live with that.  

Casey starts out.  Chuck stops him.

CHUCK
There s one more... little thing.

CASEY
What?

CHUCK
We re gonna need 4.5 million 
dollars in unmarked bills.  
Preferably in small denominations.

CASEY
Moron...

CHUCK
Hey, he asked for fifteen million.  
Way I see it, I saved us a lot of 
money.

OFF Casey s growl --


Sarah s asleep.  REVEAL Hans approaching her quietly.  He 
screws a silencer onto his gun.  Now he brings the muzzle of 
the silencer to her head. 

Just as Hans is about to pull the trigger, Sarah s EYES OPEN.   

With cat-like reflexes she sits up just as Hans FIRES.  
PFFFT!  Bullet hits the pillow.  Sarah springs up and out of 
bed.  Kicks the gun out of Hans  hand.

Hans grabs a large hypodermic needle.  OFF Hans approaching a 
cornered Sarah --CHUCK - Episode 203 - Scott Rosenbaum - Network Draft       39.



Sarah backs away from Hans who holds the needle like a knife.  

She eyes Hans  gun, but it s too far away to get to.  

Hans moves in, stabs with the needle.  Sarah dodges his 
attack.  

He stabs again.  Again and again.  She dodges his thrusts.  

Now a well place kick knocks the needle out of his hand.  

Now it s hand to hand combat.  Hans, bigger and stronger, has 
the advantage.  A punch sends Sarah to the floor.  She sees a 
bed pan under the bed.  Grabs it as he advances on her.

Now Sarah comes up swinging, the bed pan KNOCKS Hans back 
into a wall.  He s dazed.  Sarah grabs the hypodermic needle 
and pops up off the ground.  She holds the needle at his eye.

SARAH
I don t like being run over so I m 
only gonna ask you once.  Where s 
your boss?


Chuck and Von Hayes at a stand-off.

Give us the chip, Mr. Hayes.

Von starts to hand over the chip just as Casey and Bryce rush 
around the corner and spill into the alley.  

CASEY
Drop your guns!  Don t move!

The Bad Guys turn around, guns pointed at Casey and Bryce.  
It s a Mexican stand-off, but Casey and Bryce are outnumbered.

for thug work is, but I m feeling 
pretty confidant it s a lot less

The Bad Guys make their way to Chuck, guns still on Casey and 
Bryce.  They take the cash from Chuck and take off.  Bryce 
grabs the microchip from Von Hayes.  Casey s pissed.

you.

CASEY
Shut up.  Don t encourage him.

Casey s pushes past Chuck.

laugh at my stupid jokes, make a 
habit of saving my life.  

Sarah smiles.  

CHUCK (CONT D)
The truth is you re everything I 
thought I ever wanted and more.  
And for the last few days all I can 
think about is our future.  About 
what s gonna happen when I finally 
get the Intersect out of my head.  
How we ll finally get to be 
together.  For real.  No fake 
relationship.  No lies.  No cover.  

Sarah considers Chuck s words.  Despite her vow not to let 
her feelings for Chuck get her guard down, we sense she might 
be losing that battle.   

CHUCK (CONT D)
But the more I think about it, the 
more I realize that you and I can 
never have a future together. 

We hear Sarah s heart drop along with the needle scratch.  
She covers her emotions, pained but hiding it.

CHUCK (CONT D)
I fooled myself into thinking we 
could, but the truth is we can t.  
(then)
Because even if we had a real 
relationship it would never really 
be real.

CHUCK (CONT D)
I d still never know anything about 
you.  What your real name is.  
Where you grew up.  Your first 
love.  Your first heartbreak.  
Anything.  
(then)
And I want more than that.  After a 
bad day I want to be able to call 
you to tell you about something 
funny Morgan did and not find out I 
can t because you re off somewhere 
in Paraguay quelling a revolution 
with a fork.  
(beat)
I m just a normal guy who wants a 
normal life.  And as amazing as you 
are, Sarah Walker -- we both know 
you will never be normal.  

Beat.  Sarah sucks up her pain.  At the same time, a part of 
Chuck wants her to refute what he just said.  She doesn t.

They eye each other.  There s a longing, but they fight it.

SARAH
Someday, Chuck, when the 
Intersect s out of your head and 
you have the life you always 
wanted, you ll forget all about me.

CHUCK
I doubt it.

Sarah quickly fixes Chuck s collar.  Smiles at him.  He 
smiles back. 

SARAH
C mon, we better get inside.  
They re waiting. 

Now they both turn towards the door.  Their faces hidden from 
each other.  We see Chuck s face is pained.  

Now we see Sarah s EYES are WET.  She quickly DRIES them 
before Chuck can see.  As Chuck opens the door --


Chuck and Sarah enter.  The frowns on their faces immediately 
turn to smiles.  An emotional 180.  Damn, these two are 
getting good.   

Awesome and Ellie see them enter.

CAPTAIN AWESOME
It s our favorite bridesmaid!

Ellie hugs Sarah --

ELLIE
I m so excited!  Wait till you see 
the dresses I found.  

Awesome puts his arm around Chuck.  Says the following loud 
enough so that even Sarah can hear --

CAPTAIN AWESOME
I m glad you two worked things out.  
Who knows, maybe you re next.

OFF Sarah and Chuck --


Chuck flops down on his bed.  He picks up a photo of him and 
Sarah.  Smiling.  Happy.  

Now he spots something on his desk.

Bryce s cool spy glasses.  A note attached to them.  

It reads:   C mon.  Try  em on.  You d be surprised how good 
you look. 

Chuck shakes his head.  Still, he s a little curious.  He 
walks over to the mirror.  Eyes himself a beat.  Now he puts 
the glasses on his face and then it happens --

BLINDING WHITE LIGHT shoots out from behind the lenses.  

THOUSANDS of NEW INTERSECT IMAGES FLASH.  New information.  
New secrets.  All filling up Chuck s brain.  Now, just before 
he passes out, he gets out five last words --

CHUCK
God, I hate Bryce Larkin.

FLUMP.  Chuck falls to floor.  As the images flash in his 
eyes, we CLOSE IN on the glasses.  See the MICROCHIP has been 
inserted into the GLASSES.  It GLOWS as the glasses refresh 
Chuck.  OFF Chuck being updated we... FADE OUT.
