The town car sails along, bright glint off the surface
streets-- We HEAR HARD RAP, TUPAC SHAKUR-- CELL PHONE RINGS--
The black town car cruises south, past dry brown hills...
CELL PHONE RINGS AGAIN...
The Lincoln follows the Harleys off, PULLS TO A STOP in a lot
at the crest of the exit. Jagged rocks, craggy peaks.
The leader gets off his bike. EDDIE VOGEL, nearly 300 lbs.
Skull & halo patch on leather vest-- same as Harold's tattoo.
The "Road Saints." Mick lowers a window.
EDDIE
Counsellor, how's it hanging?
8.
MICK
Fine, Eddie, how's it with you?
EDDIE
(CASUAL)
Hard Case called me from the pen,
he said I might catch up to you.
Said you're stalling his case til
you see more green, is that right?
MICK
If you want me to work you've gat
to pay me.
EDDIE
We paid you. Five thousand.
MICK
That's long gone. I could tell you
half went to the aerial-photo
expert. He's going to blow the
state's case by showing that the
DEA violated the air space over
Harold's farm by flying too low...
but you don't need to know that.
All you need to know is, we had a
deal. Time to refill the tank.
Eddie smiles. Taps the side of the Lincoln.
EDDIE
Sure, gas-guzzler like this. I
heard you got three more. What's
one man need with four Lincolns?
MICK
EDDIE--
EDDIE
What? You want another five grand?
MICK
Ten. I'm flying the guy in from
Kodak in New York, he wants
business class...
EDDIE
And I want Harold back on the farm.
He's the best farmer we got, if you
know what I mean...
9.
MICK
I don't. And I don't want to.
Either pay me my money or go with
the Public Defender the judge finds
you. Of course he won't know much
about air space, but--
EDDIE
Keep your shirt on, Counsellor. We
want you.
He reaches into a vest with his big hand. Thick envelope.
Mick takes it. Starts to count, and realizes:
MICK
You had the whole ten ready. What
if you'd backed me down to five?
EDDIE
This vest got lots of pocket.
Eddie taps another pocket and GRINS. one tooth missing.
Sunlight. Where Dobbs suddenly TENSES as he SEES: A TV
CAMERAMAN coming out with camera. Off Dobbs's reaction--
MICK
Yep. Media's already picked us up.
DOBBS
Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the
press...
Mick, a beat. Then calls the cameraman over. When he comes--
MICK
I saw you in there filming. What's
your name?
CAMERAMAN
Rob Gillen. They call me "Sticks."
MICK
You freelancing on this, Sticks?
STICKS
Your client's got profile, I figure
I can sell it to local news.
MICK
How much?
STICKS
'Scuse me?
MICK
How much will they pay you for what
you shot today?
STICKS
That depends. Seven, seven-fifty.
MICK
Suppose we take it off your hands
for eight.
Sticks hesitates, like it's not the legit thing to do.
MICK (CONT'D)
Or do we make it a thousand.
17.
Sticks hesitates no longer. Takes the tape from the camera
and hands it to Mick... who's already counting out money from
the roll of cash Ted gave him. To Dobbs--
MICK (CONT'D)
I can expense this, right?
DOS
Of course. Absolutely.
Sticks takes the money, goes. Dobbs, impressed, beaming now--
DOBBS (CONT'D)
I'll admit, Mr. Haller, you weren't
my choice. You were Louis's.
Frankly I'd never heard of you. But
maybe I should have. Seems to me
I've underestimated you.
MICK
Then let's talk about my fees.
(before Dobbs can reply)
I'll need a hundred thousand up
front. Working off five-fifty an
hour, it'll come to another hundred
thousand if we go to trial. That's
estimating the trial at a week.
Appeals, we start over.
Mick's Lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb.
Mick, hand on the door--
MICK (CONT'D)
I take it that's not a problem.
Reaction Dobbs-- hesitates but has no choice. MICK GETS IN,
we GLIMPSE THE LINCOLN'S LICENSE PLATE: NT GLTY 2-- CUT TO,
LOUIS is sitting in a Porsche Carrera...
LOUIS (V.0.)
I didn't want to walk in on
anything, so I got there early.
His POV, shadow-figure of Hard-Guy approaching in the dark..
LOUIS (CONT'D)
I waited til the guy came out.
MICK (V.0.)
You see what he was driving?
LOUIS (V.0.)
A Corvette. Yellow.
Hard-Guy gets in the Corvette, pulls out.
MICK (V.0.)
So he leaves, and you go in...
The Lincoln pulls up. Mick gets out but stands there.
MICK
Thanks.
She nods You're welcome. And pulls away. Mick's smile fades
as he looks up at his dark lonely house.
Mick's got a drink in his hand. Below: L.A. is spread out:
Wide, white scattering of lights. Above: Stars.
Jams/wedges its way through traffic, to halt at the curb.
MICK exits, heads towards... into...
MICK with his daughter, HAYLEY, 8. Mick's ON A BENCH near
where Hayley waits on line for the next pony...
EARL approaches from the refreshment stand with an ice-cream
for Hayley and one for himself. Kids playing everywhere, a
MINIATURE TRAIN chugs past... but Mick's lost in thought, his
beat-up briefcase open, he's working.
EARL
Got you the good stuff, Hayley...
HAYLEY
Thank you, Earl.
Just then a little girl gets off a pony. The attendant holds
it for Hayley.
EARL
Man's got your ride ready...
MICK
Go on, I'll hold your ice cream.
Excited, Hayley goes. The attendant lifts her up and on, and
The pony carrying Hayley joins the others in the wide ring...
Mick watches her for a moment, waves-- then, balancing the
ice cream, returns to his files--
48.
MICK (CONT'D)
There's something right in front of
me and I'm not seeing it.
On his lap he's spread out: PAGES from the TWO FILES: the
blue-covered one Raul gave him. The white-covered from Ted.
Mick starts turning pages, compares... The same, the same...
When he turns the next one over:
It's the page Raul gave him showing the PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
the picture we saw in Cecil Dobbs' office.
Turns to the matching page from Ted's file. Reaction Mick...
In the parking lot, pulls up. Louis is in front of the club,
golf-clothes, waiting. Comes out to meet the Lincoln...
Louis hurries over, as far from the clubhouse as possible, in
order not to be seen or heard-- eager--
LOUIS
What's happened? Is it over? You
said it would be over by now--
MICK
That was before I found out you
were still lying to me.
He shoves a sheet at Louis. Louis looks: PICTURE OF A KNIFE,
but DIFFERENT from the knife-picture we saw before.
49.
MICK (CONT'D)
You know what that is? It's a
picture of your knife. The one you
had on you when you went to Reggie
Campos. The one the cops have.
Look at the blood on the blade.
Look at the initials.
Louis is stuck for an answer--
MICK (CONT'D)
That's why Ted Minton didn't care
when I told him Reggie's a
prostitute. What's it matter, when
he's got a knife with her blood and
your initials on it?
LOUIS
This wasn't the knife in the file--
MICK
(scowls, sore)
That's right. The file Raul got us
was a loaded deck. The cops must
have been on to him, because they
used it to set us up. So we'd think
they had nothing, when in fact they
had enough to put your Hugo Boss,
golf-playing ass away for twenty
years!
Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off.
He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis.
Mick sees him looking her way...
Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A
moment... then Mick resumes. Cold and firm.
MICK (CONT'D)
Explain to me why you lied about
the knife.
LOUIS
I didn't lie. I said the one in the
picture wasn't mine.
Mick frowns/grins at the answer...
LOUIS (CONT'D)
I said it twice! Nobody listened!
50.
MICK
(MOCKING)
What are you now, a lawyer? A
clever, third-rate fucking lawyer
with smart-ass technicalities? "You
said it wasn't yours"-- What you
should have said was, "I had a
knife but this isn't it!" What did
you think, it would just go away?
(closing in on him)
You brought a murder weapon to a
meeting with a prostitute, Louis!
How am I supposed to make that look
like she set you up?
LOUIS
1. Did. Not. Do this.
Off which, Mick stares hard at Louis. At his frightened look.
Then tries-- slowly-- as if for the last time--
MICK
Then kindly tell me why you went to
her apartment with a custom-made
knife, serrated tip, with "LR"
engraved on the blade?
LOUIS
I always carry it.
For a moment, Mick takes this in. Echoes.
MICK
You always carry it.
LOUIS
Yes. In real estate we show homes,
to people we don't know. This one
time...
He stops. Like it's difficult. Then goes ahead...
LOUIS (CONT'D)
My mother. She was showing a place.
It was in Bel-Air, so she thought
it was okay to go alone, even
though there was a man at the time
who had raped some women that way.
He was there.
MICK
Who was there?
51.
LOUIS
The man. He raped her. When she
didn't come back, I went to the
house and found her.
Mick. Stirs. Like he's seeing a possibility...
LOUIS (CONT'D)
That's when she stopped showing
property. I do the selling now. And
I started carrying a knife. Always.
Mick turns it over. Finally...
MICK
That's quite a story, Louis.
(BEAT)
Your mother will have to testify.
LOUIS
We don't want that.
MICK
(COLD)
I don't give a damn what you think
we want. From now on you do what I
tell you while I try this case. Do
I make myself clear?
Louis is silent. Mick looks off. Towards Hayley, in the car.
Not much traffic rolling out of the city, mid-morning...
PRE-LAP the YELPING/SNARLING of a small /fierce dog... We're:
Lincoln in front. Mick, working on Raul's question. Trudges
up the steps. PHONE RINGS before he gets in, he fumbles keys--
LOUIS
(turns to him, to
"EXPLAIN")
I couldn't reach you! I'm on trial
for my life, Mick, and I get
nervous when I can't reach yout
And you were away all day. Like you
told "Maggie."
Meaning he listened to the call. Mick goes white.
MICK
You don't come near this house
again, do you understand me? We
aren't friends, we aren't partners,
you're my client, eriod--
LOUIS
Just what I wanted to remind you
of. I'm your client.
Mick reacts. Louis lets in sink in, then:
LOUIS (CONT'D)
Besides, I like it in your house,
Mick... Pretty pictures of your
kid, Hayley...
MICK
Fucken don't.
LOUIS
Don't what, don't say she's pretty?
But I saw her, the other day at the
club...
At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth. Quick,
solid.
70.
His lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just
as suddenly, he steels himself. Glares coldly at Mick.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
Okay. Okay I'm going. But--
And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
--first I think I should give you
back your key. It isn't right that
I have it. Now that we can trust
each other.
Mick takes the key. Panting, he watches Louis go down the
fucking steps.
Hayley, defending, scrambles to get in the way of another
girl, a forward, dribbling towards her...
ANGLE MICK, on the sideline... among other parents...
MICK
That's it, Hayley, get in her way!
Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her,
goes in for the score. Hayley looks despondently at Mick--
MICK (CONT'D)
It's okay, honey!
When-- his CELL-PHONE RINGS. Into it--
MICK (CONT'D)
This is Haller...
He strains to listen... Stops cold. His look darkens... Even
from the field, Hayley sees this...
Seen from the POV OF--
Mick stands there KNOCKING at the door. It's opened by:
VAL
Hey Mick!
Val's surprised... a mix of emotions...
VAL (CONT'D)
What're you doin' here?... and I
heard about Raul Levin, man...
MICK
(ignores all that)
You know your garage door's open?
VAL
Shit: I just had a plasma
delivered...
And rushes to... the GARAGE. Mick trails... Val's relieved to
find the box is okay.
VAL (CONT'D)
Oh man, if we still lived in Van
Nuys this sucker'd be gone. Set me
back eight grand, too. But it's
gonna be great for the games...
(notes Mick's silent mood)
What's up anyway? What brings you
out here?
74.
MICK
Raul's murder.
(Val waits, listens.)
I've been with the cops. They can't
tie Roulet to it, because your
ankle bracelet doesn't put him near
the house.
VAL
I know, I gave them the trace. The
bracelet's got a mass detector,
there's no way to beat that.
MICK
Did the cops ask you where you were
this morning, Val?
Val's slow at first, to register just what Mick's asking...
MICK (CONT'D)
Somehow, some way, Louis killed
Raul Levin. And it didn't show up
on the trace.
Mick looks at the plasma TV, then back at Val. Val reddens--
VAL
You better not be sayin' what I
think-- that I cut him loose-- to
let him kill Raul--?
MICK
Maybe you didn't know what he was
going to do--
VAL
(over, angry--)
You think I'd let that happen? For
a fuckin' TV?
And he lunges at Mick, shoves him back agains the van, Mick
shoves back, harder, backwards into the TV box-- it hits the
cement floor, hard, and Val falls on top of it--
Sickening snap/crunch from within the box--
VAL (CONT'D)
Shit, man--
MICK
Where'd you get the money for an
eight thousand dollar TV, Val?
75.
VAL
That's bullshit! I didn't do that!
How dare you say that to me-- I'm
inocente, man--
Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at
him from the ground.
VAL (CONT'D)
Get outa here; Get out of here,
Mick, and get outa my life!
Mick's already backing off-- towards the car--
VAL (CONT'D)
Keep going, man!
Mick keeps going-- down the drive and into his car-- CUT TO,
For air-- He can hardly breathe-- straightens his thoughts--
Takes the note from his pocket, studies it.
Mick and Ted, at the same time. As they move to the front...
TED
Morning, Haller. Word is, you had
interesting visitors last night...
90.
MICK
Worry about yourself, Ted. You're
dying the death of a thousand
razors up there and you don't even
know it.
They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits
for him. Before Louis can speak: Low--
MICK (CONT'D)
Listen, you little shit: This gun-
scheme of yours is about to blow
up, and I'm not going down for it.
If I have to drive people to the
airport the rest of my life.
Mick is seething. Louis smiles. Unruffled.
Louis waits on the steps, Mick comes out. Where they're
alone...
MICK
We've had an offer. Want to spend
six months in county jail?
100.
LOUIS
I told you from the beginning--
MICK
I know: The only verdict's Not
Guilty. Okay. We'll get there.
Grateful for this, Louis puts a hand on Mick's arm. But:
MICK (CONT'D)
Don't touch me, Louis. You want to
show your gratitude give me my gun
back.
Louis grins: meaning No way.
MICK (CONT'D)
I thought so.
(THEN)
You still sure you want me to put
you on the stand?
LOUIS
I insist on it.
MICK
Then get some rest tonight, you're
up next.
Leaving Louis, Mick continues down the steps, to where the
Lincoln waits. He gets in.
Mick steps past Ted on his way to his desk. As he passes--
TED
Did you talk to your client?
MICK
Yes. No deal.
101.
Ted feigns surprise-but-acceptance... While, TO THE JUDGE:
MICK (CONT'D)
The defense calls Louis Ross
Roulet, your honor.
It's the vast view from Mick's porch. He has a drink in his
hand. And holds a phone to his ear...
MAGGIE'S VOICE
There's a rumor in the office...
105.
MICK
How I'm the one who shot Raul?
Earl holds an umbrella over Mick, they hurry into the
building...
SOBEL catches up as MICK reaches the Lincoln. Stops him. They
move to beneath an overhang, where they're almost dry.
MICK
Please tell me you've got enough on
Louis for the murder of Renteria.
SOBEL
We will. We have the ticket.
MICK
What ticket?
SOBEL
The parking ticket, that Raul
found. That was the phone message
he left you...
(Sees Mick doesn't know)
Raul checked. Louis got one at a
meter outside the victim's place,
same time she was murdered.
MICK
What about Raul's murder? Do you
have him for that?
123.
SOBEL
No. We still don't know how he
could have slipped the tracer
anklet.
(before Mick can ask more)
Haller? Leave it alone.
He hesitates-- but goes. Into the rain. Gets into--
HAND-HELD, MICK in windbreaker, jogging... RAP continues...
As the "ROAD SAINTS"-- EDDIE, HARD-CASE, others-- pour out of
the bar, jump on their HARLEYS... ROAR OFF... inside which
the RINGING OF A PHONE brings us BACK TO--
Descending on the valley side...
Harleys pouring it on in formation, like fighter-jets...
She screeches to the curb, hops out... School bus stop, where
other parents wait, in cars, under umbrellas... Maggie rushes
forward, scans for the approaching bus... Nowhere in sight...
Stands there, with the SITTER... SEES the bus approaching...
TURNS ONTO DICKENS...
Out steps Hayley, safe into Maggie's arms. Sitter looks on as
Maggie hugs her... WHILE...
L.A.'s best weather: Smog-blue. The tree off Mick's porch.
Hayley's skinny legs climb nimbly from branch to branch.
From the angle, we can tell someone is watching her.
FADE OUT.
132.
FADE IN AGAIN, ANGLE, HAYLEY ON THE NEXT BRANCH, LATER
Lifts herself. Nimble. And so pretty. Watching is:
MICK - ON THE PORCH - WRAPPED UP IN A LOUNGE CHAIR
Recovering, but not fully there. MAGGIE SITS INTO FRAME
beside him.
MAGGIE
I didn't know you were awake.
He looks at her. Questioning.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
Don't worry, we haven't been living
here. We did, for a while. When you
were touch and go.
Mick. Returns his gaze to-- HAYLEY, going branch to branch.
MAGGIE (CONT'D)
I'd better get her down, she can
get hurt up there--
MICK
You can get hurt anywhere. Let her
climb.
An almost normal tone of voice. She smiles. CUT TO,
