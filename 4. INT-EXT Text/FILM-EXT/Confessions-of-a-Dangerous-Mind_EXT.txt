SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981
It's raining.
A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street.
This feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a
cigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in
St. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the
hotel room, and talks to someone off-camera.
ACTUAL BARRIS
It was 1981. I had holed myself up in
this New York hotel. Parker Hotel.
Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my
life.
INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
Ashamed?
What do you mean?
Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks,
occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed.
ACTUAL BARRIS
When you're young, your potential is
infinite. You might do anything, really.
You might be great. You might be
Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you
get to an age where what you might be
gives way to what you have been. You
weren't Einstein. You weren't anything.
That's a bad moment. But I remembered
something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no
life of a man, faithfully recorded, but
is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or
unrhymed." I realized my salvation might
be in recording my wasted life,
unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a
cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me
understand why.
It's sepia. Three year old Chuck, dressed somewhat girlishly
and sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a
pony by a photographer. His mother stands by anxiously as
the boy totters on the animal.
BARRIS (V.O.)
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in
1931, my early childhood remains
accessible to me only as a series of
elliptical, enigmatic memories.
A baby doll is set afire.
Young Barris dances around it.
BARRIS (V.O.)
The sickly sweet smell of a burning
babydoll on a crisp autumn day.
Young Barris rolling on the ground in battle with another
boy, as a crowd of children look on.
BARRIS (V.O.)
A constant, inarticulate rage leading to
fist fight after fist fight.
The other guy gets up, brushes himself off, orients himself,
and after a moment starts beating Barris again.
SUBTITLE: New Jersey Turnpike, 1955
A bus drives along. We see from the sign above the
windshield that it is bound for New York.
Young Barris, suitcase in hand, looks up at the impressive
building. People hurry by.
BARRIS (V.O.)
... I had heard that television was an
industry with a future.
Barris enters the building with resolve.
Barris walks through the crowds. A dark look in his eyes as
he follows some giggling teenage girls in poodle skirts.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
BARRIS (V.O.)
On weekends I used to hang around
amusement parks. Because that's where
the young girls were.
Penny leans on a signpost smoking a cigarette. Barris
emerges from the building with his cardboard set. He looks
grave. He approaches Penny.
PENNY
No?
BARRIS
(lighting up)
They bought it!
Penny screams, hugs Barris.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
They bought it they bought it they bought
it...
The two dance around on the street.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
They're giving me seventy-five hundred
fucking dollars to make a pilot!
PENNY
Oh my God!
Oh my God! We gotta go
celebrate!
Let's go roller skating!
Penny kisses Barris.
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:
BARRIS
I can't, Pen. I got a date.
PENNY
Okay.
That's cool.
Call me after.
BARRIS
Yeha, okay. I will.
Barris walks off.
We stay on Penny smoking her cigarette.
MUSIC IN: DATING GAME THEME

TOOTHY HOST GUFFAWING.
ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.)
I figured I was in. All I had to do was
get the pilot made and I'd be a
millionaire. Everyone would love me.
MUSIC OUT SUDDENLY.
ACTUAL BARRIS
(staring off)
Was anyone ever so young?
Barris knocks on the door. There is some movement inside and
a woman answers the door. This is older Tuvia, 20's,
attractive but a little hard-edged now. She balances a baby
on her hip
OLDER TUVIA
Yes?
(registers)
Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.
BARRIS
Hi, Tuvia.
Barris taken by the changes in Tuvia. The baby and the full,
milk-producing breasts get him excited.
OLDER TUVIA
What do you want?
BARRIS
I came by to apologize.
OLDER TUVIA
Okay then.
She closes the door.
He knocks again.
She opens the door.
OLDER TUVIA (CONT'D)
Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.
Now what do you want?
BARRIS
So I'm back in town. For a while.
I
thought maybe you and I could --
OLDER TUVIA
Jesus, you've got to be kidding.
Tuvia closes the door. Barris stands there for a moment,
considers knocking again, then turns and leaves.
We move along a park bench, past several homeless people, one
holding an old doll, others holding other sad items. We come
to Barris. He's wrapped in a horse blanket and holding the
miniature cardboard Dating Game set. An open notebook sits
on his lap. The pages are blank, except for one entry: The
Something Else Game. Barris holds a pen poised to write, but
doesn't.
28.
Barris sits on the curb, nursing his wounds.
Byrd exits the
bar and casually approaches.
BYRD
You're a pretty angry young fella, aren't
you? Can't fight worth a damn though.
BARRIS
Screw off, fag. Don't think I haven't
seen you watching me in that bar for a
week now.
BYRD
Kind of a loner, I'd say. Fairly bright.
A tad anti-social. Mad at the world.
Can I buy you lunch?
BARRIS
Look, there's a schoolyard half a block
down. Why don't you go trolling there?
Barris gets up and starts to walk away.
BYRD
I could teach you at least thirty
different ways to kill a man with a
single blow, Mr. Barris.
Barris stops.
BYRD (CONT'D)
Might help you in future bar fights.
Just a thought.
Barris just stands there.
BYRD (CONT'D)
Oh, and there's money in it.
Good money.
Barris turns.
29.
The place is ramshackle and overgrown.
It looks deserted.
A
barbed-wire fence surrounds it.
It's dark. Byrd sits on a step, smoking a cigarette.
Barris
approaches.
BARRIS
You're training me to be a killer.
BYRD
See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly
bright.
BARRIS
I can't kill people.
My future is in
television.
BYRD
Listen, you're thirty-two years old and
you've achieved nothing. Jesus Christ
was dead and alive again by thirty-three.
Better get cracking.
BARRIS
I have ideas for shows.
BYRD
Oh, good. Why don't you spend another
six months developing 'em while staring
out the window at mommy's house next to
poor dead Albert the dog.
BARRIS
How do you know all that?
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
BYRD
I know everything about you, Chuck. For
fuck's sake, I know which hand you jerk
off with.
Barris lifts his hands, tries to remember.
BYRD (CONT'D)
Right. Leave in the morning, if you
want. But I'm here to tell you this is
honest work for good pay. You'd be
helping to make the world safer. And
your country would be grateful.
Byrd rises, stubs out his cigarette in his hand.
BYRD (CONT'D)
It'll toughen you up.
Barris sits there staring into the blackness.
Several canvas dummies are propped up in the field. Barris
and other students slash at the dummies with big knives.
Barris and other students crawl on their bellies through mud.
The students with suitcases and in traveling clothes are
hugging and saying good-bye. The end of summer camp. A
tearful Barris heads toward one of the waiting buses. Byrd
pulls him aside, discusses something with him.
- DAY
SUBTITLE: MEXICO CITY, 1965
A commercial airliner comes in for a landing.
Renda is buying a newspaper at the kiosk. He completes the
transaction and takes a few steps with his paper. Barris
blocks his way, holding a phrase book and shaking.
BARRIS
Excusa me, por favor, Senor.
Renda stops.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros?
RENDA
No comprende.
Renda tries to get away from this pesky tourist.
Barris
follows him, calling after him.
BARRIS
Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares?
Renda picks up his pace, as does Barris.
Benitez approaches.
BENITEZ
May I be of some assistance here?
Renda appears relieved, until he feels the gun in his back.
37.
The car stops in a deserted field. Barris gets out first.
His shirt is soaked through with sweat. Suddenly there's a
commotion inside the car. Renda has gotten hold of a gun.
He shoots Brazioni and Benitez. Barris panics and dives
behind the car. Renda steps cautiously outside of the car,
looking for Barris. Barris grabs Renda's foot. Renda falls,
the gun flies from his hand. Barris kicks the gun under the
car, his own gun drawn. He points the gun at Renda, who is
on his stomach. Barris doesn't shoot. He's scared, shaking
wildly. Renda looks up at Barris, trying to figure him out.
He slowly rises to his feet, turns to Barris with a pleading
look in his eyes.
RENDA
Por favor. No me mates, senor.
Tengo
tres bebes.
Barris sucks in a deep gulp of air. His hand shakes.
He
pulls out Spansh-English dictionary.
BARRIS
Again.
RENDA
Que?
BARRIS
Repitolo.
Again.
RENDA
No me mates. Tengo tres bebes.
Barris flips through the dictionary. A church bell chimes,
startling Barris. His gun goes off accidentally and the
bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away.
Renda falls, but is still alive. He screams out of where his
mouth was. A wedding party emerges from the distant church.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
BARRIS
Oh Christ.
Oh crap.
Barris tries to stop Renda from screaming by covering the
hole in Renda's face. Barris throws up, some of it landing
on Renda's pants. He wipes his own mouth with his bloody
hand and looks at the still screaming Renda. The churchgoers
are starting to squint in Barris's direction. Barris shoots
Renda again. And again and again and again and again. More
blood spatters Barris's clothing and face. The church bell
continues to chime.
Renda's contorted face in close-up as he is shot.
Blood
spurting. Echoey church bells chime.
RENDA
No me mates. Yo tengo tres bebes.

The actual Barris being interviewed.
ACTUAL BARRIS
Sometimes as a younger man I stretched
the truth to get what I wanted. "Through
all the lying days of my youth/I swayed
my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now I
may whither into the truth." Yeats. You
heard of him?
INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
Yeah.
Of course.
ACTUAL BARRIS
Sure you have.
(beat)
Anyway, my little lie worked. We aired
and become a big hit. A phenomenon,
really.
SUBTITLE:
LONDON, 1967
It's all mod and colorful. Chuck Barris shuffles along,
taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple. The blonde
bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy. But it's clear she
thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention
whatsoever, walking about twenty feet in front of him and
Barris. Barris seems bored.
It's raining. A bored Barris, dressed normally, waits with
the fat bachelor under an umbrella near the entrance. The
fat bachelor checks his watch.
FAT BACHELOR
I thinks he's really pretty and I want to
be her boyfriend.
Barris, in wig and moustache, stands in the middle of the
empty, dark courtyard.
ENGLISHMAN
(loud whisper)
Here.
Barris approaches.
BARRIS
Do you have it?
ENGLISHMAN
Do you have it?
BARRIS
Sorry.
Yeah.
Barris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an
envelope. The Englishman takes it, opens it, pulls out a wad
of cash and counts.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you.
ENGLISHMAN
Just the same.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
The Englishman finishes counting the money, pockets it, and
hands Barris a box of Polaroid film.
BARRIS
Thank you.
Oh, one more thing.
Barris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and
jams it into the Englishman's mouth. The silencer breaks the
man's front teeth. The man makes a muffled grunt.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
Sorry about your teeth.
The Englishman's eyes are wide with terror. Barris pulls the
trigger three times. The back of the Englishman's head
explodes. Blood and hair and brain are spattered against the
church wall. The Englishman slumps to the ground. Barris
reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of
money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard
gate. There stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused.
After the initial shock, Barris smiles warmly.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
It's Ronnie, isn't it?
The fat bachelor nods.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
C'mere, Ronnie. I want to show you
something neat. It's okay.
The fat bachelor enters the courtyard.
ACTUAL BARRIS
I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I
did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor.
He was ugly and fat and stupid. More
life wouldn't have changed that for him.
No woman would ever have loved him.
That's just the brutal truth, y'know?
A plane lands.
Barris steps out of the terminal. A black limo pulls up.
The back door opens and Barris gets in.
ACTUAL BARRIS
The Newlywed Game was based on my theory
that almost any American would sell out
their spouse for a washer-drier or a
lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my
respect for that most holy of unions. I
must've been on to something, because the
show aired for thirteen years.
Barris speeds through the curvy streets of the Hollywood
Hills. Penny Pacino, dressed as a hippy, sits in the front
passenger seat.
SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD HILLS, 1969
PENNY
Great wheels, man.
BARRIS
Yeah, I decided to start treating myself
right. You spend so much time denying
yourself things. Life's too short.
PENNY
Yeah, I really gork what you're saying,
man.
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
BARRIS
You really grok what I'm saying, man.
Not gork.
PENNY
Oh.
(beat)
Really?
The car screeches to a halt in front of a fancy house with a
"For Sale, Open House" sign out front.
Barris pulls up in a Jaguar XKE convertible. A pretty,
innocent-looking young woman, Monica, is emerging with a big
laundry bag from the laundromat next to the liquor store.
She glances, momentarily, at the Jaguar and at Barris.
64.
ACTUAL BARRIS
Yeah, I remember that religious girl,
sure. Monica Something. Fleming. Oh
God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam
I ever experienced. It took a little
more work than usual, but I got in there,
baby.
(smacks lips, then stares off
into space)
It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get
old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam,
it just doesn't go away. This is the
great tragedy of getting old.
Barris leads a crying Monica down the garbage-strewn alley.
They find a doorway. Barris opens it.
BARRIS
Here we are.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
MONICA
(collapsing)
I can't I can't I can't I can't...
Barris supports her and leads her into the office.
BARRIS
It's okay.
It'll be okay.
Barris and Penny walk sadly through the garden.
PENNY
What a waste.
BARRIS
Tell me about it. I figure over the
years I must've spent close to twenty
grand on these abortions: airfare,
hotels, doctors, gifts.
PENNY
That's not what I meant.
BARRIS
And I don't even know how many of these
fetuses were mine. That's what really
kills me.
A SERIES OF SHOTS IN VARIOUS LOCALES OF MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN
WITH PAIN-ETCHED FACES, ADDRESSING THE CAMERA.
WOMAN #1
It was his.
WOMAN #2
Yeah.
It was his.
WOMAN #3
It wasn't his. I lied.
WOMAN #4
Yes, it was his baby.
WOMAN #5
Yeah.
WOMAN #6
The godamn son of a bitch.
He asked you
to ask me this?

WOMAN #7
I was screwing a lot of guys at the time.
It coulda been his.
WOMAN #8
Uh-uh. I just needed someone to pay for
it. He was a wallet with legs.
WOMAN #9
Yeah, I was just a kid.
It ruined my
life.
ACTUAL BARRIS
I don't really want to talk about this.
We hold on a silent Barris.
Barris and Penny walk in silence.
PENNY
So I'm assuming this means Monica is out
of the picture.
BARRIS
Yeah, I got baptized for nothing.
PENNY
Chuck, I was thinking... I have this
plan now, now that you're free --
BARRIS
God, you look cute today.
PENNY
I always look cute. Don't distract me.
What was I going to say?
BARRIS
I don't know.
PENNY
You do know.
(enthusiastically charged)
Chuck, why don't we get married? We've
known each other forever. We've fucked
each other forever. You think I'm cute,
you just said. You always come to me
when you're in trouble. And you're
almost forty, Chuck.
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
Barris turns violently toward Penny.
BARRIS
(shouting)
I know how old I almost am! That's it.
Don't ever ask me to marry you again!
PENNY
(quietly)
I won't.
The actual Barris puffs on his cigar.
ACTUAL BARRIS
I almost asked Penny to marry me right
then. But I didn't.
Barris pulls up, gets out of his car, and heads toward the
building.
A non-descript American car is parked on the quiet wooded
street. Barris pulls up in his Jaguar. He gets out of the
car, looks in the window of the empty American car.
BYRD (O.S.)
Over here, Strawberry-dick.
Barris looks over and makes out Byrd sitting on a rock with a
view of L.A. spread out in front of him. Barris joins him.
BARRIS
Jesus, how do you know these things?
BYRD
We even know what she actually thought it
tasted like.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
BARRIS
Really? I could never find that out.
What did she think?
BYRD
It's a "need to know", my friend.
So
tell me, what can I do you for?
BARRIS
I could really use an assignment, Jim.
To straighten my head.
BYRD
I got something for your head.
Barris and the Dating Game couple walk along. It's cold and
gray and they all wear heavy coats. The couple wear cameras
around their necks. Nobody looks happy.
Barris exits the apartment building in the clean clothes. We
see the East Berlin side of the wall in the background. A
car pulls up and Barris gets in.
A hollow-eyed Barris approaches the building that conceals
the tunnel entrance. Suddenly there's a commotion on the
quiet street. The shaving man is being led handcuffed out of
the building by two trench-coated men. They shove him into a
car. Barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest. He
glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment
building. Another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
The car drives away. Barris stops at the end of the block,
stares at the imposing wall.
BARRIS
I'm really, really fucked.
Another car pulls up next to him. Picard, a
serious-looking
Frenchman, sticks his head out the window.
PICARD
Get in.
BARRIS
What?
Who the hell are you?
PICARD
No time.
Get in or die.
Barris hesitates, gets in.
The car screeches off.
Picard's car stops at the curb. Picard and Barris emerge.
Picard opens the trunk. He lifts out a big folded-up clump
of rubber with a an engine mounted on it.
BARRIS
What the hell is that?
PICARD
Your ride, Monsieur Barris.
Picard unfolds the rubber mass. He pulls a cord and it
begins to inflate. It is an airplane, a one person
inflatable plane.
BARRIS
No fucking way.
PICARD
It's quite reliable and easy to operate.
It will get you over the wall. Or you
can stay here. In the German Democratic
Republic. I will arrange for you to get
a good factory job. No, you must fly,
like Daedalus before you, to the freedom
of the west.
BARRIS
Christ.
What about you?
PICARD
They do not catch me, monsieur. This is
my talent, to get away always. In
guerre. In amour. This is my talent,
and perhaps this is my curse.
The fully-inflated rubber plane flies down the street,
dipping and rising erratically. The noise is deafening.
Barris lies on his stomach and steers, looking petrified.
He
approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it.
The plane is shot by a soldier. Air hisses out.
Barris sits on a park bench.
Jim Byrd approaches, sits.
BYRD
(chuckling)
So, did you have a nice flight?
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
BARRIS
Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying.
BYRD
Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were
up to. You were there to kill Colbert,
they were there to kill you. I'm
thinking we got a mole. So much hate in
the world, Chuck.
BARRIS
Am I in danger still?
BYRD
Jesus, yes. KGB didn't go out of
business since yesterday, so far as I
know. You're fucked, Chuck. But our main
concern should be: if they know who you
are, they know who I am.
BARRIS
Fuck off.
What do we do?
BYRD
Bow out. Lay low. That's what I'm gonna
do. You're lucky you have another career
to immerse yourself in.
This is the same field where Renda was shot. Now, the
folksinging woman is in the field singing. Barris pulls out
a gun and aims it at the woman. Her eyes widen in terror,
but she keeps singing. A church bell chimes and Barris
shoots her. She flies back, spurting blood. Her guitar hits
the ground with a twang.
The actual Jamie Farr sits next to the pool. In the
background we see a couple of kids with enormous noses
splashing around in the water.
JAMIE FARR
Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy.
I think he was very saddened that the
public saw him as this sort of spastic
moron. I remember at the time I was
reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just
thrilled to have someone else in addition
to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff
with.
Barris pulls into the parking lot. As he waits for the valet
parking attendant to get to him, he adjusts the gun strapped
to his ankle.
The actual Barris puffs on his cigar.
ACTUAL BARRIS
The next day I heard Keeler offed
himself.
Keeler falls silently in slow motion from a very high window.
ACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.)
You never really know in the world of
espionage if something labeled a suicide
actually is a suicide. But he was dead.
That I knew.
Adult Tuvia answers the door with her baby.
BARRIS (V.O.)
Ripe Tuvia.
Barris looks down from the plane as Picard, on the ground,
runs after it.
PICARD
(yelling)
Fly, Daedalus, fly!
ACTUAL BARRIS
But as I stood there, I realized, I
couldn't kill Jim Brooks, the man who was
responsible for such good stuff: Mary
Tyler Moore, Rhoda, Cindy, Phyllis,
episodes of My Friend Tony. I loved
those shows as much as anybody in
America.
Barris makes his way down the crowded street. People stare,
turn their heads to gawk. We hear over and over again: "Hey,
isn't that Chuck Barris?" and "Hey, look, The Gong Show
guy!", and "Chuckie baby, Chuckie baby!" Barris smiles wanly
and nods. People shove paper and pen in his face and he
scribbles autographs without stopping. Sweat forms on his
brow. His polyester shirt is drenched.
BARRIS (V.O.)
She was right. What the hell had I done
with my life?
Among the fans on the street, Barris spots the fat bachelor
he killed in London. He sports a bullet hole in his head
Barris does a double take.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
Wait, you're that guy. You're dead.
This is screwy.
FAT BACHELOR
I only want to be loved.
BARRIS
That's all I fucking wanted!
Barris hurries away from the fat bachelor. He begins to spot
others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed,
bloody and disfigured. Crazy, angry-looking gonged Gong Show
contestants appear in the crowd with weapons. KGB agents in
trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, Day of the Dead
skeletons dance after him. Barris breaks into a run.
Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the
L.A. night sky. Barris dashes across the street, almost
getting hit by a car. He ducks down an alley to catch his
breath. As he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle-
aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light.
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Mr. Barris?
BARRIS
No, I'm...
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
My name is Louise Wechsler and I'm here
from Tulsa with my family and...
BARRIS
Please, I'm not feeling well.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Just a moment of your time. I love your
show. And, well, I, sort of, have a
talent myself.
BARRIS
You can stop by the office to audition
tomorrow.
The woman continues to approach.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Well, I'm leaving tomorrow and I was just
wondering. See, I dance a little and I
was just wondering --
There's no way out of this.
Barris sighs.
BARRIS
Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
Barris turns to face the woman, who's very close now. She
starts to dance around, sort of ballet-like, very badly.
Barris watches. She pirouettes, arms above her head.
BARRIS (CONT'D)
Very nice.
Something in her hand glints in the light. Barris
reflexively grabs her arm. It's an ice pick. The two
wrestle for it. The woman is extremely strong. Barris jams
the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. She staggers
back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. Barris leaps at her.
The two roll on the ground. The woman pins Barris. She
straddles him and is about to stab him through the air.
Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. The
middle-aged woman is a man. He screams in a distinctly male
voice. Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the
ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into
his brain. The assailant slumps over.
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED: (2)
Barris pushes the body off himself, kneels beside it, and
pulls off the wig. He gets up, shaking and heaving. He
looks at the body one more time, kicks it in the head with
all his might.
ACTUAL BARRIS
That was it. I just disappeared. The
network had to put The Gong Show into
reruns. It was 1981. I holed myself up
in this hotel in New York. Parker Hotel.
Barris and Patricia stand looking out at the harbor.
BARRIS
I hate myself for how I've lived, Treesh.
PATRICIA
Neitzsche said, "Whoever despises oneself
still respects oneself as one who
despises."
BARRIS
I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't
even despise myself with any insight.
PATRICIA
Insane asylums are filled with people who
think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few
have delusions of being the guy down the
block who works at an insurance company.
Wonder what that means.
BARRIS
Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I
wanted to write something that someday
some lesser person would quote. But I
never did. I'm the lesser person,
Treesh. I never said anything meaningful
that wasn't said by somebody else first.
I am disposable. I disposed of people
and I am disposable.
(beat)
You look cold.
Barris drapes his jacket over Patricia's shoulders.
PATRICIA
Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're
actually acting like a gentleman.

Barris kisses her.
She lets him.
PATRICIA (CONT'D)
Well, it's late. I should get going.
BARRIS
I suppose you still won't tell me where
you're staying.
PATRICIA
No.
But I'll show you.
She takes his hand.
They walk off.
Well-wishers, family, fans, photographers, reporters, and
passers-by are lined up on either side of a red carpet that
leads from the chapel to a limousine waiting at the curb.
Barris and Penny emerge from the chapel. Everyone cheers,
photos are snapped, rice and confetti are thrown, as the
happy newlyweds make their way to the limo, Barris spots a
pinky-ringed hand in the crowd holding a gun. Barris pushes
Penny toward the white limo. The driver stands there holding
the door open. Barris shoves Penny in, then screams at the
driver.
BARRIS
Drive, Danny! Now!
Barris jumps in the car, the driver slams the door closed,
hurries around the driver's door and gets in. The car peals
away from the cab.
The actual Barris is being interviewed.
ACTUAL BARRIS
Y'know, I came up with a new game show
idea recently. It's called The Old Game.
You got three old guys with loaded guns
on stage They look back at their lives,
see who they were, what they
accomplished, how close they came to
realizing their dreams. The winner is
the one who doesn't blow his brains out.
He gets a refrigerator.
The camera holds on Barris's face as he puffs a cigar.
BLACK.
