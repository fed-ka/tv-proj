A long, rectangular cardboard box.
SUPER: "NEW YORK CITY"
ANGLE ON:
RENE RICARD (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a
notebook. He's a raggedy dandy: A poet in a hooded sweatshirt and
white hightops.
As he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity.
RENE (CONT'D)
(sighing theatrically)
In this town one is at the mercy of the
recognition factor. One's public
appearance is absolute.
Beyond him, a HAND gropes its way out of the box. It tosses a can
of YOOHOO chocolate drink.
RENE (CONT'D)
I consider myself a metaphor of the public.
I am a public eye. I am a witness.
A HEAD appears from the box. It's Jean's.
Jean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urban
park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good
and bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box in
which he has spent the night. There's something about the way
that he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost
surprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just a
subtle hint of him coming out of a dream.
He squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face.
His hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of blue
jeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered
Wesleyan University T-shirt, and the inside lining of an
overcoat. His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. He's
stylish.
He shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a
small book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. and
a cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking
tape.
Jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the
sky:
SUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY - STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFER
Jean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmering
sunlight.
DISSOLVE TO:
Rene grabs the box for use as a desk and continues to speak out
loud as he writes.
RENE (CONT'D, O.S.)
Part of the artist's job is to get the work
where I will see it.
As he speaks, we see Jean pass the wall of a funeral parlor. He
spraypaints: "SAMO AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOD"
RENE (CONT'D, O.S.)
When you first see a new picture, you don't
want to miss the boat. You have to be very
careful because you may be staring at Van
Gogh's ear.
Jean signs his words with his 'logo', a triple pointed crown.
As he presses the spray can, we HEAR the roar of a breaker.
CUT TO:
INSERT: CLOSEUP OF SIDEWALK
Pressed into the concrete is a pair of EYEGLASSES. A light-
colored piece of rock completes the picture to make a face.
JEAN'S POV: His shoes pause next to the face in the concrete.
CUT TO:
IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT
Is a METAL BILLBOARD with red plastic magnetized LETTERS that
reads: "TODAY'S SPECIAL: CLAM CHOWDER $1.50. TRY IT!!!"
CUT TO:
The sign. It now reads: "SAMO'S DAY OLD TEETH $5.00"
CUT TO:
They stand outside, not knowing quite what comes next.
Jean gives Benny a look (i.e. 'scram').
BENNY
Catch you later.
Benny leaves.
A CHILLY WIND picks up.
Jean's mood is suddenly downcast.
They button up their overcoats, about to leave.
GINA
What's a job, anyway?
(pause)
What's wrong with you?
The truth is, he feels awful for causing Gina's trouble, but
shows it by moping like a child.
GINA (CONT'D)
No, don't tell me - you just got fired by
your crazy boss.
BASQUIAT
I guess you did.
GINA
Guess I just got sick of him.
BASQUIAT
Can I walk you home?
GINA
I think I could do that alone.
Gina walks away.
He runs after her.
BASQUIAT
Wait, I'm in a band....We're at the Mudd
Club on Halloween. I'll put you on the
list.
Gina turns and looks back at Jean.
GINA
I hate the Mudd Club.
He catches up to her.
Gina notices a dead leaf in his hair and picks it out.
GINA (CONT'D)
Have you been camping? You could use a
scrub.
BASQUIAT
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I
don't know why, I just do!
He leans forward, offering his neck.
GINA
(smelling)
You do! You definitely do.
BASQUIAT
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
GINA
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
BASQUIAT
Party girls? Can I call you?
GINA
(teasing him)
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477-0496.
He writes her number on his pant cuff with a big fat magic
marker.
BASQUIAT
Here, this is for you. I made this.
He hands her the small speaker.
She takes it.
GINA
Thanks.
She admires the speaker watches him walk off.
We see Jean crossing a lawn outside a mental hospital.
HIGH, WIDE ANGLE
It's raining heavily. Jean motions for Gina to wait under the
entrance. He tries to hail a cab... And another. And another.
A parade of them passes, but each time they slow down, they get a
glimpse of Jean and drive off.
Finally, Gina steps out of the entrance. She raises her hand, and
a car pulls over instantly.
Through a steamy, rain-wet window, we see Jean and Gina seated at
a table, dining.
They seem to be having a nice time.
Gina lays in bed. Daylight streams into the apartment.
Jackhammers RATTLE outside. (Music: REGGAE SONG - Errol
Scorcher's "Cockroach in de Corner.")
EXTREME CLOSEUP
A cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into
the kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a
drawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box.
Jean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean
tears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and
bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach.
He's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can.
Someone POUNDS furiously at the door.
Ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the
piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a
symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.
LANDLADY
Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please!
He gets up and peeks through the security hole. He sees a middle-
aged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door. He opens it.
LANDLADY (CONT'D)
Ohhh, Dios mio!
She stares at him levelly.
LANDLADY (CONT'D)
I just want the rent.
BASQUIAT
Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep!
Jean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him. He
hands it to the landlady. It's a a little shack with a big head
next to it that says "'Here' For Rent."
The landlady looks at him like he's crazy. She balls up the
drawing and puts it in her pocket.
Gina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. The landlady's
trapped between them.
GINA
(to Jean)
What're you doing?
The landlady wags her finger at Gina.
LANDLADY
Next Monday.
Gina and Jean look amused as they watch her leave.
BASQUIAT
Wanna go get some breakfast?
GINA
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a
little work installing a show in a gallery.
He's an electrician. I was supposed to be
there an hour ago.
She looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor.
GINA (CONT'D)
Ohh, that's nice.
Jean kisses her neck as she looks at the drawing.
We HOLD on the drawing.
The ART WORLD CROWD fills the gallery. Jean lurks across the
street, watching through the window.
Cabs and limousines line the block. A crowd outside blocks the
street.
Jean's obviously impressed, jealous and estranged -
he feels
entitled to all this.
He crosses the street to get a closer look.
THROUGH THE WINDOW
He sees Albert Milo
talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNO
BISCHOFBERGER. Andy,
of course, is thin, silver-haired, and
nearly albino. Bruno
is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's. He exudes
money - a pillar of
security.
On the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a
coterie of young, mostly BLACK AND HISPANIC MALES. Rene looks
drunk, enjoying the moment, holding court.
Rene crosses to Albert and Andy.
People pass by.
Jean starts to walk.
About half a block away, he sprays on a wall:
"THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE BOW LIKE THIS WITH THE BIG MONEY ALL
CRUSHED INTO THESE FEET"
He looks pleased. He turns and looks up West Broadway beyond the
buildings at the sky:
SUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY
We see a surfer emerging from a HUGE WAVE. He looks powerful and
exalted.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON: A wall. We see the following graffity:
"JIMMY BEST ON HIS BACK TO THE SUCKERPUNCH OF HIS CHILDHOOD
YEARS"
A basketball bounces against a wall.
Jean and Benny amble onto a basketball court. Jean's changed his
hairstyle. Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head.
Benny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a
cigarette. He doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy.
Benny throws the ball to Jean. It bounces off a puddle and
splashes Jean.
BENNY
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette.
Concentrate.
BASQUIAT
I am... On Gina.
(beat)
Fuck - I didn't think we were actually
gonna do this.
BENNY
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
Jean shoots. It flies up, up, up -
and over the backboard.
He runs after the ball, gets it, and dribbles clumsily.
BENNY
You're shattering all my myths.
BASQUIAT
About what?
BENNY
Your people.
BASQUIAT
Oh - you mean black people!
He shoots and misses again. He throws it to Benny, who does a
picture-perfect lay-up.
BASQUIAT (CONT'D)
(changing the subject)
How long do you think it takes to get
really famous?
During the following, Benny performs a series of amazing shots
while Jean looks on admiringly.
BENNY
For a musician or a painter?
Jean shrugs.
BASQUIAT
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your
stuff all day without thinking about
anything else.
BENNY
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
He shoots. Swish.
BENNY (CONT'D)
First, you have to dress right.
He shoots again. Swish.
BENNY (CONT'D)
Then, you have to hang out all the time -
with famous people - the right people, the
right chicks, the right parties.
He shoots again. Swish.
BENNY (CONT'D)
And you gotta do your work all the time
when you're not doing that. The same kinda
work, the same style - over and over
again, so people recognize it and don't get
confused. Then, once you're famous, you
have to keep doing it the same way, even
after it's boring - unless you want people
to really get mad at you - which they will
anyway.
Benny tosses Jean the ball. Jean walks off the court.
BASQUIAT
Come on. I hate this. I'm no good at it.
Jean shoots the ball and keeps walking. The ball goes in. He
doesn't notice. Benny runs after it.
Benny and Jean walk along. Benny dribbles.
BENNY
Famous people are usually pretty stupid.
You're too smart. You'd get bored to death.
You don't wanna be like John Henry -
fighting the machine. Just do what you do.
It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
BASQUIAT
Who's John Henry?
BENNY
Oh man! Folklore guy - worked on the
railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and
laying down track. Then one day they
invented a machine to do it. And he says
"Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges
the machine to a race to lay down a mile of
track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the
whole time. They get right to the end, and
he beats it by one spike.
(pause)
Got a cigarette?
BASQUIAT
So then what?
BENNY
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like
you do it! Your friends like you, you get
laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff
everywhere. It's good. What else do you
want?
They watch a long stretch limo cruises up across the street.
BASQUIAT
Like I said - my liquid hijack Marlboros.
(indicates limo)
Check it out.
The LIMO DRIVER opens the back door. Andy Warhol and Bruno
Bischofberger step out.
BASQUIAT (CONT'D)
Andy Warhol. He's famous and he's not
boring.
INSERT: AN IMAGE OF ANDY'S PAINTINGS AT THE WHITNEY MUSEUM
(FOOTAGE FROM JONAS MEKAS FILM)
Jean scrounges in his pockets, pulls out his Xerox cards, and
readies himself as Bruno and Andy enter BALLATO'S RESTAURANT.
BENNY
What're you doing? You're doing something.
BASQUIAT
He's the best painter in the world. I'm
gonna give him one of these.
BENNY
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's
worth a lot. Trade. That's what real
artists do with each other. Besides, he'll
just use you. He's famous for that.
Benny watches Jean crosses the street. Jean passes the limousine.
Inside, the driver (a 24-year old Rasta) takes a hit from a joint
and watches Jean.
CLOSE ON
The driver's eyes.
CUT TO:
DRIVER'S POV:
He watches Jean cross the street.
Jean enters the restaurant.
Jean and Benny are outside the entrance to Gina's building. Jean
carries two huge bags overflowing with groceries and flowers. He
buzzes. There's no answer.
BASQUIAT
I'll be right back.
He produces a key and lets himself in.
He enters the building.
Jean rejoins Benny in front of Gina's building.
As they're leaving, Gina comes up the street.
BASQUIAT
(to Benny)
Check you later, man.
BENNY
Hi Gina.
GINA
Hi.
INT - GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY
Flowers and groceries are strewn on the counter.
FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN:
Over the following MONTAGE we HEAR:
RENE (O.S.)
... 'APT 20'... The church bells would ring
at noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes:
How many times we counted them.
We called our bed the cloud.
And there we'd float.
The bathtub was in the kitchen
and took forever to fill up.
We'd bathe together afterwards.
Oh the countless cigarettes and
take out Chinese food...
The bed was so narrow
Three years we made it fit.
The sheets were green the
sheets were pink the sheets
white linen from the past.
Little home, farewell,
The broken windows
and the bodega on the corner.
Now from my balcony
I look out over all New York...
Jean and Benny walk along, sharing a beer in a brown paper bag.
They approach a DRUG DEALER and exchange money for dope.
Jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and
carries it with him.
They sit down on a stoop. Jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties
the dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines. He hands
the rolled up bill to Benny, who snorts the line.
Benny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, as
though the dope burned a hole in his sinus.
BENNY
We got beat.
BASQUIAT
For real?
Jean takes a taste with his finger... He tastes his tongue and
makes a face..
He snorts part of his line, anyway, to make sure.
He frowns.
They continue onwards. Jean still carries the window.
BENNY
You gonna carry that around all night?
BASQUIAT
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
BINOCULARS POV
We watch as Rene looks frantically for Jean, but can't spot him.
Finally he sees Jean's hair-do bobbing up and down a block away.
He runs towards it.
RENE
Hey, wait up!!!
Huffing and puffing, he catches up.
RENE
You heard of Albert Milo. I made
that
niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't
you read
"Not About Albert Milo?" I know
who to
hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a
star.
BASQUIAT
Can you put me in the ring with him?
RENE
I can put you in the ring with him. Even
book the dates.
(beat)
But those big boys know how to fight. They
could make you look real sissy.
(they laugh)
I was looking at that painting upstairs.
It's the first time a picture made me
embarrassed to own anything.
(beat)
So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
BASQUIAT
Jean Michel Basquiat.
They shake hands.
RENE
Sounds famous already.
It stops in front of the gallery. From outside, we see Annina
conversing on the phone. She looks up and opens the door for him.
Jean leans on a fire hydrant, eating a Big Mac.
A pink scarf blows on the wind right in front of his face. He
catches it.
A BOMBSHELL BLONDE arrives with her hand outstretched to retrieve
it.
BIG PINK
How can I ever thank you?
BASQUIAT
(with a smile)
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
He offers her a Big Mac.
BIG PINK
Come on.
BASQUIAT
Wanna Mac?
BIG PINK
No, I'd like the scarf.
BASQUIAT
Have a Mac.
BIG PINK
I don't eat junk food.
BASQUIAT
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the
best restaurant in town.
(beat)
You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the
scarf, anyway. What's your name?
BIG PINK
You're a fast mover.
BASQUIAT
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big
Pink.
A man sleeping on the ground with a beehive of paper bags on his
head and three overcoats sticks out into the sidewalk.
Jean leaves the McDonald's bag near his head as he walks down the
street with the girl.
Jean walks down the street. He's got on a new set of clothes and
he listens to a Walkman. We HEAR Miles Davis' "Flamenco
Sketches."
JEAN'S POV
We MOVE down Prince St. and take a left on West Broadway. We
approach a huge crowd. We get closer and closer until we are
immersed in it.
The crowd realizes Jean's amongst them. People start approaching
him. Someone removes the headphones.
The DIN of the crowd replaces the music. Amongst the normal crowd
chatter, we hear friends' calling out:
VOICES IN CROWD
Jean!!! Jean Michel!!!
The CAMERA rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows
Jean as he makes his way toward the street.
We begin to DISSOLVE into a MONTAGE of stills of ARTISTS:
RENE (O.S.CONT'D)
The picture a mother's son does in jail
hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is
possible even in the most wretched. And
this is a much different idea than the
fancier notion that art is a scam and a
rip-off. But you could never explain to
someone who uses God's gift to enslave that
you have used God's gift to be free."
Jean enters a waiting limo. It pulls away from the curb.
Rene finishes as the limo threads its way through the night-lit,
twinkling city.
A cheap pharmacy gift shop window. Jean and Andy look in on two
yellow furry stuffed ducks which are part of a larger display.
ANDY WARHOL
When I was little, my brother and I used to
have two ducks as pets. We called them the
Rodriguez Brothers.
They walk into a beauty salon.
They walk out of the beauty salon..
Jean sees the back of a girl. She looks a lot like Gina.
BASQUIAT
Ouch..
ANDY WARHOL
What's wrong?
BASQUIAT
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend
Gina.
ANDY WARHOL
Do you still love her?
BASQUIAT
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about
her.
ANDY WARHOL
Well, have you asked her to come back?
Jean shakes his head `no,' sorry that he didn't.
Jean rides his bicycle through the park. He's looking up at the
birds flying in the trees.
ANGLE ON
The birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we
have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign.
The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees.
Jean presses a buzzer. He's admitted. He carries his bike on his
shoulder.
Shenge hands Andy a box.
Andy opens the box. Inside is a football helmet with Jean's
dreadlocks glued to the outside.
CLOSE UP: Andy in mirror wearing helmet.
CUT TO:
INSERT
The screen is filled with the cover of the New York Times
Magazine. Jean is featured on the cover, without his dreadlocks.
Drugged, upset, Jean leaves the party.
He opens a limo door and looks back at his house. The party
continues.
The limo drives off.
We HOLD on Jean's building.
Jean disappears around the corner.
ANGLE ON
THREE KIDS in the process of prying a door panel with crowbars.
We see that they're removing one of Jean's SAMO pieces from a
wall. We read:
"PAY FOR SOUP
BUILD A FORT
SET IT ON FIRE"
Jean arrives behind them.
BASQUIAT
What's up?
KID #1
Mind your own fuckin' business.
BASQUIAT
(recognizing his work)
That's mine.
KID
That ain't yours, man. Some asshole named
SAMO did this.
KID#3
He's dead. That's what I heard.
KID #2
He ain't dead yet. He's gonna kill himself.
That's why all those art fags in Soho are
paying more every time we bring one of
these in.
KID #1
Stupid SAMO... Hardly any of this shit
left.
The panel is almost pried free without a scratch.
KID #3
This one's damn nice. I say we hang onto it
if he's almost dead.
Jean shoves his way in front with a magic marker and adds a
couple words; now it reads:
"SAMO IS DEAD"
BASQUIAT
There you go. Now it's worth more.
The kids are outraged, thinking Jean's ruined their find.
They jump on him.
They beat the shit out of him.
They're done.
Jean lies curled up on the ground, trying to talk.
KID #2
What's he saying?
BASQUIAT
I'm SAMO... I'm SAMO...
KID #3
(bending close)
He says he's SAMO.
Kid #1 whacks him in the back once more for good measure.
KID #1
He wish.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SEA
It is flat, dead, gray.
Ominous and waiting.
Jean walks out of the gift shop (seen earlier, next to
beautician's)
Jean walks through the middle of the intersection. He carries two
yellow, furry toy ducks under his arm.
SUPER: "FEBRUARY 22, 1987"
Seeing Bruno at the wheel of a black Mercedes stopped at a light,
Jean clowns around like a street vendor who wants to wash his
window.
Bruno doesn't notice him.
BASQUIAT
B.B. It's me - Jean! What's the matter? No
snow in Switzerland this year?
BRUNO
I didn't see you.
BASQUIAT
What do you mean?
BRUNO
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
The light changes.
Bruno pulls across the street because of the traffic.
Jean drops one of the ducks in the street and walks off.
ANGLE ON
The duck lying in the street.
The "OUT FOR RIBS" sign hangs outside Jean's door.
Mary sits in her limo trying to call Jean.
Jean buzzes the doorbell. He's wearing the clogs. He's hurting.
The intercom comes on.
BASQUIAT
Hello? Gina?
MALE VOICE
Who is it?
Jean recognizes Benny's voice.
ANGLE UP
Gina and Benny look out the window into the street.
Jean's a block away.
Jean gets out of a cab. He walks up to the entrance.
The doors are locked. He rattles them.
Inside, an OLD JANITOR keeps mopping.
Jean pounds harder, RATTLES the doors more.
BASQUIAT
Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second.
Open the door.
The janitor gets nervous. He leaves.
He returns a moment later with a large SECURITY GUARD.
BASQUIAT
Open up! Open up!
The guard unlocks the door, hoping to settle Jean down.
BASQUIAT (CONT'D)
My mother's inside.
GUARD
Come back tomorrow. Visiting hours are
over.
(beat)
Don't cause any trouble.
BASQUIAT
I'm not here to visit... I wanna take her
home.
The guard gently ushers Jean out through the door.
GUARD
Don't cause any trouble.
He locks the door and walks off with the janitor.
Jean, walks around, drifting, stoned. He looks up at the skyline.
DISSOLVE TO:
Waves crash silently over a surfer.
FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN:
STREET SOUNDS
BENNY (O.S.)
Willie Mays.
FADE IN:
MORNING
Jean has been passed out on a sidewalk.
CLOSE ON: Benny's face.
He leans over Jean and helps him up.
BASQUIAT
Willie Mays... Nice to see you.
Benny looks at Jean's eyes.
Jean stretches, kicking life back into his limbs.
BASQUIAT (CONT'D)
How's Gina? You guys getting along?
Benny looks at him guiltily.
BENNY
She's good.
BASQUIAT
I guess it was a long time ago.
BENNY
Come on, let's get out of here.
Jean and Benny zoom along in a battered old Army Jeep. Now
revived, Jean stands up, waving at people miming General Patton.
We HEAR the music of "Summer of Siam."
BENNY
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
BASQUIAT
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
BENNY
Drugs??!
BASQUIAT
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking
care of my health!
The villagers cease their activities as they listen to the SOUND.
Looking up, they smile, as if warmed to their souls by some
unearthly and intangible substance. They look heavenwards.
CAMERA follows their collective gaze skywards.
We shoot up, up, into the sky.
BASQUIAT (O.S.)
There was this little prince with a magic
crown. An evil warlock kidnapped him,
locked him in a cell in a huge tower and
took away his voice. There was a window
made of bars. The prince would smash his
head against the bars hoping that someone
would hear the sound and find him. The
crown made the most beautiful sound that
anyone ever heard. You could hear the
ringing for miles. It was so beautiful,
that people wanted to grab the air. They
never found the prince. He never got out of
the room. But the sound he made filled
everything up with beauty.
BASQUIAT (O.S)
It's definitely time to get out of here.
We rush down, down through the sky.
Buildings come up at us.
We're over Soho.
We're back on the ground.
Benny and Jean continue walking.
We see Jean from behind. He's looking up.
Benny stops to readjust his parcels.
Jean continues down the street, talking louder.
BASQUIAT (CONT'D)
Hawaii? Fuck Hawaii. Let's go to Ireland.
We'll stop in every bar and have a drink.
