          FADE IN:


  11EXT.  ND LOCATION - DAY

          OVER BLACK we HEAR the SOUND of the SURF.  At least we
          think it's the surf.  The UNIDENTIFIED IMAGES begin to
          FLASH through the blackness, REVEALING a VIOLENT STRUGGLE. 
          ONE, TWO, maybe more, INDIVIDUALS in a life or death FIGHT. 
          We don't HEAR any VOICES, just GRUNTS and GROWLS, MOANS
          and the sense of VIOLENCE.  RAW VIOLENCE.  As the IMAGES
          BUILD in SPEED and INTENSITY, it culminates in a

          SUPER LOUD WHOOSH

          to BLACK, as we HEAR...

                                        WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Wake up sleepy-head!  Breakfast
                        is ready!


  22INT.  MAIYA'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

          Somebody is sleeping on a couch, covered by a blanket. 
          As the blanket is slowly thrown back, we see JOHNNY.  He
          sits up, still in his clothes.

          For a moment he's lost in the dream, can't place where he
          is.  An attractive woman in her mid-30s, MAIYA, comes out
          of the kitchen.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                                (looking around)
                          I forgot where I was.  Like a
                        dream.

          Johnny notices about a dozen child-like drawings tacked
          up around the room.  Not bad for a kid.  Maiya appears
          with a cup of coffee and hands it to him.

                                        MAIYA
                        What was it about?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        What?

                                        MAIYA
                        Your dream.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Johnny's Ladder" - TEASER - 7/24/05 - BLUE-2 2.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        I can't remember.
                                (re: his clothes)
                        I must have been pretty tired.

                                        MAIYA
                        It was after 2 when you got here. 
                        I can't thank you enough.

          There's a real connection here.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Listen, Maiya, the phone calls in
                        the middle of the night, the hang
                        ups, it has to be your ex-husband,
                        right?  Which means he knows where
                        you are.

          Maiya, clearly upset, reflects for a moment.

                                        MAIYA
                          Remember how I always used to say
                          I wanted an unconventional life,
                        to live on the edge?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Sounds like Cole's a little too
                        edgy.

          Maiya overcome, fights tears.

                                        MAIYA
                        How did I get into this mess?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        You can't blame yourself.

                                        MAIYA
                        Cole was... he turned into somebody
                        I don't even know.  The things he
                        did... I had to get away from
                        him.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        If he violates the restraining
                        order, you can have him sent to
                        jail.

                                        MAIYA
                        What about Siena?  He's her father. 
                        What's it going look like if I
                        have him sent to prison?

                        The main thing is that you two
                        are safe.

                                        MAIYA
                        He said he'd never let me take
                        his daughter away.

          A little girl, SIENA, 6, comes running out into the
          kitchen, her ever-present crayons and drawing pad in tow. 
          She's an old soul in the body of a child.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Good morning.

                                        SIENA
                        Why did you come over in the middle
                        of the night?

          Johnny and Maiya exchange a look, it's clear she doesn't
          want to worry her daughter.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                                (spots the eggs)
                        I had a craving for your mom's
                        world famous mushroom omelette. 
                        Hungry?

                                        SIENA
                                (sitting down to draw)
                        I have things to do.  Bet you
                        don't know all the things there
                        are to do in Maine.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        I bet I do.  I bet I've done them.

          Siena shows Johnny her drawings of each activity.

                                        SIENA
                        We're going blueberry picking. 
                        And lobstering.  And... Have you
                        ever found buried treasure?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        That one I missed.

          Siena flips to a DRAWING of a MAN AND A LITTLE GIRL UNDER
          A PALM TREE.

                                        SIENA
                        My daddy told me about how he was
                        going to take me to look for it
                          someday.  In the Land of Gold.

          Maiya, uncomfortable at the mention of Cole, deflects.

                                        MAIYA
                                (nickname)
                        Okay, Picasso, let's get this

          Siena runs out of the room, Maiya eyes her, worried.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        You're doing the right thing.

          She touches his face.

                                        MAIYA
                          I really missed you.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Me too.

                                        MAIYA
                        Finish your breakfast, you can
                        lock up.

          Maiya grabs a hand-crocheted scarf and starts to wind it
          around her neck.

          Maiya rethinks the scarf, unwinds it, drops it on the
          kitchen counter.  Siena runs past them like a bullet.

                                        SIENA
                        Bye!

            Johnny/Desmond smiles as Maiya waves and heads out after
          Siena.

          ON JOHNNY, standing at the window, watching them go.

          POV through window as Siena gets in the back of her mom's
            distinctively funky car (i.e., a lime green vintage Beetle)
          and they pull out of the driveway, then we suddenly FLASH

                        Hello?

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:

                        Still sleeping?  I guess I can't
                        blame you after last night. 
                        Listen, John, I could really use
                        your help on something.


  66INT.  WALT'S OFFICE - DAY

            Mid-conversation as WALT is filling Johnny in.

                                        WALT
                        This guy came by earlier to file
                          a complaint, seems an old
                        girlfriend of his is being stalked
                        by her ex-husband.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (aside)
                        Must be an epidemic.

                                        WALT
                        How's that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Know anything about the ex?

                                        WALT
                        He's a pretty rough character. 
                        Weapons conviction, assault, he's
                        got a restraining order filed
                        against him.  Plus there's an
                        ugly custody battle. I put an APB
                        out on the guy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But you want to make sure he
                        doesn't find the ex-wife first.

                                        WALT
                        The guy who reported her missing
                        hasn't been able to get in touch
                        with her since this morning.

                                        WALT
                          Roscoe's got a photograph of the
                        missing woman.  I was able to get
                        the guy to drop off something of
                        hers for you to touch.

          Walt pulls a familiar looking SCARF out of his desk drawer. 
          Johnny's expression shifts as he recognizes it.  As he
          grabs the scarf, he's suddenly--

                        I spent last night at her house.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                          I checked the blueberry farms and
                        there was no sign of Maiya or her
                          daughter.  They mentioned the

  1010EXT. DOCK - DAY

          Bruce and Johnny walk down the dock.

                                        BRUCE
                        How well do you know this woman?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We went to college together.  But
                        it's all a little blurry.  Feels
                        like a lifetime ago.

                                        BRUCE
                        Was it something special?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure.  She asked me to
                        come over last night.

                                        BRUCE
                        After the birthday party?

                                        JOHNNY
                        She was getting these phone calls
                        in the middle of the night.  Might
                        be her ex-husband.

                                        BRUCE
                        Sounds like a real mess.

          Bruce continues to smile at him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why are you smiling like that?

                                        BRUCE
                        Am I smiling?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, and it's starting to creep
                        me out.

                                        BRUCE
                        You want me to stop?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I do.

          Bruce stops smiling.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

                                        BRUCE
                          Whatever you say.

          Johnny shows Bruce the photo of Maiya.

                                        BRUCE
                        She's pretty.

          Johnny drops the photo, as he reaches down to pick it up,
          he loses his balance, grabs onto a piling on the dock to
          steady himself--

                                                                      WHITE FLASH TO:

          Johnny as Desmond, and Maiya, looking younger, walk hand
          in hand down the dock, laughing.  They sit on the dock
          next to the piling, looking out at the water.

                                        MAIYA
                          I wonder where all those boats
                        are sailing off to.  Wish I was
                        on one of them.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Where do you want to go?

                          Nowhere. Everywhere.  Make it up
                        as I go along.

          She looks right at him.

                                        MAIYA
                        Come with me.

                        What?

                                        MAIYA
                        There's something special about
                        you.  I see it in your eyes.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Me? I'm the least special person
                        in this whole college.

                                        MAIYA
                        Don't do the safe thing.  Do
                          something amazing with your life. 
                        Go on instincts, feelings--

            Johnny/Desmond grabs her impulsively, kisses her.  On the
            movie-perfect romantic moment,

                                        MAIYA
                        Wow.

          As she kisses him back,

                        I was here.  With Maiya.

                        It's like this whole chunk of my
                        life doesn't exist.  It's like
                        she knew who I was.  Like we had
                        this connection.

                                        BRUCE
                        She sounds perfect.

                        She feels perfect.

          Again, he looks at Bruce.

                        The doctors told me coma patients
                        lose memories, but why is all
                        this coming back to me now? 

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, why now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't you have something else you
                        need to do?

                                        BRUCE
                        Not a thing.  I'm all yours.

          He smiles at him again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Great.  Guess I'm saddled with

                        Guess so.

            Johnny/Desmond opens the door to find Maiya's Ex, COLE. 
          He's got an edgy energy to him.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Can I help you?

          Cole stares at Johnny for a long, uncomfortable beat.

                                        COLE
                        Where's Maiya?

                        You the new boyfriend?

                        I know who you are.  You need to
                        stop calling here in the middle
                        of the night.

                                        COLE
                          I didn't.  But I bet you did, to
                        scare her into asking you to come
                        over.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        That's crazy.

                        her.  She told me.

          DESMOND, African-American, 34, stands there.  His hand is
          bandaged and his face bruised.  He gives Johnny the once-

                        to reach her all day.

          Johnny looks wary, gestures towards the lawn.

                        There was a guy--big blond dude?

                        might be able to help.

                        hers to touch.

          Johnny eyes his surroundings -- weird, he was just here,
          but somehow it all feels different.

                        I was here last night.

          He seems unsure even as the words leave his mouth.

                        She called me.  She was afraid
                        Cole had followed her.

                                        DESMOND
                        That's strange.

                        She called me, too.  I came over
                        and spent the night on the couch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You slept on the couch?

                        Then this morning, after she and
                        Siena left, Cole shows up.

                        What happened?  Why am I in a
                          hospital bed.

                                        SARAH
                        You're in the hospital, Johnny. 
                        You were hurt.

          Bruce gestures as if to say, 'there ya go!'.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't understand.  I keep seeing
                        the same things, but from different
                          perspectives.  It's like I'm stuck
                        in...

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (it hits him)
                        In a vision.  It's like I'm in
                        some kind of... vision loop.

                                        BRUCE
                        How do you get out?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  I just don't know.

          Off this bizarre moment, we...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT ONE          DEAD ZONE: "Johnny's Ladder" - ACT TWO - 7/22/05 - WHT-2 17.

  2727EXT.  MAIYA'S HOUSE/HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          Pick up as an incredulous Johnny stares at Sarah holding
          Vision Johnny's hand.  Bruce is here too.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If I really am trapped in a vision,
                        this conversation has to be part
                        of it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Makes sense... I guess.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, just keep listening to
                        the sound of my voice.  You were
                        found lying beside your car near
                        the coast highway.  Some kids saw
                        you and called the police.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't remember driving to the
                        coast. 

                                        SARAH
                        You took a blow to the head.  The
                          doctor's are worried that you
                        might slip back into a coma.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (slight sense of panic)
                        No.  That can't happen.

                                        BRUCE
                        Calm down.  Can you remember where
                        this all started?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I was... I woke up and she was
                        making breakfast.
                                (light bulb goes off)
                        That's it.  I was trying to find
                        her.  I was trying to find Maiya.

                                        BRUCE
                        Keep going.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's missing and I was trying to
                        find her.  That must be the key
                        to all this.

                                        BRUCE
                        How can you find her if you're in
                        the hospital?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I can't.  Unless...
                                (beat)
                        I keep seeing this fight.  If
                        this really is a vision, it's
                          possible whatever happened to me
                        hasn't happened yet.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why didn't I think of that?

          Bruce smiles, which makes Johnny think...

                                        JOHNNY
                        If that is the future, I might be
                        able to stop it, if I can just
                        find Maiya.  But if I'm stuck in
                          a vision, what are you doing here?

                                        BRUCE
                                (playful)
                        Maybe I'm not here.  I mean, in
                          reality.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You mean I'm making you up in my
                        mind?  Like my own voice coming
                        back at me?  My own thoughts?

                                        BRUCE
                        Why do you think?

                        I think I just figured out why
                        you keep smiling at me like an
                        idiot.

                                        SARAH
                        Hang on, Johnny.  I'll be here
                        waiting for you.  I don't want to
                        lose you again.

          Another FLASH CUT OF THE ATTACK!

  2929INT. JOHNNY'S CAR - DAY

          Johnny is suddenly driving.  There's nobody in the
          passenger's seat.  He seems both disappointed and relieved.*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        Where could she be? *
                                (racking his brain)*
                        What do I know about her?

          Suddenly a PARTY FAVOR HORN blasts in his ear!  He spins*
          around to FIND Bruce sitting behind him in the back seat,
          SMILING.

                                        BRUCE
                        Happy birthday, Johnny!

          Johnny tries to keep control of the car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's great.  Why don't you just
                        drive us into a tree while you're
                        at it?

                                        BRUCE
                        Wasn't me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I figured that out.

          Johnny looks up into the rear-view mirror, but Bruce is
          gone.  Suddenly, he gets the party favor blasted at him
          again, but now from the passenger seat.

          REVEAL Bruce, now magically sitting beside him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to stop saying that.

                                        BRUCE
                        Like I said, it wasn't me.

                                        JOHNNY*
                        If you're my subconscious, why do*
                        I keep wishing myself a happy*
                          birthday?  What does my birthday*
                        have to do with any of this?*

                        We gotta find Maiya, right?*

                                        JOHNNY*
                          Something tells me that's the*
                        only way to save myself.*

                                        BRUCE*
                                (excited)
                        What are we gonna do?  Find that*
                        dude that popped you in the eye? 
                        We gonna kick his ass?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We aren't going to do anything. 
                        You're just here for moral support.

                                        BRUCE
                        I can do that.  But I'd like to
                        try out some karate moves I learned
                        in high school.

          Bruce chops his hands through the air with the playful
          energy of a kid.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's Judo and I learned it at the
                          Y.M.C.A.  If you're going to be
                        me, at least get it right.

                                        BRUCE
                          Whatever.  The fact is you don't
                        find Maiya, you might be lookin'
                        at another long, dark, sleep.

          Johnny knows he's right.  Hell, it's his own fear.

          Bruce shrugs, then blasts him with the party favor again.

                        Happy birthday to you and me.

          Johnny is not amused.

  3030EXT. BEACH / ND LOCATION - DAY

          ANOTHER VARIATION on the ATTACK SEQUENCE. 


  3131INT.  WALT'S OFFICE - DAY

          Walt is checking something in a file cabinet, as
            Johnny/Desmond ENTERS (hand bandaged--PRODUCTION CHOICE). 
          Bruce isn't with him as he steps into the office.  Walt
          sees Johnny, but there's an odd feeling of distance.

                                        WALT
                          I didn't expect to see you back
                        so soon.

          He walks away as Johnny/Desmond follows.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        I got kind'a turned around.  I
                        wanted to see if you'd heard
                          anything about Maiya?

                                        WALT
                        Same thing I told you before. 
                        We're looking for her.

    31CONTINUED:31

          He walks away again.  Johnny is beginning to get an
            uncomfortable vibe.  Again, he follows.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        I was just wondering if maybe you
                        could assign a few more people to
                        the search?  Make it a priority
                        case?

          Walt looks at him with a hard expression.

                                        WALT
                        I know you're worried about your
                        friend, but I already told you,
                        we're looking for her.  All my
                          deputies have copies of her
                          picture.  That's all I can do.

          Again Walt walks away.  Johnny seems totally confused
          now.

                                        BRUCE'S VOICE
                        Y'ever get the feeling you might
                        be invisible?


          REVEAL BRUCE

          He's sitting on the desk next to Johnny.  Walt does not
          see him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, what's it gonna take, a
                          lightning bolt from Heaven?  The
                        guy isn't seeing you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Me?

                                        BRUCE
                                (knocks on Johnny's
                                head)
                        Hello?!  You see anybody else
                        around here?

          He's right.  Johnny looks around, then steps over to the
          glass window and checks his reflection.  Bruce is suddenly
          standing beside him.

          REFLECTION - DESMOND

          He sees Desmond's image staring back at him.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Johnny's Ladder" - ACT TWO - 7/22/05 - WHT-2 23.


    31CONTINUED: (2)31

          Oddly, Bruce has no reflection at all.

                                        DESMOND'S REFLECTION
                                (in Johnny's VOICE)
                        That's why Walt is acting funny. 
                        He thinks I'm Desmond.

          RESUME BRUCE AND JOHNNY

          Standing side by side.

                                        BRUCE
                        You are Desmond.  I mean, you're
                        you, but you're also... It's
                          complicated.

          Walt walks back into the room.

                                        WALT
                        Still here?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Look, Sheriff, I know you don't
                        know me, but I'd really appreciate
                        it if you'd tell me what's going
                        on?  Please, it's important.

          Walt turns to him.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        What about Johnny Smith?

                                        WALT
                        What about him?

          Johnny hesitates, as suddenly Bruce is REVEALED sitting
          on top of the file cabinet.

                                        BRUCE
                        Uh-oh.  You opened a big can'a
                        worms now.

                                        WALT
                        What about John?

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        I just know he's concerned about
                        finding Maiya.  Don't you think
                        you ought'a consider him?

                                        WALT
                          Johnny'll find you if he needs
                        you.  He can take care of himself.

                                        BRUCE
                        If he only knew the truth.

                        Shut up!

          Walt TURNS...

                                        WALT
                        Excuse me?

          Bruce puts his hand up to his mouth like a child with a
          secret.

                                          JOHNNY/DESMOND
                        Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.

                                        WALT
                        Go home.  We'll find her.
                          Everything'll be all right. 

          Walt walks away.  As Bruce suddenly appears standing next
          to Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's what he thinks.  What now
                          Birthday boy?

          Johnny thinks, then grabs the photo and looks at it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to go somewhere and think.

                                        BRUCE
                        Good idea.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I wasn't asking your opinion.

          Johnny walks away.

                                        BRUCE
                        Now you're mad at me?  That doesn't

          Johnny/Cole is in the middle of the fight with Desmond.

                                          JOHNNY/COLE
                        You poisoned her against me! 
                        Filled her head with lies!

                                        DESMOND
                          I haven't talked to her in years!

                                          JOHNNY/COLE
                        Then why'd she leave?!

                                        DESMOND
                        Because she thought you were
                        dangerous!

          Even as the words leave his mouth, and Johnny/Cole CLOCKS
          Desmond hard,

          Johnny fights against his natural instincts as Cole.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What am I doing?  What's going on
                        inside me?

          Bruce is REVEALED behind him.  He suddenly seems
          frightened, like a child in danger.

                                        BRUCE
                        This is bad.  I think we should
                        go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I must be Cole.  Something keeps
                          switching me from body to body. 
                        I can feel them inside me, their
                        energy, their anger.  I have to
                        keep control.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's good, but I still think we
                        should go.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (looks around)
                        I think you're right.

          Johnny takes off, but this time he runs across the street
          and gets into a 2002 Mustang GT.  Bruce never moves.


  3636INT.  MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS

          Bruce is already waiting in the passenger seat as
          Johnny/Cole jumps into the car.

                        Yeah.  But look at this car.  I
                        always wanted a Mustang.

                        Sorry.  What now?

          Johnny looks into the rear-view mirror.

          REFLECTION

          As he sees Cole's eyes staring back at him.

          RESUME INT. CAR

          Johnny looks around and notices a receipt folded and stuck
          into the ash tray.  He picks it up and unfolds it.

                                        BRUCE

                        It's a motel receipt.  Cole must
                        be staying somewhere near the
                        coast.

                        Hey, that's where Sarah said they

                        Listen, maybe we ought'a leave it
                        alone.  I mean, there's no point
                        looking for trouble, right?

                                        JOHNNY

                        who wants her nearly as bad as I
                        do?

                        bet...

          Johnny digs into his pocket and pulls out a motel room
          key.

                        Let's go check my motel room.

          Johnny fires up the engine.

          Johnny takes one last look in the mirror, then...

  3737EXT. SMALL MOTEL - LATER

          Johnny/Cole climbs the stairs to the second floor and
          looks for the room number matching the key.  He stops in
          front of ROOM 225 and inserts the key.  Suddenly, Bruce
          steps out through the door.  He startles Johnny, who isn't
          amused.

                                        JOHNNY

                        Fun, isn't it?

          Johnny picks up on the energy of the room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can feel him.

          Bruce sees TWO AIRLINE TICKETS on the night table.  And a
          TRAVEL BOOK about Peru.  A BROCHURE that says "Incan
            Treasure: Visit the LAND OF GOLD."

                                        BRUCE
                        Looks like he's planning a trip. 
                        There are only two tickets.

          As Johnny stares at the brochure, emotions begin churning
          inside him.  As he channels Cole's rage, he violently
          shoves the bed out of the way, revealing a SUITCASE
          underneath it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoah. This guy's twelve angry
                        men rolled into one.

          Johnny/Cole tosses the suitcase on the bed, violently
          rips through it until he stops, and lifts out a HANDGUN. 
          He steps back holding the gun, sits on the end of the
          bed.

                                        BRUCE
                        He wouldn't be crazy enough to
                        kill somebody, would he?

          Johnny looks up into the mirror across from him:

          REFLECTION

          And we now SEE the real Cole staring back at us.  Bruce
          has vanished.  Johnny/Cole has a dark, menacing look in

          Johnny and Bruce are in Cole's hotel room.  The gun is on
          the bed. Johnny is staggered by what he has just learned
          from being Cole.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Cole came here to get his daughter
                        and it looks like he's prepared
                        to do anything to make it happen.

                                        BRUCE
                        We still don't know how you ended
                        up in the hospital.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But we know I wasn't shot.  So
                        that means we've still got a chance
                        to stop this.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's good.  All we have to do
                        now is find this Maiya person.

                                        BRUCE
                          I wouldn't, if you'd just think
                          straight.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I feel like I'm missing something.

          Johnny as Cole is opening drawers, throwing stuff around. 
          He's desperate, frantic, frustrated, angry, looking for
          clues as to where Maiya might be.

          He tosses around little notepapers by the phone, maps,
          address books.  Doesn't see what he's looking for.

                        here!

          He looks up, as we REVEAL Bruce watching him from across
          the room.

                                        JOHNNY

                        I know you said you were in control
                        of these other energies, but you
                        might want to take a look around.

          Johnny calms down, looks around, as we REVEAL the entire
          room has been ransacked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Cole did this.  He must have been
                        looking for something to help him
                        find Maiya.

  4343INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny pops in suddenly.  Looks around.  The remains of a
          birthday party.  Plates of half-eaten cake.  Glasses of
          wine.  Wrapping paper.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My own house? What the hell am I
                        doing here?

          Bruce appears, grinning.

                                        BRUCE
                        There's no place like home.

          Johnny quickly finds a mirror and sees...

          His own.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm me.  I mean, I'm us.

          RESUME JOHNNY

          He turns away trying to figure it out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This was last night.  My birthday
                        party.  Why am I here?  This has
                        nothing to do with finding Maiya.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe it does, maybe it does.

          Johnny shoots him a look and walks out into the foyer.

          Johnny sees Walt, Sarah and JJ with Vision Johnny by the
          door, the last of the party guests.

          Bruce leans over to Johnny, a drink in hand.

                                        BRUCE
                        Those Bannermans.  Always the
                        last to leave.

          Johnny ignores him, watches himself say good-night to his
          friends.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Thanks, you guys.  This was great.

          Sarah gives him a hug.

                                        SARAH
                        'Night, Johnny.  Happy birthday.

          She heads out the front door. Walt slaps him on the back.

                                        WALT
                        Good night, old man.

          Walt starts out. JJ shyly slips a small gift wrapped in
          comics into Vision Johnny's pocket.

                                        JJ
                        This is from me.  It's dumb.

          Vision Johnny smiles at him.

                        Bet it isn't.

          JJ stops his hand.

                                        JJ
                        Don't look now, okay?  Later.

          Vision Johnny smiles at JJ's pre-teen embarrassment. 
          Can't show emotions, not cool.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        Okay.  Thanks though.

          As JJ leaves and Vision Johnny waves good-night out the
          front door, then looks at the mess and shuts off the lights
          and climbs the stairs.

            A gleeful Bruce drags Johnny over to a FISH TANK.

                                        BRUCE
                        You always wanted a fish tank.

          Johnny looks in the tank.  A fish floats belly-up on the
          surface.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They cost extra to do that?

          He's about to turn away when he sees something.  Looks
          closer.

          Bruce and Johnny exchange a look.  That's it.

          Desmond comes out of the bedroom, also mid-search, more
          papers in his hand.  Johnny is startled to see him.

                                        BRUCE
                              (a la birthday party)

                        I came here with Desmond to look
                        for a clue.

          Bruce pops out.  Johnny/Vision Johnny nods.  As he and

          Johnny/Cole looks up from the dashboard as someone gets
          in the car next to him.

          He looks over, expecting Desmond.  But it's Bruce.  Bruce
          smiles.

          Johnny reacts,

                        What are you doing here?

          Realizes he's in a different car.  He looks out the
          windshield towards what should be Maiya's house.  But
          he's not right in front of Maiya's house.  The Range Rover
          is.  He's parked across the street.

          Sees Desmond get into the Range Rover.

          Johnny quickly looks up at the rear view mirror.  Sees
          Cole's face looking back at him.

                                        JOHNNY

                        wasn't there.  So he waited. 
                        Like he knew.

          Bruce's face comes into view with a strained smile.

                                        BRUCE
                        Look who's awake.

          He sees how shaken Johnny is.  Johnny coughs.

                        Relax, man.  It's gonna be okay
                        now.

          Johnny catches his breath, manages to see the room clearly. 
          Just like Sarah and Bruce said in his vision. Some beeping
          hospital machines.

                        I need to go.

          Johnny reaches for his clothes, starts getting dressed
          (pulls on his pants, hospital gown still on top).

                                        DOCTOR
                        Mr. Smith, I have to warn you.  A

          The doctor hesitates a beat, then exits.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        We've got to find Cole.  The last
                        place anyone saw him was at the
                        beach?  Treasure Beach.

          Walt nods.  Johnny reaches for his personal effects on
          the table next to his bed--wallet, keys, watch.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        We'll start there, see if I can
                        get a hit off something--

          He stops, halted by the sight of a SMALL GIFT, wrapped in
          a sheet of comic book paper resting next to his watch on
          the bedside table.  He reaches for it, an odd feeling
          washing over him, almost like a sixth sense.

                                        VISION JOHNNY
                        What's this?

                        you didn't get a chance to open
                        it yet.

          Johnny slips off the paper (it comes off easily) and holds
          a PENKNIFE in his hand.  He sits back down heavily on the
          bed, staring at the penknife (SUBTEXT: he realizes it
          could've helped him).

          A voice comes from the doorway.

                                        OBSERVER BRUCE
                        Happy Birthday, Johnny.

          Johnny suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway
          with Observer Bruce, looking at Vision Johnny sitting on
          the bed.

          The Johnny in the doorway realizes,

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm still in the vision.

          He takes it in.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is what happens if I don't
                        change this. 

          He looks at Bruce, as it dawns on him.

                        Hey, Siena, you in here? 

          No answer.  Johnny/Maiya's eyes dart around, panicked, as
          he doesn't see Siena, tries to keep the tremor out of his

                        father wants to make his child's
                        dreams come true.

                        Who are you?

                                        JOHNNY
                          A father like you.  Someone who
                        knows what it means to have lost
                        time with his child. But isn't
                        that better than losing her
                          altogether?

                                        COLE
                        You don't know me.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (ironic smile)
                        I do.  Better than you think. 
                        Put the gun down.  We can talk.

                                        COLE
                        There's nothing to talk about.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There is.  The future.  Siena's
                        and yours.

                                        COLE
                        We're gonna make a new life
                          together.

                        You're free to go.  But you're
                        going to have to do it alone. 
                        Siena stays.

          Cole puts a protective arm around Siena, pulling her
          roughly against him, still waving the gun.


          ANGLE ON WALT APPEARING FROM A HIDDEN LOCATION

          behind Cole, we see him approaching stealthily, gun drawn.

                                        COLE
                        It isn't fair.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then let's make it right.

                        I just wanted her to know me.

          After a beat, he lets go of Siena's hand, gun still trained
          on Johnny.

          Maiya instinctively reaches for her.

                                        MAIYA
                        Please, Cole...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Siena)
                        It's going to be okay.  I promise. 
                        Let her go, Cole.  This isn't the
                        way to keep her.

          Cole stares at Johnny, knows he's already lost her. Johnny
          looks at Siena.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Picasso.  C'mere.

          Siena looks back at Johnny.  Cole doesn't move to stop
          her. She runs towards Johnny.  As Johnny takes her in his
          arms,

                        Freeze!

          Cole freezes, drops his gun.  Walt, Roscoe and the DEPUTIES
          move in, guns drawn. 

          Maiya, bruised but able to walk, bolts up, rushes towards
          Siena.

                                        MAIYA
                        Siena!

          Maiya gathers her daughter in her arms.  As Johnny looks
          at the hard-earned reunion, knows how it would have turned
          out,

                                                                              TIME CUT:

          Desmond and Maiya cross in from where they have been giving
          their statement to Roscoe.  Maiya has Siena by the hand.

                                        DESMOND
                        This is Johnny Smith, the psychic
                        who helped us find you.

          Maiya smiles up at Johnny, words failing, tears of
            gratitude in her eyes.

                                        SIENA
                        Do you know my Mommy?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  But I feel like I do.

          He smiles at Maiya.

                                        MAIYA
                        How can I ever thank you...?

          Johnny smiles, no thanks necessary.

                                        SIENA
                        You can have my picture.

          As she proudly passes it to him, CLOSE ON the child's
          DRAWING of her mom, hair wild, flying across the sky,
          Siena in tow, flying away from a man who's small down
          below on the ground...

                                        WALT
                        Don't forget this.  Crazy, huh? 
                        Last night we were celebrating
                        your birthday, today you were
                        just hoping to see another one.

          Walt hands Johnny the penknife that made all this possible. 
          Johnny looks at it more closely, is stunned for a beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you know where JJ got this?

                                        WALT
                        He found it in a box of old stuff
                        at your place.  Shined it all up
                        for you.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought it looked familiar.  It
                        was my father's.

                        No kidding?  I guess there's a
                        certain symmetry to that.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Symmetry.  Yeah, you could call
                        it that.

          ON JOHNNY, fingering the penknife in his hand...
