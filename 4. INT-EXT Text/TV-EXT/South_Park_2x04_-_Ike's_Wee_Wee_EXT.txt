               The bus pulls away and the boys start walking home.

                         Yeah, my ass is killing me.

                         Why did they search US? That marry-

                         I wonder who took it...


               Just then, Chef pulls up in his car.

                                     CHEF
                         Hello there, children.

                                     BOYS
                         Hey Chef.

                         How's it going?

                         Bad.

                         Why bad?

                                     CHEF
                         Children, I heard about what happened 
                         at school today. Now... none of YOU 
                         took that nasty marijuana, did you?

                                     STAN
                         No dude, we never even saw it.

                                     CHEF
                         Okay, because I just want to tell 
                         you that drugs are bad.

                                     STAN
                         We know, we know. That's what 
                         everybody says.

                                     CHEF
                         Right, but do you know why they're 
                         bad?

                                     KYLE
                              (quickly)
                         Because they are an addictive solution 
                         to a greater problem causing disease 
                         of both body and mind with 
                         consequences far outweighing their 
                         supposed benefits.

                                     CHEF
                         And do you have any idea what that 
                         means?

                                     KYLE
                         No.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I know. Drugs are bad. Because if 
                         you do drugs, you're a hippy, and 
                         hippies suck!

                                     CHEF
                         Look, children, this is all I'm going 
                         to say about drugs... Stay AWAY from 
                         them. There's a time and a place for 
                         everything -- and it's called college. 
                         Do you understand?

                         Okay.

               Chef starts to walk away.

                         Don't you boys know what a Bris is? 
                         They're going to circumcise him.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What's that?

                         that is more sacred to a man than 
                         anything else in the world?

                         No, no, no children, I'm talking 
                         about the most important part of a 
                         man's body.

               The boys look confused.

                                     KYLE
                         Your heart?

                         Your eyes?

               Finally, Kenny gets it --

                         else you get a spanking.

               The counselor is walking alone down the desolate Avenue De 
               Los Mexicanos. His head is down, is hands in his pockets, as 
               snow gently falls around him. Just then a car drives by with 
               two parents in the car.

                                     PARENT
                         HEY, MACKEY! YOU GOT ANY MORE POT? 
                         MY FOUR YEAR OLD NEEDS A FIX!!

               The parents laugh and drive away. Mackey lowers his head, 
               but another car pulls up.

                                     PARENT #2
                         HEY, MACKEY! NOW WE SEE WHAT YOU AND 
                         HOMER SIMPSON HAVE IN COMMON... 
                         DOPE!!!

               The parents laugh hysterically. Mackey cowers. Another car 
               pulls up.

                                     PARENT #3
                         Hey, MACKEY!!

               Mackey looks up to see a FULL STREAM OF CARS, hundreds of 
               them, all waiting in line to pull up and insult the counselor, 
               BEEPING their horns and YELLING.

               Mackey takes off into a building.

               TILT UP to reveal that it is the South Park bar.


               Kyle, Cartman and Kenny are outside building a snow castle.

               Kyle runs towards his house. The boys follow.


               Mackey walks down the lonely street, drunk off his ass.

               Mackey stumbles up to a house, and tries the key, but the 
               key doesn't fit.

                                     COUNSELOR

               Mackey turns to see the elderly homeowner, who has a stern 
               look on his face.

               The homeowner picks up a rock, and hurls it at Mackey. The 
               rock hits him in the head.

                         Hey, you want something to warm you 
                         up?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, I didn't know this dark alley 
                         was taken...

                                     BUM
                         Here, try this, it'll warm you up.

               The bum hands the counselor a joint.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh... Marijuana's bad.

                                     BUM
                         What?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Marijuana makes you feel depressed 
                         and low. Okay?

                                     BUM
                         And you don't feel that way now?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Good point.

               The counselor grabs the joint and takes a huge drag.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Hmm... I don't feel any diff -- 
                         oooooooh. Baby, get down... Okay?

                                     BUM
                         Uh huh.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Man, this alley is cool! It's so 
                         alive and beautiful.

                                     BUM
                         Oh boy.

               Kyle walks away.

               But as he passes the train, he notices an open door. Kyle 
               looks around to see if anybody is watching.

                                     KYLE

                         you have to get on this train.

               Just as the train starts to make noise and leave, Kyle kicks 
               Ike onboard.

               Mackey is walking around in the woods, looking haggard and 
               beaten.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh man, where am I?

               A couple long haired hippies walk up to Mr. Mackey.

                                     HIPPIE
                         Hey wow, it's that counselor from 
                         elementary school, Mr. Mackey.

                                     HIPPIE 2
                         Woa, dude.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Hi boys, how are you today?

                                     HIPPIE
                         Pretty good, man, how are you?

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked 
                         out of town for doing drugs.

                                     HIPPIE
                         Hey! US TOO!!

                                     HIPPIE 2
                         Yeah, remember you caught us smokin' 
                         weed in the bathroom and got us 
                         suspended.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Oh... Oh fortune, how you mock me.

                                     HIPPIE
                         Oh cheer up, bro, all you need is 
                         some clear liquid to get your head 
                         straight.

               The hippie hands the counselor some clear liquid.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Uh, boys, LSD is bad.

               Mackey quickly drops the acid.

                                     COUNSELOR
                              (echoing)
                         Hmmm... Man, who put all this cotton 
                         in my mouth?

               Mackey's head starts to inflate like a giant balloon.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Yeah, baby. The world is so small.

               Mackey's head detaches from his body and starts to float 
               away delicately.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I'm Free... I'm Free...

                                     HIPPIE 2
                         Sweet dude, totally killer.

                                     HIPPIE
                         That guy's totally tripping.


               The boys are standing around Kyle who is making a ragged, 
               crappy looking doll.

                                     KYLE
                         There, what do you think?

                         What the hell is that supposed to 
                         be?

                                     KYLE
                         I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My 
                         parents think he's out with me right 
                         now, and I have to bring him back 
                         for dinner.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, I think your mom's gonna notice 
                         that that isn't Ike.

                         Not if I say he's sick and put him 
                         to bed right away.

               Just then, a large dog (The big mean one from Big Gay Al's) 
               comes up to the dummy and starts sniffing at it.

                                     KYLE
                         No! go away! Bad dog!

                         Dude, what did you make that doll 
                         out of?

                                     KYLE
                         I used a bunch of bones from the 
                         butcher shop.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Is that why it stinks so bad?

               Just then, the great balloon head of Mr. Mackey floats through 
               frame.

                         for a while...

               Mr. Mackey floats on through.

               The dog again tries to bite into the doll.

               The boys start to walk away. Just when they're all about out 
               of frame.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Wait a minute! No you wouldn't!!


               The train comes to a stop. Ike gets tossed out. Ike just 
               stands there looking around.

               Finally, a conservative looking couple walks up.

                                     WOMAN
                         Would you look at that, honey? 
                         Somebody dropped off a perfectly 
                         good trash can.

               The couple walks off. Ike blinks, and then bounces off to 
               the corn fields of Nebraska.


               A small coffin is lowered into the ground. Everyone is dressed 
               in black.

               Kyle and Stan peer down into the large hole as the coffin 
               settles on the ground.

                                     PRIEST
                         Yea... Usher us unto the Lord sayeth 
                         some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes 
                         dust to dust.

               The priest throws some crap into the grave. A bagpipe player 
               starts to play 'Hava negila', horribly.

               Everybody starts walking away.

                         Hey wait a minute, how come Ike's 
                         tombstone has a Canadian flag on it?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Well Boobie, there's something you 
                         have to know. Ike wasn't really your 
                         brother. He was adopted.

                                     KYLE
                         WHAT?!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         He was not really a Broflovski. He 
                         was Canadian. But we loved him all 
                         the same.

                         You mean to tell me that all this 
                         time I've been trying to protect Ike 
                         from having his fireman cut off and

                         Nebraska.

               Kyle storms off with a pissed off look.

                         that. Now they're gonna find him and 
                         cut off his penis.

               Kenny walks into an open grave and a tombstone falls on him 
               killing him.

               It's a shithole.


               The sun sets.


               Mr. Mackey is lying naked (except for his tie) next to the 
               hippie girl. Both of them are staring up at the ceiling.

               Fingerpaints are all over the place.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         Wow, man... You know it's like... 
                         You go through life thinking that 
                         you're an individual, Okay? and then 
                         you realize you're more than that. 
                         We're all just one big individual. 
                         Okay?

               They just sit there for a few moments.

                         Okay.

               The counselor finally removes his tie. His head actually 
               balloons down to an almost normal shape.


               Establishing.


               Mr. Mackey is hiking up a beautiful mountain that overlooks 
               the entire country. Ravi Shankar music plays in the 
               background.

                                     HIPPIE WOMAN
                         Wow, this is so beautiful.

               A white bird flies down and lands on Mackey's shoulder.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         I am one with the animals. And the 
                         trees.

                                     HIPPIE WOMAN
                         And I am one with you.

               MUSIC swells up.

                              (singing)
                         At long last I have found A true 
                         reason to be... Now I feel I can 
                         start a new....

               Suddenly a group of five men, the "A-Team", jump Mackey and 
               start beating the shit out of him.

                                     COUNSELOR
                         OW! HEY!

               The men throw Mackey into the A-Team van and speed away, 
               leaving the hippie girl all alone.

                                     HIPPIE WOMAN
                         Woa...


               A large banner is strung outside the house it says 'Welcome 
               to Ike's Funeral'. But 'funeral' is crossed out and BRIS is 
               written in its place.

               A few cars pull up, and people are getting out with presents.


               It is peaceful and calm.


               Mr. Mackey looks like his old self as he is led out the 
               clinic's door.

                                     SOCIAL WORKER
                         Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are 
                         fully recovered.

                                     COUNSELOR

                         everything, okay. I feel like my old 
                         self again.

                                     SOCIAL WORKER
                         Just one more thing...

               She takes Mackey's tie and puts it around his neck. She 
               tightens it so tight that his head goes back to the odd shape 
               it always was.

                                     SOCIAL WORKER
                         Remember that you CAN stay sober!

                         Okay?
