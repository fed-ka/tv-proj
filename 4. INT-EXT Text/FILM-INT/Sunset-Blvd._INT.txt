He is stopped by the

Hello, Gillis.

At the fountain sits Skolsky,
drinking a cup of coffee.
GILLIS
Hello, Mr. Skolsky.

On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores,

opponent in the background.
Gillis has evidently
stated his problem already.
MORINO
So you need three hundred dollars?
Of course, I could give you three
hundred dollars.

going to.
GILLIS
No?
MORINO
Gillis, get this through your

I'm not just your agent.
It's not the ten per cent.
I'm

He sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee,
Gillis following him.
GILLIS
How's that about your being my

MORINO

A-3O
THE ENTRANCE DOOR OF THE HOUSE
Max von Mayerling stands there.
He is sixty, and
all in black, except for immaculate white cotton
gloves, shirt, high, stiff collar and a white bow
tie.
His coat is shiny black alpaca, his trousers
ledger-atriped.
He is semi-paralyzed.
The left
side of his mouth is pulled down, and he leans on a
rubber-ferruled stick.
MAX
In here!
Gillis enters the shot.
GILLIS
I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blow-out.
I thought --
MAX
Go on in.
There is authority in the gesture of his white-
gloved hand as he motions Gillis inside.
GILLIS
Look, maybe I'd better take my

MAX
Wipe your feet!
Automatically, Gillis wipes his feet on an enormous
shabby cocoanut mat.
MAX
You are not dressed properly.
GILLIS
Dressed for what?
THE WOMAN'S VOICE
Max!
Have him come up, Max!
MAX
(Gesturing)
Up the stairs!
GILLIS
Suppose you listen just for a

MAX
Madame is waiting.
GILLIS
For me?
Okay.
Gillis enters.
A-31
It is grandiose and grim.
The whole place is one of
those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling
alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and
beams imported from Italy, with California termites
at work on them.
Portieres are drawn before all the
windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their
way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always
burning.
Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble
staircase.
It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn
velvet rope along the wall.
MAX
(From below)
If you need help with the
coffin call me.
The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis'
imagination.
He climbs the stairs with a kind of
morbid fascination.
At the top he stops, undecided,
then turns to the right and is stopped by
WOMAN'S VOICE
This way!
Gillis swings around.
Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a
doorway from which emerges a flickering light.
She
is a little woman.
There is a curious style, a
great sense of high voltage about her.
She is dress-
ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled
pumps.
Around her throat there is a leopard-pat-
terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of
the same material.
Her skin is very pale, and she
is wearing dark glasses.
NORMA
In here.
I put him on my massage
table in front of the fire.
He
always liked fires and poking at
them with a stick.
Gillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into
A-32
NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM
It is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which
has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly
torn in a few places.
There's a great, unmade gilded
bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had
begun to peel.
There is a disorder of clothes and
negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars
about.
In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn-
ing.
On the massage table before it lies a small
form shrouded under a Spanish shawl.
At each end on
a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande-
labrum, the candles lighted.
NORMA
I've made up my mind we'll bury him in
the garden.
Any city laws against that?
GILLIS
I wouldn't know.
NORMA
I don't care anyway.

White, or deep pink.
She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the
color.
From under the shawl flops down a dead arm.
Gillis stares and recoils a little.
It is like a
child's arm, only black and hairy.
NORMA
Maybe red.

Gay.
Let's make it gay.
Gillis edges closer and glances down.
Under the
shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead
chimpanzee.
Norma drops back the shawl.
NORMA
How much will it be?
I warn you -
don't give me a fancy price just
because I'm rich.
GILLIS
Lady.

For the first time.
Norma really looks at him
through her dark glasses.
GILLIS
I had some trouble with my car.
Flat tire.
I pulled into your
garage till I could get a spare.
I thought this was an empty house.
NORMA
It is not.
Get out.
GILLIS
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost
your friend, and I don't think red
is the right color.
NORMA

GILLIS

NORMA
I am big.
It's the pictures
that got small.
GILLIS
I knew there was something
wrong with them.
NORMA

They're finished.

But that wasn't good

You've made a rope of words and

is a microphone right there to catch
the last gurgles, and Technicolor

GILLIS
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
NORMA
Get out!
Gillis starts down the stairs.
GILLIS
Next time I'll bring my autograph
album along, or maybe a hunk of
cement and ask for your footprints.
He is halfway down the staircase when he is
stopped by
NORMA
Just a minute, you!
GILLIS
Yeah?
NORMA
You're a writer, you said.
GILLIS
Why?
Norma starts down the stairs.
NORMA
Are you or aren't you?
GILLIS
I think that's what it says on my
driver's license.
NORMA
And you have written pictures,
haven't you?
GILLIS
Sure have.
The last one I
wrote was about cattle rustlers.
Before they were through with it,
the whole thing played on a
torpedo boat.
Norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase.
NORMA
I want to ask you something.
Come in here.
She leads him into
A-33
THE HUGE LIVING ROOM
It is dark and damp and filled with black oak and
red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props
from the Mark of Zorro set.
Along the main wall,
a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years.
On the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of
Norma Desmond in her various roles.
On one wall
is a painting -- a California Gold Rush scene,
Carthay Circle school.
(We will learn later that
it hides a motion picture screen.)
One corner is filled with a large pipe organ, and
as Norma and Gillis enter, there is a grizzly
moaning sound.
Gillis looks around.
NORMA
The wind gets in that blasted
pipe organ.
I ought to have
it taken out.
GILLIS
Or teach it a better tune.
Norma has led him to the card tables which stand
side by side near a window.
They are piled high
with papers scrawled in a large, uncertain hand.
NORMA
How long is a movie script these
days?
I mean, how many pages?
GILLIS
Depends on what it is -- a Donald
Duck or Joan or Arc.
NORMA
This is to be a very important
picture.
I have written it
myself.
Took me years.
GILLIS
(Looking at the piles
of script)
Looks like enough for six impor-
tant pictures.
NORMA
It's the story or Salome.
I
think I'll have DeMille direct it.
GILLIS
Uh-huh.
NORMA
We've made a lot of pictures
together.
GILLIS
And you'll play Salome?
NORMA
Who else ?
GILLIS
Only asking.
I did't know
you were planning a comeback.
NORMA
I hate that word.
It is a return.
A return to the millions of people
who have never forgiven me for
deserting the screen.
GILLIS
Fair enough.
NORMA
Salome -- what a woman! What a
part! The Princess in love with
a Holy man.
She dances the Dance
of the Seven Veils.
He rejects
her, so she demands his head on a
golden tray, kissing his cold, dead
lips.

They will love it every place.

batch of pages from
the heap)

What right do you have to take
me for granted?
NORMA
What right? Do you want me to
tell you?
GILLIS
Has it ever occurred that I may
have a life of my own? That there
may be some girl I'm crazy about?
NORMA
Who? Some car hop, or a dress
extra?
GILLIS
Why not? What I'm trying to say
is that I'm all wrong for you.
You want a Valentino -- somebody
with polo ponies -- a big shot --
NORMA
(Getting up slowly)
What you're trying to say is
that you don't want me to love
you.
Is that it?
Gillis doesn't answer.
Norma slaps his face and
rushes from the room and upstairs.
Gillis stands paralyzed, the slap burning his cheek.

Norma rushes up the last few steps, down the corridor
and into her bedroom, banging the door.

He still stands motionless.
He glances around fur-

The musicians are playing away.
They have turned
their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious-

GILLIS
He starts slowly out.
As he does so his long gold
key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa
and holds him for a second of additional embarrass-
ment.
He yanks it loose and walks with as much
nonchalance as he can muster to
C-16
THE HALL
Crossing towards the coat closet, Gillis throws a
look upstairs.
Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from
its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the
entrance door.
He opens the door on the darkness
of the courtyard.
C-17
Only one alabaster lamp lights the big, cold room.
On the bed lies Norma in her evening dress.
She is
white as a sheet.
Her wrists are bandaged.
Her eyes
are wide open, staring at the ceiling.
One of her
shoes has halt slipped off her foot.
The other is
on.
Gillis opens the door and stands there tor a
second.
Then he slowly moves to the toot of the bed.
He takes the shoes from her feet and puts them on
the floor.
NORMA
Go away.
GILLIS
What kind of a silly thing was
that to do?
NORMA
To fall in love with you -- that
was the idiotic thing.
GILLIS
It sure would have made attractive
headlines: Great Star Kills Her-
self for Unknown Writer.
NORMA
Great stars have great pride.
She puts one bandaged forearm over her eyes, sobbing.
Gillis walks slowly over to the mantelpiece, stands
there for awhile.
NORMA
Go away.
Go to that girl of yours.
GILLIS
Look, I was making that up because
I thought the whole thing was a
mistake.
I didn't want to hurt you.
You've been good to me.
You're the
only person in this stinking town
that has been good to me.
NORMA
Why don't you just say thank you
and go, go, go --
GILLIS
Not until you promise to act like
a sensible human being.
NORMA
I'll do it again, I'll do it again,
I'll do it again!
Gillis stands looking at her helplessly.

LIVING ROOM, THE DESMOND HOUSE
The candles burned down, the orchestra playing to
the emptiness.
The orchestra leader looks at his
watch, rises, silences the orchestra, then starts
them in on Auld Lang Syne.

Gillis still stands.
Norma lies on the bed, arms
over her eyes, sobbing.
GILLIS
Happy New Year.
Norma continues to sob.
Gillis goes to the bed,
puts his arms on her shoulders and turns her around.
GILLIS
Happy New Year.
Norma looks at him, tears in her eyes.
Slowly she
enfolds him in her bandaged arms.
NORMA
Happy New Year.

It is a sunny day.
The garden is in somewhat better

The old house looks less unkept.
The pool

Norma sits on a wicker chaise longue, her
face shielded by an enormous straw hat, her eyes by

Max comes to the

Yes, Madame.
He goes into the house.

You're really going to send it

This is the right day.
She indicates a typewritten letter she is holding.
NORMA (Cont'd)

She read deMille's horoscope.
She read mine.

Did she read the script?
NORMA
DeMille is Leo.
I'm Scorpio.
Mars has been transmitting
Jupiter for weeks.
Today is

Now turn around.

She puts the towel around his sholders and starts
drying him.
GILLIS
I hope you realize, Norma,
that scripts don't sell on
astrologers' charts.
NORMA
I'm not just selling the script.
I'm selling me.
DeMille always
said I was his greatest star.
GILLIS
When did he say it, Norma?
NORMA
So he said it quite a few years

So what?
I never looked

GILLIS
I haven't been keeping myself at
all.
Not lately.
BETTY
I called your agent.
I called the
Screen Writers Guild.
Finally your
old apartment gave me some Crestview
number.
There was always somebody
with an accent growling at me.
You
were not there.
You were not to be
spoken to.
They never heard of you.
GILLIS
Is that so? What's the wonderful
news?
BETTY
Sheldrake likes that angle about

What teacher?
BETTY

I got him all
hopped up about it.

It's really just a springboard.
It needs work.

I was afraid of that.
BETTY
I've got twenty pages of notes.
I've got a pretty good character

Paramount is calling.

Now, now do you belive me? I told

MAX
It is not Mr. deMille in person.
It is someone by the name or Gordon
Cole.
He says it's very important.
NORMA
Certainly it's important.
It's
important enough for Mr. deMille
to call me personally.
The idea
of having an assistant call me!

I myself was surprised at Mr. de

I didn't come here to see a house.
What about Norma Desmond?
GILLIS
I'm trying to tell you.
This is

Eight master
bedrooms.
A sunken tub in every
bathroom.
There's a bowling alley
in the cellar.
It's lonely here,
so she got herself a companion.
A very simple set-up: An older
woman who is well-to-do.
A younger
man who is not doing too well ...
Can you figure it out yourself?
BETTY
No.
GILLIS
All right.
I'll give you a few
more clues.
BETTY
No, no! I haven't heard any of
this.
I never got those telephone
calls.
I've never been in this
house ... Get your things together.

suits, all the custom-made shoes and
the eighteen dozen shirts, and the
cuff-links and the platinum key-
chains, and the cigarette cases?

apartment that I can't pay for?
Back to a story that may sell and
very possibly will not?
BETTY

Look, sweetie -- be practical.

Norma lies on the
floor looking after him.
She crawls toward a con-

door, passes a mirror, realizes how she looks, moves
back to the mirror and takes the patches off her
face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with
her handkerchief, readjusts her expression to a poor
travesty of a smile and goes to the door of Gillis'
room.
NORMA

Gillis moves out of the shot towards the closets.

Yes, I am, Norma.

direction of the closet)
Thanks for letting me wear the
handsome wardrobe.
And thanks
for the use of all the trinkets.
He takes the cigarette case and throws it on the
chaise longue.
Then he throws the lighter, the
wrist watch, the platinum key-chain and the tie clip.
GILLIS
(Indicating the bureau)
The rest of the jewelry is in the
top drawer.
NORMA
It's yours, Joe.
I gave it to
you.
GILLIS
And I'd take it in a second, Norma --
only it's a little too dressy for
sitting behind the copy desk in
Dayton, Ohio.
NORMA
These are nothing.
You can have
anything you want if you'll only
stay.
What is it you want --
money?
GILLIS
Norma, you'd be throwing it away.
I don't qualify for the job, not any
more.
NORMA
You can't do this!

know.

She rushes into her room.
Gillis closes the suitcase
calmly, notices that he is still wearing some cuff-

Norma reappears in the door, carrying the revolver.

Dark except for lights from the house and the

Gillis is crossing the patio towards the garage.
He

He doesn't accelerate
his step, although he has heard the shot.
Behind
him Norma comes from the lighted house.
NORMA
You're not leaving me!
She shoots twice in rapid succession.
Gillis drops
the typewriter.
The shots have swung him around.
He
is now facing Norma.
She shoots him.
This shot
hits him in the belly.
He doubles up, instinctively
backs away from her, plummets into the lit pool.
Up the stone steps from the garage rushes Max.
He sees the situation, hurries towards Norma, who
stands exultant in the strange light from the pool.

THE PATIO
Dawn is breaking.
At the edge of the pool
stand policemen, detectives and police photographers.
Motorcycle policemen are holding off the mob which
is trying to storm the house.
A lietuenant from the Homicide Bureau leaves the
crowd around the pool and goes into

THE LOWER HALL, DESMOND HOUSE
It is filled with a pandemonium of police officers,

who are kept from the upper
floor by two policemen at the head of the stairs.
The lieutenant from the Homicide Bureau goes
through the crowd to the telephone at the foot of
the stairs, picks up the phone and dials.
LIEUTENANT
Coroner's office? ... I want to
speak to the Coroner ... Who's
on this phone?

THE WHITE TELEPHONE IN NORMA'S BEDROOM
Standing talking into it is Hedda Hopper.

I am! Now get off, this is more

Ready? -- As day breaks

famed star of yesteryear, is in
a state of complete mental shock ...
THE CAMERA PANS TO ANOTHER PART OF THE BEDROOM, where
Norma sits at a mirror, staring at herself blankly.
Firing questions at her are the Captain of the Holmby
Hills Division and the L.A.
Homicide Squad.
Max
stands by faithfully.
HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
You do not deny having killed
this man, Miss Desmond?
HEAD OF HOMICIDE
Did you intend to kill him?
Just answer me that.
HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
Was it a sudden quarrel?
Had there
been any trouble between you before?
HEAD OF HOMICIDE
If it was a quarrel, how come you
had the gun right there?
HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
This guy -- where did you meet him
for the first time?
Where did he
come from? Who is he?
HEAD OF HOMICIDE
Did he have a wife?
Did he had a
girl friend?
Did you know them?
HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
Had he been trying to blackmail you?

NORMA'S BEDROOM
The interrogators are still firing questions at Norma
who sits lifeless, staring at herself.
Max watches.
HEAD OF HOMICIDE
Did the deceased ever threaten you?
Were you in fear of bodily injury?
HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
Did you hate him?
Had you ever thought
of doing something like this before?
HEAD OF HOMICIDE
Was theft involved?
Did you catch
him trying to steal something, or
find he had stolen something?
A police lieutenant has entered, goes to the Head of
Homicide.
LIEUTENANT
The newsreel guys have arrived with
the cameras.
HEAD OF HOMICIDE
Tell them to go fly a kite.
This
is no time for cameras.
A word has pierced the mists that surround Norma.
NORMA
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
MAX
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
NORMA
They have?
Thank you, Max.

Mr. DeMille I will be on the set
at once.
Max flashes a look at the Head of Homicide.
HEAD OF HOMICIDE
What is this?
MAX
Please ...
HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN
(sotto voce, to Head of Homicide)
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
HEAD OF HOMICIDE
Okay.
And let's have the car right
outside.

NORMA
You will pardon me, gentlemen.
I have to get ready for my scene.
She takes a comb and runs it through her hair, then
starts applying some wild makeup.

STAIRCASE AND LOWER HALL
Max makes his way down the stairs through the crowd
of newsmen to the newsreel cameras, which are being
set up in the hall below.
MAX
Is everything set up, gentlemen?
Are the lights ready?
From the stairway comes a murnur.
They look up.
Norma has emerged from the bedroom and comes to the
head of the stairs.
There are golden spangles in
her hair and in her hand she carries a golden scarf.
The police clear a path for her to descend.
Press
cameras flash at her every step.
Max stands at the cameras.
MAX
Is everything set up, gentlemen?
CAMERAMAN
Just about.
The portable lights flare up and illuminate the
staircase.
MAX
Are the lights ready?
2ND CAMERA MAN
All set.
MAX
Quiet, everybody!
Lights!
Are you ready, Norma?
NORMA
(From the top of the
stairs)
What is the scene? Where am I?
MAX
This is the staircase of the palace.
NORMA
Oh, yes, yes.
They're below,
waiting for the Princess ...
I'm ready.
MAX
All right.

At the foot of the stairs Norma stops, moved.
NORMA
I can't go on with the scene.
I'm too happy.
Do you mind,
Mr. DeMille, if I say a few words?
Thank you.
I just want to tell
you how happy I am to be back in
the studio making a picture again.
You don't know how much I've missed
all of you.
And I promise you
I'll never desert you again, because
after "Salome" we'll make another
picture, and another and another.
