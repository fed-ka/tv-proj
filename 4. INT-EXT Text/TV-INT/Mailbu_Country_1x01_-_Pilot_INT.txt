                  Like this?

    RUSSELL MAKES A FACE.

                                      P.R. GUY

                  Nice.  And you threw in a tiny smile 

                  at the corner of your mouth that says, 

                   don t worry about me, I ll make it 

                  through.   I love it.

                                      RUSSELL

                  I was always good with faces.

                                      REBA

                  Yeah, he s gifted.

                                      RUSSELL

                  Just make sure that when you apologize 

                  to your wife and family that you look 

                  like you re sorry.

                                      REBA

                  Or, and this may be a radical idea, he 

                  could actually be sorry.

                                      P.R. GUY

                  No, no, actual contrition comes across 

                  as pathetic.  We want to get the 

                  feeling he s moving past this already.  

                  And Reba, if you said a few words to 

                  back him up, that would really help.    MALIBU COUNTRY PILOT                                    3.

                  So, let me get this straight.  You 

                  want me to get up in front of God, the 

                  world and my children and say that a 

                  whole two weeks after finding out my 

                  husband slept with another woman, I m 

                  already moving past it?

                                      RUSSELL

                  Well, not with that face.  Try 

                  something a little more --

    HE DEMONSTRATES A HOPEFUL FACE.  SHE GLARES AT HIM.

                                      P.R. GUY

                  Okay, there s our cue.

                  like heaven.  Like, omigod, total 

                  heaven.  Like, angels smell like this.  

                  If they had bodies and whatever, but... 

                  totally... omigod, angel B.O., right?

                  mean anything, but we kind of have a thing 

                  about taking the Lord s name in vain.

                  Yes.  If we re in trouble, then I want 

                  you to use my savings if we need it.

    HE HANDS HER HIS PIGGY BANK.

                                      REBA

                  That is so sweet, honey, but I told 

                  you, we re going to be fine.

    SHE SUDDENLY NOTICES HOW LIGHT THE PIGGY BANK IS.  SHE 
    SHAKES IT; NO NOISE.

                  I m sorry, you just threw me.  You 

                  don t seem gay, you seem normal.  Not 

                  that being gay isn t normal.  It s 

                  just statistically not normal.  It s 

                  really all about math. (THEN) Oh, boy.

                  established by the time you re thirty-

                  five, forget about it.

                                      REBA

                  Well... I m only thirty-four.

                  People don t care about that.  They 

                  want a hook; are you young, are you 

                  sexy, are you young and sexy?

                                      REBA

                  Well, I don t think that s true.  I

                                      REBA

                  Well, uh, people care about, you know,  

                  the personal history a singer brings 

                  to a song.  They want to relate to 

                  what a singer has to say.  They want 

                  to believe that you ve gone through 

                  the exact same experience they

                  I don t know.  I don t think I can do 

                  that.

                                      JEFFREY

                  I understand.  Going to the guy who 

                  humiliated you and tore apart your 

                  life, begging him to help you out, 

                  gotta be torture.

                  want to be a person with dignity or a
