1    EXT. EVERWOOD'S HOPE CHURCH. MORNING.                       1 
 
     Organ music emanates from inside as PARISHIONERS walk into 
     the church.  An USHER passes out programs. 
 
                         NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               People go to church for a lot of different 
               reasons.  Some for community, some for 
               appearances.  For others, and it may be 
               very few, it's a matter of true faith. 
               The simple fact is, life is hard for most 
               people.  By the end of a long week, the 
               soul can be as devoid of spirit as 
               Everwood's Taggart Mine is empty of ore. 
               Only, if you're lucky, when you come here, 
               you leave with something more than you 
               came in with. 
 
     The last of the parishioners hurry up the stairs as the music 
     finishes.  DELIA and ANDY are among them. 
 
                         DELIA 
               See?  I told you.  Everyone else is 
               wearing a hat. 
 
     They take their programs and walk inside. 
 
2    INT. EVERWOOD'S HOPE CHURCH. MORNING.    2 
 
     It's moderately filled, but not too crowded.  Mostly older 
     people and some families.  REVEREND KEYES (late 30s) is on 
     the pulpit giving his welcome speech to the parishioners. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               ... Also, Don and Mary Finley will be 
               hosting this week's prayer study.  Thank 
               you, Don and Mary.  And remember everyone 
               -- BYOB.  That's bring your own bibles. 
 
     Chuckles from the parishioners.  As they do, Reverend Keyes 
     scratches his face a little, here and there.  THE CAMERA 
     finds Andy and Delia settling into one of the back pews. 
 
                         DELIA 
               When does the singing start? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (no clue) 
               Uh... Soon probably. 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   2. 
 
 
 
 
                         DELIA 
               Don't you know? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Of course I know. 
                   (reading the program) 
               Right now he's doing the welcome speech. 
               Then there's going to be a brief order 
               for confession and forgiveness. 
                   (looks up, explains) 
               That's where people confess and 
               forgive... in an orderly fashion. 
                   (back to the program) 
               Then we'll do the first hymn.  Then after 
               the first hymn, we do the hymn of praise. 
                   (suddenly remembering) 
               Oh, I know that one.  You'll like that one. 
                   (back to the program) 
               Next is the Prayer Of The Day -- 
 
     People start to look at Doctor Brown as he continues to skim 
     the program and explain it to Delia. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Have you ever been to church, Dad? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Plenty of times. 
                   (back to skimming) 
               After the Prayer of The Day, we do the 
               first lesson, which is -- Isaiah two; 
               verses 1-5.  Then lesson number two... 
               Gospel lesson... another hmyn, then the 
               sermon... then the offering hymn -- 
               Jesus, how long is this thing? 
 
     Angry glares from nearby parishioners.  Andy realizes what he 
     just said.  Delia tries to hide under her hymnal. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (to his neighbors) 
               Hello there.  Happy Sunday.  Nice to see 
               you. 
 
     ON THE PULPIT 
 
     By now, the Reverend is itching a great deal more, fervently 
     scratching his neck and face. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               If everyone would please open their hymnals. 
               We're going to start today with Hymn #31... 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   3. 
 
 
 
 
     BACK ON DELIA AND ANDY 
 
                         DELIA 
               Why is he so scratchy? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               He's probably just feeling the power of 
               the lord. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Dad, no offense, but I don't think you 
               know what you're talking about. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What makes you say that? 
 
     Suddenly, everyone rises, except Andy and Delia.  She looks 
     at him, eyebrows raised. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Point taken. 
 
     Andy and Delia rise and open their hymnals. 
 
     ON THE PULPIT 
 
     Over the following, the Reverend's scratching gets worse and 
     worse.  His skin getting blotchier by the second. 
 
                         CONGREGATION 
               "Jesus is all the world to me. 
                   (scratch, scratch) 
               My life, my joy, my all; 
                   (scratch, scratch) 
               He is my strength from day to day, 
               without him I would fall." 
 
     Finally, unable to control the itching, the reverend dashes 
     off the pulpit.  Everyone stops SINGING, and looks at each 
     other, baffled.  Delia looks at Andy: 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Don't look at me?  That wasn't in the program. 
 
     As the choir starts up again, we SMASH CUT TO:

     FADE IN: 
 
3    INT. THE BROWN HOUSE. KITCHEN. THE NEXT MORNING.   3 
 
     Delia and EPHRAM eat cereal nearby, while Andy packs Delia's 
     lunch and a coat-wearing NINA looks on. 
 
                         NINA 
               Poor Reverend Keyes.  It's just 
               mortifying. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               He didn't come back out for twenty 
               minutes.  And when he did, he was covered 
               in ointment. 
 
                         DELIA 
               It was fun.  We got to sing extra songs. 
 
                         NINA 
               So are you two going to make this church 
               thing a regular event? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (shaking his head) 
               Delia asked me to take her.  It was more 
               of an exploratory mission. 
 
                         NINA 
               You're going next week though, right? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Oh, you don't want too much of a good 
               thing, now do you... 
 
                         NINA 
               I meant for the "Hope Service." 
                   (off Brown) 
               Once a year Reverend Keyes makes what's 
               known as his Hope speech.  The town fills 
               the place.  No matter their denomination. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Must be pretty inspirational. 
 
                         NINA 
               It can be.  But that's not why every one 
               really goes. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I don't get it. 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   5. 
 
 
 
 
                         NINA 
               The reverend picks the person whom he 
               feels best exemplifies hope within the 
               community.  Everyone wants to get picked. 
               Or at least see who else is gonna get 
               picked. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Ah, competitiveness springs eternal. 
 
                         NINA 
               Something like that.  There's not too much 
               suspense though, Irv Harper's won it three 
               years running. 
 
     Ephram rises, handing Andy a slip of paper. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Could you sign this? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What am I signing? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Permission slip.  For a field trip to a 
               mine. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Sounds educational. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Yes.  What kind of future will I have 
               without knowing how a mine operates? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               C'mon, Ephram.  You don't wanna be the 
               only kid in your school who doesn't know 
               where coal comes from? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
                   (takes back the slip) 
               Silver, dad.  In Colorado it's silver. 
 
                         NINA 
               Okay, the good ship Feeney is shoving 
               off... 
 
     Delia, coat on, approaches.  Andy hands her a lunch. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Bye, Daddy. 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   6. 
 
 
 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               See ya, kiddo.  Thanks, Nina.  I'll take 
               Sam and her one day this week. 
 
                         NINA 
               No problem. 
 
     They leave.  Ephram looks down at his form and hesitates. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Hey, Dad.  Y'know, I don't... have to go 
               on this. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Why wouldn't you? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
                   (treading lightly) 
               I don't know. I figured tomorrow... I 
               know it's your anniversary... 
 
     Andy doesn't seem to flinch.  But we can tell he knows very 
     well what tomorrow is. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Don't worry about that. Your mother never 
               liked to make a big deal out of our 
               anniversary anyway. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Since when?  Last year you guys flew off 
               to Hawaii. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Yeah, well.  It was one of the... smaller 
               islands.  We had a coupon. 
                   (off Ephram) 
               Your concern is appreciated, Ephram, but 
               I'm fine.  Now stop loitering.  Get to 
               school. 
 
     Andy starts clearing the table.  Ephram hesistates, but goes. 
     Off Brown, not quite as sanguine as he just pretended to be. 
 
4    INT. THE ABBOTT HOUSE. DINING ROOM. MORNING.   4 
 
     DR. ABBOTT is having breakfast and reading the morning paper 
     as ROSE cleans the table around him.  After a second,

               So, guess what Sherry and Phil are doing 
               tomorrow night?

                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               If it's running charades, you can call 
               them right now and decline the 
               invitation.  Philip tripped me on purpose 
               last time, and don't think I've forgotten 
               whose side you took. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Phil was on my team, honey.  What did you 
               expect? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Loyalty to the man who stood by you 
               during childbirth?  Twice. 
 
                         ROSE 
               They're taking a dance class together. 
               Doesn't that sound like fun? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               No. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Oh, come on.  Where's your sense of 
               adventure? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Since when does a room filled with middle- 
               aged couples desperately trying to 
               revitalize their stale marriages by 
               practicing the box step, quality as 
               adventure? 
 
                         ROSE 
               There's no box step in salsa dancing. 
 
     Rose gets up to get herself some coffee, doing a little salsa 
     move.  Abbott rolls his eyes. 
 
                         ROSE (CONT'D) 
               What do you think? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I think I don't even like salsa in my 
               Mexican food.  More coffee, please? 
 
     Rose grabs his mug and walks into the kitchen as AMY walks 
     into the dining room. 
 
                         ROSE 
               We're not finished, Harold...

     Amy waits until her mother is out of the room.  Then: 
 
                         AMY 
               Can I borrow your cell phone today? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Why do you need my cell phone?  Aren't 
               you in school all day? 
 
                         AMY 
               Yeah, but... what if they call? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
                   (realizing) 
               Amy... 
 
     Amy clearly doesn't want to have this conversation in front 
     of her mother. 
 
                         AMY 
               Please, Dad?  I really need it. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
                   (sensing her desperation) 
               It's on my nightstand. 
 
     She kisses him on the cheek and rushes out before he can 
     change his mind.  Rose re-enters. 
 
                         AMY 
               Thanks, Daddy.  Bye, Mom. 
 
     Rose hands Abbott his refreshed mug of coffee. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Thanks, dear. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Don't thank me now.  You can thank me 
               tomorrow night.  During our first 
               lambada. 
 
     Rose kisses him on the other cheek and starts to walk out. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               During our what? 
 
                         ROSE 
               Class starts at 8:00.  At the community 
               center. 
 
     Off Abbott, looking very unhappy with his present situation.

5    EXT. DOCTOR BROWN'S OFFICE. ESTABLISHING. DAY.   5 
 
     Not your typical bright, sunny Everwood day.  A block of rain 
     clouds fills the town's air space.  Hovering. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (O.S.) 
               ... So this has happened before? 
 
6    INT. DOCTOR BROWN'S OFFICE. DAY.     6 
 
     A blotchy Reverend Keyes, and his wife, MRS. KEYES, sit in 
     front of Andy's desk.  Mrs. Keyes is an attractive woman, 
     dressed very "un-preacher's-wifey" in a tailored mini-skirt 
     and low-cut blouse.  She's not slutty, but not the prim and 
     proper woman you might expect. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               It sure has.  Doctor Abbott sent me to a 
               specialist in Denver.  I was exposed to 
               every allergen on his list.  Didn't test 
               positive for a single one. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Are you currently taking any medication 
               that might--? 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               No.  And I haven't had any shellfish 
               either.  I know you doctors are big on 
               that one. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Well, it's a common-- 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Look here, Doc.  I wanna get to the 
               bottom of this as much as anyone, but 
               the most important thing right now, is 
               that I get rid of these hives before my 
               sermon on Sunday. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I heard about your sermon.  It's the one 
               about hope, right? 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               That's right.  Rekindled hope and renewed 
               faith.  And the people of this community 
               would be extremely disappointed if I 
               couldn't do it this year, on account of 
               the fact that I suddenly turned into a 
               toad.

                         MRS. KEYES 
                   (under her breath) 
               Suddenly? 
 
     Revered Keyes pretends not to have heard that, but Andy sure 
     did.  The tension between these two is thick.  Andy coughs. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               We can treat the problem immediately with 
               some antihistamines, and a topical 
               steroid cream.  But unless we figure out 
               what's causing the hives, I can't 
               guarantee you won't have another episode. 
               We should at least try to narrow down the 
               possibilities... 
 
     The Keyes look at each other.  Clearly they've already 
     narrowed it down. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Unless you've already done that. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Go on.  Tell him. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               The fact of the matter is, this doesn't 
               generally happen... that is to say, it 
               only seems to happen when the wife and 
               I... You know... when we're intimate. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               He means the rare ocassion when we 
               attempt to get it on.  Like the other 
               morning before he left for the service. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Good lord, Sarah.  You don't need to 
               spell it out for him. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               It's not like the mission was 
               accomplished. 
 
     The Reverend cringes.  Andy's starting to feel like he's in a 
     bad episode of the Newlywed Game. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Okay.  So then it's possible that your 
               wife is responsible... 
                   (off her look) 
               Not so much responsible, but, uh...

                         DOCTOR BROWN (cont'd) 
               have you been using any new products 
               lately, Mrs. Keyes?  New soaps?  Lotions? 
               Lipsticks? 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               She's got about a hundred new lipsticks 
               and lotions.  Nearly bought out the local 
               beauty store. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Don't you start... 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               It's probably as simple as that then. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Doctor Abbott suggested we do some 
               elimination techniques until we figure 
               out which product it is exactly, but the 
               sermon is in six days.  I told her she 
               should just stop using ALL that stuff, 
               until-- 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               There is no way I'm going to stop-- 
 
     Andy jumps in before a full-fledged fight begins. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I suggest, until Sunday, that the two of 
               you abstain from all physical contact. 
               In the meantime, I'll go over your files 
               with Doctor Abbott.  Perhaps there's 
               something he overlooked. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               No rush. 
 
     The reverend looks at his wife.  She refuses to make eye 
     contact.  Off Andy,

     her books.  KAYLA sits behind Amy.  WENDELL sits in front of 
     Ephram.  Their teacher, MS. CALEB, crosses between them.

               ... the town of Everwood was born because 
               of the Taggart Silver Mine, but they lost

               the silver supply dried up...

     ON AMY, picking up her phone to makes sure it's working.  She 
     clamps it to her ear, listening to a dial time. 
 
                         MS. CALEB (CONT'D) 
               Amy, dear, we don't carry cell phones to 
               class, do we? 
 
                         KAYLA 
                   (jumping in) 
               Colin's parents promised to call from the 
               hospital.  You know, if something 
               happens. 
 
                         MS. CALEB 
               Then I suggest you let the school's 
               secretary take a message.  That's what 
               those little pink pads are for. 
 
     Students chuckle.  Amy blushes.  Ephram feels for her. 
 
                         MS. CALEB (CONT'D) 
               I'm going to hand back your essays and if 
               you're not too traumatized by your 
               grades, I'd like you to split up into 
               groups of four.  Each group will research 
               the mine and share their findings next 
               week in a presentation. 
 
     Kayla turns to Amy as she tucks her phone in her purse. 
 
                         KAYLA 
                   (re: Ms. Caleb) 
               What a witch. 
 
                         AMY 
               No, she's right.  The phone's not going 
               to ring any faster if I just sit and 
               stare at it.  They know where to find me. 
 
     Sensing that Amy's put Colin out of her mind for the moment, 
     Ephram takes a leap. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Amy, any chance you, uh, want to do this 
               together?  Be in the same group?

               I noticed you're considered a longshot. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Thank god.  If the guy ever picked me I'd 
               euthanize myself. 
 
     Andy notices the manila folders still in Abbott's hand. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Those the files? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               What -- Oh, yes... 
 
     He plunks them down and Brown starts leafing through. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (CONT'D) 
               ...for all the good it'll do you.  Arthur 
               Keyes has been tested for every common 
               allergen known to man.  The only thing he 
               tested positive for is some cousin of 
               tetracycline. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Any chance Mrs. Keyes has taken that 
               antibiotic recently? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Not unless she's livestock. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Got it.  So, otherwise, nothing?

                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               He says contact with the wife is the 
               trigger, but we tested everything she 
               ate, drank, wore -- I did everything 
               short of putting the contents of her 
               bathroom in a blender and running a stick 
               test on that. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Did you?  Test the contents of her 
               bathroom, I mean? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Personally?  Every product?  No.  What 
               respectable practitioner has fifteen free 
               hours on their hands? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Me. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I said respectable practitioner. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               We could do it together.  Make a night of 
               it.  I'll buy the wine... 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               You're not serious? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               All in the interest of rekindling 
               Everwood's hope. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I'm still waiting for the day when half 
               of what dribbles out of your mouth isn't 
               vomit-inducing. 
                   (rises) 
               As tempting as the offer is, Doctor, I am 
               otherwise engaged tomorrow evening. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Yeah?  What are you doing? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
                   (sighs, then begrudgingly) 
               Dance classes with my wife. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               You know if I say nothing right now, you 
               owe me one.

               I appreciate your reticence.  Good day. 
 
     Abbott exits.  Brown smiles, digging into the Keyes file. 
 
9    INT. THE BROWN HOUSE. KITCHEN. EARLY EVENING.   9 
 
     Andy and Delia enter with bags of groceries. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Dad?  Can I spend the night at Nina's 
               tomorrow?  Sam and I are gonna play and 
               Nina promised to teach me how to bake 
               banana bread.  It could run late. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               If you inherited my "baking" genes, I 
               have no doubt it will. 
 
     The PHONE RINGS.  He grabs the phone off the counter.

     A harried travel agent, MINNIE BREWSTER, multitasks with her

               Hello?  Doctor Andrew Brown? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Yes, this is he... 
 
                         MINNIE 
               Oh, thank God.  This is Minnie Brewster -- 
               at Village Travel?  I've only been trying 
               to locate you for days!  I was about to 
               send out the FBI.  I can't believe I 
               finally found you.  I have your tickets... 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What tickets? 
 
                         MINNIE 
               Oh, no, this isn't a surprise is it?  I 
               don't have that marked anywhere on here. 
               Your wife made the reservations, I guess?

     Andy looks around, takes the phone into the HALLWAY for 
     privacy. 
 
                         MINNIE (CONT'D) 
               I wasn't here when these were booked, 
               that was Bruce but it says here 
               "Anniversary Trip for Doctor Brown and 
               wife." 
 
     Andy reacts, ashen. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Uh... My wife must have made them. 
 
                         MINNIE 
               Then it was a surprise.  Gosh, I feel 
               awful.  Well I'm not telling you the 
               destination no matter how much you try 
               and pry it out of me. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Actually, Minnie, the fact is that... 
 
     But he just can't get the words out. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
               The fact is we're in Colorado now.  Let 
               me give you that address... 
 
     Off the widower giving his address,

11   INT. DOCTOR ABBOTT'S OFFICE. MORNING.    11 
 
     Where Harold Abbott sits at his desk.  His face tells us he's 
     having an argument with himself.  And losing.  He goes to the 
     door, looks out. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Hold my calls, Louise. 
 
     He shuts the door.  He looks around his office, then moves a 
     chair out of the way, clearing a space in front of his desk. 
 
     He moves stealthily to a cabinet.  Opens it, revealing a 
     stereo.  Then, as if reaching for a stash of porn, he sticks 
     his hand behind the stereo and produces a hidden CD complete 
     with a small manual that reads: "YOU, TOO, CAN SALSA." 
 
     Harold drops the CD in and pushes play.  A LATIN BEAT plays. 
     Accompained by the VOICE of a man with a think, Latin accent. 
 
                         LATIN INSTRUCTOR 
                   (on stereo) 
               Hola.  And welcome to "You, Too, Can 
               Salsa."  Before we begin, allow the music 
               to wash over your body like a sultry 
               breeze.  Just let yourself go.  Feel the 
               rhythm.  That's right.  Feel it.  And 
               move. 
 
     And then, Harold Abbott begins... to dance.  Tentatively. 
     Badly.  With stutter steps as he tries to do some Republican 
     version of salsa dancing.  The more he tries, the more 
     awkward and frustrated he becomes.  And the more the music 
     plays, the worse he gets.  When, 
 
     The door opens and Louise enters.  Abbott spins around. 
     They're equally surprised and embarrassed. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (CONT'D) 
               Louise!  I told you to hold my calls. 
 
     Abbott races to shut the music off.  Louise just stands 
     there. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBBOT (CONT'D) 
               What is it, Louise?

                         LOUISE 
               I... I... forgot. 
 
     She leaves, closing the door behind her.  Abbott sits back 
     down at the desk, restless. 
 
12   INT. DOCTOR BROWN'S OFFICE. MORNING.     12 
 
     Andy's desk is covered in beauty products: face creams, 
     makeup, hair care products, etc.  Andy writes down the 
     ingredients of each product and checks them against the files 
     he got from Abbott.  Mrs. Keyes sits in the chair across from 
     him, legs crossed. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I'm telling you, Doctor Brown, you're 
               wasting your time. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Not at all.  I'm happy to do it.  But I 
               can drop this off to you later, if you 
               don't want to wait.  I'll be by to give 
               the Reverend a scratch test anyway-- 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               It's not the waiting.  It's just that I 
               don't believe my husband is allergic to 
               anything that's on your desk. 
                   (beat, softer) 
               He's allergic to me. 
 
     Doctor Brown looks up.  This sounds interesting. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Come again? 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               He doesn't like the changes I've made to 
               myself over the last few months, so he's 
               decided to go and get warts. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Hives. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Whatever. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               So you think his allergic reactions are 
               psychosomatic? 
 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   20. 
 
 
 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I think they're just plain psycho.  Most 
               men I know would be thrilled if their 
               wives tried to look nice for them.  Do 
               you know, for the first time in forever, 
               I can wear short skirts without feeling 
               my thighs brush up against each other? 
 
     She stands up and shows this to Andy, who is suddenly 
     extremely uncomfortable. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Yes, well... 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I've lost thirty-five pounds, I exfoliate 
               every night, and do a four-mile jog every 
               morning.  I feel great, Doctor Brown. 
               Don't I look great? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (increasingly uncomfortable) 
               You look... great. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               But he doesn't care.  I'm finally happy, 
               and all he wants is for me to go back to 
               being the dumpy, old Reverend's wife I 
               was before.  But that's not who I am 
               inside.  I never was. 
 
     She looks at Andy, searching for understanding and kindness. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES (CONT'D) 
               Fifteen years of marriage... you get 
               complacent.  It's easy to forget who you 
               are.  Who you were.  But a little while 
               ago, something inside me snapped.  It's 
               like, I woke up and saw my life going on 
               without me, and I had to do something 
               about it.  I want to live my life, Doctor 
               Brown.  I want to feel it.  Don't you 
               want to feel your life? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (beat, then) 
               Sometimes. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Were you married a long time? 
 
     Andy decides whether or not he's going to go there.  Then:

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               It would have been twenty years today. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I bet you never took her for granted. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I wouldn't take that bet. 
                   (then) 
               We're gonna figure this out, Mrs. Keyes. 
               I want to help you. 
                   (gesturing to his work) 
               This is how I can help.  Will you let me 
               try? 
 
     Mrs. Keyes looks at Andy.  For a moment, she looks like she 
     wants to say more.  But instead, she just takes her purse. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I'll see you later, Doctor Brown. 
 
     She starts to go. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Your husband wouldn't be going through 
               all these tests if he didn't love you, 
               Mrs. Keyes. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I'm sure you're right. 
 
     She walks out the door.  Andy takes a beat before getting 
     back to work.  More determined than ever. 
 
13   INT. HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. DAY.      13 
 
     Amy walks down a sunlit hallway to an open door.  Outside, a 
     sweet-faced nurse beckons.  Amy, flustered and nervous, 
     enters the room. 
 
14   INT. HOSPITAL. COLIN'S ROOM. DAY.     14 
 
     COLIN is sitting up, healthy and beautiful, watching TV.  Amy 
     seems stunned.  She stands a few feet away, unable to 
     comprehend what she's seeing.  And then... he looks at her. 
 
                         COLIN 
               I can't believe they canceled "Felicity." 
               What's up with that?

                         COLIN 
               Of course I'm awake.  What'd you expect? 
               I'm a little tired, but otherwise... 
 
                         AMY 
               I didn't know... The nurses said... 
 
                         COLIN 
               Come here. 
 
     She goes to him and wraps her hands in his.  He looks deeply 
     into her eyes. 
 
                         COLIN (CONT'D) 
               I heard you.  Everything you said.  The 
               whole time I heard you. 
 
                         AMY 
               You did? 
 
                         COLIN 
               I felt you pulling me back.  But I was, 
               like, trapped.  You know that dream where 
               you're trying to run, but your feet are 
               glued to the floor, and you're naked? 
 
                         AMY 
               Uh... I'm not usually naked in that 
               dream, but okay. 
 
                         COLIN 
               Well that's what it felt like.  Like I 
               was glued to the floor, and my mouth was 
               wired shut.  But the whole time you were 
               here, I kept wanting to say... 
 
                         AMY 
               What?  What did you want to say? 
 
     He looks deeply, beseechingly into her eyes and she melts. 
 
                         COLIN 
               I love you, Amy.  And I should have told 
               you that day at the lake, but I was 
               afraid.  I love you, and I can't live 
               without you.  You're the reason I came 
               back.  It's always been you. 
 
     Amy looks shocked.  She doesn't know what to say. 
 
                         COLIN (CONT'D) 
               Amy?

               Amy? 
 
15   INT. TAGGART SILVER MINE. DAY.      15 
 
     Kayla's insistent voice jolts Amy from her reverie.  She's 
     still clutching her cell phone tightly. 
 
                         KAYLA 
               Did you hear me?  Your phone's not going 
               to work down here. 
 
                         AMY 
               Huh? 
 
                         KAYLA 
               Your phone.  Won't work.  Don't waste the 
               battery. 
 
     Amy looks at her phone.  Kayla's right.  "No service." 
 
                         AMY 
               Shoot.  I'm gonna run outside and see if 
               there are any messages. 
 
     Amy walks out, cradling the phone to her heart, as Ephram and 
     Wendell approach. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Is she okay? 
 
                         KAYLA 
               Yeah.  She's throwing a party. 
                   (dusting off her skirt) 
               God, why do mines have to be so dirty? 
 
                         WENDELL 
                   (to Ephram, sotto) 
               I bet you wish you were that phone, bro. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Shut up, Wendell. 
 
     But Kayla definitely heard that and it did not please her. 
 
                         KAYLA 
                   (pointedly) 
               God, I cannot WAIT for Colin to wake up 
               already.  Then everything will finally 
               get back to normal around here.

                         EPHRAM 
               What's normal? 
 
                         KAYLA 
               Put it this way, you and me won't be 
               doing any more projects together. 
 
     After a second, 
 
                         WENDELL 
               I bet you guys didn't know I can lick my 
               elbow. 
 
     Kayla rolls her eyes and walks away in search of cooler 
     people.  Ephram sighs.  That's what he was afraid of. 
 
16   INT. DOCTOR ABBOTT'S OFFICE. DAY.     16 
 
     Abbott at his desk, looking at paperwork.  The INTERCOM 
     BUZZES again. 
 
                         LOUISE (V.O.) 
               Doctor Abbott?  Your wife -- 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Louise, I told you -- 
 
     Rose Abbott enters, carrying a plastic bag. 
 
                         LOUISE (V.O.) 
               -- is here. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Thank you, Louise. 
 
     Rose closes the door behind her. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Look what I've got. 
 
     She sits down in the chair opposite his desk and pulls a 
     shoebox out of the bag.  She opens the box.  Inside are a 
     pair of jazz shoes.  Abbott looks at them blankly. 
 
                         ROSE (CONT'D) 
               They're for dancing.  They're what the 
               professionals wear.  I special ordered 
               them at Sally Henderson's shop. See, you-- 
 
     She pulls them out, truly charmed and pleased by her 
     purchase.

                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I'm not going to the dance class, Rose. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Why not? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Because I don't have the time or the 
               interest. 
 
                         ROSE 
               I have the time and the interest.  I do. 
               Can't you go for me? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Life is short, Rose.  I'm getting too old 
               for frivolous pursuits. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Frivolous pursuits like... ironing your 
               shirts?  Making your bed?  Cooking your 
               eggs so they're runny in the middle but 
               firm on the outside?  Paying your bills, 
               cutting your hair, raising our children, 
               and sweeping our garage?  Those kinds of 
               frivolous pursuits? 
                   (beat) 
               I love our life.  But I don't love 
               cleaning toilets, Harold.  This is time I 
               take out of my life because I love you. 
               Time when I could be painting, or reading 
               or gardening or seeing the world.  This 
               is what I give up, what I give of myself 
               to make our marriage work.  What do you 
               give up for me? 
 
     Rose, gets up, leaving the shoes on Abbott's desk. 
 
                         ROSE (CONT'D) 
               I'll go by myself. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Oh, come on, Rose -- 
 
                         ROSE 
               I'll see you later tonight. 
 
     She leaves, shutting the door behind her.  Abbott, alone, 
     picks up one shoe and examines the heel he feels like.

17   INT. KEYES HOUSE. KITCHEN. EVENING.     17 
 
     Andy is administering a scratch test on the Reverend's back 
     while he stares at the blank screen and blinking cursor on 
     his laptop, in front of him. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               I appreciate you coming here to do this, 
               Doctor.  I like to be near the old laptop 
               in case I get hit with a thought. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               How is the sermon coming, Reverend?  Are 
               you almost finished? 
 
     Mrs. Keyes walks into the room, carrying a large Butterball 
     chicken.  She drops it in the sink, loudly, without looking 
     at her husband.  Which, of course, he notices. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Not exactly.  Let's just say the hope 
               isn't exactly flowing out me right now. 
                   (Andy pricks him) 
               Shoot, that smarts. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Sorry... How 'bout rhyming "hope" and 
               "Pope"?  That might lead to something. 
 
     Mrs. Keyes laughs. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Maybe you should have Doctor Brown write 
               your sermon.  At least he's got a sense 
               of humor. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               There's my little ego booster. 
               Glad I'm over here getting pricked to 
               death just so I can kiss you again. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Who asked you to?  I sure didn't. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Just a few more and I'll be out of your 
               way, here... 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               So, let's forget it then.  You and I can 
               sleep in separate bedrooms from now on.

                         MRS. KEYES 
               Is that a threat or a promise? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               If you could stop moving for juuuust a 
               second... 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Have you lost your mind?  Talking this 
               way in front of the doctor-- 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Doctor Brown already knows how I feel.  I 
               told him all about it this morning. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Told him all about what?  How you've up 
               and gone crazy on me? 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               We talked about life and love and 
               passion.  And how some people actually 
               have it, Tom.  Doctor Brown doesn't think 
               I'm crazy.  He thinks I'm beautiful, 
               don't you, Doctor Brown? 
 
     The Reverend looks at Andy.  Andy is suddenly trapped. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I didn't say... I said she looked great, 
               but, that's not-- 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               See?  Other men actually want to have sex 
               with me.  They don't go breaking out into 
               hives at the thought of it. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Those men don't have to live with you. 
               Watch you starve yourself on nothing but 
               chicken breasts day in, day out, piling 
               all that junk on your face, trying to be 
               someone you're never gonna be anyway. 
               Maybe if you spent less time on yourself, 
               and more time on the important things in 
               life-- 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               You mean like being your wife? 
                   (to Andy) 
               Do you see what I'm dealing with here?

               Maybe we should all sit down and try to-- 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               I think you better leave, Doctor. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Why don't we at least finish the test-- 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               No need.  We're done here anyway. 
 
     Mrs. Keyes runs into the bedroom and slams the door shut. 
     Andy collects his things and heads towards the door. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Are you sure? 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Please.  Just go. 
 
     Off Andy, walking out the door, we...

     TIGHT ON A BLACK AND WHITE POSTCARD OF EVERWOOD, CIRCA 1895. 
     Ephram studies this postcard.  Amy peers over his shoulder.

               My mom has a bigger version of that in 
               her office.  It's her favorite picture. 
 
     Ms. Caleb squeezes past STUDENTS into the shop. 
 
                         MS. CALEB 
               People, may I have your attention?  Route 
               79 has been closed due to the storm. 
 
                         KAYLA 
               Are we gonna have to sleep here? 
 
                         MS. CALEB 
               No.  But I'd like you all to contact your 
               parents on the public phones in the hall. 
               Tell them you'll be late for supper.  And 
               let's not be overly dramatic, people. 
 
     PANICKED STUDENTS SURGE past Caleb, nearly knocking her down. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               That bites.

               Kinda.  It's my father's anni -- we were 
               supposed to have dinner. 
 
     Before Amy can respond, TODD, a classmate with a permanent 
     smirk, strolls up to them.  Two BUDDIES walk in his shadow. 
 
                         TODD 
               Yo, Amy, I can't deal with the masses. 
               Can I borrow your phone? 
 
                         AMY 
               Uh... it's not really working up here. 
 
                         TODD 
               I just saw you talking on it, like, two 
               minutes ago. 
 
                         AMY 
               Yeah, well, I'd like to keep the line 
               open.  I'm expecting an important call. 
 
                         TODD 
                   (mumbles, as he walks away) 
               From Coma Boy?  Like that's gonna happen. 
 
     Amy turns to the postcard rack.  She heard that.

               There's a storm so they're making us stay 
               here until it passes. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Oh.  So, do you think it'll be long? 
               Because I can hold dinner until -- 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I think we're gonna be late.  They said 
               we won't be leaving until nine at the 
               earliest. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Oh.  So you won't make it back for 
               dinner. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I'm... sorry, Dad. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               No, no, it's fine, it's just fine. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               There's nothing I can do. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Of course not.  Lucky I didn't cook any 
               of this yet.  No harm no foul Ephram, 
               don't worry.  I'll see you when I see 
               you. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Dad -- 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Wake me up when you get home if I'm 
               asleep, okay?... Bye. 
 
     He hangs up. 
 
21   INT. TAGGART SILVER MINE. GIFT SHOP. EVENING.   21 
 
     Ephram, hangs up the phone ruefully as the next kid 
     approaches. 
 
22   INT. THE BROWN HOUSE. KITCHEN. EVENING.    22 
 
     Andy throws the food he's cut up so far in the trash, all in 
     one heap.  He sits at the table, much more disappointed than 
     he let Ephram know.  The house is silent.

     He is completely alone.  Andy glances over at the counter, 
     where a pile of mail sits.  He gets up, goes over, digs 
     through until he finds what he's looking for: a FedEx pack. 
     He contemplates for a moment, goes back to the table. 
 
     Andy opens the FedEx pack.  He pours the contents out on the 
     table: plane tickets, a map, a guidebook, an itinerary with 
     hotel reservations, and a brochure of the hotel.  Andy now 
     sees where he would be right now, where he could be, if only, 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (barely audible) 
               Florence... 
 
     As the light fades, he begins to weep quietly. 
 
                                                         FADE OUT.

     FADE IN: 
 
23   INT. MARTY'S TAVERN. NIGHT.      23 
 
     This is Everwood's only tavern and has been... forever.  The 
     gum under these tables is fossilized.  Andy sits at the bar 
     drowning his sorrows in a beer.  Very few patrons, most of 
     them regulars, populate the place. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (O.S.) 
               Are there no safe havens anymore? 
 
     Brown turns, surprised to see Abbott placing himself a stool 
     or two away. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (CONT'D) 
                   (to the bartender) 
               Macallen 12, neat. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (raising his own glass) 
               A scotch man.  We have more in common 
               than I thought. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Make it a gin and tonic, Marty. 
 
     Brown smiles.  The game that never ends. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Thought you had a dance class tonight. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Why do you remember that? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               The image of you merengue-ing is hard to 
               forget.  I take it you decided not to go. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Rose knew I wouldn't.  She signed us up 
               just to make a point. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What kind of point? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Who knows?  That I'm boring or stodgy 
               or... she's the fun one... I know, you 
               wouldn't think she'd have to struggle 
               to make that point.  Nevertheless.

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               My wife tried to sign me up for one of 
               those things once.  I think it was 
               ballroom dancing. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               And? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I didn't go either. 
 
     Doctor Abbott nods, feeling slightly justified. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
               I worked on Christmas, I worked on New 
               Year's, I worked on Thanksgiving, I was 
               working when Ephram was born.  The only 
               time Julia and I were ever alone was the 
               one week a year when we spent our 
               anniversary together. 
 
     Andy starts to sink into his memories.  The tickets that are 
     still lying on his bed.  Abbott doesn't know how to respond. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               You had a difficult schedule to keep. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I was an idiot. 
                   (finishes his drink, then) 
               You ever been to Florence? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Not yet.  But it is on my list-- 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               It's amazing.  Julia and I spent our 
               honeymoon there.  We were so young.  And 
               she was so... beautiful. 
                   (then, coming out of it) 
               You should go.  You should take Rose to 
               Florence.  I bet she'd love it. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Yes, well... Maybe next summer. 
 
     Abbott takes a sip of his drink, refusing the eye contact. 
     Marty returns with a menu. 
 
                         MARTY 
               You guys want any of the late-night 
               specials?

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Fire away. 
 
                         MARTY 
               We got spicy chicken wings, chicken 
               skewers with peanut sauce, fried chicken 
               tenders -- and by the way it's all 
               Diestel, fresh off the farm. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               What happened, Marty?  A chicken truck 
               tip over somewhere? 
 
     But Doctor Brown's mind has just fixated on something. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What did you say after the tenders... 
 
                         MARTY 
               The chicken's free range.  Means they 
               don't pump 'em with-- 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (cuts him off) 
               Antibiotics. 
 
                         MARTY 
               That's right. 
 
     Abbott and Brown share a look.  A light bulb going off. 
 
24   INT. TAGGART SILVER MINE. GIFT SHOP. NIGHT.   24 
 
     As a CLERK slips something into a bag and hands Ephram his 
     receipt, AMY'S CELL PHONE RINGS. Amy yanks it out of her 
     purse, quickly answering it. 
 
                         AMY 
               Hello?  Hello...? 
 
                         YOUNG MAN'S VOICE 
                   (on phone) 
               Is this Amy Abbott? 
 
                         AMY 
               Yes, who's this? 
 
                         YOUNG MAN'S VOICE

                         YOUNG MAN'S VOICE (cont'd) 
               I'm calling to tell you that your 
               boyfriend's doing very well. He's sitting 
               up right now and singing the greatest 
               hits of N'Sync. 
 
     Ephram peers into the hall, spots TODD MAKING THIS CALL.  His 
     BUDDIES stand by him, CRACKING UP. 
 
                         AMY 
                   (enraged, trembling) 
               Who is this? 
 
25   INT. TAGGART SILVER MINE. HALL. CONTINUOUS.   25 
 
     Ephram barrels into Todd, knocking the phone out of his hand. 
     As IT CRASHES TO THE FLOOR, EVERYONE TURNS.  AMY WATCHES THE 
     FOLLOWING FROM THE SHOP'S DOORWAY: 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               You think that's funny? 
 
                         TODD 
               Get off of me, jerk! 
 
                         EPHRAM 
                   (shoving him against the wall) 
               Do you ever think before you open your 
               stupid mouth? 
 
     Todd rises to the challenge, SHOVING EPHRAM EVEN HARDER. 
     Startled classmates start to huddle around them. 
 
                         TODD 
               Who are you, the Coma Police? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Are you really that much of a dumbass? 
               Do you have any idea what it means to 
               lose somebody?! 
 
     Just as Ephram's about to slug him, Ms. Caleb intervenes. 
 
                         MS. CALEB 
               Stop it!  Right now!  Or you'll both be 
               taking this class next semester! 
 
     Ephram backs off, continuing to glare at the shaken Todd.  A 
     DOORBELL RINGS OFFSCREEN. Followed by a persistent KNOCK. 
 
26   INT. KEYES HOUSE. KITCHEN DOOR. NIGHT.    26 
 
     The Reverend opens the door to find a very excitable Andy on 
     his doorstep.

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               It's the chicken! 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Excuse me? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Is your wife home?  I just need five 
               minutes. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Now's not a good time... 
 
     Mrs. Keyes wanders into the room, folding a sweater. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Who's at the door? 
 
     Andy steps inside, a little forward, but he's on a mission. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Mrs. Keyes, the chicken you're eating: is 
               it factory-raised or free-range? 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               Are you drunk?  You smell like liquor, 
               Doctor. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Factory-raised chickens are pumped with 
               antibiotics.  The same family of drugs 
               that you're allergic to, Reverend.  Your 
               wife's been eating an inordinate amount 
               of chicken, she's likely accrued a dosage 
               in her bloodstream that causes you to 
               react.  That's what's causing your hives! 
 
     He waits for the shower of praise.  Instead, they just stare 
     at him, devoid of any expression. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
               And why don't you seem as happy as I am. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
                   (softly) 
               We've decided to get a divorce. 
 
     A beat as Andy registers this. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Get a divorce?  No... it's all curable. 
               Don't you see?

                         REVEREND KEYES 
               We appreciate your help, but I'm afraid 
               our problems have become bigger than a 
               simple case of hives. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Simple?  Miss Marple couldn't have 
               figured out this case.  This took work. 
 
     The Reverend smiles for Andy.  But it's a weak, sad smile. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
               And so does marriage.  You both know 
               that.  You can't give up now. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               This is something we should have done a 
               long time ago.  You just helped us figure 
               it out? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I helped--?  No.  Please.  This is a 
               mistake.  What about your sermon?  What 
               about hope? 
 
     They stare at him.  Unmoved.  Then, 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I have to finish packing. 
 
     She nods to Andy and walks away.  Andy looks like he's going 
     to fall apart.  He turns to the Reverend, desperate: 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Don't make this decision today.  Please, 
               not tonight. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               What difference does it make?  Today, 
               tomorrow... 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               It makes a difference.  I promise. Just 
               not tonight. 
 
     But the Reverend has nothing left to offer Andy. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               I'm sorry.  Good night, Doctor Brown. 
 
     With that, he shows Andy to the door.  Off Andy, completely 
     shaken...

27   INT. ABBOTT HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.    27 
 
     Abbott sits in the living room watching TV.  We hear the 
     LAUGHTER of the TV audience responding to the host's joke. 
     Abbott doesn't laugh.  He looks up at the clock.  Scowls. 
 
     The door opens and Rose enters, doing a little dance step as 
     she hangs her coat.  Abbott ignores her for a second, waits 
     for her to see him.  She doesn't. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               You're home late. 
 
     Rose turns to see him and walks to the doorway. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Yes, a group of us went out for a bite 
               after class. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               A bite. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Yes.  At that new cafe down on Fourth. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               That is really immature, Rose. 
 
                         ROSE 
               What?  Dancing? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Coming in late, singing and prancing 
               around just to make me think I was in the 
               wrong.  I get it.  You probably sat by 
               yourself in the diner for two hours just 
               to make your point. 
 
                         ROSE 
               I sat in the cafe on Fourth with a lovely 
               group of people and had an intellectual 
               conversation about -- 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               An intellectual conversation? 
 
                         ROSE 
               Yes!

                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               With members of this community?  I 
               sincerely doubt that, not to mention that 
               you yourself have not engaged in an 
               intellectual conversation since the bra- 
               burning days of college -- 
 
                         ROSE 
                   (furious) 
               I beg your pardon -- 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               You made your point.  You were late 
               coming home.  I've been adequately 
               punished.  Now you can drop this silly 
               charade. 
 
                         ROSE 
               My whole world does not -- much to your 
               disappointment, I'm sure -- revolve 
               around you, Harold.  Good night. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               What did you do?  What did they teach? 
               Who was -- 
 
     Rose turns again, a flash of anger in her eyes. 
 
                         ROSE 
               No you don't.  You are not allowed to 
               pretend everything's fine when it isn't. 
               My feelings are hurt and I'm 
               disappointed.  I had a nice time without 
               you so if you can't apologize like a 
               gentleman then just leave well enough 
               alone. 
 
     Off Abbott. 
 
28   INT. TAGGART SILVER MINE. NIGHT.     28 
 
     Amy sits by herself in a facsimile of an old mining car. 
     She's wandered into this empty gallery to be alone, away from 
     the crowd.  Ephram enters.  Studies her for a moment. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Hey. 
 
     Amy turns to him, attempts a smile, but she's tired. 
 
                         EPHRAM (cont'd) 
               I think this area's off-limits.

                         AMY 
               Let 'em arrest me. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               I'll show you how to take a mug shot. 
               You can check out my seventh-grade 
               yearbook picture. 
 
     Ephram climbs into the car, settles beside her.  HER PHONE 
     RESTS ON THE SEAT BETWEEN THEM.  Long beat of silence as 
     Ephram peers up at the dank, inky walls. 
 
                         EPHRAM (cont'd) 
               Can you imagine working down here? 
               Spending whole days without ever seeing 
               the sky... 
 
                         AMY 
               I feel like I've been living down here 
               for the last six months. 
                   (then) 
               Every waking minute's been about trying 
               to get back in the light.  Trying to turn 
               back time.  Convincing Colin's parents to 
               let him have the surgery, convincing your 
               Dad that he was the only one to do it. 
               And now the surgery's over, Colin's still 
               lying in that bed and I can't convince 
               myself that any of it was worth it. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               It was. 
 
                         AMY 
                   (shaking her head) 
               No.  Even my friends look at me like I'm 
               pathetic, because I'm waiting around, 
               hoping for... 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               A miracle.  You should.  I hear they 
               happen every once in a while. 
 
     She drops her eyes, embarrassed by her emotion.  After a 
     moment, Ephram decides to take a leap: 
 
                         EPHRAM (CONT'D) 
               Can I ask you something? 
 
                         AMY 
               Sure.

                         EPHRAM 
               If he suddenly woke up tomorrow, you and 
               I... we wouldn't become total strangers. 
 
                         AMY 
               Strangers?  Ephram, I've shared more with 
               you in these last few months than I've 
               ever shared with anybody in my life. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Yeah, I know, but -- 
 
                         AMY 
               You're the only person who's been here 
               for me this whole time.  You came with me 
               to the hospital.  You helped me convince 
               your dad... the way you stood up for me 
               back there.  You're the person who's 
               gotten me through this. 
                   (beat) 
               The way I see it, if there's any miracle 
               in my life right now, it's the fact that 
               your Dad looked at a map and of all 
               places, decided to move here. 
 
     Amy turns, she's surprisingly close to Ephram.  Closer then 
     they've ever sat.  All she can see is the fear in his eyes, 
     all he can see is the beauty in hers. 
 
     Ephram leans forward, their lips touch.  And before we know 
     it -- A KISS.  They hold the kiss for about a second, before 
     Amy catches herself and quickly pulls away. 
 
                         AMY (CONT'D) 
               We should probably check... they might be 
               boarding already. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Yeah, okay. 
 
     He watches her rise unsteadily.  Then Ephram shuts his eyes. 
     Wishing he hadn't done what he just did.

     The humble place of worship shudders in the evening storm. 
     The rain and thunder can't help but remind us of the storm 
     that took Julia's life.

     Andy enters the church tentatively.  Wet from the rain.  He 
     looks around, sees that it's empty, completely angry.  He 
     finds a pew in the middle, enters. 
 
     Andy kneels awkwardly, uncertain: this is what you do, right? 
 
     He clasps his hands together, closes his eyes and bows his 
     head.  Nothing comes.  He waits for inspiration.  It doesn't 
     arrive.  He opens his eyes, looks up, 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               One year ago today.  That was the last 
               time I knew life was worth living.  All 
               my dreams died with Julia.  I wake up 
               every day and I wish I were still asleep. 
               The thing is, my heart's still pumping, 
               I'm still breathing, I still move in the 
               world like a human, living being.  But I 
               have no joy. 
                   (beat) 
               We don't talk a lot. I don't complain to 
               you, I don't ask for favors, I don't 
               whine about fairness. And I've never 
               believed you owed me anything. But I'm 
               telling you right now, I've got nothing 
               left.  I used to have a gift. Now 
               everything I touch -- everyone I touch -- 
               is just as broken as... just as broken as 
               I am. I look into the future and see... 
               nothing. Just a great, grey nothing.  I 
               have nothing to point myself toward, 
               nothing to keep me going. I've got two 
               kids. Who need a father, and a mother, 
               too. Right now I'm neither. I'm no good 
               to anyone. 
                   (beat) 
               Please, please, give me my joy back. 
                   (beat) 
               Are you listening? 
 
     PAN from Andy to the back of the church where, at the side, 
     nearly hidden behind a pillar, stands Reverend Keyes.  And he 
     is listening. 
 
31   INT. SCHOOLBUS. NIGHT.       31 
 
     Ephram boards.  He spots AMY SITTING BY HERSELF.  When their 
     eyes meet, it's an awkward moment.  Amy half-smiles, turns to 
     the already-seated Kayla, motions for her to join her.

     BACK ON EPHRAM, his worst fears already materializing.  He 
     glumly plops down beside Wendell. 
 
                         WENDELL 
               Where've you been?  I was starting to 
               think Ms. Caleb threw you down a shaft. 
 
     Ephram opens his backpack, checks on the gift shop bag. 
 
                         WENDELL (cont'd) 
               What's that? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               What does it look like?  A bag. 
 
     A CELL PHONE RINGS two rows behind them.  Amy's cell phone. 
     OVER ON AMY and KAYLA -- 
 
                         AMY 
                   (on phone) 
               Hello? 
 
                         KAYLA 
               Who is it? 
 
                         AMY 
               Hey, Dad, we're just about to leave. 
                   (then, stunned) 
               What?  When? 
 
                         KAYLA 
               What?  What is it?  Tell me.  Is this 
               about Colin? 
 
     Amy turns to Kayla, almost in a daze. 
 
                         AMY 
               He woke up. 
 
     Kayla reacts, covering her mouth, truly shocked. 
 
     BACK ON EPHRAM and WENDELL.  They've both heard this. 
     Wendell turns back to Amy, then over at Ephram. 
 
                         WENDELL 
               Dude.  Did you just hear that? 
 
     ON EPHRAM, staring straight ahead, ignoring the question and 
     plugging his ears with headphones...

32   INT. THE ABBOTT HOUSE. MORNING.     32 
 
     Rose, dressed for work and carrying a briefcase, heads down 
     the stairs.  Doctor Abbott rushes to catch up. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Rose -- 
 
                         ROSE 
               I'm late for work, Harold.  We have the 
               Planning Committee Meeting this morning. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Wait, I -- 
 
                         ROSE 
               Don't forget to pick up milk and paper 
               towels tonight. 
 
     She's just at the door as: 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Please, Rose.  Just for a minute. 
 
     She turns, reluctantly. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (CONT'D) 
               The Planning Committee will wait, 
               particularly since it's just you and 
               Jean Snotty. 
 
     She smiles a half a smile, the first he's gotten from her 
     since the whole dance class issue came up. 
 
                         ROSE 
               What is it, Harold? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I wanted to tell you what I should have 
               told you last night. 
                   (beat) 
               I'm sorry.  For being... a jerk, about 
               the dance class. 
 
     The apology comes a little late for Rose, who holds her turf. 
 
                         ROSE 
               I just want us to try new things.  I want 
               us not to get... stale.

                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I do, too. 
 
                         ROSE 
               You don't act like it.  Every time I 
               bring up a new thing to try or to see, 
               you pooh-pooh it like I had suggested we 
               go to a key party and become swingers. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I am not that bad... 
 
                         ROSE 
               You are that bad, you -- 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I'm scared.  I was scared. 
 
     This surprising admission stops her in her tracks. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (CONT'D) 
               I'm no good at dancing.  Sure I can sway 
               to the occasional wedding band assault on 
               "Love Me Tender," but Latin salsa? 
                   (beat) 
               And even deeper than my rhythm-less 
               affliction, is my fear that you'll 
               somehow outgrow me.  I don't want to 
               change.  I don't want you to change. I 
               like things the way they are. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Everyone changes.  We can change 
               together. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               That's not always the case.  Look at the 
               Keyes, she went one way, he went another 
               and now where's either one of them? 
 
                         ROSE 
               We're not the Keyes, Harold. 
 
     Rose takes Harold's hand.  His heart fills with gratitude. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Words are a poor substitute for actions 
               where love is concerned.  And I certainly 
               don't demonstrate affection half as often 
               as I should -- but my love for you, Rose, 
               is immeasurable.  You make sense of my 
               silly, little life.

               I know.  And I love you, too, Harold. 
 
     Off Rose, as they embrace, pleased with her husband's sudden 
     moment of appreciation,

     Doctor Brown makes pancakes.  Delia eats pancakes.  Ephram 
     enters, with his bulging backpack and, ignoring his plate of 
     pancakes, gets a bowl of cereal.

               They're safe to eat.  They're from a mix.

               Those aren't good for you. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Says who? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               How was the big mine trip?  You came in 
               pretty late. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               It was fine.  Oh, except for the getting- 
               stuck-for-six-hours-in-a-mine part. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Did you learn anything? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Not to go to a mine in a thunderstorm. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Useful.  Delia, go get your things, your 
               bus will be here any minute. 
 
     She runs to her room. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
               Want me to take you today? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Naah.  I'll ride my bike. 
 
     He gets up.  As he leaves, he sets down a badly-wrapped 
     present in front of Andy.

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What's this? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Happy anniversary. 
 
     Andy Brown catches his breath. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               That's very thoughtful, Ephram. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               It's... from Delia.  It was her idea. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               When did you find the time to -- 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               We got it for you a while ago.  For 
               Christmas.  But after yesterday, it 
               seemed like... she thought you could 
               use a boost. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (looking down at the gift) 
               Should I open it now or -- 
 
     But he looks up to find that Ephram has already fled any 
     pending sentiment.  Andy unwraps the gift revealing... 
 
     HIS VERY FIRST COUNTRY DOCTOR'S BAG.  He smiles. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (CONT'D) 
                   (to himself) 
               Thank you. 
 
     Delia enters, ready to go. 
 
                         DELIA 
               What's that, Dad? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               A present. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Who from? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (with a smile) 
               Well, honey, I'm not exactly sure.

     He gets up to walk Delia to the door and we remain on the 
     doctor's bag, proof positive that god works in strange ways. 
 
34   INT. THE BROWN HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. MORNING.    34 
 
     Andy is just seeing Delia off to her bus.  As he opens the 
     front door, Mrs. Keyes stands on the other side of it. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Who are you? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Mrs. Keyes? 
 
                         DELIA 
               Oh. 
                   (with a kiss) 
               Bye, Daddy. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               See ya, kiddo. 
 
     Delia heads out.  Andy's left with the Reverend's wife. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I'm sorry to bother you at home, Doctor. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Come in, come in.  I'm glad you're still 
               here.  I thought you were leaving town. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I am.  Going to stay with my mother for a 
               few days until I figure out what to do 
               next. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I wish you wouldn't go.  I feel terrible-- 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               Don't.  That's why I came by.  I don't 
               want you feeling responsible for what's 
               happening between Tom and me.  It's not 
               your fault.  And as much as I tried to 
               blame him, it's not Tom's fault either. 
 
     Andy points to the living room.  Inviting her to sit.

                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I'm sorry if I crossed a line last night. 
               I guess these days, it's difficult for me 
               to accept that anyone would choose to end 
               their marriage. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               I suppose it must look like that to you. 
               But somehow, it doesn't feel like a 
               choice to me.  It feels like the decision 
               was taken out of our hands.  Somewhere 
               down the line, Tom and I grew apart.  I 
               don't know when it was exactly.  I don't 
               even think we realized it at the time, 
               but we changed.  We started wanting 
               different things.  And we can't go back, 
               even if we wanted to.  Sometimes, I wish 
               we could, because to tell you the truth, 
               I'm scared out of my mind right now. 
                   (beat, then) 
               But I think maybe that's a good thing. 
 
     Andy regards the brave woman before him. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES (CONT'D) 
               I'll see you around, Doctor. 
 
     Before she can leave: 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Hold on a minute, Mrs. Keyes. 
 
     Andy walks over to an end table, picks up the tickets to 
     Florence and looks at them for a moment.  Exhales.  Then 
     walks back to the door, and places the tickets in her hands. 
 
                         MRS. KEYES 
               What's this? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               It's where my life began.  Maybe you'll 
               find what you're looking for there, too. 
 
     Andy smiles.  Finally released... 
 
35   INT. HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. DAY.      35 
 
     Dr. Abbott escorts a nervous Amy down the corridor.  She 
     carries a bag stuffed with gifts. 
 
 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   50. 
 
 
 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               I asked the nurse to give you some 
               privacy, but the doctors want somebody in 
               his room -- 
 
                         AMY 
               That's okay, Dad. It's better that way. 
               I mean, I... I don't know if I can handle 
               this alone. 
                   (stops before the door) 
               Do you want to come in with me? 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Is that what you want? 
 
     She takes a deep breath, frightened, exhilarated, confused. 
     She turns toward the door, steeling herself. Abbott squeezes 
     her shoulder. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT (cont'd) 
               I'll be right here. 
 
36   INT. HOSPITAL. COLIN'S ROOM. DAY.     36 
 
     ON A MEDICAL MONITOR, scanning and beeping.  FOLLOW THE TUBES 
     to the teenager attached on the other end.  This is COLIN. 
 
     He stares vacantly at a NURSE HOVERING above, changing an IV 
     bag.  Amy slowly enters, taken aback by the sight of Colin 
     sitting in an almost upright position.  With open eyes. 
 
                         NURSE 
               You can come in. 
 
                         AMY 
                   (re: IV bag) 
               If this isn't a good time -- 
 
                         NURSE 
               I'll be done in a second. 
 
     Colin's head turns slowly toward Amy.  He stares at her 
     flatly, HIS FACE IMMUTABLE AS A MASK. 
 
     Amy puts her hand up to her mouth, overwhelmed, but not 
     letting herself break down. 
 
                         NURSE (cont'd) 
               Feel free to speak.  He can hear you.

                         AMY 
                   (approaching Colin's bedside) 
               Hi there.  I wanted to be the first 
               person here when you... 
                   (rambles to fill the silence) 
               I was up on Mt. Laurel when my Dad called 
               last night and I... I would've run to 
               Denver if I could.  I... 
                   (unsettled by his eyes) 
               I stayed up all night, wrapping gifts and 
               stuff.  There's so much I want to show 
               you... I threw together a bunch of 
               pictures from last summer... 
 
     None of this seems to register with Colin. Amy turns back to 
     the Nurse who's scribbling notes on a chart. 
 
                         AMY (cont'd) 
                   (quietly) 
               Are you sure he can hear me? 
 
     Nurse nods. 
 
                         AMY (cont'd) 
               Then why is he staring at me like that? 
 
                         NURSE 
               Like what? 
 
                         AMY 
               Like he... doesn't know who I am. 
 
                         NURSE 
               Maybe he doesn't.  Considering what he's 
               been through, it's very common. 
 
                         AMY 
                   (shattered) 
               How long will it take before he does? 
               Remember? 
 
                         NURSE 
               He may have to start from scratch.  A lot 
               of these patients do. 
 
37   INT. HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. MOMENTS LATER.    37 
 
     Dr. Abbott leans against a wall, reading a paper.  Amy 
     emerges from Colin's room, heading swiftly for the elevator. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Amy?  You ready to go?

                         AMY 
                   (avoiding his eyes) 
               Yeah. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               You all right? 
 
                         AMY 
               Of course, I'm all right.  I've been 
               waiting for this moment for six months. 
                   (a taut smile) 
               Colin's back. 
 
     She presses the elevator button repeatedly, tears welling in 
     her eyes.  Abbott puts his arm over her shoulder. Pulls her 
     close.  And we go... 
 
38   EXT. EVERWOOD'S HOPE CHURCH. MORNING.    38 
 
     The sun shines.  People rush in, ORGAN MUSIC rushes out. 
 
39   INT. EVERWOOD'S HOPE CHURCH. SAME.     39 
 
     Parishioners pile in for the service, excitement in the air. 
     PAN down a pew to FIND Irv, Edna, Rose, Amy, Doctor Abbott, 
     Ephram, Delia and, finally, Andy. 
 
     Each character expresses a different relationship to the 
     "hope sermon" about to be given.  But Andy is the only one 
     shrouded in doubt: will Reverend Keyes even speak this year? 
 
     Suddenly, silence, as Reverend Keyes walks to the lectern. 
     He pauses a moment before speaking.  And then it becomes a 
     moment too long.  The crowd fidgets anxiously. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES 
               The gift of community is that each one of 
               us is absolved of the burden of 
               completeness, in and of ourselves, at 
               every moment.  We can lean on one another 
               for the elements we lack.  This week I 
               leaned on one of you.  For this week, 
               I lost my marriage. 
 
     The crowd erupts into surprised whispers.  But Reverend Keyes 
     continues.

                         REVEREND KEYES (CONT'D) 
               Isn't this truly the meaning of hope -- 
               the ability to look into the future and 
               imagine a better moment, a glimmer of 
               beauty to strive for?  This week, I lost 
               all that. 
 
     He pauses.  Silence. 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES (CONT'D) 
               At the moment when I was without reason, 
               no longer able to find meaning of my own, 
               I came here, to this church.  I believed, 
               as I have in other moments of need, that 
               I would find God here.  I did not. 
 
     The crowd almost panics.  Is this the hopelessness speech?? 
 
                         REVEREND KEYES (CONT'D) 
               What I found inside this church was a man 
               more dispirited than myself, crying out 
               to our Lord for comfort, and receiving 
               none.  I say to this man today, I cannot 
               fix your broken heart.  I cannot mend 
               your weakened spirit.  I cannot heal your 
               grief.  What I can do is pour the love of 
               this community into your wound as your 
               own faith was a healing salve unto my 
               own. 
                   (beat) 
               I am reminded of a quote from an ancient 
               text.  "Love lives by hope and dies when 
               hope is dead."  To this man, to my 
               brethren, I say love has died, in my life 
               and in your own.  For now.  But hope is 
               not dead.  Nor is joy.  Hope will rise 
               again, and with it the return of love, 
               joy and peace.  To this man I say, if you 
               will strive to find meaning, so shall I. 
               If you will endeavor to rebuild your 
               life, if you will marshal the strength 
               required, I will seek the courage within 
               myself.  Your suffering, your strife, 
               your determination will be my hope. 
                   (beat) 
               Each year I select a member of this 
               community who represents the value of 
               hope.  This year I would like to single 
               out the man most deserving of our own, of 
               this community's light and life.  That 
               man is Doctor Andrew Brown. 
 
     The crowd whispers, points, etc.  Our regulars look at Andy, 
     some surprised, some pleased, etc.

               There are two states in this life, love 
               and a call for love.  It is the latter 
               which is the most requiring of bravery. 
               Come together as a community and help 
               this courageous man find what he came 
               here to seek.  Peace.  Joy.  Hope. 
                   (beat) 
               For us all. 
 
     And Reverend Keyes exits the pulpit.  MUSIC PLAYS and they 
     all rise for another hymn. 
 
40   EXT. EVERWOOD'S HOPE CHURCH. AFTER THE SERVICE. DAY.   40 
 
     The service now over, the PARISHIONERS stream out of church, 
     shaking hands with the Reverend, etc.  We find Davenport on 
     the church steps, interviewing Irv who is clearly not 
     enjoying this interview as much.  Edna, however, loves it. 
 
                         IRV 
               I'm happy for Doctor Brown.  Really I am. 
 
                         DAVENPORT 
               What do you think your chances are for 
               making a comeback next year?  Or is this 
               is it for Irv Harper? 
 
                         IRV 
               Next year, who knows?  I plan to stay 
               positive, keep doing the work-- 
 
     Davenport sees Andy coming down the stairs and immediately 
     rushes to him, cutting Irv off. 
 
                         DAVENPORT 
               Doctor Brown!  Doctor Brown could I get a 
               quote, please? 
 
     As soon as he's gone. 
 
                         EDNA 
               C'mon, honey.  Let's go home.  I'll make 
               you a bowl of 'hope' chili.  Then maybe 
               we can snuggle up on the couch and watch 
               Hope Floats... 
 
                         IRV 
               You're loving this, aren't you? 
 
                         EDNA 
               A little bit.

     CAMERA pans over to Doctor Brown, as Davenport takes his 
     picture.  Delia and Ephram wait behind him. 
 
                         DAVENPORT 
               ... thanks, Doc.  Oh, and could you tell 
               me who you are wearing? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Men's Warehouse. 
 
     Davenport jots that down and goes.  Delia takes Andy's hand. 
 
                         DELIA 
               I'm hungry. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Twelve hours of church will do that. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Mama Joy's sound good to anyone? 
 
     The Abbotts (minus Bright) walk down the stairs.   Amy and 
     Ephram still have lingering "mine" awkwardness between them. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Congratulations, Doctor Brown.  I think 
               the Reverend made a fine choice. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Thank you, Mayor. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
                   (to Amy) 
               Where's Bright? 
 
                         AMY 
               Oh, he had football practice.  He's not 
               real big on church, anyway. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Well, that's one thing we have in common. 
                   (then) 
               So, did you get to see--? 
 
                         AMY 
                   (quickly, to her dad) 
               Are we going to eat?  I'm starved. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Your mother will be picking the 
               restaurant today.  Right, dear? 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   56. 
 
 
 
 
     Rose smiles, appreciating the gesture. 
 
                         ROSE 
               How about Mama Joy's? 
 
                         DELIA 
               That's where we're going! 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               We could share a table. 
 
     Abbott sighs, then: 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Oh, why not? 
 
     As the two families head down the church steps, 
 
                         NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               The Browns and the Abbotts left church 
               that day with each other to lean on and 
               what more could any parishioner expect of 
               a Sunday?  Not counting of course the 
               brunch at Mama Joy's, which even the most 
               reverential of churchgoers will secretly 
               admit is their favorite part. 
 
     The CAMERA pulls up and away from Everwood's Hope Church and 
     it's last exiting PARISHIONERS.  All of them, and us, leaving 
     the service with something more then they we came in with. 
 
                                                          FADE OUT.
