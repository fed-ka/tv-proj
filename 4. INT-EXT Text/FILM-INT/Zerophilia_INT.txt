A small, run-down service garage, crammed with tires, tools
and discarded car parts.
Luke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke.
MAX, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair
and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag.
Dripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck,
chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench, which he
occasionally REVS for emphasis.
MAX
I can do the gasket for twenty
bucks. But new T-sprocks, for this
thing? Two, three hundred, maybe?
LUKE
Shit.
Can I hold off on that?
MAX
No skin off my ass. But a few
days, weeks, your whole
transmission could blow.
LUKE
Ah, Jeez.
I shouldn't got this.
7.
Max considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and
SIGHS.
MAX
Four hundred seventy-five
horsepower. Twenty-eight inch
wheels. It's a classic. Let me
dig around out back. Maybe we got
a used set.
LUKE
That'd be great.
Thanks.
Max disappears through a squeaky door at the back.
Luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender.
He sits, impatient for Max to return.
He examines Max's cap, tries it on. He picks up the torque-
wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner
of Max.
He spins around and REVS the wrench, catching sight of
MICHELLE, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and T-
shirt, with warm, confident eyes.
Luke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights.
He sets
down the torque-wrench.
LUKE (CONT'D)
It's not my wrench. It's my truck.
MICHELLE
What's wrong with it?
LUKE
Oh, just needs a new gasket and a
couple T-sprocks. The flanges are
sheared off.
No big deal.
MICHELLE
You have to watch my brother, Max.
He's sellin' you "T-sprocks?"
LUKE
Yeah?
MICHELLE
There's no such thing. Last week
he sold Mrs. Gustafson a whole set:
six hundred bucks. My name's
Michelle.
8.
LUKE
From New York. Poli-Sci transfer.
I sort of asked around campus.
MICHELLE
You did?
LUKE
You've prob'ly already got a
stalker, huh?
MICHELLE
No.
Luke stares, awkward.
LUKE
You heard about Cafe Lunizia?
Italian? They got New York style
pizza. Make you feel at home.
MICHELLE
You askin' me out?
LUKE
Oh, well, uh, -definitely!
An SUV pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with Keenan and
OTHER GUYS. CHAD, exuding supreme self-confidence, calls
over to Luke as he pumps gas.
CHAD
Hey, Spanky, let's go! Look
forward to kickin' your puck ass.
LUKE
My ride.
MICHELLE
Your name's "Spanky?"
LUKE
No, Puck Ass, but people just call
me Luke. We're beatin' his frat
boy team in street hockey. Pisses
'em off.
MICHELLE
I'll talk to Max. Tell him to just
replace the gasket.
Luke's BREATHING grows HEAVIER.
9.
LUKE
Thanks. So, what do you think?
I'll just sit there while you eat.
I won't even talk.
MICHELLE
Look, I just split up with this
total amoeba.
LUKE
Oh, I'm a paramecium. That's way
more evolved. I'm practically pond
scum.
MICHELLE
Maybe I'll give you a call when the
truck's ready.
LUKE
Great.
You mean to go out, right?
Michelle smiles, and walks out through the squeaky door at
the back. Keenan approaches.
KEENAN
(a whisper)
Whoa. That was her!
Jesus, you're
sweatin' like crazy.
Luke sits, nods 'yes,' wipes BEADS of SWEAT from his brow.
LUKE
We're goin' out.
Keenan gives him a high-five.
Luke smiles, catching his
breath.
A small, run-down house. Hockey gear, dirty laundry and
Keenan are strewn across the garage-sale sofa. He munches a
burrito while watching the game.
LUKE (O.S.)
KEENAN!
COME HERE, QUICK!!!
Keenan leaps up.
KEENAN
WHAT?!
He races down the hall, sliding on the linoleum.
10.
BATHROOM
Luke, a towel around his waist, stares at himself in the
mirror, horrified.
LUKE
Look!
My chest!
Keenan looks, clueless, a little uncomfortable now.
KEENAN
Yeah?
LUKE
I had hair. Come on! Not a lot,
but you've seen me -some- right?
KEENAN
Okay, I don't know.
So?
LUKE
Well, where'd it go?
Keenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand, now mashed.
KEENAN
I really thought you gettin' laid
was gonna' help. What is it with
you, man? I mean, you're smarter
than me, you're better lookin' than
me.
LUKE
I am not.
KEENAN
I know. But I'm just sayin', you
can get any girl you want.
LUKE
Easy for you, you've got Janine.
KEENAN
I'm still workin' on my GED. How
long you think Brainiac's gonna'
wanna' hang with that?
LUKE
She worships you.
11.
KEENAN
Man, I'm gonna' be that wild fling
she had with the local dude from
the bike shop. "God, what was his
name?"
LUKE
You're crazy.
Keenan gives him a look of "I'm crazy?"
KEENAN
You're gonna' have a great time
with her tonight. Just be
yourself. ...Mostly.
The decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any
second. Barbells on the floor. Luke dodges and weaves,
slugging a makeshift punching bag.
Keenan appears, wiping sleep from his eyes.
KEENAN
We takin' up boxing?
LUKE
I don't know. I am.
KEENAN
What's goin' on? You competin' for
Mr. Universe this week?
LUKE
Everyone should just mind their own
fucking business!
Keenan recoils at the attitude.
KEENAN
Didn't go so great, huh?
Luke punches the bag, harder and faster, a near SEIZURE: ROAD
RAGE.
He collapses in a heap.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
Dude.
LUKE
It was goin' great. She's amazing.
Funny. And really smart.
And the
way she eats ravioli, like 'aah.'
KEENAN
Cool.
16.
LUKE
Then I started feelin' all weird
again, and,... oh, man, you'll
think I'm nuts... Keen, I had
breasts. I felt 'em.
KEENAN
Whoa, first date.
Definitely the
'new Luke!'
LUKE
No!
On me.
KEENAN
You're startin' to creep me out.
Listen, I think I know what's goin'
on, okay? "Acute Adolescent
Anxiety." It's from the stress of
college, girls, grades. It's
really common.
LUKE
I'm not an adolescent.
Where'd you
get this crap?!
KEENAN
The Net. I found all the symptoms
right off: panic attacks,
"Localized Alopecia" -that's hair
loss. This doctor wrote back, "Any
chance your friend, Luke, just lost
his virginity?"
LUKE
You told, -you gave him my name?!
KEENAN
He's a doctor, back East. He's
sending this information pack.
Look, I started thinkin' you're
goin' bipolar on me or somethin'.
Come on, man, BREASTS?!
Luke considers.
On a corner table sits high-tech laboratory equipment.
Keenan and Luke gulp beers, still in shock.
Luke keeps one
hand down his pants for reassurance.
SYDNEY
In the world?
A hundred. A
thousand. There's no way to know.
It doesn't show up in any normal
DNA test. It's triggered when you
first have sex.
LUKE
The woman in the RV!
KEENAN
(dark)
From Utah.
SYDNEY
Now, you're Morphescent whenever
you're aroused.
KEENAN
You tellin' me this is gonna'
happen any time he gets the hots
for a girl?
Keenan looks over at Luke...
KEENAN (CONT'D)
Man, this could be a problem.
34.
LUKE
Is there a cure?
SYDNEY
It's not a disease!
But there are
steps you can take.
LUKE
Well, what are they?
SYDNEY
Take it easy. You can't rush this.
Before anything, you need to try
going all the way.
KEENAN
"All the way?"
SYDNEY
You need to turn all the way into a
female.
LUKE
You out of your mind?!
SYDNEY
You have to give it a try.
KEENAN
Maybe we should get a second
opinion.
LUKE
Yeah, may be! 'Cause you can
FORGET THAT!
SYDNEY
Fine, but I warn you, they've never
seen this before. First, they'll
try a barrage of antipsychotic
medications, surgery, electroshock
therapy, -god knows what.
KEENAN
If he were to try goin' all the
way, then what?
Luke glares at him.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
I'm just askin'.
35.
LUKE
It ain't gonna' happen!
SYDNEY
Oh, for Chris' sake! I'm trying to
help you. That Z chromosome's not
latent anymore! You don't get
control a' that thing, you don't
know when it's going to kick in,
what it's gonna' do! You want to
end up with three left breasts,
behemoth hips and one testicle?!
Luke and Keenan swallow, wide-eyed at the prospect.
Sydney calms herself down.
SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Now, there's no reason for that to
happen. Sorry. You're not the
only one who didn't get any sleep.
Now, are you going to let me help,
or not?
KEENAN
How would he even do that?
Go all
the way, I mean?
SYDNEY
He's a Z.
(to Luke)
You become Morphescent when you get
turned on. You can change all the
way when you have an orgasm.
LUKE
With who?
SYDNEY
I'm available.
LUKE
No way!
SYDNEY
Well, excuse me. Truth is, at this
stage, you don't really need anyone
else.
LUKE
Huh?
36.
Sydney wearily sips a highball. She looks to Keenan for
help. Keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off.
LUKE (CONT'D)
Oh.
SYDNEY
It's a lot to absorb, I know. When
you're ready, give me a call. Your
first time, you shouldn't be alone.
Luke storms through the house, trying to evade Janine, who
enthusiastically follows. Keenan traipses after.
LUKE
You TOLD HER?!
KEENAN
I had to. You know Janine.
She
knew somethin' was up.
JANINE
I've read about this kinda' thing,
but I didn't think it was real.
It's so cool!
LUKE
It's disgusting!
JANINE
How can you say that? If I had a
chance to be a guy for a day, I'd
jump at it. Seriously, Keen,
wouldn't you want to get inside a
girl's body?
Realizing she just handed him the perfect straight line...
JANINE (CONT'D)
Don't EVEN go there!
(rolling her eyes)
Fine. You're boys. Still, isn't
it every guy's dream to have a pair
of boobs to play with anytime he
wants?
LUKE
Not my own!
(to Keenan)
Man, how could you tell her?!
KEENAN
She should be here. It's just
weird, two guys alone, one turnin'
into a girl.
JANINE
Yeah, I can't wait. Not exactly
something you get to see every day.
LUKE
Forget it!
40.
JANINE
What, HE gets to, and I don't!
LUKE
No one gets to!
Luke goes in the bedroom, SLAMS the door.
Keenan and Janine take up residence outside.
Janine tries to peek through the keyhole, beneath the door.
JANINE
Should we put on some soft music?
KEENAN
You want a magazine in there?
LUKE (O.S.)
Shut up!
LATER
Janine keeps an ear held close against the door.
KEENAN
How 'bout a couple beers?
JANINE
Maybe you want to take a bath?
LUKE (O.S.)
Will you PLEASE shut up?!
JANINE
Does he sound different?
KEENAN
Think so.
LUKE (O.S.)
Oh God!
(lewd)
Oh, my God!
(rising in pitch)
Oh my GAWD!
Keenan and Janine exchange a worried look.
41.
INSIDE THE BEDROOM
Now approaching the mirror, in awe, ...gently raising a hand
to touch the exquisite FEMALE FACE reflected there, stands a
real female, an absolutely FEMALE LUKE.
OUTSIDE THE DOOR
Janine knocks.
JANINE
Luke?
You alright?
The door opens, revealing Female Luke, wrapped in a sheet.
Keenan clutches Janine.
They STARE, AT A TOTAL LOSS, INCREDULOUS...
KEENAN
Whoa.
JANINE
Dude.
Female Luke speaks, with an unmistakably female voice.
FEMALE LUKE
Happened fast, huh?
JANINE
Can we see?
Female Luke hesitates.
KEENAN
Come on. It's not like I haven't
seen you naked a hundred times.
And she's a girl!
Female Luke shyly parts the sheet, revealing her stunning
naked torso.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
Whoa.
JANINE
Dude.
(exasperated)
Of course they're perfect. I
couldn't have tits like that?
Female Luke checks herself out in the mirror.
42.
FEMALE LUKE
Oh, God.
Look at me.
Keenan and Janine sit on the edge of the bed, in shock.
FEMALE LUKE (CONT'D)
What's the matter?
Keenan, afraid to answer, looks to Janine.
They both have the same reaction...
JANINE
You're really hot.
Victoria's
Secret hot.
KEENAN
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit
edition.
JANINE
Latvian Lesbians' Hidden Camera
Chronicles.
(to Keenan)
Don't look at me, -it's your tape.
Keenan keeps his distance from Luke, embarrassed, if turned
on.
KEENAN
Look, I just wanna' get one thing
straight. No way I'm gonna' sleep
with you.
FEMALE LUKE
Man, even as a joke, that's just
SICK!
JANINE
I will. I'm definitely not into
the butch hair thing, though.
You
gotta' do something about that.
Keenan looks at her shocked.
JANINE (CONT'D)
I thought you're into watchin' two
girls?
Keenan's speechless.
Female Luke can't stop gazing at herself in the mirror.
43.
FEMALE LUKE
This is too weird. This is
freaking me out.
KEENAN
Should we call Dr. Catchadourian?
FEMALE LUKE
What for? I did it. Now, I can
switch back. Get outta' here.
JANINE
Already?
KEENAN
Yeah, okay, yeah.
JANINE
Will you stop starin'?!
Janine rolls her eyes, as she and Keenan back out of the
room, their eyes locked on her amazing body.
OUTSIDE BEDROOM - LATER
Janine and Keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch.
Luca opens the door.
FEMALE LUKE
Janine? It's like I can't get in
the right mood or something.
JANINE
Welcome to my world. Oh, honey, no
one could in this situation.
FEMALE LUKE
You gotta' help. I need to do this
right now!
JANINE
You can't force these things.
KEENAN
Some girls go half their lives
before they even have one.
JANINE
Okay, Studly, what do you suggest?
44.
KEENAN
She likes it when I tell her stuff.
JANINE
Like what?
KEENAN
"You're so beautiful,"
"I love your smile,"
"The English Patient was my
favorite movie too."
Janine and Female Luke both roll their eyes.
Female Luke
swings the door shut.
The DOORBELL CHIMES.
FEMALE LUKE (O.S.)
Who's that?!
KEENAN
Pizza!
Figured you'll want some
after.
FRONT DOOR
Janine throws it open, Max stands outside.
MAX
Hey.
JANINE
Can I help you?
MAX
I was lookin' for Luke.
KEENAN
Hey, man. He's not around right
now. What's up?
Female Luke comes out of the bedroom, wrapped in a sheet.
FEMALE LUKE
Thank God.
I'm starving!
She stops in her tracks, stares at Max.
Max stares back, intrigued.
MAX
How ya' doin'?
45.
Female Luke nods 'okay.'
MAX (CONT'D)
I'm Max.
You live here too?
Janine, Keenan, and Female Luke are momentarily speechless.
JANINE
No.
She's just visiting.
KEENAN
She's Luke's cousin.
JANINE
Luca.
Keenan and Luca GLARE at Janine.
Max gazes at Luca, spellbound.
MAX
I always thought "Luca" was a guy's
name? Italian or something.
Luca wraps herself more tightly in the sheet.
LUCA
I'm part Italian.
MAX
Cool. I'm part Italian too. The
important part.
(perfect Italian)
Lei sono una bella donna. Amerei
per mostrarlo il che inclinando
torre di pisa.
LUCA
What's that mean?
His eyes fixed on Luca, he smiles.
MAX
You in town for a while?
JANINE
No, just a few weeks.
LUCA
'Weeks?!'
KEENAN
Days.
46.
LUCA
I'm leaving today!
Now!
KEENAN
Is there anything you want me to
tell Luke?
Max gets fluid, scanning the room for a toehold, infatuated
by Luca. He seizes on a hockey stick.
MAX
I'm way into hockey. I was hopin'
Luke could show me the ropes. Is
he as awesome as I've heard?
LUCA
Yeah.
He's alright.
MAX
Do you play?
LUCA
Uh, I don't know.
JANINE
She's gotta' pack.
You need to go.
MAX
Really nice meeting you.
Janine ushers Max out the door and shuts it on him.
Luca ducks into the bedroom, shuts the door.
INSIDE BEDROOM
Luca at the window, peers out between the curtains, watching,
as Max walks away.
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
As Max gets to the end of the driveway, he stops and turns
back, sporting a charming smile.
INSIDE THE BEDROOM
Luca jumps away from the window, smacking into Janine.
JANINE
Are you okay?
Luca just stares back at her, nonplussed.
47.
JANINE (CONT'D)
What is it? What's
the matter?
(beginning to get it)
Oh...
LUCA
"Oh" what?
What do you mean, "oh?"
JANINE
(shrugs)
He's a hunk.
LUCA
I got to switch back.
Right now!
JANINE
What's the big deal?
LUCA
Get out of here!
Just GET OUT!
JANINE
Okay, okay.
OUTSIDE BEDROOM
Janine emerges from the bedroom to join Keenan.
He looks up
at her, questioning.
KEENAN
What's goin' on?
JANINE
It's a girl thing.
KEENAN
Does he need any help in there?
JANINE
Not from you.
OUTSIDE BEDROOM DOOR - LATER
Keenan and Janine sprawled out, leaning against the door,
half-eaten pizza between them on the floor, WEARY.
BUZZING emanates from inside the bedroom.
LUCA (O.S.)
This is good!
48.
Keenan and Janine PERK UP.
KEENAN
Finally.
JANINE
Alright, okay, now open those
little levers on the sides,... and
flip that center thingy back...
Keenan finds this particularly unsettling.
LUCA (O.S.)
(enthused)
Did you get this thing at the mall?
JANINE
No.
KEENAN
Janine wouldn't have one a' those.
JANINE
Please. And mine's got way more
features than that one.
(Keenan's crotch)
Or that one.
Keenan gives her the evil eye.
LUCA (O.S.)
So, where'd you get it?
JANINE
It was Larissa's.
My roommate.
Inside the bedroom, the BUZZING STOPS.
LUCA (O.S.)
GROSSS!!!
OUTSIDE DOOR
Keenan grabs the last bottle from his six-pack.
KEENAN
I'm just sayin', he's not that
experienced with girls.
JANINE
Oh, and you are?
49.
KEENAN
I'm startin' to wonder if you are?
JANINE
I'm not gonna' feed your fantasies.
Keenan flips the TV remote, disturbed.
INSIDE THE BEDROOM
Luca sits on the edge of the bed, frustrated.
JANINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Luca?
LUCA
Don't call me that!
JANINE (O.S.)
You gotta' just think about
whatever turns you on. No matter
what it is.
Luca considers, she goes over to the window, peers out
momentarily, then draws back.
OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM
Janine lies down on the floor.
JANINE (CONT'D)
(last ditch)
Okay, pretend you're thrown on your
back, pinned against the bed...
Spread eagle, eyes closed, she fantasizes, as she directs...
JANINE (CONT'D)
You can't move an arm, a leg,
nothing, even an inch!
Keenan glances over, taken aback at her tone...
JANINE (CONT'D)
And two strong hands feel your
thighs,...
Keenan watches, getting turned on...
JANINE (CONT'D)
creeping firmly, slowly toward your
breasts...
50.
Keenan lunges for Janine.
JANINE (CONT'D)
Keen!
KEENAN
Babe, every time I look at you, I
get the shivers! I just want to
rip your clothes off, and throw you
down...
JANINE
Oh, Keen!
They're kissing, ROLLING AROUND TOGETHER now,...
KEENAN
I want to envelop every inch of
you, that incredible curve along
your side,...
They roll on the floor, clothes torn...
KEENAN (CONT'D)
I want to pin your arms over your
head, and make mad, passionate...
LUCA (O.S.)
AAAHHH!
Keenan and Janine RECOIL.
Whether agony or ecstasy, it's a frightening sound.
The door opens.
Luke stands in his shorts, ALL MALE.
JANINE
You're a screamer.
Sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with
Jeremy.
JEREMY
This shirt? I've had it for years.
SYDNEY
Well, it's very sexy. I love men's
clothes. What else have you got in
your closet?
Jeremy smiles, unsure what she means. When Polly approaches,
her eyes a little red, Jeremy pulls her aside.
JEREMY
Polly, are you alright?
Didn't
mean to walk in on you.
POLLY
Oh, hon. I'm fine, thanks. Love,
tears. That's the trade-off.
She puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring.
Jeremy ducks
behind the bar.
SYDNEY
My God, he's gorgeous.
POLLY
Yes, he's a Michelangelo. And the
sweetest boy in the world. Sorry,
darling, I'm afraid you'll find
he's not your type.
SYDNEY
Oh, we'll see about that.
57.
POLLY
I think he may prefer men.
SYDNEY
I certainly hope so.
Keenan and Janine enter.
SYDNEY (CONT'D)
You two better have a seat.
JANINE
Is Luke alright?
SYDNEY
He should have full control over
this now. Something must be really
confusing him. The only thing I
can think of...
KEENAN
What?
SYDNEY
When he became Luca, was he
attracted to one of you? You can
get really thrown by that. Janine?
JANINE
No.
Not me.
KEENAN
Well, he sure as hell wasn't
attracted to me.
JANINE
No.
Definitely not.
SYDNEY
Wasn't it just the two of you?
JANINE
Not exactly.
Janine glances to Keenan, as his eyes GO WIDE, grossed out.
KEENAN
Oh, give me a break! No way!
Max?! They just had a huge fight.
He tried to beat the crap out of
him!
Janine and Sydney exchange a knowing look.
58.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
Oh, Christ, Luke's not queer!
He
was just turnin' into a girl!
JANINE
Exactly.
He was a girl.
KEENAN
Oh!
This is just wrong.
JANINE
Would you rather she was attracted
to me?
KEENAN
Would you?!
JANINE
Maybe I would!
SYDNEY
Whoa! HANG ON! Right now, Luke
needs your help. He needs to know
you're behind him, no matter what
he wants.
Janine nods.
JANINE
So, what's all this mean?
SYDNEY
Bottom line? Maybe Luca really
likes this boy, -enough to want to
be female.
JANINE
(to Keenan)
Don't sneer!
KEENAN
Oh, come on! I know the guy.
We've done all kinds a' shit
together: Hoops, hockey!
JANINE
Oh, and girls can't play sports?!
KEENAN
Oh, -whatever! Christ, Janine!
Why the hell would he want to be a
girl?!
59.
JANINE
That's so hard to imagine?!
KEENAN
Uh, -YEAH!
SYDNEY
HEY! LISTEN UP! I know what I'm
talking about. You see this?
Sydney pulls out a SNAPSHOT, shows it to Janine.
JANINE
Who's he?
An Ex?
...Oh, my God.
SYDNEY
Ex me.
KEENAN
You're one too?
You're a Z?
You're a guy?!
SYDNEY
Was.
I made a terrible mistake.
She and Keenan keep staring at the photo...
SYDNEY (CONT'D)
And once you finally figure out who
you are, it's a horrible thing not
being yourself. That's why it's
crucial we help Luke.
Janine nods, grasping the significance.
Keenan keeps looking from the photo to Sydney and back again.
KEENAN
You musta' worked out.
Luke kneels on the floor, stocking candy shelves.
The CHIME BINGS.
He peers over the aisle, looks around, no one in sight.
Michelle appears by the soda dispenser, wary of him.
MICHELLE
Hi.
LUKE
Hey.
How are you?
MICHELLE
I'm okay.
You?
As they talk, Michelle maneuvers to get closer.
Luke maneuvers to keep his distance.
LUKE
Okay.
You look really nice.
MICHELLE
Thanks.
I was hopin' you might
call.
LUKE
I was going to.
MICHELLE
There's something I need to talk to
you about. -But did I do something
wrong?
LUKE
No. Nothin' like that. There's
just some stuff I've got to sort
out.
63.
MICHELLE
Like what?
They gaze at each other across the magazine rack,
a mountain range of silence between them,...
MICHELLE (CONT'D)
There's nothing you can't tell me.
LUKE
Me too. What did you want to talk
to me about?
They stand silent, beneath the hum of fluorescent lights.
MICHELLE
Nothing really.
So, heard you and
Max really got into it?
LUKE
Yeah.
I kind a' lost it.
MICHELLE
He knows how to push buttons, huh?
What exactly did he say that got
you so pissed off?
LUKE
I don't know. We'd just finished a
game. I was all revved up.
MICHELLE
He's actually a really nice guy.
LUKE
Not sure he's too crazy about me
seein' his sister.
MICHELLE
Did he scare you off?
LUKE
No, he doesn't "scare" me. What,
his struttin' around, thinkin' he's
such a bad ass, with his shirt
hangin' open half the time?
Luke's surprised and embarrassed by his own words.
Michelle steps away, confused.
64.
MICHELLE
It's just an act. He likes
pretending he's Joe Cool. Always
says you gotta' just be whatever
you want, and fuck 'em if they
can't take a joke.
LUKE
Well, he's a joke alright.
MICHELLE
Look, I'm not sure this is gonna'
work out.
LUKE
I'm sorry, I didn't mean-
MICHELLE
No. I can't do this. I'm not sure
you even know who you are. Much
less who I am. Have you ever even
had a girlfriend?
LUKE
What's that supposed to mean?!
MICHELLE
Well, if you think my brother's
such a "joke," how much better
could you think of me? We're not
that different, you know?
LUKE
You're totally different.
He's a
guy, for one.
MICHELLE
And he's my best friend. If you
don't like him, you can't like me.
She exits.
MINI-MART - LATER
Luke kneels in the aisle, stocking shelves, distracted,
fidgety, distressed.
He glances up at the magazine rack. A Female Fitness
magazine catches his attention. The BEAUTIFUL COVER model
seems to MOVE.
He stares at it: no movement.
65.
Luke approaches the rack, and flips over the magazine cover.
As he steps away, he glances back at the rack,
CELEBRITY MAGAZINE COVER
The ADONIS on the cover comes to life. He rips off his shirt
as he moves off one magazine cover and into another, where he
passionately kisses the BIKINI-CLAD COVER MODEL.
MAGAZINE RACK
THE MODELS AND OTHERS on half a dozen covers begin stripping
down, moving to other magazines and making out with each
other all across the rack.
OUTSIDE THE MINI-MART
The windows glow among the dark trees.
Inside, Luke rips up covers, HURLING magazine after magazine
across the floor.
INTERCUT WITH:
INSIDE BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT
Michelle leans against the shower wall, staring at the spray
of water, upset.
Steam rises, filling the bathroom.
She begins SINGING, longingly,...
MICHELLE
"I wanna know how to go
To the inside of love.
I can't find my way through."
Washing herself,
behind the shower curtain,
the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts.
As her hand turns the shower faucet, it changes...
MICHELLE (CONT'D)
"I'm outside of love,
To the side or above,
I can't find my way with you"
66.
A glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain, grows
more muscular,
and her voice begins LOWERING IN PITCH,...
as MICHELLE BECOMES MAX.
MAX
"Must be a special view,
Finding a me with a you,
On the inside of love."
Max steps out of the shower, and towels off in the mirror.
A persistent KNOCK on the door. Sydney pulls on a robe over
a pair of men's boxers, wiping sleep from her eyes. She
swings the door open.
Luke stands outside in POURING RAIN.
SYDNEY
Oh, honey.
Come in.
BY THE FIREPLACE
Sydney pours hot tea.
LUKE
You're one too.
Why didn't you
tell me?
SYDNEY
I didn't want to confuse the issue.
LUKE
So, it's true what you said? You
really know. I wouldn't change
unless I wanted to?
SYDNEY
Maybe some part of you.
LUKE
What part?
How much of me? I
mean, for it to work? Half? More
than half? What if it was only a
tiny bit, -a thought?
67.
SYDNEY
I don't know. But I believe there
may be thousands of Z's out there,
millions for all we know, go their
whole lives without even knowing
they are one. Nothing ever
happens. You couldn't keep it from
happening.
LUKE
I love being with Michelle. How
come I can't control it when she's
around?
SYDNEY
I think whatever part of yourself
you deny, just gets bigger and
bigger until it takes you over.
Luke nods sadly.
LUKE
You think I don't really want to be
a man.
SYDNEY
I think for some, making it stop is
more important than knowing who you
are. It was for me.
LUKE
Maybe for me too.
SYDNEY
Right now, you're Morphescent. The
key is to have sex with another Z.
You become Adulmorphic. Your
gender locks. You can't just
change anytime you want.
LUKE
Another Z?
SYDNEY
That's why I came all the way out
here.
LUKE
And why you keep tryin' to get me
in the sack?
68.
SYDNEY
Thought maybe I could save you some
distress. But you say you're not
attracted to me. For it to work,
both of us have to be into it.
LUKE
That won't be a problem.
SYDNEY
Okay then.
LUKE
Tonight.
SYDNEY
Not right now? Okay.
Tonight.
EXT CEMETERY - MORNING
Morning dew. Acres of empty grass.
Luke sits at the top of
a hill by his dad's grave.
LUKE
Remember that Christmas when Keen
and me accidentally set the
Scofields' house on fire?
He stares up at the sky.
LUKE (CONT'D)
And that burning shingle drifted
over and lit up the Robertson's
place? The whole town was ready to
lynch us, and we snuck back home...
Two AM, you were up drinkin'
coffee,...
He tugs out hunks of grass.
LUKE (CONT'D)
I thought you were gonna' kill us.
But you just looked me right in the
eye, and said, "Son, there's
leftover pizza in the fridge."
A tear rims his eye.
LUKE (CONT'D)
That was the coolest thing anyone
ever said. Dad, I'm in such
trouble.
69.
LUKE (CONT'D)
I feel like if I let this thing in,
it's all over. But I don't know
what else to do. Guess you can't
figure out who you are, until you
accept who you might be.
Department store shopping bags and boxes are strewn across
the bed.
Sydney checks herself out in the full-length mirror.
A man's
gray tuxedo jacket over lingerie.
The giant work floor of the abandoned mill.
Sunlight beams
through holes in the roof.
Max, on roller blades, practices guiding the hockey puck
along the floor.
He stops when he notices the figure watching him from outside
the giant metal doors:
Luca in the blue dress, on roller blades, hockey stick in
hand.
MAX
You're about the last person I
expected to see.
LUCA
I can show you a few moves if you
want?
MAX
Yeah?
What the hell.
LATER
Luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey
puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber,
and sawdust piles.
All the while, she dodges Max's attempts to steal the puck.
Max finally gets it, which riles Luca. She hip checks Max.
They swerve to avoid a pipe, crash-landing on top of each
other on a sawdust pile.
They bust out LAUGHING.
70.
LUCA
Not bad.
MAX
You're better than Luke.
LUCA
I taught him everything he knows.
Luca pulls away from Max, suddenly self-conscious that Max's
leg is on top of hers.
Awkward from the broken connection, they gaze up at the blue
sky through a hole in the roof.
MAX
I thought you left town?
LUCA
Had to come back.
MAX
Good.
LUCA
Where'd you learn to speak Italian?
MAX
Just tourist stuff. "I'll have the
spaghetti bolognese." "How much
for a room?"
LUCA
Have you been?
MAX
Little Italy. In New York.
Someday, though. Want to go with
me?
Max leans over and KISSES Luca.
She responds, tentatively at
first,
then as she grows more confident,...
her face REDDENS, she GASPS.
Luca pulls back, self-conscious, confused.
She brushes
sawdust off her dress, stands.
LUCA
Look, this was a mistake.
71.
MAX
Yeah.
Of course.
I know.
Looking up, Luca sees Keenan, staring at them from across the
floor, incredulous.
Keenan exits out through the giant doors.
LUCA
Oh, Jesus...
MAX
Are you and he...?
LUCA
Huh?
MAX
It's really none of my business.
LUCA
No! I'm sorry.
I shouldn't've
come here.
Max stands, brushes off the sawdust.
MAX
Please don't say you're "just
visiting." That you "need to
leave." I'm the one who needs to
leave.
Max skates off across the giant shop floor.
Sydney wears a stunning black silk evening gown.
Small Greek statues now adorn the room.
LUKE
I guess I really did need to face
it head on in order to see.
SYDNEY
It was courageous.
LUKE
Girls, are just, I don't know.
It's a different energy. They're
soft and warm, they can make a guy
feel complete.
SYDNEY
And multiple o's. Actually, male
Z's have multiple o's too. Been so
long I nearly forgot.
LUKE
Cool.
SYDNEY
Okay, to be honest, I'm relieved
you sorted this out. My conscience
would have bothered me for decades
if we'd just gone ahead without you
being certain.
Sydney pops a cork and pours herself and Luke glasses of
champagne. A toast.
SYDNEY (CONT'D)
To womanhood!
74.
LUKE
To manhood!
They drink.
LUKE (CONT'D)
So, how does this work?
SYDNEY
We just do it. And, ...it just
happens.
AT THE BED
Luke and Sydney begin undressing.
SYDNEY
Do you like this dress?
LUKE
Sure. Looks great on you. Man,
dresses! Even without everything
else, dresses are reason enough
right there to stay a guy.
Sydney takes this in, considers,...
SYDNEY
"Stay a guy?"
Let me get this
straight. You didn't decide to be
a woman?
LUKE
No.
Of course not.
What?
Sydney, realizing her mistake, regroups: Plan B.
SYDNEY
Just testing you. Hold on a
moment. There's something I
forgot...
She retrieves some ROPE.
LUKE
What's that for?
SYDNEY
You've never done it with another
Z. Trust me, you need to be tied
down.
75.
LUKE
Does it hurt?
SYDNEY
On the contrary.
BEDSIDE TABLE - LATER
The alabaster eyes of a small Greek Statue stares blankly in
the direction of the CARNAL SOUNDS coming from the bed, OFF
SCREEN...
SYDNEY (O.S.)
Just let yourself go completely.
LUKE (O.S.)
Wow, this is intense.
SYDNEY (O.S.)
When two Z's do it, the lateral
hypothalamus gets completely
overwhelmed,...
LUKE (O.S.)
OH, MAN!!
SYDNEY (O.S.)
Cellular fission kicks in, and,
well,... you can go Zytusional!
LUKE (O.S.)
Unbelievable!
The chiseled eyes of a two-foot Statue of David, blankly
stare.
LUKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Oh no.
What's happening?
Luke's voice begins RISING IN PITCH...
HALF-LUCA (O.S.)
What have you done?!
(Luca)
NOOOOO!!!!
The SOUNDS ESCALATE, growing increasingly more INTENSE,
culminating in the extraordinary, never before heard,
SOUND OF ZYTUSIONAL CLIMAX...
76.
LUCA/LUKE AND SYDNEY (O.S.)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Silence.
MIRROR - LATER
A great-looking, bare-chested guy with Sydney's hair appears
in reflection: MALE SYDNEY.
Behind him, still strapped to the bed, is now Luca, a GAG in
her mouth.
Male Sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in
the mirror.
MALE SYDNEY
(into phone)
I hear you're the best. Yes, it's
an emergency!
Please. Or I'll
have to cut it myself.
(to Luca)
Now, you look me in the eye, and
tell me that wasn't the best sex
you ever had.
Luca MOANS, STRUGGLES VIOLENTLY!
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Half an hour! YES! THANK you!
Male Sydney clicks the phone off.
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
You can have all my clothes. Oh,
and I just bought these incredible
Anna Felucci pumps.
(reconsiders)
Maybe I should keep those.
Male Sydney returns to dressing, a ribbed tank beneath a gray
Italian tux.
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Okay, I wasn't completely honest
with you, but I never lied either.
It stopped. That is what you
wanted.
You're Adulmorphic now.
The only way to switch is to do it
with another Z.
77.
He gazes at Luca, a pang of guilt.
He sits on the bed,
speaks softly.
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
I know you don't believe me, but
this is the right thing for you.
Eventually, you'll figure that on
your own. But I could tell it was
just gonna' take way too long!
Luca stares, distraught.
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Oh, for Chris' sake. Being a woman
doesn't make you any less of a man!
The entire bed LURCHES back and forth as Luca struggles.
Male Sydney winces, pangs of guilt, which turn to anger...
MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
Damnit! I can't live my whole LIFE
wrong 'cause of one stupid mistake!
I'm a man! I love havin' this
chest, these arms! But most of
all,...
(grabs his pant crotch)
Welcome home, boys! Hang in there,
I'm takin' you out for a SPIN!
LATER
Luca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed.
A KNOCK at the door.
Luca MOANS and tries to YELL through her gagged mouth.
The KNOCK PERSISTS.
SIDE WINDOW
The ivy parts and Keenan peers in.
His eyes GO WIDE.
He pushes the window open a little, whispers...
KEENAN
What's goin' on? Where is she?
Luca MOANS and struggles against the ropes.
78.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
Whoa. I guess I really didn't
think you were gonna' go this way.
Okay. Whatever.
Keenan sits on the edge of the bed.
Luca MOANS trying to get Keenan to remove the gag.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
Hang on a sec'. Look, I'm sorry
about earlier, -what I said. But
all this stuff.
Janine and I
split up.
Luca stops struggling, shocked.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
All I ever did was piss her off.
I'm not sure she even wants a guy.
And you think I'm so much better
with girls than you, and sure I can
get laid anytime I want, but truth
is, I never even woulda' hit on her
if it weren't for watchin' you.
Keenan climbs on top of Luca, starts untying her hands,
straddling her.
KEENAN (CONT'D)
The way you just talk to 'em about
anything, like it was okay. I
gotta' get her back, man.
With Herculean effort, Keenan struggles to hold back tears...
KEENAN (CONT'D)
It's like the whole world's blown
apart. Ah, shit. Man, you havin'
tits now is just weird.
The place is cleared out, save for Polly cleaning up behind
the bar and Max, alone, shooting pool.
POLLY
Girl trouble? Boy trouble?
Max shrugs.
POLLY (CONT'D)
How about we get a game in before
dawn?
89.
Max nods, sets up a new rack.
MAX
What's the point? It never works
out. Or they just cheat on you
anyway.
POLLY
Liverpool was a veritable shagfest
when I was your age. A boulevard
of broken hearts. But eventually,
I found him.
She sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket.
POLLY (CONT'D)
Scratch.
Then he died.
MAX
Sorry.
POLLY
Everything reminded me of him. So,
I came here, half way round the
world to forget. Then created this
place, just like the one where we
met.
MAX
He can't handle this. Us.
He
can't handle who he is.
POLLY
You being a guy too?
MAX
Or him being a girl.
Polly's confused, but presses on.
POLLY
Everyone's terrified. But once you
really know someone, and they know
you, it makes you whole.
MAX
No one wants to know who I really
am.
POLLY
You're so sure?
90.
MAX
It's impossible. He was the one
person I thought could understand.
But no, it's impossible.
Max puts the cue stick down, and moves off.
Polly calls
after,...
POLLY
It's worth finding out.
White gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze. The sun's
first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows.
Michelle stirs slowly, then BOLTS AWAKE.
She grabs Luke, a
vise grip around his torso.
He awakens, groggy.
LUKE
Hey you.
...Good morning.
What's
up?
Michelle bites her lip, embarrassed, releases him.
LUKE (CONT'D)
You still think I'm going to bolt,
don't you?
MICHELLE
And leave me stuck.
He smiles.
LUKE
What do you want, a gender pre-nup?
MICHELLE
Maybe.
I have to go to work.
She nuzzles him playfully.
Luke glances at the clock, MOANS.
LUKE
Only place I'm going is back to
sleep.
MICHELLE
No. I can't show up at work like
this.
LUKE
Oh, yeah.
He smiles, folds into her.
