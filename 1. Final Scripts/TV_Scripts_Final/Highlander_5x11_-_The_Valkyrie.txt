      Establishing.

      OVER we HEAR snippets of a political speech:

                                      STEFANOVICH (O.S.)
                          (with passion)
                    Listen to your hearts, Comrades. 
                    Ask it why your children go to sleep
                    hungry.  Why you have no decent work.
                          (beat)
                    The President knows who our enemies
                    are and like a gutless fool, does
                    nothing but choke on the bile of
                      compromise.

10031003INT.  MOSCOW HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

      The taped speech plays ON TELEVISION.  At the podium stands
      IGOR STEFANOVICH, who has the Russian crowd in his hand.

                                      STEFANOVICH
                          (from TV)
                    But I, Igor Stefanovich, will not
                      compromise.  I will promise you that
                    we will take back the empire they
                    have stolen.  That one day soon the
                    Hammer and Sickle will fly again.
                          (beat)
                    And you and I and our children will
                    once more be proud to call ourselves
                    Russians!

      CHEERS erupt.  The crowd goes wild.

      PULL OUT from the TV to reveal a lavish hotel suite.  Red
      velvet upholstery, luxurious antiques... and in the center
      of it all sits Stefanovich watching himself on tape.  He
      smiles at the cheers.

                                      STEFANOVICH (CONT'D)
                    Do they not love me?

      Stefanovich glances at a GUARD nearby who nods.

                                      STEFANOVICH (CONT'D)
                    Of course they love me.  Because I
                    fill their empty bellies with
                    something better than food.
                          (beat)
                    I fill it with someone to hate. 
                    Someone to blame for their wretched
                    lives.  The Jews, the Moslems, the
                      Chechnians... It doesn't really
                    matter.

      Stefanovich stands, stretching, eyes gazing into a new future.

                                      STEFANOVICH (CONT'D)
                    Ah, there are glorious days ahead,
                    Dimitri.
                          (yawns)
                    But now I'm going to bed.  I don't
                    want to be disturbed.

      Stefanovich crosses to a door, exits to the bedroom.  The
      Guard sits and prepares to make a night of it.

      A KNOCK at the hotel door.  Grumbling, he gets up, opens the
      peep hole, peers out into the hallway.

      GUARD'S POV

      INGRID HENNING.  Immortal, tall, attractive, sensual, wearing
      a long trench coat, smiling.

                                      GUARD
                          (opening the door)
                    Yes?

                                      INGRID
                    I have an appointment with Igor
                      Stefanovich.

      The Guard frowns, double checks his log book.

                                      GUARD
                      Impossible.  Comrade Stefanovich has
                    just gone to bed.

                                      INGRID
                    Then I'm right on time.

      Ingrid smiles provocatively, opens her trench coat, lets it
      drape off her bare shoulders.  She's wearing a sexy negligee,
      almost see-through.  As she advances on him, he backs up
      into the room.

1003CONTINUED: (2)1003

                                      INGRID (CONT'D)
                    If you don't trust me, you can search
                    me.  What have I to hide?

        Stefanovich, now clad in a bath robe, emerges from the
      bedroom.  He stops as he sees Ingrid.

                                      STEFANOVICH
                    What is this?

      Ingrid reaches into her trench coat, pulls out a gun.

      BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!

      She fires three shots.  Stefanovich drops to the floor. 
      Then... BLAM!  BLAM!

      Ingrid's eyes widen.  She crumples to the floor, revealing
      the Guard standing behind her, gun smoking.

      The Guard checks to make sure she's dead, then rushes over
      to Stefanovich.  With one hand he tries to put pressure on
      the wound.  With the other he grabs a phone --

                                      GUARD
                      Stefanovich has been shot!  Send an
                      ambulance, quickly!

      BEHIND THE GUARD,

      INGRID

      revives.  Her eyes pop open, take in the situation.  She
      gets to her knees, reaches for her gun, and fires.

      BLAM!

      The Guard clutches his heart and rolls over dead.

      Ingrid rises.  Satisfied, she turns and walks out of the
      hotel suite.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

10041004INT.  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

      In a small, local community center, bleachers surround the
      perimeter of a basketball court.  A boxing ring has been set
      up in the center.  Stretching across one wall a banner
      proclaims: "CHARLIE DESALVO MEMORIAL BOXING TOURNAMENT"

      An enthusiastic AUDIENCE cheers on the two late teenage
        middleweight amateur BOXERS center ring.  One wears YELLOW
      trunks, the other RED.  They both wear protective headgear.

      IN THE RING

      The boys circle each other warily.

      YELLOW

      makes the first move -- his left shoots out, taps Red on the
      chin.

      RED

      counters with a straight-arm jab and a cross -- but misses
      the mark.

      YELLOW

      fires back with a one-two to the stomach.

      ANGLE ON THE CROWD

      where an excited MacLeod sits on one side of Methos with
      Dawson on the other.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What did I tell you!  Kid works the
                    body just like Basilio.

      Red staggers a bit, Yellow moves in.

                                      DAWSON
                    You mean like Dick Tiger.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (emphatic)
                    I mean like Carmen Basilio.

                                      DAWSON
                          (emphatic)

                                      METHOS
                    What are you guys talking about?

      MacLeod bobs and weaves as he talks, his hands throwing
      combinations.  His eyes never leave the fighters.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carmen Basilio.

                                      METHOS
                    Who?

                                      MACLEOD
                      Middleweight contender in the Fifties. 
                    The guy hit like a mule.

                                      DAWSON
                    Dick Tiger.

                                      METHOS
                    Who?

                                      DAWSON
                      Middleweight champion in the Fifties. 
                    Guy knocked Basilio on his ass.

                                      METHOS
                    The Marquis of Queensbury would be
                    so proud.

                                      MACLEOD & DAWSON
                          (teasing him)
                    Who?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Keep that left up.  Watch the overhand
                    right!

      Red connects with an overhand right.  Yellow goes down.

                                      DAWSON
                    You can't say you didn't warn him.

      MacLeod settles back down, loving the action.

                                      METHOS
                    And you and Joe sponsor this...

                    Charlie would have loved it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He grew up here.  He knew that places
                    like this get kids off the streets.

      In the ring, Yellow is being helped on his stool and smelling
      salts are being offered by a trainer.

      Methos turns to MacLeod, smirks --

                                      METHOS
                    Good thing you got 'em off the street. 
                    They could get hurt out there.

      MacLeod's just about to slam him back when they both get the
      BUZZ.  He scans the crowd, spots a familiar face across the
      floor --

      INGRID

      Also getting the BUZZ, her eyes searching the sea of faces. 
      They land on MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't believe it...

      She's now a blonde, and dressed a lot more conservatively
      than when we last saw her, but still attractive.

                                      METHOS
                    Time to go.

                                      MACLEOD
                    She's a friend.

                                      METHOS
                    When they carry a sword and I don't
                    know them, I get shy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Later.

      MacLeod gets up, begins weaving his way through the crowd. 
      Dawson calls after him, a look of concern on his face.

                                      DAWSON
                    Mac...
                          (MacLeod turns)
                    Never mind.

      Methos head for the door.

                                      METHOS
                          (to Dawson)
                    You coming?

      MacLeod reaches Ingrid.  She looks happy to see him, and
      something else... maybe a little uneasy?  Her eyes are
      constantly moving, scanning the crowd.

10051005INT.  BEER HALL - BERLIN - 1935 - DAY

      Her hair bobbed in the style of the thirties, part of the
      German Intelligencia, Ingrid puffs on a cigarette in a smoke-
      filled Beer Hall.

      At a table in the background, a group of YOUNG PEOPLE drink
      beer.

      Camera PULLS OUT, reveals Ingrid is seated across from
      MacLeod.

                                      INGRID
                    If you ask me, your mission here for
                    British Intelligence is useless.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Why?

                                      INGRID
                    Because the British ruling class are
                    snobs.  Because no matter what you
                    tell them, they'll never believe
                    that they should fear a little failed
                    painter from Austria.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Does Hitler really have the support
                    of the German people?

      She throws up her hands in disgust.

                                      INGRID
                    Ah... the proletariat.  They're always
                    the last to realize what's going on. 
                    And then, it's too late.

      She lights a fresh cigarette languidly.

                                      INGRID (CONT'D)
                    It might be tragic if it wasn't so
                      predictable.  They love him.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (shakes head)
                      Incredible.

      She flashes MacLeod a superior smile.

                                      INGRID
                    Why should that surprise you?  Hitler
                    appeals to the lowest common
                      denominator.

      Suddenly, a desperate looking young man, DAVID, enters the
      Beer Hall.  His shirt torn, his nose bloodied, David makes
      his way toward MacLeod and Ingrid.

                                      INGRID (CONT'D)
                    David!  What happened?

                                      DAVID
                    Those goddamned Nazis, that's what
                    happened!
                          (beat)
                    I'm standing on the corner, talking.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's all you were doing?

                                      DAVID
                    Yah, just talking.  And then, those
                    bastard Brownshirts.  They started
                    hitting me.  Three of them!

      Ingrid passes David her beer.

                                      INGRID
                    Have a drink.  You'll feel better.
                          (to MacLeod)
                    You want to give the English a piece
                    of intelligence?  Tell them the
                    greatest danger in dealing with a
                    leader like Hitler is underestimating
                    him.

      David raises the glass to drink, but freezes.  MacLeod follows
      his line of sight.  Two big, muscular BROWNSHIRTS enter the
      hall.

                                      DAVID
                    My God.  That's them.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Really.

      MacLeod starts to get up, but Ingrid puts a restraining hand
      on his arm.

                                      INGRID
                    You're just here to observe, remember?

      MacLeod reluctantly relents, sits back down.  But now the
      Brownshirts have spotted David.  They cross to his table.

                                      BROWNSHIRT #1
                    Ah, look what we have here.  Our
                    loudmouth Jew has run back to his
                    Communist friends.
                          (to MacLeod)
                    Are you his friend?

      MacLeod stands.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.
                          (beat)
                    I'm his brother.

                                      BROWNSHIRT #1
                    Another Jew.

      The Brownshirt tries to sucker punch MacLeod.

      MACLEOD

      Catches his fist in the air.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Wrong.

      MACLEOD

      snaps, the wrist breaks.  Brownshirt #1 falls to his knees.

      BROWNSHIRT #2

      comes for MacLeod.

      MACLEOD

      twists around, lashes out with a crushing KICK to the groin. 
      Brownshirt #2 doubles over, pitches forward, gasping for
      air.

      BROWNSHIRT #1

      has come up behind MacLeod.  With his good hand, he grabs a
      beer stein and tries to bring it down on MacLeod.

      MACLEOD

      reaches over his head, grabs Brownshirt #1 by the arm of his
      uniform, and FLIPS him up and over.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96510     "The Valkyrie"      10.     Final Shooting Script 9/19/96

      He lands on a nearby table scattering beer and patrons
      everywhere.

      BROWNSHIRT #1 AND #2

      lie in unconscious heaps.

      The customers take one look at the battered Brownshirts and
      make a beeline for the door.

      Ingrid gathers up her purse, looks to MacLeod.

                                      INGRID
                    You're not helping anything, you
                    know.  What do you think you've
                      accomplished by that little display?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know, but it made me feel a
                    helluva lot better.

                                      DAVID
                    I thank you, my friend.  But she's
                    right.  You may have stopped these
                    two, but there will be more.

                                      INGRID
                    There will always be more.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

10061006INT.  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY CENTER   THE PRESENT    NIGHT

      The BELL RINGS.  Another match is in full swing.  MacLeod
      snaps back to the present.

      Suddenly TWO COPS push their way through the front door.

      TWO MORE COPS enter through a side door, one of them DETECTIVE
      ROBERT FRAYNE, a plainclothes cop.

      INGRID

      has her eye on the Cops.  They're sweeping the audience.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (re: cops)
                    Friends of yours?

                                      INGRID
                    I'll explain later.

      She moves to a wall and hits a fire alarm.  As it goes off,
      the boxing stops.  People stand, people jump up, shout --
      general pandemonium.

                    Smooth.

      In the ensuing confusion, Ingrid grabs his hand.

                                      INGRID
                    C'mon.

      MacLeod points toward a side door.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This way.

      They run through a fire exit and into the street.

      Camera moves to a door as Interpol INSPECTOR NICOLAE BRESLAW
      enters.  He surveys the room with a piercing eye.

10071007INT.  MACLEOD S LOFT - NIGHT

      MacLeod and Ingrid step off the elevator.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think it's time for you to tell me
                    what that was about.

      Ingrid wanders nonchalantly around the loft, picking up and
      putting down a book here, a photograph there...

                                      INGRID
                    Some Russian politician was
                      assassinated.  The police want to
                    question me.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (lost)
                    Is there a connection I'm missing
                    here?

                                      INGRID
                    I just happened to be in Moscow, at
                    the same hotel.
                          (shrugs)
                    I don't even know who it was.

      But MacLeod can't let it go --

                                      MACLEOD
                            (incredulously)
                    So you're saying they tracked you
                    all the way here from Moscow?  Just
                    to question you?

                                      INGRID
                    Actually, they already took a
                    statement from me at the hotel.  But
                    after I left the country, I guess
                    they ran a check on my passport. 
                    Something wasn't kosher.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't remember you being careless.

                                      INGRID
                    What can I say?  I haven't been great
                    with the paperwork lately. 
                          (throws up her hands)
                    I don't know.

      She flops down on the sofa.

                                      INGRID (CONT'D)
                    What do I have to do to get a drink
                    around this place?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Wine?

                                      INGRID
                    Scotch.

      He opens the cabinet, pours two glasses, hands one to Ingrid. 
      They toast.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So they started to wonder about the
                    woman with the phony passport?

      She takes a sip of the scotch, dismisses the question.

                                      INGRID
                    Serves me right for getting sloppy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sure we can straighten it out.

                                      INGRID
                    I think it's best to just leave it
                    alone.
                          (smiles)
                    Who knows?  They might even suspect
                    me.

                                      MACLEOD

                    Must've seen it in a newspaper... on
                    TV or something.

      She puts down her glass, rises to leave.

      MacLeod searches her face with his eyes.

                    What's going on, Ingrid?

                    Nope.

                                      METHOS
                    Did she mention why the police were
                    after her?

                                      MACLEOD
                    They were just trying to tie up some
                    loose ends.

                                      METHOS
                    Really.  Five patrol cars and ten
                    uniforms -- that's a helluva lot of
                    manpower for a loose end.

      Methos stops at a coin-operated newspaper box.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You old cynic.

                                      METHOS
                    I try.

      Puts in a quarter, pulls out a paper, starts leafing through
      it.  MacLeod peeks over his shoulder.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    There's an exhibit of Grecian
                      antiquities opening at the museum
                    today...

                                      MACLEOD
                      A twenty-five hundred year old garage
                    sale.  My heart's already racing.

                                      METHOS
                    Hey, some of that stuff could be
                    mine.

      MacLeod abruptly grabs the paper out of Methos' hands.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    I believe the phrase is, "Mind if I
                    borrow your newspaper? 

      MacLeod's not listening.  His attention is riveted to
      something in the paper.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Damn it.

      He throws the paper down and hurries off.

                          (looking after him)
                    Something I said?

      He picks up the paper, opens it up to a full page ad.  It
      reads: "NEW FREEDOM PARTY.  A NEW WORLD ORDER!  ALAN WILKINSON
      SPEAKS OUT TONIGHT AT COMMUNITY CENTER."

10091009INT.  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY

      The boxing ring is gone.  TECHNICIANS set up the sound system,
      do mike checks.  VOLUNTEERS hang a big banner: "NEW FREEDOM
      PARTY.  A NEW WORLD ORDER FOR A NEW WORLD!"

      On stage, ALAN WILKINSON paces behind the podium, rehearsing. 
      Short hair, well built, the guy looks like an ex-cop in an
      expensive suit.

                                      WILKINSON
                          (to himself)
                    It is time for White America to stand
                    up and remember who we are and what
                    we've done.

      He is interrupted by an OFFSTAGE voice.

                                      TECHNICIAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                    Mr. Wilkinson, we need a sound check.

                                      WILKINSON
                          (into the mike)
                    White is right.
                          (beat)
                    How's that?

      ANGLE ON INGRID

      as she slips in through a side door.  Her eyes settle on
      Wilkinson, turn to ice.  She begins to make her way toward
      the stage, scoping the layout.

      Wilkinson's BODYGUARD hovers in the background, obviously
      bored -- he's nothing Ingrid can't handle.

      Ingrid gets the BUZZ.

      She whirls, faces MacLeod.  Their eyes lock.  She knows he
      knows.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I guess you didn't leave town.

                                      INGRID
                    I'll be out of your life in fifteen
                    minutes.  If you're my friend, you'll
                    turn around and walk out the door.

      She reaches a gloved hand into her coat pocket.  His hand
      clamps down on her arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I am your friend, Ingrid, that's why
                    I can't let you do this.

                                      INGRID
                    This is none of your business, Duncan.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm not going to stand here and watch
                    you kill someone.

      She struggles to free her arm.

                                      INGRID
                    Let go of my arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Ingrid, you can't do this.

                                      INGRID
                    I'm only doing what needs to be done.

      She pulls a gun from her pocket.  He grabs it, holding it
      immobile.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's not going to happen.

      ANGLE - THE BODYGUARD

      He sees them struggle.  He reaches for his own weapon.

      INGRID

      sees him.  She suddenly throws herself away from MacLeod,
      points at him and screams at the top of her lungs --

                                      INGRID
                    Oh my God!  He's got a gun!

      She turns and hightails it out the side door.  MacLeod starts
      to follow but is stopped by the sound of a bullet being
      chambered.  He turns and feels --

      WILKINSON'S BODYGUARD

      pointing an AUTOMATIC directly at his head.

      MacLeod's screwed.  He drops the gun, throws up his hands
      and off his frustrated reaction, we --

10101010INT.  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER

      Inspector Nicolae Breslaw, Interpol -- mid-fifties, the face
      of a priest, the eyes of a hunter.  He chews a toothpick to
      shreds.

                                      BRESLAW
                    Are you a writer of fiction, Mr.
                    MacLeod?

      MacLeod shakes his head.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Uh uh.

      Breslaw spits out the toothpick.

                                      BRESLAW
                          (re: toothpick)
                    Smoking was much more agreeable.
                          (re: MacLeod)
                    That's a shame.  Possessed of such
                    an imagination, it seems a shame to
                    squander your talents on my humble
                    self.

                                      MACLEOD
                    If I could help you, I would,
                      Inspector.

                                      BRESLAW
                    Would you?

      Breslaw flips open his notebook.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    Let's review, shall we?  You just
                    happen to be here as they're setting
                    up for Wilkinson's speech.

                                      MACLEOD
                      I sponsored a boxing match there
                      yesterday.

                                      BRESLAW
                          (ignoring him)
                    A woman you've never seen before has
                    a gun.  You take the gun away from
                    her.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    Then she screams you have a gun, and
                    runs away, leaving you holding the
                    weapon.  Do I understand correctly
                    so far?

      MacLeod nods in sympathy.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know how it sounds.

                                      BRESLAW
                          (mock surprise)
                    Do you, Mr. MacLeod?  Now it is you
                    who underestimate my imagination. 
                    If I have learned anything in my
                      relatively undistinguished career
                    with Interpol, it is that nothing is
                      impossible...

      He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a folded piece
      of paper.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    And no one is who they seem to be.
                          (deliberately)
                    No one.

      He unfolds the paper.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                      Especially pretty young girls with
                    guns.

      He shows MacLeod the paper -- it's a police artist sketch of
      Ingrid.  MacLeod just manages to stop himself from flinching
      in recognition.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    Is this the girl?

      MacLeod pretends to study the picture.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Can't say for sure.  Didn't really
                    get that good a look.

      But Breslaw has a sixth sense for liars.  His nostrils flare,
      his eyes narrow.

                                      BRESLAW
                    Pity.  Normally when one disarms a
                    potential assassin, one pays more
                    attention to detail.

      MacLeod just shrugs helplessly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Sorry.

                                      BRESLAW
                    I'm sure you are.

      Breslaw sees Detective Frayne brushing a chair for prints.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                          (to the Detective)
                    Don t bother checking for prints,
                    Robert, she won t have left any.

      Frayne continues his work.

                    They all make a mistake sooner or
                    later, Inspector.

                                      BRESLAW
                    Not this one.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So what's this all about?

                                      BRESLAW
                    It's about murder, Mr. MacLeod. 
                    It's about murder.

      On his way up in the elevator, MacLeod gets the BUZZ.

      Ingrid starts apologizing as he steps into the loft.

                    Look, I'm sorry, but you left me no
                    choice.

      MacLeod stares at her, his eyes hard.

      She squares her shoulders, meets his gaze without flinching.

      MacLeod looks at his old friend, tries to put it together.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You had good teachers.

                                      INGRID
                    The best.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So Breslaw was right about the
                    murders?

                                      INGRID
                    They weren't "murders".

      MacLeod raises his eyebrows in question.

                                      INGRID (CONT'D)
                    They were assassinations.  There's a
                      difference.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The end result is still the same.

                                      INGRID
                    Yes, but some people deserve to die. 
                    That's the difference.

                    Quite a responsibility.  Judge, jury
                    and executioner.

                                      INGRID
                    You think I want to do what I do?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know what to think, Ingrid.

      Ingrid remains eerily composed.

                                      INGRID
                          (simply)
                    I've only killed the ones who needed
                    it.

      MacLeod is rocked.  This is not the woman he once knew.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How many?

      Ingrid looks directly in his eyes.

                                      INGRID
                    Not enough.

                                      MACLEOD
                    When did it become so easy for you
                    to kill?

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

10131013INT.  BEER HALL - BERLIN - 1944 - DAY

      It's nine years since we last saw the Beer Hall.  The pall
      of Nazi propaganda has settled on the room.  Posters of the
      Fuhrer line the walls.  SOLDIERS in uniform are everywhere.

      At a table in the corner, Ingrid sits with a nervous COLONEL
      STAUFFENBERG.  Wounded in Tunisia, the handsome Stauffenberg
      wears an eye patch, is missing a right forearm and has only
      three fingers remaining on his left hand.

      Dressed as a Nazi, MacLeod enters, crosses to Ingrid and
      Stauffenberg.  Ingrid is subdued.

                                      INGRID
                    Colonel Stauffenberg, Duncan MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Colonel.  We've heard good reports.

        Stauffenberg picks up on the accent.

1013CONTINUED:1013

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    You're British.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Yes?

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    I have papers for a German officer
                    returning from the Russian Front. 
                    You'll never pass.

      Without missing a beat, MacLeod launches into a stream of
      perfect German.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (in German)
                    Ich versichere Ihnen, Oberst
                      Stauffenberg, Sie konnen Ihr volles
                    Vertrauen in mich und meine
                      Fahigkeiten setzen.  (Translation: I
                    assure you, Colonel Stauffenberg,
                    you can put your complete confidence
                    in me and my abilities.)

      MacLeod clicks his heels smartly.  Stauffenberg's taken aback.

                                      INGRID
                    They'll believe him.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                          (to MacLeod)
                    Your German's very good.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I've had a lot of time to practice.

                                      INGRID
                    You're certain there's no other way
                    than a bomb?

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    This is our only way.
                          (indicates MacLeod's
                            pistol)
                    No one is allowed to carry a gun in
                    the presence of the Fuhrer.
                          (to MacLeod)
                    You have the fuses?

      MacLeod pulls a package of cigarettes out.

                                      MACLEOD
                    All the way from England.

1013CONTINUED: (2)1013

      He hands the package to Stauffenberg, who opens it and looks
      inside.  The FUSES are composed of a small GLASS VIAL hooked
      up to a THIN WIRE and a FIRING PIN.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    They run ten minutes?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (indicating a fuse)
                    When you break the glass it releases
                    the acid.  The acid eats through the
                    wire releasing the firing pin.  Eight
                    minutes, ten minutes... It's hard to
                    be exact.

        Stauffenberg nods curtly.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    It's good enough.  The device will
                    be placed in my briefcase.

      MacLeod picks up the salt shaker from the table, unscrews
      the top.

                                      MACLEOD
                    All right, as I see it...

      He pours a thin stream of salt on the table in a rough
      rectangle.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    "Wolf's Lair" -- Hitler's
                      headquarters.

      Marking sections off with his index finger --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Sentries here.  Here.  And here.
                    And most important, the S.S. 
                      Checkpoint, here, on the main road
                    in.

      He grabs the pepper shaker, pours a small square of black
      pepper inside the white salt border.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    The underground bunker is here.
                          (draws a door)
                    Only one door in.  Other than that,
                    the room is completely sealed off. 
                    That'll intensify the blast.

        Stauffenberg nods, satisfied.  He wipes out the diagrams on
      the table.

                    escape this time.

                                      INGRID
                    And the Reserve Army is ready to
                    step in?

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                          (nodding)
                    The Shadow Government is prepared,
                    both here and in occupied France. 
                    As soon as they receive word
                      "Operation Valkyrie" has been
                      completed, a new Germany will be
                    born.

        Stauffenberg raises his glass.

                                      STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
                    To Valkyrie, then.

      MacLeod and Ingrid join him in a somber toast.

                                      MACLEOD & INGRID
                    To Valkyrie.

10141014EXT.  STREET - BERLIN - 1944 - NIGHT

      It is late.  There are only a few cars and a few people
      walking.  Something is troubling Ingrid as she and MacLeod
      walk.

                    they can do is shoot me.

      On a secluded forest road, an S.S. checkpoint sits at the
      entrance to Wolf's Lair - Hitler's compound.  A SENTRY signals
      an approaching STAFF CAR to stop.  A brief exchange and the
      car is waved on through.

      The staff car pulls off the main road behind a quonset hut. 
      Ingrid, Stauffenberg and MacLeod get out.  Stauffenberg paces
      nervously.

                    Listen to him.  It's the only way.

        Stauffenberg considers, then, obviously moved by MacLeod's
      apparent willingness to sacrifice himself, agrees.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    The German people will not forget
                    the British soldier who gave his
                    life for them today.

      He shakes MacLeod's hand.

                                      STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
                    I will see to that.

      MacLeod smiles humbly in return.

      The staff car approaches a small clearing, pulls up in front
      of the Conference Building.  Typical of temporary wartime
      construction, it is a low cinder block structure, metal roof,
      one door.

      As MacLeod and Stauffenberg get out, they're met by CHIEF OF
      STAFF KARL BRANDT crossing the compound.  They salute Brandt,
        Stauffenberg introduces MacLeod.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    Staff Chief Brandt, Colonel Frick. 
                    Newly returned from the Russian Front.

      Brandt looks MacLeod up and down.

                                      BRANDT
                    No doubt, Frick, you are here to
                    explain why British convoys are still
                    getting through, supplying the Red
                    Army.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You'll have my full report.  I'm
                    sure you will be satisfied.

      From across the darkened compound walks a SHORT MAN flanked
      by two OFFICERS.  Brandt glances in their direction.

                                      BRANDT
                    It is not I who must be satisfied.

      He moves off, enters the Conference Building.

      As the Short Man walks under a floodlight we see who it is. 
      ADOLF HITLER.  He passes by Stauffenberg and MacLeod, who
      salute.  Without acknowledging them Hitler enters the
      Conference building with his Officers.

        Stauffenberg reaches into his briefcase, breaks the acid
      vial activating the fuse.

      INSERT

      We see the wire and the acid slowly eating away at it.  Below
      it, the charge of explosives.

        Stauffenberg nods to MacLeod.  It s done.  They move toward
      the conference building.

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                          (quiet)
                    God be with you, Duncan MacLeod.

10181018INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - WOLF'S LAIR - 1944 - MOMENTS LATER

      A small room, one wall is lined with windows.  A large,
      rectangular table made of heavy oak occupies the center. 
      The table is supported by two thick wooden pedestals.

      The briefing is in session.  Hitler sits at the table
      surrounded by several NAZI OFFICERS poring over a giant map. 
      He gestures angrily toward the map.

                                      HITLER
                    Fifteen kilometers of railroad
                    destroyed in the last air strike
                    alone!

        Stauffenberg and MacLeod enter.  MacLeod takes up his position
      on the opposite side of the table.  Stauffenberg pulls out
      his chair and sits, two chairs down from Hitler.

                                      HITLER (CONT'D)
                    The new fifty millimeter Flak Guns
                    are completely useless!

        Stauffenberg reaches under the table, places the briefcase
      bomb to one side of the table pedestal -- the side facing
      Hitler.

                                      HITLER (CONT'D)
                    They are laughing at me!  I will not
                    stand for it!

      Leaning over to his left, Stauffenberg whispers to Chief Of
      Staff Brandt --

                                      STAUFFENBERG
                    Excuse me, Herr Brandt.  I must make
                    a call.

      He rises, glances quickly toward MacLeod.  The two men salute
      each other briefly with their eyes.  Stauffenberg exits.

      MacLeod's eyes go to the briefcase.

      The wire inside the briefcase nearly eaten through by the
      acid.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Hitler pounds the table in anger.

                                      HITLER
                    Why build Flak Towers around the
                    railroad yards if the guns don't
                    work!?  Who is the imbecile
                      responsible?

                                      BRANDT
                    Perhaps I can explain.

      Hitler turns his beady little eyes on Brandt.

                                      HITLER
                    I hope for your sake you can.

                                      BRANDT
                    If I may demonstrate...

      He stands up, tries to reach the map on the table.  But his
      foot hits the briefcase.  Annoyed, he moves Stauffenberg's
      briefcase out of his way -- to the other side of the table
      pedestal -- away from Hitler.

      From across the room MacLeod sees it happen.  He reacts
      instantly.  He pushes an officer out of the way and moves
      toward the bomb.

                                      BRANDT (CONT'D)
                          (reacting)
                    What are you doing...?

      INSERT - THE FUSE

      The acid has eaten through.

      MACLEOD

      never reaches it.

      BOOM!

      The briefcase EXPLODES.  The impact blasts MacLeod back across
      the room.

      Windows blow out.  Shards of glass carve up the air.  The
      roof caves in, smoke billows up and fills the FRAME.96510     "The Valkyrie"      31.     Final Shooting Script 9/19/96



10191019EXT.  WOLF'S LAIR - 1944 - CONTINUOUS

      A general ALARM shrieks to be heard over the screams and
      confusion.  Bits of flaming wood rain down from the night
      sky.

      Ingrid stands in the center of the compound, transfixed by
      the sight of the flames leaping up out of the Conference
      Building.  She whispers a prayer of thanks.

                                      INGRID
                    Thank God.  It is finally over --

      But the words die on her lips.  Staggering out of the flames,
      supported on each side by a bruised and bloodied Officer...
      Hitler.  He's still alive!  Bleeding, obviously in severe
      shock, but still alive.

      Ingrid's jaw drops.  Numbly, she reaches into her pocket,
      pulls out a GUN.  She points it at him as he moves toward
      her.

      HITLER

      blinks in the glare of the floodlights, stops, raises one
      burned bloody arm high...

                                      HITLER
                      Providence has spared me again.  I
                    am invincible!

      INGRID

      goes pale.  Her heart stops, her throat seizes.  She freezes
      as

      HITLER'S EYES

      bore into hers.  He screams like a man possessed --

                                      HITLER (CONT'D)
                    The hand of God himself protects the
                    Fuhrer!

      INGRID

      swallows, about to pull the trigger --

      BLAM!

      She waited too long, an Officer shoots her from behind.

      BLAM!  BLAM!

      Two more bullets rip through her.

      Hitler is led off by the Officers.  MacLeod, battered by the
      explosion but revived, comes limping out of the building. 
      He sees Ingrid lying dead in the dirt.  Fires blazing, sirens
      blaring, he runs for her, takes her up in his arms, carries
      her off into the woods.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

                    In thirty-five I was an intellectual
                    fool and a snob.  I knew what was
                    coming and I did nothing but talk
                    about it in beer halls.  Then in
                      forty-four I had my chance, and I
                    lost it.

                    You know how many millions died,

                    But he might become Hitler.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You can't know that.

                    At sixteen, he and his friends beat
                    two gay men to death.  At twenty, he

                    Now all he does is give a speech and
                    a dozen other people go out and burn
                    churches for him.  He has to die.

      MacLeod and Methos sit at a table, two drinks in front of
      them.  Methos fiddles idly with a "Joe s" matchbook.

                    I know about her.  She had the chance
                    to stop Hitler.  And she didn't. 
                    And she's been making up for it ever

                    Can't you see that all her "torment"
                    is self-inflicted?  It's the ultimate
                    in arrogance to think that one person
                    can alter the course of history.

                    You can't deny that killing Hitler
                    would've saved thousands of lives. 
                    Maybe millions.

                    But if they'd have killed him in
                      forty-three like Rommel wanted, the
                    Germans might have won the war.

      MacLeod walks into the Dojo, finds himself staring down the
      barrels of two automatics.  Two COPS confront him, their
      guns raised.

                                      BRESLAW (O.S.)
                    We let ourselves in.

      MacLeod turns to see Breslaw sitting on a bench against the
      wall, chewing on a toothpick.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I love company.  Who brought the
                    beer?

      Breslaw silently signals the Cops.  They spin MacLeod around,
      slam him up against the wall face first.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Is this really necessary?

                                      BRESLAW
                    I had a man watching this place.  He
                    saw Ingrid coming out.

      The Cops pat MacLeod down, cuff him.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (over his shoulder)
                    So you've got her?

                                      BRESLAW
                    Where is she?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I guess not.

      Breslaw jumps up from the bench.  His patina of intellectual
      ennui has cracked.  Now, he's just a cop who's been jerked
      around.  And he's pissed.

                                      BRESLAW
                    You lied to me!  You said you didn't
                    know her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe she was looking for a place to
                    work out.

                                      BRESLAW
                    Where is she?

                    If I told you I didn't know, would
                    you believe me?

                                      BRESLAW
                    I ve already made that mistake.
                          (to the Cops)
                    Take him downtown.

      A nod of his head and the Cops shove MacLeod toward the door.96510     "The Valkyrie"      38.     Final Shooting Script 9/19/96



10241024INT.  POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      Harsh light.  Spartan furnishings.  A desk.  Two chairs. 
      Back on his own turf, Breslaw is icily calm.  He pulls a
      soggy toothpick out of his mouth, regards it stoically...

                                      BRESLAW
                    ... my only vice left.

      He leans across the desk toward MacLeod, who sits with his
      arms crossed, defiant.

                                      BRESLAW
                    I'm not interested in you, MacLeod. 
                    I suggest you don't make me
                      interested.

      MacLeod says nothing.

      MacLeod's not giving him anything.  He shrugs.  Breslaw
      stands, walks around the desk, sits on the edge facing
      MacLeod.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    A little story.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Do I have a choice?

                                      BRESLAW
                    I'll be brief.  Once there was a
                    writer... a poet, actually.  But he
                    lived in dark times.  Hitler, the
                    Nazis, and soon he was afraid to
                    stay in Germany.  So he took his
                    wife and son and escaped to Rumania. 
                    He thought they'd be safe there. 
                    And for a while they had a good life,
                    they were happy.  Until one night
                    when the Communists broke into his
                    home.  They took him away in the
                    dead of night... and shot him.  For
                    his poetry.
                          (beat)
                    They shot my father for writing
                    poetry, MacLeod.

      MacLeod's moved by Breslaw's story.  He loses the edge.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sorry.

                                      BRESLAW
                    So you see, part of me understands
                    Ingrid, too.  A tyrant here.  A
                    dictator there.  And now, there is
                    this Wilkinson.  Despicable.  Some
                    people might say murdering him is a
                    community service.  What do you say,
                    MacLeod?

      There's a long beat as the two men measure each other.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I say Wilkinson's speech should be
                      postponed.

      MacLeod leans forward, speaks pointedly.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    I want to stop Ingrid as much as you
                    do.

      Breslaw takes a BEAT, looks directly into MacLeod's eyes,
      senses instinctively he's telling the truth --

                                      BRESLAW
                    On that we agree, then.

      An OFFICER sticks his head in the door.  Breslaw goes over
      to him, they exchange a few whispered words, then the Officer
      leaves.  Breslaw returns to his desk.

                    The Watcher records on the lady are

                    was waiting.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then you know Ingrid's wanted for
                    fifteen murders over the last ten
                    years.

      Ingrid turns a corner, out of sight.  The Cop picks up speed,
      makes the corner -- but the sidewalk is empty.

                                    DET. FRAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Damn it.

      He pulls over, picks up the radio.

                    It's Frayne.  Patch me through to
                    the Inspector.

      The words choke in his throat.

      A GUN BARREL jams hard up against his jaw bone.  His eyes
      slide slowly over to see Ingrid holding an AUTOMATIC.  He
      drops the radio, it falls into his lap.

                                    DET. FRAYNE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, Ingrid... let's relax.  Nobody's

                    I'm sorry.

      Frayne's eyes widen just a fraction before she pulls the
      trigger.

      BLAM!

      He jerks once, falls over dead.

      A shocked MacLeod confronts Breslaw.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't believe it!  Stefanovich,
                    yes.  Wilkinson, maybe.  But Ingrid
                    would never kill a cop.

                                      BRESLAW
                    Are you sure?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I know her, Breslaw.  She couldn't.

                                      BRESLAW
                    I was right... you are a fool!

      Breslaw pulls a tape recorder out of his Pocket, pushes the
      play button.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)

      clearly the Cop's voice

                    stop me.  I'm sorry.

      A GUNSHOT rings out.  MacLeod winces, shakes his head in
      disbelief as he hears --

      Breslaw clicks off the tape recorder.

      MacLeod remains silent.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    MacLeod!  Don't you get it?  The
                    woman will kill anyone who gets in
                    her way.  For the last time, where
                    is she?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't know.

                    I hope you have a dark suit, MacLeod.

      He steps into the elevator.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    Because soon you'll be going to the
                    funeral of an old friend.

10291029EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT

      A BAG LADY loiters outside the hotel.  Hunchbacked, bundled
      in rags, dragging her life behind her in a garbage bag, she
      makes a pitiful sight.

      A MINIVAN pulls up to the curb.  In red, white and blue
      letters, a sign on the van reads "ALAN WILKINSON -- NEW
      FREEDOM PARTY."

      The passenger door opens, a DECOY who looks like Wilkinson --
      dressed in a stylish suit, wearing a hat, jacket collar turned
      up -- gets out, followed by the driver, Breslaw.

      They make their way toward the hotel entrance.  The Bag Lady
      scuttles over to them, reaches into her shopping bag.

      Suddenly, the Wilkinson Decoy pulls a gun, levels it at the
      bag lady.

                                      BRESLAW (O.S.)
                    Freeze!

      The Bag Lady looks up, and we see it's actually Ingrid --
      she's walked right into a trap.  Breslaw comes up behind
      her.

                          (beat)
                    Do it, or you're dead.

      She hesitates for a moment, then one look in her eyes tells
      you she won't.  She pulls out her gun and --

      BRESLAW

      shoots her twice.

      BLAM!  BLAM!

      The bullets twist her body around.  She drops to the pavement,
      rolls face up, dead.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    What a waste.

      Breslaw reaches down and closes her eyes.

10301030INT.  JOE'S - NIGHT

      Breslaw and MacLeod sit at a table.  It looks like Breslaw
      is on his fourth or fifth scotch.  His eyes are bleary, the
      skin on his face sags.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (re: drinks)
                    You're not driving, are you?

      Breslaw knocks back another shot.

                                      BRESLAW
                    Never gets any easier.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What?

                                      BRESLAW
                    The killing, I mean.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (gently)
                    Maybe that's how it should be.

      Breslaw smiles at MacLeod in silent gratitude.  He takes out
        a cigarette, lights up.  Off MacLeod's raised eyebrows --

                                      BRESLAW
                          (re: cigarette)
                    Maybe if I die a little tonight, it
                    will even things out between me and
                    God.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I hear Wilkinson's speech is back on
                    for tomorrow night.

                                      BRESLAW
                          (nods)
                    This time, he's on his own.

      Breslaw takes a puff, savors it.

                                      BRESLAW (CONT'D)
                    When I was a young boy, everything
                    was black and white.  Good and evil,
                    you see?  Then I grew up and
                      discovered there was only grey.
                          (beat)
                    I am sorry I had to kill your friend.

      MacLeod sighs, feels the pull of the past.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The Ingrid I remember will always be
                    with me.  The Ingrid you killed...
                          (shakes head)
                    I didn't know her at all.  Don't be
                    so hard on yourself, Breslaw.  You
                    had no choice.

      Breslaw sighs deeply, exhales a long thin stream of smoke.

                                      BRESLAW
                    Nice try.  But we always have a
                    choice, MacLeod.  If this fascist
                    scum Wilkinson becomes your President
                    in the next five or ten years... how
                    am I going to sleep at night?

                                      MACLEOD
                    You did what you had to do.

                                      BRESLAW
                    But was I right?

      MacLeod's eyes drift off to something only he can see.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    I would have made the same choice
                    you did.

10311031INT.  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY CENTER - THE NEXT NIGHT

      Banners drape across the stage, "NEW FREEDOM PARTY.  A NEW

      A small but zealous crowd listens as Wilkinson struts and
      fumes behind the podium on stage.  His eyes burn with
      righteous fire.

                                      WILKINSON
                    They call me a racist.  Why?  Because
                    I have the balls to speak the truth. 
                    And that's not my truth or your truth. 
                    That is the truth and the truth is
                    that I can no longer support a
                      government that is weak, corrupt,
                    and taxes us to death.

      The audience reacts like well-trained animals.

                                      WILKINSON (CONT'D)
                    The truth is that if they can't
                    protect us and our children from
                    these hoodlums and crackheads, then
                    we'll do it ourselves!

      The crowd CHEERS dementedly, anger rising up like a foul
      stench.

      ANGLE ON

      MacLeod and Methos, seated at the back of the auditorium.

                    She's not here.

      MacLeod studies the audience, keeping a vigilant eye out for
      Ingrid.

                                      MACLEOD
                    She will be.  She has to be.

      He double checks the emergency exits.  All secure.

      Back up on the podium, Wilkinson goes for the throat.

                                      WILKINSON
                    The truth is that every true American --
                    and we know who we are -- has to
                    stand up and say I won't take it
                    anymore.

                                      METHOS

                    Let's pack it in?

      But MacLeod shakes his head.  Methos sighs...

                    No, no.  There's something...

      His eyes drift up to Wilkinson on stage.

      MACLEOD S POV

      Wilkinson looks possessed.  Gesticulating madly, his eyes
      bulge, the veins on his neck threaten to burst.  The image
      shimmers, shifts... Wilkinson MORPHS into Hitler, spouting
      obscenities in German.

      BACK TO SCENE

      MacLeod's eyes go to the airport metal detectors at the door
      and the guard checking all packages.

      MacLeod's mouth goes dry, he blinks, flashes back to Berlin
      1944... he sees Ingrid's face floating in front of him, as
      if through several layers of gauze he hears her saying --

                                      INGRID
                    You're certain there's no other way
                    than a bomb?

      A FLASH CAMERA goes off in MacLeod's eyes.  He snaps back to
      the present, galvanized.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That's it!

      Methos is bored, rubs his throbbing temples.

                                      METHOS
                    Don't suppose you have any aspirin?

      MACLEOD'S POV

      On stage beside the podium sits a small briefcase.

      He grabs Methos roughly by the shoulders.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Whatever you do don't let anyone
                    touch that briefcase.

      He turns and dashes for the exit.96510     "The Valkyrie"      49.     Final Shooting Script 9/19/96



10321032EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY CENTER   MOMENTS LATER

      MacLeod rounds a corner.  The night streets are quiet.  The
      only sound, the muffled booming bass of Wilkinson's
      screechings in the background.

      He crosses the street, scans up and down... gets the BUZZ. 
      Still no one in sight.  He stops, says simply --

                                      MACLEOD
                    Dozens of innocent people are going
                    to die.

      Ingrid emerges from the shadows.  She holds a detonator in
      her hand.

                                      INGRID
                    Innocence is relative.  You've lived
                    long enough to know that.

      MacLeod looks into her eyes, sees the same rabid fire he
      just saw in Wilkinson's... he shivers involuntarily.

                                      MACLEOD
                    That cop you killed, what was his
                    crime?  He was just doing his job. 
                    He didn't care about Wilkinson, about
                    politics.

                                      INGRID
                    Just like the German officers we
                    killed with that bomb.  They were
                    just soldiers.
                          (beat)
                    The price of killing Hitler.  Except
                    we didn't.

      Ingrid doesn't blink.  MacLeod lets his gaze drift down to
      the detonator in her hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Please.  Put it down.

                                      INGRID
                    I can't.

      MacLeod reaches behind, draws his sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't want to do this.

      Ingrid looks at him.  Is it sadness in her eyes, or pity?

                                      INGRID
                    Duncan.  We're old friends.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This goes beyond friendship.

                                      INGRID
                    You'll never be able to do it.  I
                    know you.
                          (beat)
                    You're better than I am.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Please.

                                      INGRID
                    Think about it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I have.

                                      INGRID
                    Imagine a world without tyrants,
                    without dictators.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I can't let you kill everyone in
                    that room.

                                      INGRID
                    You're prepared to sacrifice all
                    that?  For what?  For a group of
                    arrogant racist bastards who are no
                    better than he is?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not all of them, Ingrid.
                          (beat)
                    You have no right to do this.

                                      INGRID
                    But you have the right to stop me?
                          (beat)
                    How is that different from my killing
                    them?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Put it down, damn you!

      The world slows down.  A moment out of time.  Their eyes
      lock.

      INGRID'S FINGER

      hovers over the detonator.

      MACLEOD

      tenses his muscles for the strike...

                                      INGRID
                    Now or never, Duncan...

      MacLeod strikes the death blow.  Ingrid falls.  The detonator
      rolls safely off to one side.

      The Quickening begins, sends out showers of electrical SPARKS
      from nearby power lines.

      Across the way as Wilkinson's speech concludes, a bedlam of
      fanatical APPLAUSE and hysterical CHEERS gushes into the
      street and melds with the shattering climax of the Quickening
      as MacLeod sinks to his knees beside the dead body of his
      old friend.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

10331033EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

      Two police cars and a Bomb Squad van are parked out in front
      of the Community Center.  The defused briefcase is safely
      stowed in the van.

      MacLeod and Methos stand off to one side, watch as Wilkinson
      gets into his car, is driven off.

                                      METHOS
                    There he goes.  Our hero.

      MacLeod frowns his disapproval.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Don't start.
                          (beat)
                    Ingrid said something just before
                    she died.

                                      METHOS
                            (reflective)
                    Yes.  They usually do.

      MacLeod lets that one slide.

                                      MACLEOD
                    She asked me what the difference was
                    between her killing them and my
                    killing her.

                                      METHOS
                    Good question.  Right up there with
                    the "chicken and the egg" one.

                                      MACLEOD
                    So you're saying there is no answer.

      A sly smirk plays across Methos' lips.

                                      METHOS
                    Oh, there's an answer.  But the real
                    question is, are you ready to hear
                    it?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Now is not the time.

      Methos nods, gets serious.

                      Stefanovich killed and Ingrid judged
                    him.  Wilkinson killed and Ingrid
                    judged him.
                          (beat)
                    Ingrid killed and you judged her.

      MacLeod understands the implications.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then who judges me?

                                      METHOS
                          (beat)
                    You hungry?
