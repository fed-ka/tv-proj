  ON HORSES AND JOCKEYS loading into the STARTING GATES.

  DANNY ROBERTS finds a spot near the rail along the home-
  stretch, holding a rolled up copy of the DAILY RACING FORUM. 

  The BELL SOUNDS.  The horses leap from the gates and race 
  down the track.  

  WE PICK UP GARRY moving through the crowds in front of the 
    bleachers, ignoring the race.

                ...on the rail, Saddlepoint leads 
                into the turn.  Factory Bound is 
                second.  At the back, Buckey s 
                Folly, the longshot, swings wide to 
                the outside...

  ON ROBERTS, watching the horses come around the final turn.

                                ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                  Saddlepoint leads down the 
                  homestretch.  Factory Bound is 
                giving ground.  But on the inside, 
                here comes the longshot...   

  ANDRE steps in behind Roberts, nods to someone off-screen.

  THE CROWD CHEERS in the BG.  ANDRE steps in, pins Roberts  
  arms to his back, holds him as...  

  GARRY STABS ROBERTS TWICE with quick, brutal efficiency.

                                ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                At the wire, it s Buckey s Folly by 
                a nose!

  Roberts drops his beer.  GARRY slides him to the ground.  The 
  men fade into the oblivious crowd.  

  OFF DANNY ROBERTS  WINNING TICKET...

  PRELAP:  THE RHYTHMIC POUNDING OF A TAIKO DRUM, like a fading

  The infield is taped off.  The ME is bagging ROBERTS  BODY.  
  SHERIFF S DEPUTIES stand the perimeter.  FBI Crime Techs work 
  the scene. 

  We find COLBY briefing DON.

                  Everybody was focused on the race.  
                This was on the body...

                                WARNER
                We were running a surveillance on a 
                  a mid-level supplier, linked to a 
                  Salvadorian drug cartel.  He liked 
                coming to the track, so we came 
                with him.

                              DON
                And found Tabakian... 

  They ve reached the STABLES.

                                WARNER
                We re thinking the drugs and 
                Tabakian can t be coincidence, but 
                so far we ve never seen any product 
                at the track.

                              DON
                What about the owner of the 
                  racetrack?  You tried to get him to 
                  cooperate? 

                                WARNER
                Maurice Connors?  Track s a cash 
                cow.  Long as it is, Connors 
                figures Tabakian s gonna keep him 
                around.

                              DON
                So we shake things up for Connors 
                with Tabakian, maybe he rethinks 
                things, right?

                                WARNER

                Well, I can tell you this much.  
                Fact you re still here, means 
                something.  But I wouldn t count on

                Took me half a day to work that out 
                  mathematically.

                So, handicapping... we re trying to 
                predict how a horse will run at the 
                distance of the current race.

                              ALAN
                Exactly.  We have to consider past 
                  performances, type of horse, track 
                  conditions, the experience of the 
                  jockey...

                              CHARLIE
                  Actually, we should consider a lot 
                more than that.  I d factor for 
                average race speed, interval pace, 
                wind speed, time of day, assigned 
                weights, gate slot, sun position--

                Charlie, you can t account for 
                  everything.

                Sure you can.  If you can think of 
                  everything.

  Charlie turns to one of the BACK PAGES of the notebook. 

                              CHARLIE
                This is what s confusing... it s a

                It s something not readily apparent 
                to other bettors.

                              ALAN
                In my experience handicappers know 
                pretty much everything... That is,  
                unless there s cheating going on.

  Charlie considers the notebook.  Smiles at Alan.

                              CHARLIE
                That s it.

                              ALAN

                              CHARLIE
                  Cheating.  That s the behavior 
                Roberts wrote this algorithm for.

  Alan pulls his CELLPHONE from his pocket,

                              CHARLIE
                What are you doing?

                Next thing you re gonna tell me is 
                you gotta tell Don, right?

  Charlie talks with Don and Alan.

                              CHARLIE
                Originally Roberts system was 
                working just fine picking second 
                place finishers.  Then something 
                  happened...

                              DON
                What?

                              ALAN
                Cheating.  My idea actually.

                              CHARLIE
                So the horses who should have been 
                winning suddenly stopped winning. 
                Which threw off his ability to pick 
                the runners-up.  So he made an 
                  adjustment...

                              DON
                What kind of adjustment?

                              CHARLIE
                Well, he probably noticed that race 
                outcomes were consistently falling 
                outside the range of realistic 
                  probabilities.  It s like the

                Roberts retooled his system to 
                account for the fact the races were 
                fixed.  And presto: produced thirty

                Maybe exposing the cheating is what 
                got him killed.

                Dad may be right.  See, I loaded 
                all the race data on my laptop, so 
                I was able to run every winning 
                Pick-Six bet from the past six 
                months through Roberts  algorithm.

                              DON
                And found what?
