ROAD - DAY
The TRACK is SILENT.
The CAMERA looks at a sign.
It reads:
CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
Established 1935
Gradually we can begin to hear, in the BG, the SOUNDS of
CHILDREN playing.
CUT TO:
2
In the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying
a game of softball.
In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.
CLAUDETTE is 17
years old.
She is pretty.
She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant
Counsellor" written on it.
She fills out the shirt very well.
Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks
quickly in the opposite direction.
The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we
SUPERIMPOSE:
JULY 4, 1958
The CHILDREN'S VOICES FADE slowly.
CUT TO:
3
ECU as a COUNSELLOR squeezes off a shot.
The paper target is ripped in the black.
The COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the
line.
CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG.
CLAUDETTE
Have you seen Barry?
The COUNSELLOR smiles.
Shrugs.
COUNSELLOR
He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time
I saw him.
CLAUDETTE leaves.
The COUNSELLOR smiles.
CUT TO:
4
Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.
CLAUDETTE
passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.
BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
cow eyes.
In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
an Everly Brothers hit.
BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.
He is not
ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
CLAUDETTE
We've got to talk.
BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.
Nods.
BARRY
Okay.
5
BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his
shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.
The Everly Brothers continue as we:
CUT TO:
6
From over the tops of a rack of canoes we see BARRY and
CLAUDETTE walking along the shore.
CLAUDETTE
You said we were special.
BARRY
I meant everything.
In the BG, CHILDREN leap into the water.
BARRY
(continuing)
You know what I said, though.
CLAUDETTE
I can't, Barry...
CUT TO:
7
The TRACK goes SILENT.
BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path.
This is not an aimless
walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.
He leaves
the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
BARRY
I care very much.
He puts an arm around her and draws her close.
They kiss.
They separate.
CLAUDETTE
Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
BARRY decides to be politic.
BARRY
I wouldn't know.
CLAUDETTE
Oh, you...
She kisses him and they are locked.
A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE:
Just beyond the thicket of
lacy vines.
It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
breast.
She reaches up to take his hand away.
BARRY
Claudette...
CLAUDETTE
Somebody'll see.
BARRY
No, they won't...
He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
that part of her bra is exposed.
He seals her protesting lips
by kissing her.
From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
the field of vision.
A branch pops.
CLAUDETTE
(in a thick whisper)
Somebody's there, Barry.
BARRY
Come on, Claudette.
A man's not made of
stone.
CLAUDETTE
Let's go back, Barry...
BARRY
I need you so much, Claudette.
BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.
They kiss again,
passionately.
The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
Closer.
The THEME has snuck in.
It becomes discordant.
It
swells.
Closer.
QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
blow.
The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.
The PROWLER's powerful hand has him
by the throat.
He backpeddles, trying to get away.
ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.
BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.
The knife falls to
the mossy floor of the clearing.
Two hands go for the free blade.
BARRY's hand has it.
There is a confused jumble of struggle.
Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
REACTION SHOT:
BARRY, horrified by the sight.
The PROWLER's hand has the knife.
It moves quickly forward.
We can hear the blade strike.
BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
MCU the moss where the finger fell.
The PROWLER reaches into
FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
QUICK CUT TO:
CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.
She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her
temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.
The MUSIC
has stopped abruptly.
THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.
It is completely SILENT.
CUT TO:
8
TITLE SEQUENCE
The screen is completely black.
A small white shape starts to
ZOOMS towards the FG.
The shape becomes a three-dimensional
rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Just as it gets to its final
position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane
of glass.
There is a loud crash.
The logo shifts to the upper
left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the
Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.
TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out.
DISSOLVE TO:
9
The TRACK is SILENT.
In a LONG SHOT we see the one main street.
A newspaper
delivery truck drives away from the CAMERA.
A GIRL walks down
the street.
Superimposed title:
THE PRESENT
A MEDIUM SHOT in front of the bank reveals a day/date/time/temp
sign which blinks:
FRIDAY, 13
7:01
60 Degrees
FRIDAY, 13
7:01
60 Degrees
We can begin to hear a small-town DJ OVER as a pick-up truck
moves down the street past the GIRL in her late teens.
She has
a knapsack, a freshly scrubbed face, jeans, and a plaid shirt.
She wears her hair in a long braid.
She wears Nike jogging
shoes.
This is ANNIE.
DJ (V.O.)
It's 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June.
This is Big Dave and it's time for you
lazy bones to GET OUT OF BED!
It's
black cat day in Crystal Lake.
Don't
forget the big drawing today to see who
gets our FRIDAY THE 13TH Monster
Surprise: either a man's digital
continuous readout watch or a Panasonic
color television set!
CUT TO:
10
ANNIE walks a half step behind the OIL MAN, heading for his
truck which is parked there on the street.
OIL MAN
All the girls up there gonna look as
good as you?
ANNIE
I don't know.
ANNIE wonders if she should accept the ride with this guy.
Suddenly, from between two parked cars pops RALPH, a crazy hobo
who has two dead rats in his mouth, their tails in his teeth;
they swing from him like a strange beard.
OIL MAN
Goddamnit, Ralph!
Get outta here.
(to ANNIE)
Don't worry about him.
He's harmless.
(back to Ralph)
G'won.
Git!
RALPH
It's Friday the 13th.
He giggles and skulks away.
OIL MAN
Climb on up, Miss.
The OIL MAN gives her a boost up and then climbs aboard the rig.
CUT TO:
12
The oil truck thunders along the road.
CUT TO:
14
The oil truck has stopped.
ANNIE stands alongside the driver's
side.
OIL MAN
Don't let the spooks getcha, Annie.
ANNIE smiles.
ANNIE
No sweat.
Thanks a lot for the lift.
He nods and shakes his head with the sense of what might have
been if he were thirty years younger.
He puts it in gear and
roars off.
ANNIE looks around and sees an old gas station.
It is closed.
There's a sign which reads:
"No Gas 'Til Sat."
A mangey dog
sits on the stoop watching ANNIE.
ANNIE kneels down and calls the dog.
The dog comes.
ANNIE
pets him and then heads off up the road.
The dog watches her go.
CUT TO:
15
ANNIE is beginning to get worried about the time.
It's hot and
she's late.
She looks up.
From her POV a Jeep barrels along the road towards us.
ANNIE puts out her numb.
CUT TO:
16
The Jeep roars along the road.
The sun and shadows keep us
from seeing the DRIVER.
CUT TO:
18
In the FG the sign for Camp Crystal Lake.
In the BG, the Jeep
roars off into the distance.
CUT TO:
20
ANNIE lands, rolls, is upended, scratched by brambles, and
flips.
She scrambles to her feet and starts running towards
the camp.
CUT TO:
22
The Jeep stops, turns quickly, heads back for her.
CUT TO:
23
ANNIE's feet pound the hard-packed dirt.
She looks over her
shoulder to see the Jeep.
The sun flares on the Jeep's
windshield, keeping us from being able to see any details of
the DRIVER.
In a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to
escape.
The Jeep skids to a stop.
CUT TO:
25
The CAMERA becomes the DRIVER and chases into the thicket.
Branches and briars snap back at us.
Just ahead, the terror-
stuck ANNIE stumbles and falls.
She screams as a knife flashes
past her in a blur.
When the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise
on ANNIE's face.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK.
Her throat has been cut.
She collapses
out of FRAME.
A bird soars across the sky above.
The TRACK is SILENT.
CUT TO:
26
A gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway.
We
hear rock 'n roll OVER coming from a car radio as this much-in-
need-of-repair vehicle passes a slower car.
CUT TO:
27
The van turns past the sign that reads:
CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE--Established 1935
CUT TO:
29
The CAMERA SEES what NED saw.
The buildings are run down at
the heels.
It is the same camp we saw in the early scenes, but
time has torn the place badly.
The van passes the CAMERA and we see the three new ARRIVALS
looking out the window.
CUT TO:
31
This is the main building.
It is the building where Barry and
Claudette met.
Outside is a flagpole, a small parking area, a
large overhanging tree.
In the BG we can see part of the lake.
In the FG there is a Jeep.
CUT TO:
32
An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of
a huge tree stump.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs,
a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.
This is
STEVE CHRISTY.
He is strong, charming, and engaging.
He is
animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to
do things.
In the BG the van comes to a stop.
No sooner has JACK hopped
down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.
STEVE
Wanta give me a hand here?
JACK smiles and comes quickly.
STEVE
(continuing)
Alice?
NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had
polio when he was a kid.
His upper body is strong, but his
legs are slightly deformed.
He and MARCIE hustle over to the
big stump.
STEVE
(continuing)
Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
Alice?
ALICE comes into the MS.
She is carrying a shovel and a bucket
and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.
ALICE
Cabin B is ready.
STEVE
Push on this side.
Alice, this is Jack,
Marcie and Ned.
Push.
They exchange "hellos" as they bend to the work.
STEVE
(continuing)
That's got her.
Thanks.
I'm Steve
Christy.
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
You got some grubby clothes?
Climb into
'em.
Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out
the boathouse.
I want him to start with
the canoes.
What happened to Brenda?
ALICE
You told her to sweep the courts.
STEVE sets off.
STEVE
I'd rather she painted.
Let's go, folks.
As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.
NED
I thought we had two weeks...
ALICE shrugs.
ALICE
You can changed in three.
CUT TO:
33
The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull
up.
A brush slaps into view.
BILL is sweating while finishing
a coat of paint on the last canoe.
BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.
He rubs his
long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone
call his name OS.
He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the
trail.
ALICE
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
BILL
I finished the boats.
ALICE nods slowly.
ALICE
I'll tell him.
She turns away.
BILL
Alice?
The others show up?
ALICE
Everybody except the girl who's supposed
to handle the kitchen.
Annie.
BILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps.
ALICE look at him, then turns again.
BILL
You think you're gonna last all summer?
ALICE
I'm not sure I'll last all week.
(pauses)
I'll tell Steve.
CUT TO:
34
STEVE and NED are rehanging a door.
Next to them is BRENDA, a
dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting
the wall.
On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking
paint.
STEVE
Shim it up just a scooch.
NED levers the door higher at the top.
STEVE
(continuing)
Perfection.
Hold it.
STEVE uses a long ratchet screwdriver.
STEVE
(continuing)
To answer your question, my parents once
owned this camp.
There were some tragic
accidents and they went bankrupt.
I
promised them I'd reopen if I could.
See if it closes right now.
NED swings the door on its hinges.
NED
Looks good.
STEVE
Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?
BRENDA turns and nods.
STEVE
(continuing)
She's archery.
He's rifle ranged.
And
I'm behind schedule.
Let's go, Ned.
They exit with the tool box.
MARCIE stops and turns to BRENDA,
who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead.
CUT TO:
35
STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a
swimming float down to the water's edge.
STEVE supervises as
he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.
They ad-lid as
appropriate.
("There goes my hernia." "Are you sure you're
lifting?" "Not so fast." "I'm walking backward.")
They drop the things carefully.
STEVE
Come on back here and let's above the
float in.
They get behind it and shove it into the water.
NED hops
aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.
CUT TO:
36
STEVE CHRISTY comes upon ALICE, who is renailing floorboards on
the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin.
On the railing is a
sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.
INSERT:
ALICE'S SKETCH.
It is a moody pierce, a sense of
foreboding dominates it.
Otherwise, it is the camp's central
compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.
STEVE
You draw very well.
ALICE
Oh, thanks.
I wish I could spend more
time at it.
ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.
She reacts good-
naturedly and keeps on working.
STEVE bends down next to ALICE.
STEVE
This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?
She shakes her head.
STEVE
(continuing)
Any particular reason?
ALICE
Just a feeling.
(pause)
Nothing personal.
STEVE
(nodding)
You want to leave?
ALICE
I don't know.
Probably be best for
everybody.
STEVE
You may not care a lot about this place,
Alice, but I mean to make it my whole
life.
It's been my whole life.
Gimme
a chance.
Stay a week.
Help get it
ready.
Next Friday, if you're not
happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.
I'll be grateful.
He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.
She looks up.
She nods.
ALICE
Next Friday.
STEVE
Thanks, Alice.
He stands up.
STEVE
(continuing)
I've got to go to town and pick up the
trailer and all that other stuff, but
I'll be back around ten.
If you're
still up, we can talk, okay?
ALICE
Sure.
She watches him cross out of FRAME.
CUT TO:
38
STEVE is at the wheel of his Jeep.
The COUNSELLORS are
standing within earshot, huddled around the Jeep.
JACK
You want it listed separately?
STEVE
Yeah.
Brenda, after lunch hit the
archery range.
If Annie gets here, have
her start in on the kitchen.
Do your
best.
Tomorrow we have a preliminary
inspection by the state safety people.
I'd like to look good.
He wheels the car around and out the driveway.
The others
stand looking before NED breaks the silence.
NED
He neglected to mention this place is
called "Camp Blood" downtown.
They are all getting back to work.
ALICE
How come?
NED
Some campers drowned.
Then some
counsellors got killed.
BILL
No shit.
When?
NED
Late fifties sometime.
They never
caught the guy who did it either.
MARCIE
Neddy collects weird facts.
Next he is
going to tell us that there are poisonous
snakes in the outhouse and green lizards
in the lake.
As they laugh, the CAMERA HOLDS on ALICE.
CUT TO:
39
BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.
She
enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of
this area.
She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated
than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.
BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter
and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.
There are
already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.
The targets are heavy.
This isn't an easy one-person job.
The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets
closer to setting up the target.
In MCU, she lifts a target up.
Her head is very close to the
face of the target.
She gets it up, lets the tripod take the
weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow
streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by
eighteen inches.
BRENDA whips around.
WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:
a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-
to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked
simultaneously.
He has a feather stuck in his hair.
She grabs the arrow and storms at him.
BRENDA
You're crazy!
She snaps the arrow in half.
NED
Did anyone ever tell you you're
beautiful when you're angry?
BRENDA
(plussed)
I don't believe you...
NED
Want to see my trick shot?
It's even
better.
BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's
little she can do.
She laughs.
BRENDA
(still laughing)
You ever fire one of those bows again,
and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
NED
God, but I love that sexy talk.
BRENDA snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the
bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.
CUT TO:
40
We watch through one of the dusty panes, seeing the charcoal
sketch in the FG, ALICE in the BG checking her materials
against her invoice.
CUT TO:
42
MARCIE is the source of the scream.
She runs towards the
CAMERA, dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter.
Her feet are
bare.
When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by
JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.
The
screams were not serious and MARCIE is doing some of it for
effect.
BRENDA brings up the rear.
They are all dressed more
or less for a frolic in the lake.
BILL and ALICE stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin.
BILL
is smiling, ALICE is a little bit amused.
MARCIE
Help me!
Save me!
The frog people are
after me!
It's swim time at Camp Crystal
Lake.
Come on, Alice, I need protection!
CUT TO:
44
A LONG WIDE SHOT reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull
of a hot afternoon.
At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of
the group:
MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.
They
are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.
There is no
real attempt to exert too much energy.
Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's
POV.
The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,
on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.
Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.
Occasionally,
we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush.
CUT TO:
45
The group sits or lies in the cool water, more or less focused
on NED, who is acting as moderator.
NED
What do you want to be when you grow up?
BRENDA
Dancer.
MARCIE
Cowboy.
NED
Girls can't be cowboys.
MARCIE
Okay, Fireman.
NED goes to JACK.
NED
Jack?
JACK
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
BILL
Filmmaker.
ALICE
Artist.
NED
Doctor.
Now, if you were a flavor of
ice cream, what would you be?
MARCIE
Rocky Road.
They laugh.
CUT TO:
46
The PROWLER looks in LONG SHOT down at the lake and we can just
make out the COUNSELLORS.
The CAMERA PANS and we move toward cabins.
CUT TO:
47
ALICE is treading water, talking with BRENDA, as NED comes up
out of nowhere.
BRENDA
Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize the
nitrites or something.
NED surfaces between them.
He looks with googly eyes at ALICE.
NED
There are sand sharks in this lake and
they can eat the bathing suit right off
you.
ALICE laughs.
NED
(continuing)
See?
I'm getting to you.
Very slowly.
NED does a porpoise drive and disappears.
BRENDA is not laughing.
She is looking off towards the cabin
area.
ALICE sees her and look where she looks.
ALICE
What'd you see?
BRENDA
I don't know.
Marcie's got me paranoid.
She smiles.
CUT TO:
48
The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place
alongside Alice's cabin.
There is underbrush about two feet
tall and all around that area.
The PROWLER stops, leans down
and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.
The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a
burlap bag which has been secreted there.
The hand lifts the
bag, which has something in it that moves.
The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below
the window.
The window is open, making entry quite simple.
The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in
and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.
One hand has the
animal firmly behind the jaws.
The hand takes the snake and
puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white
coverlet.
It slithers across the bed.
The PROWLER's hand closes the window.
The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.
CUT TO:
49
BILL and ALICE are lying on the shore on their towels, watching
the OTHERS in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun.
ALICE
is on her stomach, tracing angular designs in the sand.
BILL
is on his back, listening.
BILL
It still hurts?
ALICE
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt,
but I thought I could stand anything.
(pause)
I just wasn't ready for that kind of
pain.
We were supposed to meet in L.A.
When I got back there, he sent a telegram
saying he was going back to his wife.
BILL turns over so he can look at her better.
BILL
What'll you do when you leave here?
ALICE
I don't know.
Various feet enter the FRAME.
BILL and ALICE look up to see
JACK with his arm around MARCIE, NED toweling his head, and
BRENDA putting on her blue workshirt.
MARCIE
Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe
and I are going back to work.
BILL gets up.
BILL
Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm
ready.
Frozen yogurt?
ALICE smiles at the reference.
ALICE
I'll be along.
NED
(in a nelly voice)
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll
scratch your eyes out...
They head off.
ALICE turns over to tan her front.
CUT TO:
50
A machete rips through some vines.
Again it hacks at the brush.
PULLS BACK to reveal BILL clearing away the years of vine
growth which have choked off a path.
He wipes the perspiration
from his eyes and continues along.
CUT TO:
51
Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.
There
are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's
an aging set of parallel bars.
There is even a set of weights
made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.
ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.
He
explodes his breath.
We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven
parallel bars.
He is really very good and there is no doubt
about his strength.
BRENDA
Not bad.
As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat
little turn which is dazzling.
NED does a take.
NED
Holy shit...
BRENDA
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the
only show-off in camp, would we?
CUT TO:
52
The sun has dropped lower on the horizon.
The CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the
late sun.
A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with
a start.
CUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete.
ALICE
I didn't know I was asleep...What time
is it?
BILL
Almost five.
ALICE gets up.
ALICE
Now I'm only eleven hours behind
schedule.
Steve is going to have a
small cow.
They walk away from the shore.
CUT TO:
53
ALICE is walking quicker than BILL.
We realize we have seen
this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it.
BILL
You can only do what you can do.
ALICE
And then Steve looks at you with those
hurt eyes--like you don't care about
children...
BILL laughs at her imitation.
ALICE
(continuing)
I'll see you later.
She turns to go up the steps to her front door.
BILL
Alice?
She stops and look down at him.
He is serious and he cares.
ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.
She knows that it
wasn't easy for BILL to say.
ALICE
You're very nice.
They share a short silent moment.
BILL
Hope you will.
BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long
blade.
ALICE watches him go.
She shrugs.
This might be a good place
to stay.
She turns and goes into her cabin.
CUT TO:
54
ALICE heads from her cabin to the showers.
CUT TO:
56
BILL, returning from his last half hour of trail-blazing, hears
ALICE.
ALICE (O.S.)
Help!
BILL doesn't hesitate.
Carrying his machete, he runs to
ALICE's cabin.
MARCIE and JACK follow in the BG.
CUT TO:
58
Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among
the late afternoon rays of the sun.
We can hear the sounds of
the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt.
CUT TO:
60
JACK lands, almost unconscious.
BILL kneels into FRAME and
cheeks JACK's vital sign:
his eyes, his carotid pulse, his
breathing.
JACK shakes his head.
JACK
I'll be okay.
Holy shit...
BILL
Don't get up.
Take a second...
JACK lies back down.
Covers his eyes with his arm.
JACK
You saved my life.
BILL
I had to.
JACK
Thanks.
BILL
I figured if I didn't save you.
I'd
have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that
would have ruined my appetite.
JACKS looks up and smiles.
BILL give him a hand and the groggy
athlete gets to his feet.
JACK
Whew.
Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and
looks in.
We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred
switch and a now-silent generator.
BILL
This puddle was enough to ground you all
the way to China.
JACK looks in, too.
JACK
Floor probably leaks.
This area is full
of springs.
BILL
A short somewhere.
BILL leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches
another wire.
BILL
(continuing)
There's the problem, Jack.
Wire worked
itself loose.
He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU.
JACK
Just in cause this bugger goes bad.
I'm
gonna pick up some lanterns from the
equipment shack.
JACKS walks away.
CUT TO:
63
We watch NED come away from the main cabin and walk moodily
toward his cabin.
The CAMERA stays with the troubled child as he stops, leans
down, picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush.
It
cuts through.
He flips a few stones in his hand.
NED looks off.
Sees something.
WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:
a shape--a human shape--standing by a
cabin.
NED walks towards it.
NED
Hello?
Can I help you?
CUT TO:
66
JACK and MARCIE walk across the pint needles towards the lake.
There is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on
the horizon.
JACK and MARCIE walk along the shore to the lake.
They have
turned on the flashlights which they carry with them.
JACK
Wind's up.
It's shifted a good hundred
and eighty degrees.
MARCIE
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
JACK
I love you.
MARCIE
I love you.
They kiss.
MARCIE pulls back.
MARCIE
(continuing)
What about Neddy?
JACK
I don't love Neddy.
MARCIE
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
JACK
(yelling)
Ned!
MARCIE
Don't call him.
JACK
I thought you wanted to give him one of
your motherly lectures.
Ned is gonna do
whatever he wants to do, you know.
MARCIE
I guess...
The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light.
JACK
Looks like a storm.
MARCIE
I'm a little scared of storms.
Always
have been.
Since I was a kid.
JACK
You?
The brick?
JACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie
shadows.
She flashes hers at him.
MARCIE
I've dreamed this dream.
Maybe half a
dozen times.
There is a thunderstorm.
The rain comes down like pebbles.
I can
hear the sound.
I try to close my ears
off.
It doesn't work.
The sounds gets
louder.
The rain turns to blood and the
blood washes down in little rivers.
And
the sound stops.
A loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.
MARCIE is
startled and reaches out for her lover.
JACK
It's just a dream.
MARCIE
I call it my shower dream.
They look at one another in the two lights.
They grin.
Rain
drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them.
JACK
This is no dream.
Want to escape for a
while?
MARCIE
Lead the way!
JACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.
MARCIE is only
a half step behind, laughing.
FROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.
There is no theme,
just the rumble of thunder...
CUT TO:
68
The rain has gathered in intensity.
ALICE comes up to the
front door and looks out.
BILL comes up behind her.
ALICE
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
BILL
Not if they're where I think they are.
ALICE laughs.
ALICE
I'm not always this stupid.
She turned back into the cabin.
CUT TO:
70
MARCIE runs across the now-wet central area towards the
bathroom facility.
She tries to skip between the raindrops,
but she knows she'll get a drenching.
CUT TO:
72
The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an
establishing shot of the diner.
Through the window, which are
being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS
seated on stools at the counter.
CUT TO:
76
The rain continues as STEVE exits the diner, gets in his Jeep
and starts it up.
He roars off through a big puddle, splashing
water towards the CAMERA.
The Jeep pulls a small equipment
trailer.
CUT TO:
78
The Jeep plows through the rain, leaving the town lights
behind.
A sign off to the side reads:
CRYSTAL LAKE
45 Mi.
CUT TO:
79
PROWLER'S POV:
From outside the cabin, we can see some
activity in the big meeting room.
The CAMERA moves slightly
from left to right as the shot is established.
Then an unseen
hand releases a branch which partially blocks the shot.
CUT TO:
80
The rain is very heavy.
Steve's Jeep drives past the CAMERA.
The tires squish in the muddy roadway.
CUT TO:
82
STEVE's Jeep coughs, sputters, stalls.
OVER we can hear him
trying to re-start his dead engine.
R-r-r-r...
CUT TO:
86
STEVE smiles to see that the oncoming car is the local police
car, driven by a middle-aged cop named TIERNEY.
TIERNEY has
the window down already.
TIERNEY
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
STEVE
I think water got into the electrical
system.
You ride me back to camp?
I'll
get one of my counsellors to drive me
back tomorrow morning.
TIERNEY
Why not?
STEVE is around the car and hopping in almost before TIERNEY
can answer.
TIERNEY
(continuing)
"To serve and protect" don't mean to
chauffeur.
He puts the car in gear and roars into the night.
CUT TO:
88
Through her window we can see BRENDA changing into her soft
yellow pajamas.
CUT TO:
90
There is a small roof overhang like a porch, affording some
protection from the wind and wet.
ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER:
as BRENDA hears the tapping sound
closer by.
She looks and sees.
WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:
somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a
string and left it dangling from the eaves.
The wind blows,
making the knife tap against the building.
BRENDA
Neddy?
Cut the screwing around, Neddy!
She grabs the knife, breaking the string.
BRENDA
(continuing)
This isn't even half funny.
Angry, BRENDA turns and goes back inside the cabin.
CUT TO:
92
BRENDA runs through the rain, her flimsy pajamas drenched.
Her
bare feet slip in the mud.
She heads for a small rise that
leads to the softball field.
CUT TO:
94
WIDE SHOT of BRENDA running across the softball diamond.
CUT TO:
95
CLOSE UP:
a hand reaches in and slams on a circuit breaker.
CUT TO:
96
CLOSE UP:
Two large spot lights on a telephone pole light up.
CUT TO:
97
The softball field is now lit.
BRENDA is confused.
She looks
off behind the backstop.
Then to center field.
Confused, she
runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind
third base.
The CAMERA slowly zooms in on the darkness where
BRENDA exited.
We hold on that spot for several seconds.
Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.
Then
another.
CUT TO:
98
STEVE turns as the cop's car door slams.
TIERNEY peels out on
the wet road.
CU as STEVE watches the lights grow dim in the distance.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
as STEVE turns and jogs the other way.
Low
thunder rolls in the distance.
CUT TO:
101
BILL and ALICE have made their way to BRENDA's cabin.
From the
outside they can see the Coleman lantern burning on the table
within.
ALICE
Brenda?
Brenda?
You there?
There is no response.
The CAMERA stays in a MCU of ALICE as
she and BILL cross up the stairs and into the cabin.
CUT TO:
102
The rain slants down as BILL and ALICE make their way towards
Jack's cabin.
They go to the door.
BILL knocks.
BILL
Jack?
ALICE
Marcie?
BILL
Hey, guys!
BILL opens the door to the cabin.
CUT TO:
104
ALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.
To the
left of the door is a small sign that reads:
"Office."
BILL
tries the door, but cannot open it.
BILL
Sucker's locked.
Who's got the key?
ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and
comes up with a short 2x4.
She crosses to the door and smashes
through one of the window panes.
She puts her arm through the
broken glass, unlocks the door and enters.
BILL follows.
The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.
They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's
desk.
BILL picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch
on the desk set several times.
BILL
(continuing)
It's dead.
Try the pay phone.
ALICE
Do you have a dime?
A quarter?
BILL
No.
There must be some in the desk
somewhere.
They fumble through the desk to find some change.
BILL finds
some in the postage drawer.
He then crosses over to a pay
phone mounted on the wall.
The CAMERA moves to the cornice of
the building where the phone line exits.
It follows the link
up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and
phone lines come in from the pole.
Here we see a dangling
phone cable which has been recently cut.
OVER, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead
telephone.
ALICE (V.O.)
Hello?
Hello?
This damn thing's dead,
too.
CUT TO:
107
BILL and ALICE comes out into the rain, heading for the camper
van.
They hop in.
CUT TO:
108
BILL slides behind the wheel.
The keys are in the ignition.
ALICE hops in on the passenger side.
BILL turns over the engine.
It grinds away but does not catch.
From an ANGLE behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine
fail to catch.
We look in the mirror and see someone standing
in the distance, watching.
BILL gets out of the driver's side.
Slams the door.
The
CAMERA TRUCKS with him as he opens the door to the engine.
ALICE joins him as he shines his light on the engine.
ALICE
What's the matter with it?
BILL
Wet.
I don't know.
He tries a few more times.
ALICE
Why don't we run?
Just run now?
BILL
It's over twenty miles to the
crossroads.
Steve'll be back in an
hour.
Things will straighten out then.
We'll take his Jeep and get help.
He goes to her and cradles her face in his hands.
BILL
(continuing)
Don't worry.
There is probably some
really stupid explanation for all this.
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll
smile.
(pause)
Promise.
ALICE nods.
CUT TO:
109
In the FG we see a camp sign.
In the BG we see a figure
running towards us.
The figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as STEVE
CHRISTY.
Just as he's about to make the turn into the
driveway, he looks up and smiles.
He stops and catches his
breath as the other person catches him in the light of a
flashlight.
STEVE
Hi.
What are you doing out in this mess?
He shields his eyes from the light.
CUT TO:
110
From across the lake, the lights from the camp twinkle through
the rain drops.
CUT TO:
111
The CAMERA as PROWLER moves to the shed.
The noise of the
generator grows louder as the door is opened.
CUT TO:
112
The rain has lessened a bit.
BILL approaches the shed with his
fluorescent lamp and rifle.
He has the rifle at the ready.
CU on his hand on the door handle.
He pulls it open.
CUT TO:
114
ALICE walks very quickly around the side of the cabin, headed
for the generator shed.
ALICE
Bill!
CUT TO:
120
The door to the shed is closed.
ALICE looks around and then
puts a hand on the hand.
In CU we see the hand pull.
The door
doesn't budge.
REACTION SHOT:
ALICE decides to pull harder.
She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.
She pulls
until she finally wrenches the door open.
The lamp casts long
shadows upwards.
The generator sits silent.
ALICE leans into the shed to look.
The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can
see behind the right-hand corner of the building.
As we clear
the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down
from a branch above.
The something turns slowly in the wind.
It is BILL--dead--in
a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.
ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.
ALICE
Bill?
She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
REACTION SHOT:
ALICE.
She is riveted with horror, unable to
move or turn or run.
The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME,
the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.
ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again.
She
turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main
cabin.
ALICE
(continuing)
Help!
Help!
CUT TO:
121
ALICE gets to the door and stops.
She fiddles with the side of
the screen... somebody has latched it.
CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at
the door, snapping the latch.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the
thunder and the lightning.
The THEME is going full-tilt as
ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
TWO-SHOT:
as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from
above.
A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of
STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.
A rope is looped under
his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade
protrudes from his heart.
REACTION SHOT:
ALICE in terror.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair
of legs which swing from the same big tree.
STROBE SHOT:
of JACK, dead.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.
In the BG we
see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance
between herself and ALICE.
CUT TO:
124
ALICE runs for the door, slams through it.
The CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear.
CUT TO:
125
MRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly.
CUT TO:
126
The central area is bathed in light.
The rain has stopped.
MRS. VOORHEES has turned on all the flood-lights.
ALICE runs to the corner of one of the cabins.
She stops to
look back.
MRS. VOORHEES is gaining on her.
ALICE runs to the equipment shed.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
The door is thrown back.
ALICE goes in.
Looks
for a weapon.
Nothing is available.
ALICE sobs with fear.
She runs.
MRS. VOORHEES passes the equipment shed.
CUT TO:
128
A single bulb outside the building shows ALICE as she bursts
through the door.
CUT TO:
129
MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night.
CUT TO:
131
ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the
front door of the main cabin.
She runs in quickly.
There is
no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.
She turns off the lights and runs
into the kitchen.
CUT TO:
133
The moon comes out from behind a cloud.
ALICE pushes a canoe
into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will
permit, out in the lake to safety.
CUT TO:
136
Exhausted, ALICE puts her paddle across her lap and falls
forward, slumped across a thwart.
CUT TO:
137
The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the
horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.
The birds are
up, foraging for food.
As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky
reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.
The canoe
holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the
surface of the lake.
CUT TO:
138
ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.
She has not
changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.
The
water laps gently against the side of the canoe.
Very slowly,
she wakes.
She opens her eyes.
The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.
They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.
The canoe
rocks gently.
ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
lapping water.
Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
try to find their footing in the shallow water.
MRS. VOORHEES
is covered in mud and blood.
She sees ALICE struggling to get
up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.
ALICE grabs a paddle
floating near her.
MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
waist-high water as fast as she can.
She screams with rage.
Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.
From her
mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
JASON (Lipsync)
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
using it like a staff to ward off the blow.
The machete cuts
the paddle nearly in half.
MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.
The machete flies out
of her hand and lands in the water.
The two women roll in the
water.
MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
stretching to reach around her throat.
They roll over and
under the water.
We cannot see who is winning.
Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
for ALICE.
She is screeching madly.
JASON (Lipsync)
(continuing)
Kill her, mommy!
Kill her, mommy!
ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
off into the water.
The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
shore.
CUT TO:
139
ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.
We hear
the sound of a car approaching.
Now it comes into view.
It is
a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door
that says "State Department of Health and Safety".
There are
two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.
ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.
1st INSPECTOR
Good morning, miss.
2nd INSPECTOR
(Leaning across the front seat)
Are you all right, ma'am?
ALICE
Help me.
The CAMERA PANS BACK while the two men get out of their vehicle
and come around to help ALICE.
CUT TO:
140
LONG SHOT of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of
Crystal Lake.
The canoe lies half sunken in the shallows.
One
paddle drifts in the current.
The lake has swallowed its secret.
