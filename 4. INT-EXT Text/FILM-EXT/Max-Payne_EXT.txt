A blizzard, at the peak of its power. Visibility zero, New
York reduced to the hulking shapes of buildings on the banks.
MAX PAYNE thrashes in the water, a long way from shore.
MAX'S VOICE
There's an army of bodies under this
river. Criminals, people who ran out of
time, out of friends.
Chunks of ice float in the dirty water around him. Max's
body freezing, skin turning blue. Heavy winter clothes
saturating, like an anchor dragging him down...
MAX'S VOICE
The next time they drag this river,
they'll find me on the bottom with the
rest of them. And there won't be anybody
left to say I was different.
Max's face sinks below the surface...
CUT TO:
Abruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its
place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight.
Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN
duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway...
On the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them.
TITLE CARD:
ONE WEEK EARLIER
Max climbs out of the subway into a neighborhood with a foot
in two worlds: the buildings are old and crumbling, but the
shops inside are sleek and expensive. A jarring combination.
M
ax walks up the street, brushing past HOMELESS PEOPLE and
FASHIONISTAS jostling for the same space on the sidewalk.
NT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY
The hallway is ancient brick, but the doors are pristine
steel. Pausing at one with a dozen locks, Max KNOCKS.
The door cracks.
An EYE appears.
Squinting, evaluating.
OICE (O.S.)
You can't come here anymore.
MAX
William Preston was a dead end.
The door cracks enough to reveal the speaker: TREVOR, skinny-
fat in an sharp suit and sunglasses, shirt open a little far.
TREVOR
You can't come here, I said. I'm done
helping you. I've already...
(lowering his voice)
...paid my debt to society, you know?
I've cooperated enough.
MAX
We need to talk.
Won't take long.

TREVOR'S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE HALL
Max follows Trevor inside. The narrow brick entry opens into
a cutting-edge loft beyond, filled with modern art and a
gathering of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE milling around enjoying it.
TREVOR
I thought you found Bill's partner.
MAX
I did, but Doug only wanted to talk about
pigeons, or something. I need a new
name, someone robbing houses to feed a
habit around that same time.
T
REVOR
Three years is a lifetime for guys like
that. One way or the other, they're
probably all gone now.
(a little self-satisfied)
Either way, I'm not the one to ask
anymore. I cater to a better class, now.
One of the guests catches Max's eye: NATASHA, young and
beautiful, returns his gaze for an extra moment and smiles.
MAX
I can see that.
TREVOR
This is a party. These are my friends.
You remember friends?
AX
I need another name, or I start frisking
your friends.
Trevor stands his ground, not flinching at Max's threat.
TREVOR
don't have one to give you, Max. Look,
you've gone through all your living
leads, now you're running out of dead
ones...
(beat)
I don't think this guy's out there.
Max nods, fatigue fighting the determination in his eyes.
TREVOR

you'd see that for yourself.

Max doesn't answer. His eyes have drifted back to Natasha.
She plucks a drink from a passing tray, revealing a dark
smudge across the inside of her wrist as she does.
TREVOR
I'd invite you in, but...
Suddenly intent, Max pushes past Trevor and into the loft.
MAX
hanks.
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Max weaves through the party towards Natasha, out of place in
his utilitarian clothes. She looks up as he gets closer...
N
ATASHA
ou decided to stay for a while.
She speaks with a Russian accent - smiling, a little nervous.
Rather than answering, Max's eyes drop to her wrist.
NATASHA
ow it's your turn to say something...
ax takes her hand, gently turning it to reveal her tattoo: a
black wing, stylized feathers tracing faint blue veins.
MAX
That's interesting.
NATASHA
Thank you. It's...
(glancing past Max)
Shit.
Max follows her gaze to the front door, where Trevor is
nervously greeting another new arrival: MONA SAX. She's
striking, beautiful but also a little frightening. It
doesn't hurt that she's flanked by BODYGUARDS. Russian Mob.
Seeing Natasha standing with Max, Mona barrels across the
room towards them. People stand aside to let her pass.
ithout preamble, Mona begins YELLING at Natasha in Russian.
Natasha RESPONDS in kind, clearly intimidated by Mona.
Abruptly, Mona grabs Natasha's arm, jerking her off balance.
MAX
Why don't you let go--
S
12.
MONA
(in perfect English)
Mind your business.
Mona returns to Natasha, dragging her towards the door.
Natasha's tone becomes PLEADING, physically no match for
Mona. Max steps in, reaching up to touch Mona's shoulder...
I
t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's
arm. Incredibly, he's just as fast, slipping free of the
grip that would surely have snapped his wrist...
For a moment, Max and Mona stare each other down. Surprised,
reevaluating each other. Natasha continues to TALK, her
Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.
Mona's eyes drop to Max's chest, where the tussle pulled his
coat open to reveal a low-pro holster and tarnished badge.
With the flick of her wrist, Mona stops her guards' advance.
The crowd begins to notice the altercation. Natasha keeps
TALKING, trying desperately to make peace and reassure Mona
of something. Mona's eyes cut between Natasha and Max...
till apprehensive, Mona shakes her head and walks away.
NATASHA
My sister.
(beat)
Sort of a bitch.
As Max nods at the understatement, Trevor rushes over,
forcing a broad smile to reassure his guests. He pulls Max's
coat closed over the badge and ushers him towards the door.
TREVOR
You have to go. Now.
MAX
(pulling free)
Fine. I just want to ask her something
first...
Max turns to the spot where Natasha had been.
She's gone.
HALLWAY - LATER
The party has grown more crowded. Max fights his way down a
dark hall, searching the shadowed faces he passes. Back
here, the music is nothing but GROWLING BASS.

A flickering glow escapes the gaps around one door...
DARK ROOM
A ring of candles in the center of the floor provides the
only light. It's not enough to really see the PEOPLE inside.
We hear them CHANTING, low voices MURMURING in unison...
Quick glimpses in the candle light, bare flesh writhing.
Cast on the walls, corresponding shadows twist and shift...
A black feather billows across the floor between candles.
Spreading up the wall, a new shadow rises above the rest...
pair of wings - long and distorted in the candle light.
Max appears in the doorway as the shadows loose their shape -
Max only catching a glimpse, not sure what he's seeing...
HALLWAY
As Max strains to see detail in the dark room, a face
materializes in the haze: cheeks laced with tattoos, eyes
twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow. JACK LUPINO.
uddenly, Max turns and sees Natasha standing beside him.
We
immediately notice something different about her: staring
boldly into Max's eyes, all her earlier shyness vanished.
N
ATASHA
Looking for me?
Natasha glances through the door at the shifting shadows,
smiling at what she sees. Max follows her eyes...
MAX
Were you in there?
ATASHA
(shrugging, coy)
Take me somewhere, I'll tell you.
Natasha walks down a dark, desolate block, the sound of her
HEELS echoing off of the crumbling buildings around her. Her
eyes are still wild, her stride quick and aggressive.
A group of MEN huddle in a stairway to avoid the wind. As
Natasha passes, they look up at her with equally wild eyes.
atasha steps off the sidewalk and into an alley, plunging
into the darkness like she's been there many times before.
In the distance, faint MUSIC rumbles through the street.

Natasha barrels down the alley, squinting to see ahead.

Suddenly unsettled by something, Natasha's pace slows.
She

can RATTLES in the alley behind her.
Natasha spins...
Nothing - just the FLICKERING of moths swarming the alley's
only light, their shadows black shapes against the bricks.
The sound of much larger BEATING WINGS fills the alley...
Eyes wide with terror, Natasha searches for something in the
shapes cast by the moths, dread deepening as she finds it:
eal winged shapes mix with the shadows, FLAPPING wildly...
Natasha CRIES OUT, stumbling back.
She turns, running...
NATASHA
ot yet!
Please, just let me...
Natasha's SCREAMS seem lost in the chaos of wind and WINGS
and distant MUSIC. She suddenly stops running...
More SHADOWS assemble ahead of her, their black wings open.
Alex approaches the alley, pulling on a leather jacket and
snapping a badge onto his belt. The cops let him pass.
Max follows Alex, slowing as he crosses the police tape. By
the crowd of CSI TECHS, what started here didn't end well.
There's blood everywhere, a dozen white sheets on the ground.
MAX
What happened to them?
ALEX
Her.
Just one.
Confused, Max studies the sheets. On second look, they
aren't covering anything quite big enough to be a whole body.
ALEX
omebody found her leg near the sidewalk,
called it in a few hours later. We found
the other one in the dumpster over there.

the word we came up with.
The Detective grins, proud of his wit. Alex and Max move on
without comment. Max looks at the sheets, shaking his head.
MAX
Why are you showing me this?
Alex pulls out a plastic evidence bag, holding it out...
Max's wallet.
ALEX
We found it here, by her heart.
Inside the clear bag, Max's ID picture is smeared with blood.
ALEX
As far as we know, the victim--

ax kneels down over a tarp. The edge is pulled back,
revealing a pale forearm with a delicate tattoo of a wing.
MAX
(remembering)
They couldn't lift him up...
ALEX
What did you just say?
Max looks up at Alex, who is suddenly quite agitated. He
glances back at the other detectives - they're staring at
Alex and Max, whispering something amongst themselves.

ALEX
We need to talk, Max. Tonight.

Here's my address...
MAX
For God's sake, I know where you--
ALEX
(somber)
No, I moved out.
Alex hands over the address and hurries away, leaving Max
standing in the alley, surrounded by Natasha's remains.
Max steps out of his car, moving up the sidewalk to a
surprisingly nice apartment building: uniformed doorman, the
works. Double-checking the address, Max steps inside...
A massive stone structure, squat like a military fortress and
black under the storm clouds. There have been updates over
the years, but nothing could to hide the age of the building.

BB starts across the sidewalk to the entrance. Max follows,
giving a confused frown at the building they're approaching.
MAX
You quit working for Aesir?
BB leads Max through a wrought-iron gate, into a small
courtyard leads back to the thick wood doors of the entrance.
B
I didn't quit, they made me head of
security for the whole parent company.
That comes with its own building, such
that it is.

Check this out.
A proud parent, BB points at a deep pit in the stone wall.
MAX
(impatient)
It's a bullet hole.
BB
Yeah, from a musket ball. The British
used this place as a military prison
during the Revolutionary War. Think
about that. It's older than St. Paul's.
M
ax looks up at the crumbling gargoyles perched above.
NT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - DAY
The double doors fly open onto a massive office - dark wood
panelling, a wall of windows glowing white from the snow.
Max goes to the windows. Spreading out bellow him, the wide
black expanse of the East River rolls past. Bridges arc up
into the storm clouds and disappear before they hit Brooklyn.
BB
W
hen the weather isn't so shitty, the
view is unbelievable.
(going to the closet)
I'm not making any guarantees that any of
this will fit.
While BB roots around inside, Max absently scans his desk.
A slick company newsletter - `AESIR PHARMACEUTICALS.' On
the cover, NICOLE HORNE - 50's, dignified, not quite smiling.
`A HOLIDAY MESSAGE FROM THE CEO' printed below her face.

Max flips the pages - smiling scientists, sparkling labs...
ICHELLE PAYNE, bright smile illuminating a bland corporate
portrait. The same face in the photo Max showed the Junkie.
BB
hey're going to set up some kind of
scholarship in her name.
Taken by surprise, Max doesn't seem to hear BB's explanation.
BB

over what she might want. I guess since

ax eagerly takes the old uniform from BB, happy to have
something else to focus on. BB studies his body language.
BB
You still haven't been out there, have
you?
Max doesn't answer, slipping into a wrinkled dress shirt.
XT. CEMETERY - DAY
Cars line the drive leading into the cemetery. People leave
their warmth and hurry through the iron gates - these
mourners especially determined, a community out to honor a
fallen brother. BB and Max follow them onto the...
CEMETERY PATH
Max's eyes are on the cemetery. BB follows his gaze...
Two marble angels on the hill. One smaller than the other.

black, escorted through the cemetery gate by the HONOR GUARD.

suddenly anxious)
Go ahead up and say something to Christa.
I'll find us some seats...
ax threads his way through the mass of UNIFORMED COPS
waiting to enter the cemetery. One by one they notice Max,
jaws clenching. Max doesn't realize the gauntlet he's in,
distracted by a glance of BB slinking into the graves...
...where NICOLE HORNE watches the funeral from among the
headstones, almost overdressed in head-to-toe black. Close
at hand, JASON COLVIN holds Nicole's umbrella.
B approaches Nicole, body language weak and deferential...
Max glances back at the path and finds himself facing a wall
of angry cops. He keeps walking, no sign of backing down.
CHRISTA (O.C.)
Let him through.
Even with the cops making way, the walk to Christa is hard -
the heartbreak and grief on her face slowing Max's gait.
AX
Christa, I'm really sorry about what--
CHRISTA
Don't talk to me like some stranger.
Christa's eyes bore into Max with all the weight of a long
and deep friendship, momentarily shaming him into silence.
CHRISTA
Who did this to him, Max?
MAX
We don't have a lot, yet...
Christa steps towards Max, teeth gritted with powerless rage.

life, he cared that much. So what are

M
ax could melt under those eyes, but Christa turns her back
and continues up the path to Alex's waiting coffin.
Shamed, Max turns away and starts back down the path alone.
BRAVURA
Detective Payne?
Everyone turns to see JIM BRAVURA (40s) leaning on the fence.
BRAVURA
.A.
I need you to come with me.
hough they'd been moments from brawling, there's a common
reaction from the other cops: nobody likes this guy. Max
looks around, humiliated.
MAX
ow?
BRAVURA
Now.
GRAVESIDE
The honor guard stands in formation by the flag-draped
casket. The PRIEST waits, his bible ripping in the wind...
Christa twists around in her chair, looking down at the
cemetery gate. She sees the crowd, Max being escorted away.
CHRISTA
(sad, to the priest)
Okay.
Above them all, Nicole Horne stands like a shadow between the
graves, too far away to hear the words of the priest.
The snowfall has picked up, flurries giving way to thick
heavy flakes already sticking to the sidewalk. Max leans
into the stinging wind, lost in the night's revelations.
Hax slows abruptly, looking back at the street behind him...
eavy shadows pool around the alleys, doorways and swelling
cars. The streetlights seem to carry less in the snow.
A FIGURE walks down the opposite sidewalk. With heavy snow
filling the space between them, it's hard to make out much...
...but there's something flowing out from the figure's back.
W
T
32.
Max turns back to the sidewalk ahead, jaw clenching...
ALLEY
Abruptly, Max's ducks into the mouth of alley. Back pressed
to the cold brick, he draws his pistol and CHAMBERS a round.
Unseen by Max, something moves in the shadows behind him...
he street lamps begin to sputter. In the strobing light,
long black shadows billow from the Figure's shoulders...
Max backs away from the corner, deeper into the dark alley
where three SHAPES are surging forward to meet him...
Max dodges, but his pistol's KNOCKED to the pavement. Max
stumbles, bringing up his guard. The Man charges again. Max
sidesteps, grabbing an arm as he does, SNAPPING the bone...
O
ut on the street, the Man's SCREAMS mix with the howling
wind. The Figure steps into the street, towards the alley...
Max is jumped from all sides, opponents finally coordinating
to overwhelm him. The Figure steps out of the wind...
...and what seemed to be wings turns out to be a long coat.
Mona Sax moves closer, opening that coat to reveal a thick
metal chain. Max GROWLS as arms pull him upright.
MAX
Lose your dog?
Mona whips the chain into Max's face, CLANKING as it strikes
bone. Instantly, blood begins streaming from his mouth...
MONA
We need to talk about my sister.
The chain CRACKS again, Max's teeth rattling from the blow.
MAX
hoever killed your sister did the same
thing to my partner--
(louder)
It was the same person.
MONA
Yeah.
You.
Mona HITS Max again, this time in the shins.
Max CRIES OUT.
M
(

MAX
slurred)
So stupid...
Slowly at first, Mona WHIRLS the chain into a larger loop...
MONA
You left your wallet lying beside her
body. Who's stupid?
M
ax slumps to the side, spitting out a stream of blood...
MAX
Does that sound like something a Homicide
cop would get wrong?
Mona whips the chain faster, CUTTING the air...thinking...
Gasping at the pain, Max slowly straightens up again.
MAX
You know somebody named Owen?
Mona lets the chain's speed gradually slow again.
MONA
Owen Green?
MAX
Natasha called him on her way out of my
apartment. Give me one day to--
Mona drops the chain with a CLANK.
ONA
No.
Now.
She motions for her men to haul Max to his feet.
Max throws himself forward into the window, looking down...
...where Owen falls, looking up at Max helplessly...
... then less terrified, as the wind keeps RUSHING past...
...and then, just before impact, relieved.
Owen CRASHES into the sidewalk.
B

Mona races up to join Max in the window. For a stunned beat
they look down at the shattered body of Owen Green - his
unblinking eyes frozen on the heavens, collecting snowflakes.
MONA
(shaken)
What did we just see?
No answer, Max studies Owen's twisted body. Long, finger-
like bruises trace out from his neck, blending with the
tattoos that lace his grey skin. Grinning skulls, the USMC
eagle/globe/anchor...
...and a pair of wings, just like Natasha's.
I
NT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT
Max drops a Polaroid of Owen's tattoo onto a glass counter.
lue water ripples through translucent pipes in the walls and
floor, the air of the small room glowing like the ocean. A
mirrored ceiling repeats the tattoo parlor again above.
MAX
You're sure this is the place?
MONA
Natasha had all her work done here.
An elderly TATTOO ARTIST moves up behind the counter.
ARTIST
Something I can help you with?
Max slides the photograph across to the Tattoo Artist.
MAX
What if I wanted this tattoo?
TATTOO ARTIST
Then you're probably in the Marine Corps.
MAX
(pointing to the wings)
This one.
The Artist stoops closer, tensing when he sees the design.
Mona leans over the counter, locking onto the Artist's eyes.
MONA
What is it?
37.
As encouragement, Mona lets her coat open to reveal her gun.
TATTOO ARTIST
(intimidated)
It's a Norse superstition. The Vikings
used to wear them for protection.
MONA
Trust me, my sister had all the guardian
angels she needed.
TATTOO ARTIST
Not angels. Valkyries.
T
he Artist goes to a shelf bulging with old books - his
reference library. He searches through dusty volumes...
Just past the shelves, a doorway is cracked open. A young
APPRENTICE artist hovers in the dark and listens in on the
conversation unnoticed - sweating, his pupils drawing back...
Returning with a book, the Artist finds the page: a winged
woman led by a pack of wolves over a grizzly battlefield.
TATTOO ARTIST
In Norse mythology, the only way you get
to go to heaven is to die in violence.
Die in your sleep, you go to hell.
Valkyries fly over the battlefields,
picking out the righteous dead. They
reward the people who draw first blood.
(beat)
A soldier's angel.
Nodding, Mona lets her gun drift away from the Artist.
TATTOO ARTIST
I'm generally thrilled to have referral
business, but I tell people looking for
those wings to find ink closer to home.
MONA
Where's home?
TATTOO ARTIST
Some club down in Alphabet City.
Mona turns to leave, satisfied, but Max is stuck on the book -
the valkyrie's empty eyes, bloody bodies at her feet...
MAX
Protection from what?

Suddenly, all the lights go out.
T
he pipes stop glowing, blackness replacing the blue lights.
Out of the corner of his eye, Max sees a DARKER SHADOW race
across the room towards them, almost too fast to be human...
Max and Mona have time to duck; the Artist isn't so lucky. A
CRACK of bone, the old man's skull taking the brutal force...
Mona's weapon BARKS, a short burst RIPPING through the air.
n the momentary fire, Max can see the Shape swinging a club.
The bat CUTS through the air, SMASHING open glass pipes in
the wall behind Max, the shards raining down over him...
The Figure charges at Max again.
Max's pistol CRACKS.
The room is abruptly silent.
The lights flash on.
Mona steps out of the back room...
Max is stunned to find himself standing over nothing more
monstrous than the Apprentice - one hand over the hole in his
chest, the other weakly swinging a shard of glass at Max.
A
PPRENTICE
(gurgling, to Max)
They see you...they see you...
MONA
Do you know this guy?
Max shakes his head, struck mute by the look in the dying
man's eyes.
In a block of abandoned storefronts, only one retains a spark
of life, its red sign burning in the dying light: RAGNA ROK.
T
he streets are more crowded there, people shuffling towards
that sign and the sounds of DARK MUSIC filtering from inside.
p on the roof, MUSIC inside the club RATTLES old pipes.
Perched at the edge of the roof, a figure CHANTS along...
Jack Lupino - the tattooed face we caught
a glimpse of in the
candle light of Trevor's party, now fully
visible in the
failing sun and no less frightening. His
colorless eyes
absorb the street, the SCREAMS, Max's car
pulling away...
On his back, the tattoos of two elaborate black wings. Steam
rises from ink-blackened skin, snow melting before it lands.
BB rushes out, struggling to keep up with Max's longer legs.
BB
What's really going on here?
MAX
Alex found something out about what
happened to her. Something new.
B
There's no way.
He would have told us.
MAX
He was trying, right before he died...

BB
Listen, okay? Why don't you come back
with me, let Beth make up the guest room
for you. Just for tonight.
Max nods, but keeps moving away from BB.
BB
You need to take some time. Get some
sleep, heal up. See if it still feels
real after that...
MAX
It's real.
Max crosses against the light, cutting through the driving
snow. BB tries to follow, but traffic pushes him back.
H
elpless, BB can only bury his hands in his pockets and watch
Max fade away. After a moment, he pulls something out...
A business card: `J. BRAVURA, I.A.'
In a ticket booth, an elderly ATTENDANT shivers by a space
heater, ticket windows plugged with make-shift insulation.
The attendant looks up from his book and sees Max approaching
through the snow. Max slows as he gets closer, looking up at
the glowing threshold to the trains beyond. He stops.
ATTENDANT
(via intercom)
You riding?
Max holds for a moment. For all the danger he's faced, this
is the most hesitation we've seen from him so far.
ATTENDANT
via intercom)
If you're coming, you better come on.
Way it's looking, might be the last train
tonight.
Max takes a step into the light of the ticket booth. The
attendant opens the ticket slot, letting a gust of freezing
air blow inside. Max slides a few bills through.
Ticket in hand, Max starts his solitary march to the trains.

45.
The platform is cleaner than the ones in the city - dressed
up for the tastes of the COMMUTERS who step off of the train.
Max threads his way through the handful of exhausted
BUSINESSMEN arriving home, moving out into the darkness.
The snow's driving just as hard out here, but peaceful houses
with warm windows glowing make the storm feel comforting. In
the yards, forgotten sleds disappear under new powder, gone
for good by morning. Snowmen distort as they swell.
Max Payne trudges up the center of the street, a black streak
spoiling the peace of the evening. A trespasser.

driveway, no colorful Christmas lights flashing from the
eaves. A black void behind every window, no life inside.

Max reaches for the handle...hesitant to actually touch...
CUT TO:
At the edge of a strip mall, a ramshackle personal storage
business sits behind a razor-wire fence. Inside the fence,
rows of stalls for rent, covered by metal garage doors.
here's the faint sound of METAL STRETCHING, and Max is over
the fence. He moves through the rows, reading the numbers.
A padlock hangs from the door, shining metal glazed over with
a sheet of ice. Max finds a pristine key on a ring in his
pocket. Hands shaking, he cracks the ice and tries...

Max walks deeper into the space, brushing the light over the
boxes. He holds his hand over one, as if warming it...
Max opens the box.
aiting for him under the flaps, a stuffed animal stares up
at Max from inside the box. Silly grin, frozen eyes shining.
Hands trembling, Max pushes the toy aside. Deeper in the
box, he finds a framed picture and pulls it into the light...
The photograph is of Max - younger, cleaner, genuinely
smiling. Posed along with him, Olan Mills-style, are
Elizabeth and the baby. Gauzy backdrop, church clothes.
Max studies it, haggard new face reflecting in the glass...
Abruptly, Max jumps up and moves away from the box. Long
strides, trying in vain to physically shake the memories, to
block out the emotions with something productive...
The flashlight beam keeps sweeping, deeper and deeper. Max
chokes back tears, occasionally glancing at the baby box.

to throw the lid off the document box. Rows of folders, all

(to himself)
Okay, Chelle. Help me, here...
Max's fingers skim to the last file in the box, marked
`2004.' Much thinner than the others. Her last year.
Only one file in the final section. Max opens it, finding
pages of handwritten notes, photocopies, drawings...
Closing the file, he checks the name on the tab and frowns.

Max steps out of the storage locker. He tucks the manila
folder inside his coat and pulls the metal door closed.
He starts away, retracing his steps to the fence. Mind
reeling with what he's just seen, the memories flooding back--
There's a second set of footprints in the snow before him.
Max freezes, their significance immediately registering.
OICE (O.S.)
Stay where you are!
A YOUNG COP steps out of the shadows behind Max, pistol
trained on the back of his head. The cop's eyes are wide

with panic. He assumes an awkward, textbook firing position.

Relax, I'm a cop.

Don't move! I know who you are.

Slowly, he raises his hands.
MAX
Just relax. I need you to trust me for a
minute...
YOUNG COP
Yeah? Is that what you said to your
partner?
MAX
You don't understand.
YOUNG COP
(gesturing with the gun)
Lay down on your face.
Max studies the cop - stiff legs unsteady on the deep snow,
his frostbitten fingers wrapped around the trigger. Trapped
between two rows of locked doors, Max has no cover to run.
Peeking through the snow at Max's feet, an extension cord
snakes under the shivering cop's legs and down the corridor.
T

MAX
(bending down)
Okay, just take it easy.
Max starts to lay down, causally laying his hand over the
power cord. The cop edges closer, smirking as Max complies.
YOUNG COP
Word's gotten around about the sick shit
you did to him, too. If I were you, I'd
get ready for sort of a long ride back
into the city...
Max wraps his hand around the cord and whips it tight...
The cop pitches backward, squeezing off a SHOT as he falls.
Before he can fire again, Max pounces on the cop, driving a

knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol away.

he cop goes limp. Max pulls the clip, clears the chamber
and lets the gun fall in the snow beside the unconscious cop.
Struggling to his feet, Max races down the corridor and
scaling the icy chain link. He drops into the snow,
immediately breaking into a dead run on the other side.
Up and down the dark street, shadowed GHOULS break windows
and claw at abandoned cars, searching for anything of value.

Moving comfortably through the shadows, Mona follows the
general movement towards a BASSY QUAKE farther up the block.
A red neon `RAGNA ROK' bloodies the snow in the air, marking
the entrance to the club responsible for the RUMBLE...

glimpses of thin limbs and black pupils on the dance floor.

inding around the dance floor, CLUBGOERS - some ragged, some
in nice clothes - queue at a metal door in the back wall.
One after another, they wait for their moment to enter...
There's a disturbance at the front door. Black-clad Guards
force open a rift in the crowd on the dance floor...
Jack Lupino walks inside the rift - his tattooed face red and
black, eyes calmly sweeping out across the riotous crowd...
ROM THE DANCEFLOOR
Lupino moves through bodies roiling like a parted sea, sheer
walls of twisting flesh towering above him to the rafters.
Mixed within, the wings POUND and SWEEP, blotting the light.
Hell.
The snow isn't deep near the charred and twisted metal of the
train, melted by the fireball. Police tape rings the area.

ETECTIVES wander between yellow tarps in the train, sipping
coffee. Out on the tracks, Bravura works alone.

He forced them to stop, first.
Bravura nods at the explanation, but without conviction.
He
continues to scan the wreckage, still not satisfied...
BRAVURA
So he had the bomb with him inside, but
he decided to walk outside to detonate
it?
HOMICIDE COP
Are you asking if that seems like odd
behavior from a guy who cut his partner's
head off?
The Young Cop from the storage building slips down the snowy
bank and towards Bravura. His face is bruised and swollen.
OUNG COP
You wanted to see me?
HOMICIDE COP
Careful what you say to him, if you ever
want to make detective...
YOUNG COP
(to Bravura, guarded)
I already filled out a report.
Bravura sees the Young Cop aware of the detective's presence.
BRAVURA
Show me where it happened, then.
E
XT. STORAGE FACILITY - MORNING
Bravura and the Young Cop stand on the spot where he fought
Max the night before - disturbed snow, the frayed cord...

Bravura nods at the bullshit, focus drawn to Max's locker.
BRAVURA

He was coming out of here?
When the Young Cop nods, Bravura starts to step inside.
HOMICIDE COP
Hey, real cops are working here...
The city is starting to shut down under the relentless snow -
the sidewalks are nearly empty, only cabs on the icy streets.
The Aesir corporate offices gleam in the diffuse light, a
pillar of glass and steel disappearing up into the storm...
R
Jason Colvin steps out of a cab and marches up the steps.
ECEPTION AREA
Stepping off of the elevator, Colvin passes a RECEPTIONIST.
COLVIN
You should go on home, already.
There's
nothing going on today...
RECEPTIONIST
Well, there's someone in your office...
COLVIN'S OFFICE
Colvin steps through the doorway and stops short.
Max stands behind Colvin's desk, inspecting the photographs
hanging on the wall. He's cleaned himself up a little.
MAX

This your daughter?

COLVIN
Yes, it is. Three years old.
For reasons Colvin can't fathom, Max's mood seems to darken
even farther. Colvin sees the badge clipped to his belt.
COLVIN
Is there something I can help you with,
detective?
AX
You can tell me about Project Valhalla.
COLVIN
(nervous laugh)
I think you might have the wrong...
Barely keeping his poker face, Colvin eyes the phone.
MAX
eed to make a call?
COLVIN
Maybe I'd better.
Max motions for Colvin to go ahead. While the executive's
shaking hands dial the number, Max closes and LOCKS the door.
COLVIN
Yes, there's a detective here...

Abruptly, Max RIPS the phone cord out of the wall.

The words, Max's flat delivery, catch Colvin like ice water.
Still holding the dead receiver, Colvin staggers back...
COLVIN

Excuse me?
MAX

shadows. Mona ducks her head away as the spotlight finds her
at her building door. For a moment, she's in a whiteout.
lowly, the cop car moves on. Mona starts to use her key...
but the lock has already been forced open.
BB steps through the door, over the guard's upturned chair.
The blizzard has won - streets and sidewalks no longer
scraped, cars long abandoned under their icy cocoons. The
fifth largest city in the world, reduced to a ghost town.
B
Happy New Year.
B strides out in front, taking in the sight. It might as
well be a desert, white sand sifting around their boots,
buildings rising above like black canyon walls.
Max shuffles along behind BB, head bent low in the wind.
Plumes of his ragged breaths trailing out behind him.
79.
BB (cont'd)
Look at it from my perspective: this
thing is going to be a true epidemic.
One hundred percent dependence within a
few doses, and we control the only
source. This is so much bigger than
Lupino's little bar. This is every
street corner in the City in a month,
nation wide in two.
Max keeps trudging, one foot in front of the other. BB looks
annoyed that he's not getting a reaction out of him.
B
B
I hope you're not over there blaming me.
Really, this is Michelle's fault.
Max's eyes start to burn.
BB sneaks a peek, encouraged.
BB
She had no right to put me in that
situation. Asking me to pass up this
kind of an opportunity to help her rat
out my bosses...I'm sorry, but that's
unreasonable.
Max's head snaps up, eyes simmering with rage.
BB smiles.
BB
But then again, who could blame her for
getting confused, being married to such a
righteous man. So maybe it is your
fault, after all.
(beat)
Just like your old man. Always knew you
were better than everyone else--
MAX
No.
Just better than you.
BB's smile seems to double.
He considers Max for a moment.
BB
For what it's worth, he didn't know
Michelle was going to die.
Max starts walking again, doesn't raise his eyes. The seed
has been planted, though. BB plays with the silence.
BB
He thought they were going out there to
scare her, destroy her research.

FLASHBACK: MAX'S KITCHEN - DUSK
Looking up from the mail, Max sees the smashed kitchen door.
R
Max keeps walking, trying to fight off the memories. BB
strolls along beside him, taking his time with the story.
BB
I'd arranged with the other guys to
finish the job.
LASHBACK: MAX'S HALLWAY - DUSK
Max races into the hallway bathed in golden light.
Between Max and the end of the hall, two JUNKIES are huddled
against a door. Twisting the handle, SMACKING the wood.
BB (V.O.)
He locked them out of the bedroom, tried
CPR...boy scout shit.
he Junkies turn to Max, eyes black and glassy.
Sick smiles.
Max looks nauseous.
BB sees it, thrilled.

And as thanks, you nearly blew his head
off while he crawled out the window.

FLASHBACK: MAX'S BEDROOM - DUSK

curtains. The fabric ripples, revealing a reflection...
Alex.
BB (V.O.)
That's funny, to me.
A momentary flash of his profile, a mask of guilt and shame.
Max stops walking.
All of his will gone.
BB steps closer, drinking in the pain in Max's eyes.
BB
You really didn't know?
With a shrug, BB turns away from Max's fury and moves on...
INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS
Above them, traffic signals strain under thick icicles.
Intermittently, the lights go dark, the power faltering.

You should have killed me then, when you
had a chance.
BB
I learned something from your father,
years ago. Always give people a choice.
tepping into the intersection, BB stops. Abruptly, Joe
Salle closes with Max, meaty hand clamping onto his arm.
BB
He gave me the choice between early
retirement or facing the charges he was
going to bring against me. He sat me
down in that bar and explained that I
could either give up the thing I loved,
or I could have it taken away by force.
That (was my choice.

BB
Just out of curiosity, though: why don't
I have a chance now?
Max's eyes are clear - almost peaceful for the first time.
MAX
Because now I know it's you.
BB moves closer, the arrogance in his smile deepening.
BB
Well, you're--
Suddenly, Max launches himself forward - a fullback's
explosion into the line that catches Salle by surprise...
Hands cuffed behind his back, Max drives his shoulder into
BB's jaw, splitting his lip. BB tumbles back into the snow.
Joe brings the club out again, bashing Max across the head,
using it to choke Max until his struggles lose power.
JOE SALLE
Okay, enough. This is far enough.
BB looks around, wiping the blood from his lip. His eyes
fall on a mound of construction rubble in a vacant lot.
B
B
Hang on.
JOE SALLE
BB...
BB stands and walks onto the lot, kicking away snow until he
exhumes a cinder block in the rubble pile. BB picks it up.
BB
've got something better.
Carrying the cinder block, BB starts off down a different
street. Grudgingly, Salle pushes Max along after him.
Visible a few blocks away, the black body of the river waits.

An ancient shipping pier juts out into the river, murky water
high and roiling around its pilings from the stormy weather.

B motions for Max and Joe Salle to follow him out onto the
pier, its planks buried under a thick sheet of ice.
BB

Grab me some of that rope.
BB drops the cinder block at Max's feet, CRACKING the ice.
BB
It's not like we didn't see it coming.
Clamping onto Max's arm, BB unlocks his handcuffs.
BB
Sullen, withdrawn...Max just never seemed
the same after the tragedy.
ights running the length of the pier flicker, eventually
dying altogether. All down the shore, the power fails.
BB
It's a good thing his father didn't live
to see it, though. Bill Payne's only
son, a strung-out suicide.
idden in the now deeper darkness, BB pulls something from
his coat: two glass vials like Lupino's, filled with the same
green powder. He tucks them into Max's coat pocket.
BB
smiling)
It would have eaten him alive.
MAX
Bravura's not going to buy it.
BB
Sure? Not even once the autopsy turns up
traces in your blood?
Max looks at BB, trying to understand how that could be.
BB
dosed you that night at Alex's, just to
make sure things were fuzzy. Compliments
of the house.
J
84.
Seeing that BB has removed Max's cuffs, Salle hurries over.
The motion puts both men off balance on the slick boards...
BB
oe, why don't you calm down...
Salle grabs Max's arm. Max looks down at Salle's feet, hard-
soled shoes slipping. Salle anticipates his next thought...
Abruptly, Max jerks his arm away.
Not able to let go in time, Salle's feet fly out from under
him. The big man crashes down hard on his side.
Max ducks and stumbles forward...
BB FIRES, missing. Max looks back. Beached on his side, Joe
Salle draws his pistol, the next shot coming any moment...
Max slips. Struggling to right himself, hands scraping over
rough planks, another shot CRACKS inches from Max's legs...
With nowhere else to go, Max turns to the water. Boots
slipping, he lunges for the edge, careening over...
RIVER - CONTINUOUS
Max SPLASHES down into the dark water, body twisted in an
awkward position, wind blasted from his lungs by the impact.
SHOTS from the pier above CUT into the water around him...
Max dives under as much as he can stand it in the frigid
water, swimming farther from shore. Shots continuing to
SPLASH around him, the current pulls him into deeper water...
P
IER
BB and Salle FIRE with less conviction. In the water, the
disturbance made by Max grows smaller as he's swept away.
BB lowers his gun, motioning for Salle to do the same.
BB
It's fine, as cold as that water is...

Just in case, though. Make sure.
Salle frowns, shoots BB a look.
JOE SALLE
How?

RIVER
Max lifts his head. The wide expanse of the river stretches
around him, surface broken by swirling pocks of falling snow.
The current caries him farther from piers and buildings
receding into snow, as black as the water they rise above.
Turning, Max sees that the opposite shore is even farther.
Slowly, the exhilaration of escape begins to change. Icy
water bites his skin. Muscles beginning to tremble...
Limbs heavy with saturated clothing, joints seized by cold,
Max tries to swim against the current with little success.
Max sinks lower, churning water lapping his face.
GASPING
BREATHS becoming SPUTTERING COUGHS...
CUT TO:
Max breaks the surface: COUGHING, GASPING, flailing his arms.
It's hopeless; he immediately begins to sink again.
Desperation, panic move his limbs, but for nothing.
Max Payne slips under without so much as a ripple.
Out in the middle of the river, the white curtain of blowing
snow parts to reveal a dark shape, drifting in the fog. Like
an island in the black water, a small boat bobs in place...
T

weather while talking into a two-way radio. Faintly visible
around him, larger ships are outlined by twinkling lights.

hook across the body. He tries again, a solid hit...
A hand breaks the surface, weakly grabbing the pole.

pier. The Captain and his FIRST MATE crouch over Max.

The Captain and Mate lift Max's rigid body up to the pier.
People start to inspect his cut and battered body.

all the cops, he's bleeding everywhere.
Catatonic to this point, Max suddenly tries to shake his
head. He attempts to sit up, but hands force him down.
Powerless, Max's eyes desperately look around, searching...

Hand shaking violently, Max reaches inside his coat and pulls
out the vials BB planted. Trembling, he flips the caps away.
IRST MATE
What is that? What's he...
With everything he has, Max opens his chattering jaws and
dumps the green-tinged powder into his mouth.
APTAIN

Let him go, then.
Max wobbles up the planks, the snow fall not quite as hard as
it had been when he went into the water.
Max's gait grows more steady, each step forcefully forward...
One by one, the flakes become burning embers drifting from
the sky. Max marches ahead, bits of fire raining over him.
With dead streetlights, the hulking black shape of the Asgard
building looms like a mountain at the end of the block.
ax moves up the street, steam rising from his clothes as
they dry from the heat of his skin. Sweat beads on his face.
Max enters Asgard's courtyard, the Gothic facade rising high
above. He passes through its security lights, shadow casting
down onto the clean white snow like a projection screen...
Invisible to the naked eye, more shadows of winged shapes
dart and swoop in the air above Max's outline on the snow.
Sickly light glows in the east. The snow has all but
stopped. BB strides across the roof, hope in his eyes.
BB

The weather's broken, your pilot is going
to have no problem landing.
From the ground, the explosion rains glass down over the Feds
and waiting SWAT team. Shielding his eyes, Bravura squints
up at the flames in the windows. Taliente pats his shoulder.

BRAVURA
Try to take Payne alive, if there's
anything left.
Taliente nods.
On his signal, the SWAT team mobilizes.
A shower of bullets strikes the doors as he steps outside.
Max can't react. Bullets shred the door behind him, one slug
hitting Max in the stomach and knocking him to the ground.

It's unbelievable. All that snow, and...
Watch it end up being a beautiful day.
ritting his teeth, Max struggles to his knees. Blood rushes
between his fingers, streaming out of the hole in his side.
earing Max's effort, BB turns away from the empty sky.
Using the pistol as a crutch, Max finally stands...
BB
You want my confession, first?
You came
all this way for it...
BB tosses his useless weapon aside.
BB
(mock penitent)
Forgive me, Max, for I have sinned. I
should have bet more on you, and less on
that helicopter.
Max limps closer, pistol swinging at his side.
A thin trail
of blood follows behind him in the snow...
BB watches Max's approach, his swagger rapidly failing.
BB
Just get to it, already. That's all I
ask. You've earned it, so just...
With the pain in his stomach causing some difficulty, Max
pulls the pistol's slide back to check for a live round.
BB watches Max's preparations, terror growing. Unable to
resist his panic, BB abruptly tries on a helpless smile.
BB
But I want you to listen to me, first.
Just try to hear what--
Max raises the pistol and PULLS THE TRIGGER. The slug hits
BB in the center of the forehead, snapping his neck back.
The shell casing twirls down, landing in the snow without a
sound. BB's corpse lands a moment later with a clumsy THUD.
Max lets the gun slip out of his hand and walks past the body
- BB's eyes frozen on the sky, red halo slowly expanding.
Max reaches the edge, the river's black body revealed below.
His gait falters, blood filling each footprint in the snow...
Max stands at the roof's edge. A stiff wind buffets against
his chest, forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little.
Slowly, his eyes drift from the water below to the sky...
CUT TO:
Max looks up at the sky. Behind him, the SWAT team races
outside, swarming and BARKING orders at Max, weapons raised.
Max drops to his knees. He raises his hands, one dripping
with his own blood. But his eyes stay on the sky...
MAX'S VOICE
But I have this idea about it.
...where a tiny tear opens in the clouds, revealing steel
grey dawn beyond.
FADE OUT.
