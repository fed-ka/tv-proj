Oliver hauls trash outside, adding it to a very large pile of
bags. An older Jack Russell Terrier, ARTHUR, follows him.
In the dark, OLIVER FIELDS has a tape recorder and
microphone, he follows ANDY as he excitedly prepares, a group
of friends looks on.
ANDY
Okay. Is it on? (recorder)
OLIVER
Yeah yeah.
ANDY
This is for our friend Hal Fields.
Hal. We love you.

Andy quickly lights a rack of large fireworks, they shoot up
into the night and explode - smoke - more explosions -
everyone's laughing. Oliver looks up at the fireworks,
recording the sounds, happy.
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
CUT TO PRESENT
Oliver has packed his car, he leans down to Arthur.
OLIVER
You're coming to live with me now.
Arthur looks at him.
OLIVER
This is my car.
Arthur hops in.
Oliver's car drives down Sunset boulevard.
A live action "portrait" of Hal, looking into camera, first
in old clothes, then jump cut to new all black outfit.
OLIVER (V.O.)
He changed all his clothes.
The camera moves through a large group of men and streamers
gathered for Los Angeles Pride event.
OLIVER V.O. (CONT'D)
He got a boyfriend, Andy, a
physical trainer who was also
studying for his professional
pyrotechnic license.
Camera lands on Hal beaming with pride, his arm around Andy
who looks into camera and says.

10/29/07 6.
CONTINUED:
ANDY
Since I came out to my father, he
never speaks to me. That's why
I've been always attracted to older
men.
Hal and friends laugh warmly at Andy. We cut to live action
"portraits" of a priest, a therapist, the Primetimers, his
movie-night club, and the large L.A. Pride group, all looking
into camera.
OLIVER V.O.
He found an out gay priest to guide
him spiritually. He saw a therapist
for the first time. He joined the
Primetimers. Movie night.
Los Angeles Pride, and then...
Oliver walks Arthur across a lit field, towards the dog park.
Everywhere dogs and their people are playing. Oliver and
Arthur sit on a bench like two humans. Oliver watches the
action, Arthur stares at Oliver.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
Go have your own experiences with
your own people. I'll be right
here...
Arthur stays by Oliver's side.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
I'm a human. I'm not a dog.
And you're a Jack Russell, that's a
breed. Your personality was created
by this guy John Russell, a hunting
enthusiast, in the 1800s. And he
bred your ancestors to have stamina
and courage for the hunt. You think
you're just you, and you want to
chase the foxes, but other people
planted that in you years ago.

10/29/07 10.
CONTINUED:
OLIVER (CONT'D)
Now, somewhat arbitrarily, you are
considered very cute by us humans,
and we keep breeding you not to
chase foxes, but to be cute, and we
put you in movies and television
shows, and you, you're chasing
tennis balls cause there as close
to a fox as you're going to get.
Arthur stays by Oliver's side.
(CONTINUED)
10/29/07 21.
CONTINUED:
Oliver and Arthur walk up the empty street - Oliver kicking
himself for missing his chance with her. His phone rings.
OLIVER
Hello?
ON THE OTHER END: Silence. A little breathing, the party in
background.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
Is that you?
BEEP.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
One beep means yes?
BEEP.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
I've always wanted to have a phone
call with someone who doesn't
talk...
BEEEEEEEEEEEEP.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
You want to do something?
BEEP
OLIVER (CONT'D)
Now?
BEEP.
OLIVER (CONT'D)
Okay, I'm parked just right up the
street.
BEEP. They hang up. Oliver is filled with hope.
CUT TO: "Julius" walking out into a pool of street light.
They smile at each other, but don't say anything. They get
into his car.
OLIVER
Okay. You point - I'll drive.
Oliver starts the engine. She points forward and they head
off. At the light she points left, he follows. Down the
street she points right...
OLIVER
This way?
(CONTINUED)
10/29/07 22.
CONTINUED:
She nods. Oliver drives up on the sidewalk before the
street, heads down it for half a block, then takes her right.
We can hear them laughing.
Oliver, Arthur and the woman enter a very fancy hotel lobby.
Oliver is impressed. She mime's giving him a tour but still
doesn't talk.
Oliver wakes, still in his clothes. ANNA is already up. She
waves and Oliver smiles.
Anna holds up her notebook: "Who are you?"
OLIVER
Oliver.
She writes again: "Go to NY. Audition. Back Thursday."
OLIVER
How long are you here when you get
back?
Anna holds up one finger.
OLIVER
A year?
Anna shakes her head and smiles. She gestures smaller.
OLIVER
A month? Right. And then?...
She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting.
OLIVER
You're filming here. Acting.
(CONTINUED)
10/29/07 24.
CONTINUED:
Oliver smiles as he interprets her gestures.
OLIVER
And after?...
She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand.
OLIVER
Just somewhere else. Where?
Anna only shrugs. She writes more, and tosses the notepad on
his lap. Oliver reads: "Can I see you again?"
He's very happy.
OLIVER
Yes.
Oliver now alone with Arthur - heading home, he's happy.
CU on his face as he remembers...
REPEAT SCENE: Oliver and Anna's first kiss, tentative and
delicate.
CUT TO PAST
The three are now in Oliver's car.
(CONTINUED)
10/29/07 31.
CONTINUED:
ELLIOTT
You're thinking about her all the
time.
OLIVER
And you know that because?
ELLIOTT
Because you're not talking about
it. I know you.
There's a pause, then the truth.
OLIVER
It's true. It's embarrassing. I'm
38 and falling for a girl again...
CUT TO PAST
Oliver and Arthur watch from the car as Elliott gets a can of
spray paint, heads to a blank wall across the street and
sprays a large tag on a wall. He then runs back to the car,
looks proudly at his work.
(CONTINUED)
10/29/07 33.
CONTINUED:
OLIVER
What the fuck is that?
ELLIOTT
L-E-IT, Elliot
OLIVER
Well, that's ridiculous.
ELLIOTT
I know! (Getting his criticism
more) You're not very supportive.
OLIVER
Well, its just copying something
someone did, like, 30 years ago in
the Bronx.
ELLIOTT
Well yeah. I'm part of a tradition
of civil disobedience, something
bigger than myself.
Oliver can't believe Elliott said that.
Elliott drives along-side Oliver who's walking with a spray
paint can, terrified as he's never done this before. He
tries to spray, nothing comes out.
OLIVER
How does it work?
ELLIOTT
Shake it, you have to shake it.
Oliver shakes it awkwardly, then sprays across the wall:
1985 BUSH FINDS JESUS
Oliver runs back to the car, exhilarated.
ELLIOTT
What was that?
OLIVER
Historical consciousness... you
know, something bigger than myself.
Elliott scoffs.
OLIVER
Let's do it again.
Elliott drives off. Oliver's coming to life.
(CONTINUED)
10/29/07 34.
CONTINUED:
WE HEAR:
ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Okay, but when you see her, don't
tell her that you painted
historical consciousness on the
wall...
WE SEE: more of Oliver's graffiti on different buildings:
1983 CHICKEN MCNUGGETS
2003 BRITNEY SPEARS MOST GOOGLED
Oliver exits his house alone, down his front stairs to the
street. Halfway down, he hears now familiar sound of Arthur
barking and howling. Oliver can't believe it.
10 year old Oliver's in the driving sear, Georgia smokes and
admires his handling of the car.
GEORGIA
You're turning into a wonderful
driver.
Oliver's proud.
They walk through a caged-in freeway overpass - Oliver is
carrying Arthur while blindfolding Anna with his hands. Over
this we hear the sounds of the quiet hotel room and an
intimate conversation between them.
ANNA (V.O.)
You don't know me. I like that.
OLIVER (V.O.)
No, that's not true.
ANNA (V.O.)
Oh yeah?
OLIVER (V.O.)
Yeah, you have blonde hair that
goes down to about here. You smoke
in non-smoking rooms.
Oliver is still covering her eyes, leading her to a certain
point, the busy sound of the freeway fading up...
OLIVER
Okay, open your eyes...
HIGH ANGLE on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath
Oliver and Anna's feet under the overpass. The trucks lay on
their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them.
MOMENTS LATER: they walk alongside the LA river together, arm
in arm, happy. The intimate conversation continues in voice
over.
ANNA (V.O.)
Oh yeah? You drive on the sidewalk.
You were raised by animals.
Sometimes you look very alone, like
you just got here.
They meet up with friends on the banks of the river.
OLIVER (V.O.)
Yeah, you see, you don't know me at
all.
Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk up to a typical L.A. Taco truck
on the side of the street. There is nothing fancy looking
about it.
ANNA
No.
OLIVER
Yeah.
ANNA
Really?
OLIVER
It's really good.
JUMP CUT: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready
to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously,
we're not sure what she thinks.
(CONTINUED)
10/29/07 46.
CONTINUED:
OLIVER
What do you think?
ANNA
It's so good.
Oliver's so relieved.
OLIVER
It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd
like it.
ANNA
Why?
OLIVER
You're an actress and staying in
that fancy hotel.
Anna can barely swallow her huge bite...
ANNA
I like this place.
Anna, Oliver and Arthur are walking in Elysian park, a view
of downtown behind them. Oliver's looking at her face, she
notices.
ANNA
What?
OLIVER
Nothing, you're pretty.
ANNA
No...
OLIVER
Yeah.
ANNA
Jewish girls are not pretty. They
can be "interesting", or cute, but
not pretty.
OLIVER
You're kidding right?
ANNA
That's what my mom told me.
OLIVER
She did not.
Anna laughs. As Anna continues to explain, the sound begins
to fade down...
ANNA
No, you're right, this girl at
school told me that. And I went
home and my mom said, `Anna, who
told you that?
And Oliver's narration fades in over them walking...
(CONTINUED)
10/29/07 49.
CONTINUED:
OLIVER (V.O.)
This is what it looks like when
Anna tells me about being Jewish in
2003. And when I tell her that my
mother was Jewish. And then my
father turned in his gay badge when
my mother turned in her Jewish
badge. And they got married in
1955.

CUT TO PRESENT
We cut to Arthur sprinting up a trail in Elysian park. Oliver
and Anna chase after him. In contrast to the previous scene
there is lightness and laughter here.
Anna, Oliver, Elliott, Shauna and Arthur drive up Sunset
Blvd. They arrive at Alvarado, park and get out. Above them a
well lit large blank/white billboard. As Oliver and Elliott
get spray paint cans from the back of the car...
ELLIOTT
Oliver, don't write any of that
serious stuff, okay? Just write
something funny. Girls like funny.
The gang get to the top of the stairs, on to the roof where
they can see the large blank billboard towering in front of
them.
SHAUNA
You know what? Here, give me
Arthur. We'll just stay here and
get arrested. You know, that's
good.
Oliver leaves Arthur with her, and Anna and Elliott and him
head off to the billboard. They climb it's structure, it's
high and a bit scary. On the top is a gang plank looking over
the city. Anna is happy she came. Elliott goes to paint the
back side of the billboard. Oliver meets up with Anna, over
looking the city.
OLIVER
You okay?
ANNA
Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my
new friend (the handrail she
holds).
OLIVER
Okay.
Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard.
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY.

finds her in the gangways between the two billboards with a
view to downtown below her.

She walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow
it's more intimate and vulnerable now.
ANNA
It's working.
They kiss.

run back to their car.

Oliver's laughing now - the noise, the absurdity. Hal and
Oliver make eye contact. Hal yells less strongly than the
others but trying...
HAL

OLIVER
Yeah, everyone knows that, here.
He gives Hal another pill, another reluctant difficult
swallow, another ping.
HAL
No they don't.
OLIVER
Everyone knows about that Pop.
HAL
Don't be ridiculous.
Hal's hiding something, he doesn't look Oliver in the eyes
when he asks...
HAL
Did you know, about me?
Oliver shakes his head no.
OLIVER
No, I just thought you and mom
weren't in love.
HAL
We loved each other.
OLIVER
But you were gay that whole time.

HAL
She didn't think I was the greatest
lover, but we made do. Look, I
liked my life, the museum, our
house, that's what I wanted.
OLIVER
And mom? You wanted mom too right?
Frustrated and angry, Oliver takes the pill tray into the
kitchen, leaving Hal behind.
HAL
Yes, stop that.
HAL
She proposed to me you know.
This draws Oliver back into the room.
HAL
I said - look I love you and we're
great buddies but you know what I
am. And then she says, that doesn't
matter. I'll fix that.
Oliver's never heard this part of the story before.

Okay? Thanks.
Elliott closes the door. Oliver heads back to his car and
Arthur's howling begins. It's an incredibly sad and desperate
howl. Oliver gets to his car, the howling doesn't stop,
Oliver can't ignore it. Oliver get's out of the car, heads

Oliver and Arthur drive up to a new house. Oliver looks at
Arthur with guilt.
Oliver watches Andy cry as Arthur licks him all over.

He tentatively gets into his car, silence. He drives away.
Oliver crosses the cold New York avenue.
Oliver passes a bodega with flowers - he pauses.
Oliver now with a bouquet of flowers in his hand, looking for
the right number, finds her building. On his way to the door,
he has doubts about the flowers, he decides to throw them
away.
Oliver rings her buzzer, no answers, a stranger leaves the
