                  Italybefore you came to Kembleford and fought with Anne-Marie Adams 
                  on the night of Ruby s birthday... dropping that coin in the struggle...

                  Anne-Marie was the storyteller. Father, you have a real talent for fiction

                  The photo was a clever touch. You had me flummoxed there for a while.

                  you wouldbe wearing  as the son of the nanny.I had it right when we first

                  your mother had died... visiting her grave and seeing her buried like a 
                  pauper. Did you blame Anne-Marie for her death?

                  I suspect you felt the Adamses owed her more than that. Old retainers are
