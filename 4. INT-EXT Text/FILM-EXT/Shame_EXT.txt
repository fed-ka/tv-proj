BRANDON is walking with shopping bags. He slows by the
revolving doors, spots a mother with buggy about to come out
of the other door and hurries over to open the door for her.
WOMAN comes out nodding her thanks.
19
23
A beautiful day-
BRANDON's face now fresh, passing-
A CUTE NEIGHBOR heading into the building, lost in
conversation on her cellphone-
CUTE NEIGHBOR
(in greeting)
Hey.
BRANDON
(nods)
Hey.
BRANDON juggling cellphone, keys and satchel, heading off to
work, watching the sway of her ass.
24
32
DAVID struggling to push his arm through the twisted sleeve
of his jacket, pursuing ELIZABETH and her friends up the
street.
DAVID
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok. Hold on,
hold on. No, listen. I just got to
talk to you one more time, one more
time. Listen..
BRANDON comes out of the club, doing up his coat. Looks away
at DAVID haranguing the trio.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Your eyes, they're beautiful. You
know why I didn't get it right the
first time? Because it's, it's like
a collage. Let me see your hand,
let me see your hand..
DAVID smiles, gently coaxing her in the opposite direction-
BRANDON hails a cab. DAVID continues haranguing ELIZABETH
19.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Look at those eyes, look at those
eyes. I know the color of your
eyes.
BRANDON (OVER)
David, come on.
DAVID
Come on, we can play that game.
That's so much fun when you play
that game.
LOREN
Bye.
A cab pulls up.
DAVID
It's okay. `cos I'm going this way.
BRANDON opens the cab door and waits with the taxi. DAVID
walks towards BRANDON.
BRANDON
Hey man, he's going uptown.
DAVID concedes throwing his arms up, jacket half on. DAVID
paws BRANDON affectionately, straightens BRANDON's jacket,
gives him a kiss and stumbles into the cab.
DAVID
(Laughs) Ok.
BRANDON
I'll see you tomorrow
The cab pulls away.
33
33
A car glides close to the kerb-
BRANDON head down walking-
ELIZABETH
Hey. Wanna ride?
BRANDON smiles-
BRANDON
Sure.
BRANDON gets into the car.
20.
34
34
The incessant drone of cars, steady overhead-
Vast concrete supports edging the highway-
BRANDON presses ELIZABETH flat again the grit of the wall
Caught in the scissored half light, they move, with glorious
abandon-
The slice of passing headlights casting fractured light
across their writhing state until-
ELIZABETH gasps, her body shuddering, leaning into his as
they climax together, sweat beading skin.
35
52
A dimly lit street-
A cab is pulling up. DAVID opens the door.
DAVID
I've got it, I've got it. Get out,
get out, get out, get out.
DAVID is wearing SISSY's hat.
DAVID (CONT'D)
Come here, come here, come here,
come here.
Finally SISSY steps out of the cab, DAVID lifts her over his
shoulder.
42.
SISSY
(YELPS) Oh, God! No! (LAUGHS)
DAVID
(STRAINS) Come on, come on with me,
come on...
SISSY
Get off. Get off. Get off.
DAVID (OVER)
You wanted me to do that. How did
that work?
SISSY
Get off me.
SISSY starts to enter thru the revolving door. DAVID follows
DAVID
Ah come on, come on, come on, come
on, come on...
BRANDON is left alone to pay the driver.
53
56
A dimly lit street-
44.
BRANDON just visible in his apartment block steady on the
approach. He is dressed in running gear.
Pushing the glass doors open, BRANDON hesitates and presses a
button on the iPod Nano on his arm. He stretches, zips his
top, pulling his hood up.
BRANDON slips his earphones on, moving off.
57
57
BRANDON running past illuminated windows and neon lights. The
city is alive. BRANDON stays focused, running, music pumping
in his head.
58
63
BRANDON stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward
the Hudson River, the LAP of murky water, audible. He hovers
for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back
to the main road.
The glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond.
64
64
Above, the tall, endless glass of The Standard Hotel, scored
with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny
still lives.
BRANDON comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans.
Above him, engraved in stone is "1949." He looks up toward
the tall building, which appears like a Stasi East Berlin
building. Stark and authoritative.
A KID slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor
window, a FILIPINO NANNY ushers him away.
A WOMAN, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans
and t-shirt, paces along the window. Catching sight of
BRANDON, she PULLS the curtain along the length of the glass.
A MAN stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and
jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up.
A FEMALE CLEANER just visible lost in the monotony of
cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy
duster.
And then BRANDON sees her-
A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands, naked her body pressed against
the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the Hudson
River. The steady back and forth of the MIDDLE AGED MAN
behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up
fuck.
50.
BRANDON hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his
face as for a brief flickering moment BRANDON's eyes lock
with the MIDDLE AGED WOMAN's dead gaze, standing high above-
A CAR HORN LOUD UNREMITTING-
BRANDON turns, his hypnotism broken. It's as if he comes back
to himself.
65
65
A distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street-
MARIANNE waiting inside the bar, seated, with a drink,
clearly there for some time. Her eyes checking the room, with
quiet concern.
BRANDON stands watching from a distance-
BRANDON makes to cross, hovering on the edge of the gutter
until-
66
67
A dirty grey street, brightened by the glow of BRANDON and
MARIANNE seated inside the restaurant.
68
68
LATER-
BRANDON and MARIANNE stand heady from the wine and a little
awkward in the freezing cold-
They walk-
59.
BRANDON sneaks a side glance, MARIANNE smiles. It's freezing.
They're breath and bodies steaming as they walk.
MARIANNE
Thank you.
BRANDON
Look, touch that.
BRANDON bows, pointing to the back of his head.
MARIANNE
Your head?
MARIANNE turns to touch BRANDON's head. As she does so, he
GROWLS at her, like a little dog.
BRANDON
GRRRRRR.
MARIANNE shrieks.
They BOTH laugh.
BRANDON (CONT'D)
(LAUGHS) Oh, no, no, no...
MARIANNE
(LAUGHS) You're such a.. Weirdo.
She pushes him playfully.
BRANDON
No, seriously, seriously. Touch it.
MARIANNE
OK.
There's a massive knot on the back of his head.
MARIANNE (CONT'D)
Oh, my God.
BRANDON
Do you feel that?
MARIANNE
Yeah, what is it?
BRANDON
It's a remnant.
MARIANNE
A remnant?
60.
BRANDON
Yeah, from the Neanderthals.
There's only a few of us left since
the homo sapiens took over.
MARIANNE (OVER)
OK. Hmm.. That would explain the
forehead.
BRANDON
What's that supposed to mean?
MARIANNE
`What's that supposed to mean?'
BRANDON
What do you mean?
MARIANNE
(CHUCKLES) No, seriously, how did
you get it?
BRANDON
(COUGHS) I used to play this game
with my cousin.
MARIANNE
Hm-hmm.
BRANDON
Where I would sit on his feet and
he'd fly me through the air. I hit
my head on the ceiling and I
blacked out.
They both laugh. Marianne laughs hysterically. BRANDON laughs
along.
BRANDON (CONT'D)
I was knocked out for 5-10 minutes.
I peed my pants.
MARIANNE
(Reacts Sympathetically) Oh.
BRANDON
If you had a choice to live in the
past or future and you could be
anything you wanted, what would you
be?
MARIANNE
What would you be?
BRANDON
I always wanted to be a musician in
the sixties.
61.
MARIANNE
That's cool A musician?
BRANDON
Yeah.
MARIANNE
Sixties is tough though. I saw
GIMME SHELTER recently, you know
the Rolling Stones documentary?
BRANDON
Yeah.
MARIANNE
It kind of seemed like hell.
BRANDON
What?
MARIANNE
(LAUGHS) Yeah, the sixties would be
the last place I'd want to be.
BRANDON
No way!
MARIANNE
Yes. Eugh, chaos!
BRANDON
So where would you wanna, and what
would you wanna be?
MARIANNE
Erm.. You know. Here, now.
BRANDON
That's boring
MARIANNE
Fuck you. (LAUGHS)
Still walking along, BRANDON thinks for a moment. BRANDON
turns and stares at MARIANNE, holding his gaze. MARIANNE
blushes. There's a silence as they walk on. They get to a
subway entrance.
MARIANNE (CONT'D)
OK. Well, this is me.
BRANDON nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet-
BRANDON
This is you.
They stand heady from the wine and a little awkward.
62.
MARIANNE
Thank you very much Brandon.
BRANDON
Thank you very much MARIANNE. We
should do this again.
SILENCE
They loiter on the edge of something more.
MARIANNE
Right.
SILENCE
BRANDON hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of
uncertainty. MARIANNE descends into the depths of the subway,
with a half wave.
BRANDON
So, is that a yes?
MARIANNE (O.S.)
Maybe, yeah.
69
77
BRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the
swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on
the sidewalk. A pile of black garbage bags already piled up
along the street in waiting for collection.
Further down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands, walks by
the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk.
A SIREN goes past-
The DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS.
BRANDON heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door
firmly.
78
79
BRANDON and MARIANNE stepping out of a cab, BRANDON leading
MARIANNE, both giggling and tripping.
MARIANNE
Where are you taking me? (LAUGHS)
BRANDON
Come on. You'll see
MARIANNE stops. She smiles, quizzically, allowing herself to
be guided and yet-
MARIANNE
No, where are we going? (LAUGHS)
BRANDON
Come on.
80
84
The trawl of cars-
The grey of the Hudson River-
BRANDON and the HOTEL LOVER just visible high above, caught
full frontal in the window-
85
90
BRANDON is rounding a corner, doing up his jacket. The
MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND runs out after him.
MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND
Hey, Romeo.
He spins BRANDON around and punches him.
The slip and slide of BRANDON's shoes, his face smashed
against the sidewalk. The MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND comes in hard
again, kicking him, sharp in the ribs. BRANDON recoils yet
almost seems to want more as he struggles to stand. He spits
on BRANDON.
91
91
BRANDON walking, aimless and bleeding-
The DRONE of taxi's streaking past-
79.
TWO WOMEN seated outside a bar, drinking and smoking, lost in
their laughing conversation oblivious-
BRANDON walks on-
A YOUNG MAN with a satchel roughly brushes past him-
The YOUNG MAN wavers on seeing BRANDON is crying, moving on-
BRANDON's face head down wanting to get away.
A rush of TEENAGERS and MIDDLE AGED COUPLES spilling out of a
cinema-
BRANDON walking, disorientated, jaywalking through the
traffic.
The SCREECH of horns-
BRANDON ignores them, he crosses streets, traffic, darting
off the sidewalk into the road, when human, dog or stroller
gets in his way until-
92
92
BRANDON walking past a blur of yellow Neon and glow of shop
signs-
Across the street, a snaking queue of MEN wait in line
outside a club.
He keeps walking, eyes scouring-
TEENAGERS loiter, in oversized clothes, sunk under caps and
hoods.
93
93
A lively bar; a couple of HOT GIRLS entering-
BRANDON considers, goes to enter, barred by BOUNCERS, who
point him back along the cue-
He stands in line-
Across the street, a THICK SET GUY eyes him. He stands
smoking outside a heaving bar. BRANDON looks away-
A GANG OF GIRLS pass, The BOUNCERS let them in with ease.
BRANDON reaches for his iPhone, tries to cover his face with
his phone to get into the club-
BOUNCER
Woah! Not tonight, buddy.
80.
BRANDON ties to get in again. The BOUNCER stops him a second
time.
BOUNCER (CONT'D)
I said not tonight.
The THICK SET GUY over the street, flicks out his cigarette,
eyes grazing over BRANDON as he re-enters the heaving bar
opposite.
BRANDON considers, hands sunk deep in his pockets.
Through the glass a heaving bar. BRANDON considers, on the
edge until-
He suddenly crosses the street, narrowly avoiding a taxi
streaking past.
94
97
The early hours-
BRANDON, heading away. He clocks his phone, several messages
from SISSY logged.
BRANDON listens to his voicemail-
SISSY ON ANSWER MACHINE
(from SISSY)
Brandon, it's Sissy.. I really need
to talk to you. Please.
BRANDON pockets his phone.
98
98
SISSY ON ANSWER MACHINE
Please will you pick up the fucking
phone?
BRANDON stops and knocks on an apartment door. A woman opens
and BRANDON steps in.
99
103
BRANDON climbs the stairs, filing out of the subway, eyes
catching on-
A WOMAN's shoes, like Sissy's earlier at the Boom Boom Room,
discarded. BRANDON picks up his pace.
The intermittent WHIR of sirens-
BRANDON emerging from the subway, already reaching for his
cellphone-
Beyond the glow of an ambulance-
BRANDON keeps walking, heading off up the road quietly
distracted. He taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his
ear.
The PULSE of a distant phone ringing-
The answer machine kicks in-
ANSWER MACHINE
This is Sissy..leave a message..
Don't if you're an asshole.
BRANDON flicks it off, slips it back in his pocket. BRANDON
picks up his pace.
He flicks out his phone again. Tries again-
ANSWER MACHINE (CONT'D)
This is Sissy..leave a me-
BRANDON is running now, heart beating fast now, breath
quickening, a seeping panic threatening to unleash-
BRANDON
Shit!
SUDDENLY he makes a dash for it, weaving through the sidewalk
at pace.
104
110
BRANDON now walking along the side of the river, railings
seemingly speeding up his journey.
Beyond, the shadowy black figures of a broken jetty stretch
out toward the open river.
111
111
The endless grey of the Hudson River, close now-
BRANDON walking along a concrete jetty-
A rusting building, oxidized and stained salt green, edging
along the jetty until-
BRANDON reaches the edge of the jetty, looking out-
The LAP of grey water beneath.
87.
BRANDON stands, a hangover kicking in-
And at once BRANDON is crying, the tears flowing slow at
first until they rush, like floodgates opening. He reaches
for breath, trying to stifle the howls emanating from his
body, inconsolable now, flooded with emotion-
BRANDON sinks squat to the ground, buckled in two, body
shuddering.
The LAP of the water steady now-
BRANDON sobs and sobs and sobs, a mess of snot and tears as
he looks out over the wide sweep of the Hudson River.
Far off the drone of the freeway, the early evening trawl of
traffic kicking in-
The froth of the tide back and forth, rising and breaking,
back and forth.
112
