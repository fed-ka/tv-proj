11EXT. SHAN SHEN ALLEY - DAY 1

      FX SHOT DMP: the Chino-planet Shan Shen, a horizon of
      PAGODAS & KITES, hazy against a WHITE SKY.  Craning down...

      CAMERA coming down long, fluttering vertical banners; red,
      emblazoned with Chinese-style writing.  Craning down...

      To the ALLEYWAY, in which there's a tatty STREET MARKET. 
      Wooden stalls, crates, barrels, cages of CHICKENS. 
        STALLHOLDERS & PASSERS-BY, mostly Chinese, in peasant's
      clothes.  Red banners flanking the alley.  Finding...

      THE DOCTOR & DONNA, just wandering, enjoying themselves. 
      At the far end of the alley, way behind them: the TARDIS.

      SERIES OF JUMP CUTS, seen from a distance, observing them,
      dialogue not audible: the Doctor & Donna chatting with a
        STALLHOLDER, who's gesticulating wildly.  They're falling
      about with laughter.

      JUMP CUT TO the Doctor & Donna trying some foamy drink
      from a wooden bowl.  Ooh, it's delicious.

      JUMP CUT TO the Doctor & Donna moving away from some crates,
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
      fast - something stinks!  Cor!  They're hooting!

      JUMP CUT TO Donna, on her own, wandering.  She looks back:
        www.thewriterstale.com

      The Doctor's way back, fascinated by a stallholder's sea
  
      urchins.  Donna just smiles, walks on, leaving him to it.

      She passes a rough DOORWAY.  A WOMAN is sitting outside,
      on a stool.  She's 30's, shrouded in Chinese/Romany robes. 
      Clever eyes.  This is the FORTUNE TELLER.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    Tell your fortune, lady?  The future
                      predicted.  Your life foretold.

                                      DONNA
                    No thanks.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    Don't you want to know?  If you're
                    going to be happy?

                                      DONNA
                    I'm happy right now, thanks.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    You've got red hair.  The reading's

                                      DONNA
                    ...all right then.

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 11 - Shooting Script - 20/11/07 - Page 2.



22INT. FORTUNE TELLER'S ROOM - DAY 1

      Dark room, shrouded with drapes; incense in the air; the
      walls are just broken concrete, like this downtown society
      has built itself into abandoned warehouses & tenements.

      But this just b/g: TIGHT on the FORTUNE TELLER, grasping
      DONNA's hand in hers.  Breathes in deep.  Staring at Donna.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    Ohhh you're fascinating.  No, but
                    you're good.  I can see... a man. 
                    The most remarkable man.  How did
                    you meet him?

                                      DONNA
                    You're supposed to tell me.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    I see the future.  Tell me the
                    past.  When did your lives cross?

                                      DONNA
                    It's kind of complicated.  I ended
                    up in his spaceship on my wedding
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
                    day.  Long story.

      CUT TO LOW ANGLE, behind Donna, some distance away; a drape
        www.thewriterstale.com
      is parted, and this is the POV of something on floor-level. 
      Looking at Donna.  A noise, a quiet hissss-tic-tic-tic.
  
                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    But what led you to that meeting?

                                      DONNA
                    Well.  All sorts of things, but...
                    My job, I suppose.  It was on Earth,
                    this planet called Earth.  Miles
                    away.  But I had this job, as a
                    temp, I was a secretary, in a place
                    called H.C. Clements -

      FLASHBACK - sudden white frames, whoosh!  - then snatched
      images from 3.X, Donna at her desk, the H.C. CLEMENTS sign -

      CUT BACK TO Donna.  But it's not just a flashback, she felt
      those images.  Like a little punch.  Blinks.

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    Woah.  Sorry...

                    It's the incense.  Betters the
                    memory.  Just breathe deep.

      The LOW POV scuttles halfway towards Donna, hisss-tic-tic...

                    never met this man?  If your life
                    had taken a different path?

                    Yeah.  I got lucky.

                                      FORTUNE TELLER
                    But was there ever a choice?  This
                    job of yours.  What choices led
                    you there?

      On CU Donna, she flinches -

      Whoosh! FLASHBACK, but to a new scene, the next scene,
      sc.3, glimpsed images, the car, her mum -

      CUT BACK TO DONNA; transfixed by the Fortune Teller's stare.

                                      DONNA
                    There was a choice.  Six months
                    before.  Cos the agency offered me

                    Your life could have gone one way,

      run away, in b/g, MOOKY & MATES legging it, panic.  But on
      DONNA.  Tracking into CU, as she watches the far horizon. 
      As though remembering something that never happened...

      She blinks.  Shakes it off.  Looks round.  With people
      running all around...  ALICE is staring at her. 

                                      DONNA

      And Alice is terrified.  Of Donna.  Alice turns, runs away.

      Donna looks back towards the direction of the Webstar. 
      Deep breath, then she runs towards it.  Veena calling out:

                                      VEENA

      way off in b/g, above the buildings, raining down fire.

      (NB, this street & set-up can double for sc.126 in Ep. 
        www.thewriterstale.com
      4.1.)

  
      The street's sealed off, CROWD at the barriers, AMBULANCES,
      POLICE CARS, ARMY JEEPS.  Donna running up...

      She's behind some people.  Tries to see.  For some reason
      she doesn't understand, that instinct, she's got to see.

      She thinks.  Moves round to the side...

      Like a spy, she goes round the back of a JEEP, no crowd,
      slips through a gap in the barriers, creeps forward...

      Then stops.  Hidden in shadow.  Just watching.

      There's a SECOND AMBULANCE.  UNIT SOLDIERS around it, all
      quiet, standing still, as though bereaved.  One soldier
      with his back to Donna, on radio, and during this,
      PARAMEDICS carry a covered body on a stretcher.

                                      SOLDIER
                    ...from the evidence, I'd say he
                    managed to stop the creature. 
                    Some sort of red spider.  He blew
                    up the base underneath the Barrier,
                    flooded the whole thing, over.

                                      RADIO VOICE
                    And where is he now?  Over.

                                      RADIO VOICE
                    Is it him?

                                      SOLDIER
                    I think so.  He didn't get out in
                    time.  Sorry to report, sir.  But
                    the Doctor is dead.  Over.

      On the stretcher.  An arm slips out.  An arm in a brown
      suit.  Something falls from its grip.

      The SONIC SCREWDRIVER clatters to the floor.

      Donna just stares.  It means nothing to her.  And yet...

      She feels like she's intruding.  Turns away.  Walks back.

      CUT TO Donna, now a distance away from the barriers &
      people, walking away.  Lost in thought.

      REVERSE, Donna's back to CAMERA as she walks; shot on a
      LONG LENS, so her background - and this is a long street -
          DW4 - Ep 11 - Green
      is just a blur, far-off PEOPLE still running to and fro... 

      And one blur is running towards her.

      Coming into focus slowly. 
  
      A WOMAN.  Running.

      A blonde woman.

      Close and closer

      Focus resolving... 

      Into... 

      ROSE TYLER. 

      And she's desperate.  Rose stops Donna, breathless -

                                    ROSE
                    What happened, what did they find? 
                    I'm sorry, but...  Did they find
                    someone?

                    I don't know.  Bloke called the
                    Doctor or something.

                    Where is he?

      And Rose is so upset.  Though controlling it.

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.  Did you know him?  I mean,
                    they didn't say his name, it could
                    be any Doctor.

                                    ROSE
                    ...I came so far.

                    Could be anyone.

      Now, Rose looks at her properly.  Studies her.

                                    ROSE
                    What's your name?

      Said, trying to look left and right, though she can't see
      properly, can't reach.  A quiet hisss-tic-tic-tic...

      And when she looks up -

      Rose Tyler has gone.

      WIDE SHOT, no one near Donna.

      She's a bit freaked out.  Walks away, down the dark street.

                    ...it sounds impossible, but the
                    entire hospital has disappeared. 
                    The Royal Hope no longer exists. 
                    It's not been destroyed, there's
                    no wreckage, it's simply gone. 
                    Reports from bystanders say that
                    the rain lifted up around the
                    hospital, that the rain actually
                    went up, into the air.  This was
                    followed by a flash of lightning. 
                    And when it cleared... the Hospital
                    was gone.  Literally, lifted out
                    of its foundations.  To repeat: no
                    wreckage, no rubble, no debris. 
                    Simply, gone.  And we're being
                    told that CCTV footage from
                      surrounding buildings has confirmed
                    this.  An entire hospital has
                    vanished into thin air.

                    All right, Donna, have some respect. 
                    There's two thousand people in
                    that hospital.  And it's vanished!

      Picking up her box, striding to the door -

      Street near some shops, where the chippy would be.  DONNA
      walking along.  A lonely figure.  It's strangely deserted.

      DONNA notices...

      In the distance, in the direction she's heading, an
      ALLEYWAY.  And it's flashing with PRAC WHITE LIGHT. 
      Blinking, with a sizzling sound.  Getting stronger.

      Donna closer, curious, and when she's a few feet away -

      A BANG!! of LIGHT - a WOMAN comes belting out, like she's
      been shot from a cannon, runs to a halt, in the road...

      It's ROSE TYLER.  In the same clothes as sc.13.

                    Nice hotel.  Christmas holiday.

                                      DONNA
                    Can't afford it.

                    You've got that raffle ticket.

                    First prize.  Luxury weekend break. 
                    Use it, Donna Noble.

      Silence.  Donna so disturbed by this woman.  Quiet, cold:

                                      DONNA
                    Why won't you tell me your name?

      Silence.  Hold.  Then:

                    I think you should leave me alone.

      Donna turns.  Walks on.  Upset.

      Behind her, FOCUS turns Rose into a blur.  The blur walks
      back into the alley.  Which blinks with PRAC WHITE LIGHT
      again, fizz, pop! but Donna just keeps walking.

      Nice smile, and they head in, Donna's arm round her mum.

                    be breakfast!  We've got croissants!

      He looks round.  SYLVIA's sitting up in bed, in silky M&S
      nightie, remote in hand, flicking through channels.  (Other
      side of the bed all ruffled; that's where Donna slept.) 

      DONNA's in the bathroom, door propped open, just finishing
      her make-up, dressed all Christmas-Day-smart.

                                    WILF
                          (to Sylvia)

                    It's Christmas Day, I never get up
                    before ten.  Only madam there was
                    up with the dawn chorus.  Like
                    when she was six years old!

                    I'm not wasting one second in this

      Knock-knock at the door again, as Wilf goes to answer.

                                    WILF
                    Hold on!  I'm there!

      CUT TO DONNA, in the bathroom.

                    Cos I thought, nice early breakfast,
                    then we'll go for a walk.  People
                    always say that at Christmas, 'Oh,
                    we all went for a walk', I've always
                    wanted to do that.  Very refined. 
                    Walk first, presents later, yeah?

      She looks into the room -

      Her POV; Sylvia in bed, staring at the TV.  But closer,
      the Spanish maid.  She's staring at Donna.  Scared. 
      Furious.  Like something is blasphemous.  All fast:

      And Donna looks round -

      IN THE MIRROR - hisss-tic-tic-tic!  - a GLIMPSE of SOMETHING
      ON HER BACK!! - something black -

      - she spin round, a second mirror behind her -

      They're all looking to the horizon.

      FX; REVERSE.  Far in the distance, rising up in a red sky,
      a MUSHROOM CLOUD, where London once was.

      Far away, the SPANISH MAID is staring at her.  Pointing at

                    It's all the cars, every single
                    ATMOS car!  They've gone mad...
                          (suddenly)
                    Turn around!

      And he's pointing his gun at Donna!  All at once, wild:

                    SOLDIER #2 (CONT'D)MR COLASANTO
          I said, turn around!You gone crazy, boy?

                      WILFSYLVIA

                    SOLDIER #2MR COLASANTO

        Show me your back!! She's done nothing!
  
      But Donna, scared, hands in the air, turns, shows her back.

      Nothing there.

      Soldier #2 disturbed, shaken, lowers his gun.

                                      SOLDIER #2
                    I'm sorry...  I thought I saw...

                                    WILF
                    Call yourself a soldier?!  Pulling
                    guns on innocent women!  It's a
                    disgrace!  In my day, we'd have
                    you court martialled for that!

      But Wilf b/g: on Donna.  She looks at the end of the road.

      Far off, where the road turns, around the corner... the
      walls bouncing, the FIZZ, POP! of flashing PRAC WHITE LIGHT.

      And very calm, Donna walks towards it.  Ignoring:

                                      SYLVIA
                    Donna, where are you going?  It's

      DONNA walks round the corner.  Expecting to see...

      ROSE.  Standing centre of the road. 

                                      DONNA
                    Hello.

      Cold and bleak.  DONNA & ROSE on a bench.  Very far away,
      DRIFTS OF SMOKE.  Sirens from the city.  Both quiet:

                                    ROSE
                    It's the ATMOS devices.  You're
                    lucky, it's not so bad here, Britain
                    hasn't got much petrol.  But all
                    over Europe.  China.  South Africa.

                    They're trying.  Right now.  This
                    little band of fighters, on board
                    the Sontaran ship.  Any second now -

                    None of this was meant to happen. 
                    There was a man.  This wonderful
                    man.  And he stopped them.  The

                    he stopped them all from happening.

        www.thewriterstale.com
                    Man in a suit.  Tall, thin man.
                          (smiles)
  
                    Great hair.  He had this really
                    great hair.

      Donna disturbed.  Rose is right; she's dreamt of this.

                                      DONNA
                    ...who are you?

                                    ROSE
                    I was like you.  I used to be you. 
                    Cos you travelled with him, Donna,
                    you travelled with the Doctor.  In
                      a different world.

                                      DONNA
                    But I never met him.  And he's
                    dead.

                                    ROSE
                    He died underneath the Thames on
                    Christmas Eve.  But you were meant
                    to be there.  He needed someone to
                    stop him, and that was you.  You
                    made him leave, you saved his life -

      During that, on CU Donna -

      Whoosh, she's hit by FLASHBACKS, feels them, fierce images
      from 3.X, the water, the fire.  'You can stop now' -

                    Stop it!  I don't know what you're
                    talking about, leave me alone -

      She's turning to go, Rose stands, calls after her, strong:

                    Something is coming, Donna. 
                    Something worse.

      Donna stops.  Looks back.  Reluctant, but...

                                      DONNA
                    The whole world is stinking.  How

      But the truck starts off.  The Colasantos staring at Donna.

      She runs after them, but it's useless, the truck drives
      away, she's left standing in the middle of the empty street -

      SYLVIA sitting alone.  She looks smaller.  Defeated.  Just
      staring into space.

      DONNA in the doorway.

                    I asked about jobs.  With the army. 
                    They said I wasn't qualified.

      Silence.

                    You were right.  You said I should
                    work harder at school.

      Steps back out.  Looks either side of the box's walls,

                    Doctor to show you that.  Simply
                    by being with him.  He did the
                    same to me, to everyone he touches.

                    Were you and him..?

      Rose doesn't answer, just smiles, sadly.  Walks over to
      Donna.  Reaches for her back -

      Donna tenses, scared again.  Rose so gentle.  She just
      smooths one hand across Donna's back.

                                    ROSE
                    D'you want to see it?

4848INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT M

      The CIRCLE OF MIRRORS: rectangular free-standing mirrors,
      with wires leading to machinery.  Rose leading DONNA to
      the centre, CAPTAIN MAGAMBO standing at the edge.

                                    ROSE
                    Just stand there.

                    Can't you stay with me?

      But Rose goes to the edge.  Everyone in the room watching.

                                      CAPTAIN MAGAMBO
                    Ready?  And, activate.

      Simple PRAC LIGHTS blink on, in the spaces between the

                                    ROSE OOV
                    It's part of you, Donna.  Look.

      And Donna...

      Opens... her eyes...

      - oh God!, there it is! - she's in shock, she spins round -
      CUT, CUT, CUT, in the mirrors, cos there it is - 

      - the THING - !

      - it's only glimpsed at first, cutting between Donna's
      terror - one mirror, then another, then another -

                    I'm still here.  It's okay.

      Donna breathing hard.  Controls her panic.
  
      Looks properly...

      At the HUGE BLACK BEETLE clinging to her back.  Shiny
      carapace, spindly black legs moving and flexing, mandibles
      clacking together, hiss-tic-tic-tic...

      Keeping control.  Wanting to scream.  Quiet:

                    time, by making someone's life
                    take a different turn.  The meetings
                    never made.  The children never
                    born.  A life never loved.  But

                    Yes you did.  Cos one day, that
                    thing made you turn right, instead
                    of left.

                                      DONNA

                    You wouldn't remember.  It was the
                    most ordinary day in the world. 
                    But turning right meant you never
                    met the Doctor.  And the whole
                    world changed around you.

                                      DONNA

                    Can't even touch it.  Seems to be
                    in a state of flux.

                                      DONNA

                    No, there's more than that...  The
                    readings are strange.  It's like
                    reality is bending around you.

                                      DONNA

                    No, we're getting separate readings. 
                    From you.  And they've always been

                                    ROSE
                    The Tardis has pinpointed the moment
                    of intervention - Monday the 25th,
                    one minute past ten in the morning,
                    your car was on Little Sutton
                    Street, leading on to Ealing Road,
                    but you turned right, heading for
                    Griffin's Parade, you need to turn
                    left, that's the most important
                    thing, you've got to go back and
                    make sure the car turns left, Donna,
                    have you got that?  One minute
                    past ten, you've got to make
                    yourself turn left, heading for
                    Chiswick High Road -

      DURING THIS, a SERIES OF JUMP CUTS, intercut & overlapping

      The moment has come.  DONNA walking across the empty space,
      flanked by TWO SOLDIERS, followed by ROSE & CAPTAIN MAGAMBO.

      Military.  Tense.  Scary.

      All the SCIENTISTS at their machines, poised, staring.

                    No, the mirrors are just incidental. 
                    But they bounce Chronon Energy
                    back into the centre.  Which we
                    control, and decide the destination.

      Donna walks centre.  Bravery faltering a little.  Rose at

                    Least I'm not gonna die.  Cos I
                      understand it now!  You said I was
                    gonna die, but you mean this whole
                    world, it's gonna blink out of
                    existence - but that's not dying,
                    cos a better world takes its place.

      DONNA is on her hands and knees.  Heaving for breath.  In
      a ordinary shopping street.  Back in the old days.

      She looks round, staggered -

      - oh God, the PEOPLE, the CARS, the NOISE, a BOOMBOX playing -
      KIDS on bikes - SHOPS -

      The ordinary world.  As it was.  So bright and loud and
      colourful and wonderful, it's like sensory overload.

      Donna dazed.  Stands.  Then, a second's joy!  Exhilaration! 

      But then...

      A street that's visibly similar to the T-JUNCTION, in the
      same area.  But still so far away.

      CU DONNA.  Running.  But desperate. 

      It's too far.  She knows it's too far.

      Out of breath, shattered, looks at her watch -

      09.59.

      Christ!  And she runs - !

      INTERCUT WITH SC.5.  HIGH SHOT, the T-JUNCTION ahead.  The
      car pulling into place...  The LORRY thundering past it...

      Donna running, running, running -

      SC.5, Donna & Sylvia, sitting there, arguing.  The whole
      world turning around these women.

      Donna running -

      ...but she runs to a halt.  Wretched.  Crying.  She can't.

      Exhausted.  She looks ahead, down the road, the T-junction
      not even in sight.

      But then she sees...

      And she realises...

      The LORRY heading towards her.  100 yards away.

      Donna's very still now.  Somehow calm. 

      CUT TO FLASHBACK, SC.36, CU Rose, 'You're going to die.'

      And Donna's so sad, knowing what she must do.

      The lorry is thundering closer.

      And Donna doesn't think of herself.  Thinks only of the
      world.  Says one word, quietly:

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)

      Pause.  And Donna's mother defeats her.

                                      DONNA
                    Yeah.  Suppose you're right.

      Still conscious.  She can hear cars, beeping...

      The lorry driver looks round.  Waves to traffic, stop.

      A car pulling up behind the lorry.  He can't see what's
      happened, MAN leaning out of his window, 'Oy!  Shift!' 

      Another car behind him, pulling up...

      She spins round the other way to see -

      The FORTUNE TELLER is on the floor, curled into the corner,
      terrified: like she experienced all this, the whole
      different world, felt it, way beyond anything she'd planned -

      And she's terrified.  Of Donna.

                    What did she look like?

                                      DONNA
                    ...she was blonde.

      And the Doctor is full of dread; Donna looking to the
      distance, trying to remember...

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    What was her name?

                                      DONNA
                    I don't know.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Donna, what was her name?

                    She never said.  But she told me. 
                    To warn you.  She said... two words.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    What two words?  What were they? 
                    What did she say?

                                      DONNA
                    ....bad wolf.

      On the Doctor.  Staring.  Breathing hard.  Like the world
      is falling apart around him.

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    What does it mean..?

      And the Doctor's seething, burning, boiling - runs out -

                                                                            CUT TO:

      DONNA runs out -
  
                                      DONNA
                    Doctor, what is it - ?

      And she stops.  Looks up.  In horror.

      The VERTICAL BANNERS are still fluttering, flanking the
      length of Shan Shen Alley.  And every single one of them
      now says, in black Chinese lettering, against red -

      BAD WOLF.

      The Doctor, Donna, look round -

      Scrawled on the walls: BAD WOLF.

      - and the Doctor is running, like a mad thing, down the
      alley, towards the Tardis - Donna desperate, following -

      And as they run towards the Tardis...

      They see...

      The POLICE BOX sign above the door has changed.  The
      lettering now says BAD WOLF!

      The Doctor slams inside -

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 11 - Shooting Script - 20/11/07 - Page 55.



6161INT. TARDIS - DAY 1

      THE DOCTOR bursts in, then DONNA -

      They stop by the door, Donna slamming it shut behind them -

      The interior is lit by RED LIGHTS, rising and falling, and
      the awful warning of the CLOISTER BELL is tolling.

      Both terrified:

                                      DONNA
                    What is it, Doctor?  What's bad
                    wolf??

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It's the end of the universe.
