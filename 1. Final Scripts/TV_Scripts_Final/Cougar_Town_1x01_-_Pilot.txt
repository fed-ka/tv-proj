      CLOSE ON a picture of JULIA  JULES  COBB IN HER TWENTIES, 
      stunning in a bikini.  Jules has no filter, and if she 
      weren t so aggressively friendly, you d say she was pushy, 
      sarcastic -- even relentless.  CUT WIDE TO REVEAL JULES AT 
      40, NAKED (post shower), comparing the old picture to her 
      current self in the mirror.  She pokes at her body, tugs at 
      her arm skin, pulls her belly tight so there s no wrinkles, 
      etc.  Then, re: her reflection, pissed:

                                  JULES
                    Fuck!  

      SHE DIMS THE BRIGHT LIGHTS, THEN TAKES ANOTHER LOOK:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Much better.

      As she checks out her butt and shrugs, pleased:

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAME - NIGHT

      SEAHAVEN is a small town on Florida s Gulf Coast where 
      everyone turns out for high school football games.  The crowd 
      is full of a specific type of woman: 40s, dressed young for 
      her age: too much skin, too much Botox, just too much.  ANGLE 
      ON a banner that reads  Welcome to Cougar Town!   The 
      Seahaven Cougar football team bursts through the sign, 
      TRAMPLING the Cougar mascot.  As the team bounces around the 
      field, we hear Jules  dialogue as narrative V.O.:

                                  JULES (O.C.)
                    You know how they say fifty percent 
                    of marriages end in divorce...

      JULES (dressed appropriately cute) sits with her son TAD (17) 
      and friend/assistant LAURIE KEENAN (28).  Tad is quietly 
      handsome, sarcastic and his relationship with Jules 
      VACILLATES BETWEEN FRIEND AND PARENT.  Laurie is a happy-go-
      lucky townie, but she can stand up for herself.  Jules sees 
      her potential and treats her like a little sister/protege. 

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    ... Around here it seems like 
                    ninety percent.  And I know I m one 
                    of them, but I don t feel like one 
                    of them, you know?

                                  LAURIE
                    Will you look at all these old ass 
                    bitties trolling for action.

      Jules SEES A VERY BIG CHESTED WOMAN.                                                                                      2.


                                  JULES 
                    Aw, Tad, your math teacher, Ms. 
                      Pritchett, got new boobs.  Have the 
                    kids noticed her new boobs?

                                  TAD
                    We have, Mom.

                                  LAURIE
                    Jules, you re old.  You had any 
                    plastic surgery?

                                  JULES
                    I got Botox once, but I didn t like 
                    it.

                                  TAD
                    You looked like Mickey Rourke.  
                    Never again, right?

                                  JULES
                    Sweetie, when a woman says  I got 
                    Botox once but I didn t like it  it 
                    just means that from now on she 
                    only gets a little so she can still 
                    smile and frown.  See?  Happy.
                          (smiles, then frowning)
                    Mad.  Grrr.  Plus, if my waddle 
                    thingy here gets any bigger --
                          (re: skin under her chin)
                    I ll disappear for two weeks on a 
                       vacation  and when I get back I 
                    might talk a little differently but 
                    it will be gone -- Laurie, stop 
                    staring at Ms. Pritchett you ll 
                    make her self-conscious.  She s 
                    obviously not used to them yet.

      Ms. Pritchett is awkwardly trying to flaunt her breasts.

                                  LAURIE
                    I can t help it.  They look like 
                    gorilla heads.

                                  TAD
                    Check it.  Ryan promised me he d do 
                    something during warm-ups.

      RYAN, the quarterback, rifles a pass into the head of the 
      Cougar mascot, who drops.  Tad and Laurie ad-lib cheers (Yes!  
      Outstanding!)  As Ryan points up to them:

                                  JULES
                    He s a good friend.  

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                      3.


      EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTER THE GAME

      Laurie reads a text as Jules watches Tad talk to friends.

                                  LAURIE
                    Your new realty signs are ready.  
                    I ll put them out in the morning.

                                  JULES
                    Tad s a great kid, isn t he?

                                  LAURIE
                    Yeah.  Can I take his virginity?

                                  JULES
                    Again, no.

                                  LAURIE
                    Come on, I want it.

                                  JULES
                    I m hoping my son s first time is a 
                    little more romantic and a little 
                    less reverse cowgirl.  Besides, we 
                    don t even know for sure that he s 
                    still a virgin.
                          (they both laugh, then)
                    Be nice.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. JULES  DEN - NIGHT

      Jules dials the phone.  When it s answered she holds the 
      receiver out as she pours a glass of wine.  Then, into phone:

                                  JULES
                    Elle, that s your wine being 
                    poured.  Get over here.

      INT. ELLE S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      ELLE KELLER, 42 and attractive, is on her phone.  An upper-
      east side type, Elle is mean, scary, and fiercely loyal to 
      Jules.  She s wearing a CLEAVAGE REVEALING NIGHTGOWN.

                                  ELLE 
                    I can t, I promised my husband that 
                    we d start having sex once a month 
                    without it having to be a quickie 
                    and the fucker actually called me 
                    on it.  Andy s in the shower 
                    shaving his beard because if he 
                    doesn t, forty minutes from now my 
                    inner thighs will look like someone 
                    took a disk sander to them.                                                                                      4.


                                  JULES
                    Graphic.  Why so pissy?

                                  ELLE
                    I m fat.

                                  JULES
                    You re not.

                                  ELLE
                    I am.  I woke up fat.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, I m not buying it. 

      Jules goes to her window and pulls up the shade REVEALING 
      ELLE IN THE HER WINDOW TEN YARDS AWAY (they re neighbors).

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Wow, you look slutty. 

                                  ELLE
                          (touched)
                    Really?

                                  JULES
                    Total riverboat whore.

                                  ELLE
                    Love you.  I thought you had a date 
                    tonight with Larry the lawyer.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, I had to cancel it. 

                                  ELLE
                    Why?

                                  JULES
                    Because he s ugly and sixty.  
                    Fucking Florida.

                                  ELLE
                    Hey, if you re bored and want to 
                    hate yourself, do what I did and 
                    try on all your old lingerie.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, I only model lingerie by 
                    myself on Saturday nights.  On 
                    Friday nights I look up old high 
                    school boyfriends on the internet.

                                  ANDY (O.C.)
                    Let s do this, woman.                                                                                      5.


                                  ELLE
                    Ugh, I have to go.

      Elle hangs up.  ANDY KELLER is 40, sweet, not as hot as Elle 
      and is unaffected by her edge.  Though she d never admit it, 
      she LOVES HIM DEEPLY.  Currently Andy s thumb is fairly deep 
      INSIDE HIS NOSTRIL, PICKING.  HE DOESN T STOP:

                                  ANDY
                    I have a little scab up there.

                                  ELLE
                    You are so sexy.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. JULES  DEN - LATER

      Jules (in sweats) looks through her old lingerie.  She grabs 
      the two glasses of wine (hers and Elle s) as Tad comes down.

                                  JULES 
                    If you don t have plans tonight we 
                    could hang out on the couch and 
                    watch a movie.

                                  TAD
                          (re: two wines)
                    Are you hitting on me?

                                  JULES
                    Huh?  Oh, no, this wine is for 
                    Elle.  That s why I have my 
                    lingerie out.  She s coming over 
                    later and we re going to experiment 
                    a little.  
                          (off Tad s stare)
                    Okay, that was supposed to be a 
                    joke but you seem really 
                      uncomfortable.  

      THIS IS HOW SHE TALKS TO HIM SOMETIMES.  IT MAKES HIM CRAZY.

                                  TAD
                    Ryan s picking me up.  Where s my 
                    jacket?

      Tad EXITS, looking.  Jules picks up a RED BRA/PANTIE combo: 

                                  JULES
                    I wonder if I could still pull this 
                    off?  Honestly, the whole ensemble 
                    creeps me out.  But that might be 
                    because it was a Christmas gift 
                    from your shithead Dad s shithead 
                    brother.  Lovely family.                                                                                      6.


                                  TAD 
                          (returns wearing jacket)
                    Ryan s mom just says  good night .

                                  JULES
                    Love you.  And remember, home by 
                    twelve, and if I ever catch you or 
                    Ryan drinking and driving I ll show 
                    everyone that baby picture of you 
                    two holding each other s penises.

                                  TAD
                    Bye, Mom.

      And he s gone.  Bored, Jules looks at the phone.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

      The room is black, the phone rings and an OLDER, ODD-LOOKING 
      MAN (60ish), wakes, turns on the light and answers the phone.

                                  LARRY
                    This is Larry.

      INT. JULES  DEN - CONTINUOUS

      Jules talks to Larry the lawyer.  From now on we INTERCUT:

                                  JULES
                    It s eight-thirty on a Friday 
                    night, why are you already asleep?  
                    I guess I m no better, I m just 
                    sitting in my den, all by myself... 
                          (beat, then, tersely)
                    Larry!

      REVEAL Larry is asleep on the phone.  Startled, he wakes.

                                  LARRY
                    This is Larry.

      Jules hangs up and sits back on the couch.  She sighs, and 
      looks around, lonely.  Fed up, she grabs her keys and exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT

      Jules is in line at the counter holding various junk treats 
      and magazines.  She looks down the aisle and sees an 
      incredibly HANDSOME YOUNG MAN (20s) DRINKING FROM A MILK 
      CARTON.  Lost in his looks, Jules reacts.  TIGHTER ON THE 
      YOUNG MAN S FACE as rivulets of milk run down his cheek and 
      neck.  Flushed, Jules turns back to the counter.                                                                                        7.


      The young man, NOW SHIRTLESS, ENTERS THE FRAME BEHIND HER AND 
      KISSES HER NECK.  Jules moans:

                                  JULES
                    Holy crap.

      Jules is snapped out of her fantasy by the cashier, who waits 
      to ring her up.  He knows she s ogling the handsome guy.

                                    CASHIER
                    Ma'am, whenever you re done.

                                  JULES
                          (flustered)
                    Sorry.  He is a cutie.

      The MARRIED COUPLE in line behind Jules shake their heads 
      judgmentally.  Mortified, Jules addresses them calmly:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Please don t shake your heads at 
                    me.  It makes me want to cry.
                          (they stop)
                    Thank you.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. STREET - NEXT MORNING

      Jules (in robe) grabs her paper.  Across the street, GRAYSON 
      ELLIS (40s, handsome, closed off, and calmly emotionless) 
      ushers a pretty young CLUB GIRL (23) into a cab.

                                  GIRL
                    I d hook up with you again just for 
                    the jacuzzi tub.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I ll file that under  classy .

                                  GIRL
                    Call me later, my number is 349--

      He CLOSES the DOOR on her mid-sentence.  The cab leaves as 
      Jules approaches, playfully smiling; she loves torturing him.

                                  JULES
                    Aw, Grayson, that was so sweet.  I 
                    think she might be the one.  What?

                                    GRAYSON 
                    Nothing.  This is how I always look 
                    at annoying people. 
                          (gives same look)
                    This, on the other hand, is the 
                    look I give to neighbors when I 
                    don t give a shit what they think.                                                                                      8.


                                  JULES
                    They re very similar looks.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (walks off)
                    Have a grand morning.

                                  JULES
                          (follows him)
                    You know what drives me nuts?

                                    GRAYSON
                    Great, let s talk more.

                                  JULES
                    How come when a 40 year-old guy 
                    gets divorced and starts violating 
                    sorority girls everyone s like, 
                     Way to go , but you see a 
                      divorced... mature woman with some 
                    hot young thing and it s more 
                      disturbing than the Holocaust?  And 
                    you re not the least bit self-
                    conscious about the age difference.  
                    I mean, don t you get insecure 
                    about your grey hair, your pot 
                    belly, your skin tags-- 

                                    GRAYSON
                    What s a skin tag?

                                  JULES
                    You know, those gross, little, mole 
                    thingies older people get.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I don t have those, but I m sorry 
                    you do.

                                  JULES
                    I don t have skin tags.

                                    GRAYSON
                    For someone that doesn t have them 
                    you seem to know a lot about them. 

                                  JULES
                    Fine, I have a big one in my 
                    armpit.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I may vomit.  Can I ask you 
                    something personal?

                                  JULES
                    Don t be mean, I can t handle mean.                                                                                      9.


                                    GRAYSON
                    When was the last time you had sex?

                                  JULES
                    I almost got together with my son 
                    last night.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Maybe you just covet what you 
                    pretend to despise.  Maybe what 
                    really  drives you nuts  is that 
                    you couldn t bag a  hot young 
                    thing  if you tried.

                                  JULES
                          (beat, then points at him)
                    Mean.  You don t think I could--  
                    No.  No.  Don t give him the 
                      satisfaction... 
                          (she steps off, then steps 
                            back)
                    The hell with it.  Hey kid!

      As a BOY (15) ON A BIKE looks over, Jules opens her robe 
      flashing him, revealing the RED BRA/PANTIES from last night.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Pow!

      The boy BIKES INTO A PARKED CAR.  Jules turns to Grayson:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Yes!  Suck it!

                                    GRAYSON
                          (looking off)
                    I think he broke his face

                                  JULES
                          (realizing)
                    Right.  Go get some ice.

      As Jules rushes over to help:


                                      END OF COLD OPEN                                                                                    10.

      EXT. SEAHAVEN HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

      STUDENTS GAWK and react as Jules drops Tad off at school.  

                                  JULES
                    I m guessing the kid I flashed goes 
                    to your school.

                                  TAD
                    He does. 

                                  JULES
                    Would it help if I explain to him 
                    what I was going through 
                      emotionally?

      Tad exits the car.  RYAN (17, black, studly quarterback but a 
      good guy) walks up.  As Jules drives off, out window: 

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Tell him I love him, Ryan.

                                  RYAN
                    She loves you.

      The class prick, BJ, approaches.  Tad turns to Ryan:

                                  TAD
                    Great, here we go.

                                  BJ
                    Hey Cobb, I heard your mom s got a 
                    porn star body.

                                  TAD
                          (sincere)
                    Thanks, BJ.  That s really nice of 
                    you to say.  I ll let her know. 
                          (to Ryan as they walk off)
                    Does he look confused?

                                  RYAN
                    Mm-hmm.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. COBB REALTY OFFICE - DAY

      It s a modest office.  Laurie sits at her desk as Jules talks 
      on the phone and gathers her things.  WE INTERCUT:

                                  JULES
                    Honey, is this call about anything?  
                    I have to go sell a house.

                    That means your little, baby

                    out loud that you re better friends 
                    with me than with her.

                                  JULES
                    Why are you in your crazy place?

                                  ELLE

                    Fine.  And don t call Stan a thing.

      Jules hangs up and they head out the door.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Give a girl a warning.  My uterus 
                    almost shot out.

      EXT. YARD - CONTINUOUS

      Jules walks to a  Jules Cobb Realty  for-sale sign.  It s a 
      VERY SEXY PICTURE OF JULES; LOW-CUT TOP, SULTRY EXPRESSION.                                                                                     12.


                                  JULES
                    What did you do?!  That s not the 
                    photo I picked.  That s from the 
                    night we got drunk on Amaretto and 
                    played dress-up. 

                                  LAURIE
                    I don t care if you fire me.  This 
                    is marketing for Jules.  I m 
                    putting you back out there.  You ve 
                    been divorced for five months and 
                    you re not having any fun.

                                  JULES 
                          (beat, then)
                    I m not, am I?  

                                  LAURIE
                    No.

                                  JULES
                    I want to go out tonight, and I 
                    want to go somewhere where I can 
                    get a hot neck kiss from a handsome 
                    young man.  Preferably while he s 
                    drinking milk.

                                  LAURIE
                    We can do that.

                                  JULES
                    Good.  And I don t care what people 
                    think of me.

                                  LAURIE
                    Yeah, you do.

                                  JULES

                    everyone think they look desperate 
                    and inappropriate and just... sad?  

                                  LAURIE
                    Jules, you could never be like 
                    them.  Look how beautiful you are.  

                                  JULES
                          (looks at sign, smiles)
                    Thanks.                                                                                    13.


                                  LAURIE 
                    Friends look out.  It s like when 
                    you finally convinced me that Dale 
                    was a loser and I had to stop 
                    dating him.  What?

                                  JULES
                    You have a giant hickey, and I can 
                    tell it s Dale s because whoever 
                    did it has a tooth missing.

                                  LAURIE
                    Uncalled for.

      They drive off.  ANGLE ON SIGN.  A BOY (14) walks by, does a 
      double take, looks both ways and STEALS IT.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. EMPTY WATER FRONT HOUSE (FOR SALE) - MINUTES LATER

      BARBARA (50s), a conservative realtor, shows her clients (MAN 
      60, WOMAN 24) the home.  Jules speaks to the woman.

                                  JULES
                    Take as much time as you need.  The 
                    master bedroom is upstairs...
                          (under her breath)
                    If you want to see where your 
                    husband will eventually croak on 
                    top of you.

      Laurie laughs.  Barb approaches demurely. 

                                    BARBARA
                    Good morning, girls.  How is 
                      everything?

                                  LAURIE
                    Awesome, Barb.  I finally got Jules 
                    off her ass and tonight we re going 
                    to get us some--

                                  JULES
                    Excuse us.

      Jules pulls Laurie outside. 

      EXT. EMPTY WATER FRONT HOUSE (FOR SALE) - CONTINUOUS

      Jules steps in front of Laurie and walks backwards.

                                  JULES
                    I have to deal with Barb 
                      professionally, my personal life is 
                    none of her--                                                                                    14.


      Right then, Jules TOPPLES OVER backwards.

                                  LAURIE
                    You know you re not coordinated 
                    enough to walk backwards in heels.

      REVEAL Jules facedown in a bush.

                                  JULES
                    I will kill you.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. JULES  HOUSE - MORNING

      Jules pulls up to see an old convertible, golf clubs in the 
      back.  Her ex, BOBBY COBB (42), a loser yet somehow  
      disarmingly charming, sits out front.  

                                  JULES
                    What do you want, Bobby?

                                  BOBBY
                    I was hoping I could get a little 
                    advance on my next alimony check.
                          (he follows her inside)
                    C mon, J-bird.  Not a lot of people 
                    are taking golf lessons lately.  
                    I ve got Tad tonight, I d like to 
                    be able to, you know, feed him.

      INT. JULES  HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Jules enters and starts filling out a check, annoyed.

                                  BOBBY 
                    You know, Oprah said that when a 
                    marriage falls apart, both people 
                    need to take responsibility for 
                    their roles.

                                  JULES
                    I dropped out of college to support 
                    you and raise our kid while you 
                    spent twenty years trying to make 
                    it on the tour and drilling 
                    anything that moved.  

                                  BOBBY
                    Right.  And maybe you should ask 
                    yourself what you did to make me do 
                    that. 
                          (off her glare)
                    Kidding.  I know I was an ass.                                                                                     15.


                                  JULES
                          (smiles, hands over check)
                    Hey, for old time s sake, you want 
                    to go upstairs and have sex?

                                  BOBBY
                    Uh, yeah.

                                  JULES
                    I don t.

                                  BOBBY
                    That must have felt good.

                                  JULES
                    It did. 

      He smiles and exits.  Jules reacts casually (this is normal).

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

      Jules and Tad walk toward a house.  Jules eats her cuticle.

                                  TAD
                    Can you please not eat your finger?

                                  JULES
                    Give me a break, I m hungry.

                                  TAD 
                    Why do I still have to see a 
                    shrink?

                                  JULES
                    You re a child of divorce, Tad.  
                    Own it.

      INT. PSYCHOLOGIST S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Tad and Jules enter the home office waiting room.

                                  JULES
                    Plus, I list Dr. Ellis  house for 
                    him, so you get free sessions.  

      GRAYSON EMERGES (He s the Shrink! Yay!) escorting out a 
      SOBBING TEEN.  Jules and Tad AWKWARDLY LOOK AWAY.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I ll call later to check on you.

      The second the sobbing girl exits, Jules sighs with relief:

                                  JULES
                    Wooo!  What s wrong with her?                                                                                    16.


                                    GRAYSON
                    I don t know.  She wasn t crying 
                    when she came in.  You re up, Tad.  
                          (as Tad heads in)
                    And do not take your shoes off 
                    again if you aren t wearing socks.  
                    It s disgusting.

                                  JULES
                    I figured out how to get you back 
                    for yesterday.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Please God, let it be the silent 
                      treatment. 

                                  JULES
                    I decided that we re friends.
                          (off his reaction)
                    When we see each other we ll talk 
                    about your life, whether you re 
                    happy or sad - we re friends.

                                    GRAYSON
                    You can t just decide that we re 
                    friends.

                                  JULES
                    Uh, I just did.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I don t like this.

                                  JULES
                    That s okay.  Sometimes friends are 
                    mad at each other but they always 
                    go back to being friends.  

                                    GRAYSON
                    Stop it.

                                  JULES
                    Bye, call you later.

      As she leaves, we stay on Grayson s reaction.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. JULES  BEDROOM - LATER

      Laurie sits in an armchair.  She calls out.

                                  LAURIE
                    Why aren t you ready yet?

      Jules pokes her head out of the bathroom, still in a towel.                                                                                    17.


                                  JULES
                    Well, I can t find my favorite 
                    base.  Also, I m old and saggy and 
                      disgusting and I never really had 
                    my twenties so I have no idea how 
                    I m supposed to act or look, and 
                    even though I made fun of stupid 
                    Larry for going to bed early, if 
                    I m out after ten o clock, I get 
                    sleepy, and I hate you.

                                  LAURIE
                    Wow, that came out all at once.

                                  JULES
                    I m not doing this.  I m happy the 
                    way things are. 

      Laurie grabs the long pillow placed vertically on Jules  bed.

                    wearing?

      As Laurie tosses her an outfit:

                    We may have to talk about me 
                    killing your mother.

                                  TAD
                    Why was that girl crying?

                                    GRAYSON
                    She snapped and cut off her dog s 
                    feet.

                                  TAD
                    Really?

                                    GRAYSON
                    No, I m not allowed to tell you.

                    He knows who Tiger Woods is.

                    Yeah it is.

      He pulls back the rope.  Laurie enters.  Jules hesitates.

      NOW PROUDLY FLAUNTS HER NEW BOOBS IN A TANK TOP.

                                  LAURIE
                    Look, she s getting used to them.
                          (re: Jules)
                    You seem nervous.  Say something 
                      judgmental about me, that always 
                    loosens you up.

                                  JULES 
                    You can t wear fake nails on just 
                    one hand.  It looks insane.    

                                  LAURIE
                    I only had four left.  And this is 
                    the hand I smoke with.  Better?
                          (Jules nods)
                    First round s on me.

      Laurie goes to the bar.  Barb approaches looking different; 
      tight dress, heels, make-up -- She is Barb, QUEEN COUGAR. 

                                  JULES 
                    Barb?  What are you doing here?

                                    BARBARA
                    Having a glass of Pinot with my 
                    sister, trying to score some dick.  

                                  JULES
                    Oh, well... Good luck with that.  I 
                    have to go over here.

      Jules turns away KNOCKING INTO MATT (26, attractive).  His 
      drink explodes all over his shirt.  He looks at Jules.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Hi, I m Jules.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      LAURIE LOOKS OVER AT Jules and Matt now in mid-conversation.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    ... I can t believe you went to 
                    college in London.  I always wanted 
                    to do stuff like that.

                                  MATT
                    Why didn t you?                                                                                    20.


                                  JULES
                    You know how it goes.  I was 
                    nineteen, met a guy, started 
                    thinking with my hoo-hoo, and boom-- 
                    I jammed out a kid.
                          (finishes drink)
                    Boy, you are hot as balls.  Sorry, 
                    this is my second drink and all 
                    I ve eaten today is finger skin.

                                  MATT
                    Gross.  Want me to get you a water? 

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, but have them put it in a 
                    drink glass with a lime so I still 
                    look cool.

      Matt exits, REVEALING BARB, who mouths  hit that .  Jules 
      turns to see Ms. Pritchett all over a young man.  Jules looks 
      at a MIRROR and sees herself surrounded by youth (guys in 
      baseball hats, young girls, etc.).  HORRIFIED, JULES LEAVES.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. JULES  HOUSE - NIGHT

      As Jules EXITS A CAB, she sees GRAYSON with another YOUNG 
      CLUB GIRL (24).  She yells across the street:

                                  JULES
                    Stop having sex with babies!

                                    GRAYSON
                          (calmly to girl)
                    That s my new friend.

      INT. JULES  HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Jules enters to a ringing phone.  She answers it.

      INT. ELLE S DEN - CONTINUOUS

      Elle sits on the phone, by a Scrabble board.  WE INTERCUT.

                                  ELLE
                    I can t believe you stood me up.  
                    I m so pissed at you--

                                  JULES
                    Sorry, sorry, I totally forgot.  
                    I ll be right over.

      Jules hangs up and rushes upstairs, then:

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:                                                                                    21.


      Jules (hair up, wearing sweats) rushes downstairs and opens 
      her front door.  MATT S there,  STARTLING HER.  Laurie leans 
      out the window of A RANDOM GUY S car:

                                  LAURIE
                    You left that at the bar!  I m 
                    either going home with this nice 
                    gentleman or I m having him drop me  
                    at Dale s.  I haven t decided yet.

                                  JULES
                    Not Dale s!

      They DRIVE OFF.  Jules looks at Matt for a beat, then:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    This is so awkward I feel like my 
                    face might explode.

                                  MATT
                    May I come in?

                                  JULES
                    Uh... sure, okay, yeah.

      As he enters, she frantically lets her hair down and shakes 
      it out, sexy.  It doesn t work.  Then, re: her hair:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    That didn t work.  Can I get you a 
                    snack?  That s what I do for my 
                    son s friends, I get them snacks.  
                    Do you like crackers with peanut 
                    butter on them?

                                  MATT
                    I m okay.  I hope it s not too 
                    forward - coming over here.

                                  JULES
                          (turns away)
                    Look, Matt, you re a good kid, but 
                    this isn t really how I roll--
                          (he kisses her neck)
                    Oh my god, that s a neck kiss.

      The phone rings, snapping Jules out of her bliss:

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. ELLE S DEN - SAME TIME

      Elle is on the phone.  From now on WE INTERCUT.

                                  ELLE
                    Where the hell are you?                                                                                    22.


                                  JULES
                          (whispering)
                    There s a man in my house.

                                  ELLE
                    Should I call the police?

                                  JULES
                    No.  I went to a bar, and-- just go 
                    look at him.

      Elle puts the phone down and runs out of the room.

      INT. ELLE S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Elle enters and flicks on the lights even though Andy is 
      sleeping.  He momentarily stirs.

                                  ANDY
                    What...?

      Elle goes to the window, LOOKS OVER AT MATT in Jules  window, 
      reacts and runs out without shutting off the lights.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    Come on!!

      INT. ELLE S DEN - CONTINUOUS

      Elle runs back in and picks up the phone.

                                  ELLE
                    Go do horrible things to that young 
                    boy right now.

                                  JULES
                    No, I need time to prepare.  I have 
                    to go buy candles, I look good in 
                      flickering light.  Oh my God, what 
                    if he wants to keep the lights on?? 

                                  ELLE
                    Alright, deep breath.  You re good 
                    at sex, right?  

                                  JULES
                    I m like a seven.

                    I m a nine.  Now look...

      INT. JULES  BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

      As Jules frantically gets ready we hear Elle s speech:                                                                                    23.


                                  ELLE (V.O.)
                    ...No matter how hot he is, he s 
                    still a man, so he s less confident 
                    than you, sexually.  Just take 
                    charge of the situation the second 
                    you enter the room.  

      Ready, Jules turns confidently to enter the bedroom.

      INT. JULES  BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Matt lies on the bed.  The room is BRIGHT.  The bathroom door 
      opens a crack, and ONLY JULES  ARM COMES OUT, BLINDLY 
      SEARCHING FOR THE DIMMER.  She finds it, turns the lights 
      down, then ENTERS THE ROOM, POSING CONFIDENTLY.  From the 
      bed, MATT TURNS THE LIGHTS BACK UP.

                                  MATT
                    I want to see you.

                                  JULES
                    Here I am.

                    What s that scar from?

                                  JULES
                    I got knifed when I was a kid.

                                  MATT
                    Really?

                                  JULES
                    No, it s from my C-section.
                          (re: armpit)
                    And this little fella here is a 
                    skin tag -- What am I doing?

      Moment of truth.  Jules TAKES CONTROL:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Okay, listen up.  Lights off, 
                    condom on, and put Jonathan under 
                    your hips.

                                  MATT
                    Who?

                                  JULES
                    The big pillow.  No more talking.

      As Jules hits the lights:

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    24.


      INT. JULES  DEN - LATER

      The lights are dim.  ANGLE ON Jules, on the couch, in heaven.

                                  JULES
                    I feel like I can see colors again.  
                    That was amazing.  

      REVEAL Matt next to her eating crackers with peanut butter.

                                  MATT
                    Yeah.  And thanks for making these.  
                    After you offered before I couldn t 
                    get them out of my head.

                                  JULES
                    Three times.  We had sex three 
                    times without you needing a nap, or 
                    pills or anything.  How fun is 
                    that?

                                  MATT
                    Pretty fun.

                                  JULES 
                    Would it be okay if I did something 
                    I haven t done in years?  I always 
                    told my husband that I hated it, 
                    but I don t hate it, I love it.

                                  MATT
                    You can do anything you want to me.

                                  JULES
                    Fun!

                                  MATT
                    So what are you going to--

                                  JULES
                    Again, no talking.
                          (she slides down)
                    Just watch.

      Jules undoes his jeans (suggesting oral-sex).  ANGLE ON door.  
      Tad enters and reacts.  Then, Jules badly covers to Tad:

                                  JULES (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    There he is!

      REVEAL Bobby is at the door, too.  He calmly addresses Jules:

                                  BOBBY
                    You said you hated that.

      Jules sits, the weight of last night on her shoulders.  She 
      casually prepares to eat a banana.  Tad enters, snatches it 
      from her hand and throws it away.

                                  TAD
                    You re not allowed to eat those

                      seventeen, of course you know that.  
                    It s probably been done to you a 
                    number of times.  Has it?  You know 
                    what, that s probably off topic. 
                          (Tad leaves)
                    We ll talk later.

      INT. COBB REALTY OFFICE - MORNING 

      Jules enters to see Laurie.

                                  JULES
                    Well, I may have to kill myself--

      Jules stops when she sees Elle (with stroller).

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Why are you here?

                                  ELLE
                    You never called and told me what 
                    happened.  See, I used to be your 
                    best friend.  But now that I m 
                    stuck at home and you blow me off 
                    to go to bars and chase men, my 
                    only option is to come here and 
                    listen to you share everything 
                    about your life with this dummy. 

                                  LAURIE
                    She s been here forty minutes and 
                    that s the nicest thing she s said.                                                                                    26.


                                  ELLE
                    Go push Stan around the block, 
                    we re having grown-up talk.

                                  LAURIE
                    Stan?  Is your baby sixty?

                                  JULES
                    Laurie, please?  For me.

      As Laurie reacts and pushes Stan out, Jules turns to Elle:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    You d like her if you gave her a 
                    chance.

                                  ELLE
                    Pass.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Tad walks along, miserable.  He sees BJ (and idiot friends) 
      waiting for him.  

                                  TAD 
                    Not today, man.  I m warning you.

                                  BJ
                    Calm down, Cobb.  I did you a 
                    solid.  I walked in on my little 
                    brother and caught him with this.
                          (holds up Jules  sign)
                     Hi, Tad, it s me, Mom .  She is 
                    hot.  And guess what all the junior 
                    high boys are doing with these?
                          (holds up sign again)
                     I know, and I like it. 

      WE PUSH IN on Tad s face, flushed with fury.

      Jules and Elle now sit and talk.

                    You know why I really came here?  
                    Remember how Andy drinks coffee 
                    like every sip is sooo delicious?  
                    He was doing it this morning and it 
                    made me want to murder him so I 
                    need you to say your thing.                                                                                    27.


                                  JULES
                    No one in the world is meant for 
                    you more than Andy and you love him  
                    with all your heart.

                                  ELLE 
                    I know, it s so annoying.  Look, I 
                    know you have your own problems...

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      TAD BEATS BJ WITH THE SIGN as the others watch.  In between 
      each hit he says the same thing:

                                  TAD
                    You think my mom s hot now?  How 
                    about now?  How about now?

                                                                            BACK TO:

      We rejoin their conversation.

                                  ELLE 
                    ... But we had a plan.  We were 
                    going to have stupid cookouts with 
                    our stupid husbands, take awful 
                    vacations together.  Now I m always 
                    busy with the baby and you re back 
                    out there in the world, which I 
                    don t like at all by the way...  I 
                    just want us to still have time for 
                    each other.  I love you.

                                  JULES
                    I love you back, but twice as much, 
                    and in a more vulnerable way.  And  
                    Elle... I always have time for you.

      As Jules  phone rings:

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Through glass we see THE PRINCIPAL explain what happened to 
      Jules (Tad next to her).  He MIMES BEATING SOMEONE with a 
      sign.  Jules and Tad exit the office.  Then, all business:

                                  JULES
                    Go get your stuff.

      As Tad moves off, Jules turns to see Bobby.                                                                                    28.


                                  BOBBY
                    He does not look happy.

                                  JULES
                    The school called you?

                                  BOBBY
                    What?  No, I m here on an unrelated 
                    matter.  Apparently they have a 
                      landscaping position that I might 
                      potentially be interested in.  

                                  TAD
                          (returning)
                    Please, Dad, cut the lawns at my 
                    school, that s exactly what I need!

      Tad storms off, then Jules gets in Bobby s face.

                                  JULES
                    He was supposed to sleep at your 
                    apartment last night.  Couldn t you 
                    come through for me, just once?!!

      Jules storms off.  An ADMINISTRATOR approaches Bobby:

                                    ADMINISTRATOR
                    Ready, Mr. Cobb?

                                  BOBBY
                          (unconcerned)
                    Let s do this.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Tad and Jules get out of the car arguing.

                                  JULES
                    ...Look, I know you and I had a bit 
                    of an awkward moment last night.
                          (off Tad s look)
                    Yeah,  awkward moment , that s what 
                    I m calling it.  Still, there s 
                    never an excuse for violence.  

                                  TAD
                    Junior high boys are stealing your 
                    signs.  Do you want to know why?!  
                    They use them to pleasure 
                      themselves. 

                                  JULES
                          (flattered)

                          (catches herself)
                    I mean, really?

                                  TAD
                    Why can t you just be a normal mom, 
                    and stop torturing me?

                                  JULES
                          (calling after him)
                    I m allowed to have a life, Tad.

      Tad goes inside.  Grayson approaches having witnessed it all.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Don t worry, he ll be fine.  You 
                    know, as long as you don t sell my 
                    house in the next six years because 
                    thanks to you, that boy s going to 
                    need some work.  Of course, I m not 
                    speaking to you as his doctor.  I m 
                    speaking as your friend.  We re 
                    friends, remember?

      Grayson smiles, pleased with himself.  Jules walks up to him, 
      then unexpectedly PUSHES HIM OVER.  Then, from the ground:

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Did that just happen?

      Tad, watching, yells down from the upstairs window:

                                  TAD
                    Never an excuse for violence, Mom!

                                  JULES
                    Get back in the damn house!

      Tad closes the window and Jules turns to Grayson:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    You know what?  I m not going to 
                    play the  pretend we re friends  
                    game with you anymore.  It s only 
                    fun with someone that you re 
                    actually, maybe sort of becoming 
                    friends with.  Not with a typical 
                    douchebag that gets to walk away 
                    from his marriage scot-free, no 
                      responsibilities, nothing.  Do you 
                    know how scary it is being a single 
                    forty year-old woman?

                                    GRAYSON
                    I want to say yes.                                                                                    30.


                                  JULES
                    Whatever you do, you feel judged by 
                    the world -- you feel judged by 
                    yourself.  And deep down you know 
                    that even if you ever do want to 
                    get married again, it s not going 
                    to happen.  Not when you re fifty, 
                    your looks have faded, and you 
                    can t make babies anymore.  So you 
                    put on a brave face and try really 
                    hard not to think about the fact 
                    that maybe this is all your life s 
                    going to be.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (getting up)
                    You know, my Grandad got a chick 
                    pregnant when he was ninety.

      Jules pushes Grayson down again and marches back to her 
      house.  From the ground, Grayson turns to see Andy pushing 
      the stroller by, drinking coffee.  They speak casually.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Andy.

                                  ANDY
                    Grayson.  She got you twice.
                          (sips coffee, blissful)
                    Ohhh, lord, that s good coffee. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Jules pulls her outside and turns, walking backwards.  

                                  JULES
                    I won t let you fall into the same 
                    trap I did.  Kids don t fix things--

      She FALLS into the same bush AGAIN.

                                  LAURIE
                    You never learn, do you?

                                  JULES
                          (face down in bush)
                    Shut up.

      Jules looks up from the bush to see THE SAME BOY from before, 
      STEALING JULES  SIGN.  They lock eyes, then:

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Get him!  

      The kid runs off.

      EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

      The kid rounds a corner, terrified.  Jules and Laurie follow, 
      NOW CARRYING THEIR SHOES.  They chase him through bushes and 
      across backyards.  The boy tries to climb over a fence but 
      JULES JUMPS AND GRABS HIS FOOT.  The boy panics, drops the 
      sign and flops over.  Out of breath, Jules and Laurie watch 
      him sprint into a nearby house. 

                                  LAURIE
                    We got the sign back.  It s over.

      As Jules reacts:

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. KID S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      The doorbell rings over and over.  A MOM opens the door to 
      REVEAL a very dishevelled Jules and Laurie.

                                  JULES
                    May I talk to your son?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    32.


      INT. HALLWAY/KID S ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

      As the Mom opens the door:

                                  MOM
                    Robbie, someone wants to talk to 
                    you.

      The door opens to REVEAL Robbie, in his boxers, his room 
      covered with Jules  signs like an adolescent whack palace.  

                                  JULES
                    Hi, Robbie.  You obviously know my 
                    name, this is my co-worker, Laurie.

                                  LAURIE
                    Hey, Robbie.  You re fast.

                                  ROBBIE
                    This is seriously not cool.

                                  MOM
                    He s never stolen things before.  
                    You know boys, his body s going 
                    through a lot of changes.

                                  ROBBIE
                    MOM!

                                  JULES
                    It s okay, I have a son of my own.

                                  ROBBIE 
                    Do you embarrass him like this? 

      Jules looks at this mortified kid and it hits her.  Hard.

                                  JULES
                    Yeah, I guess I do.  Sorry, Robbie.

      As Jules walks out with the Mom, Laurie gathers the signs 
      then looks at the sad kid.  She checks the door, then:

                                  LAURIE
                    Give me your e-mail address, I ll 
                    send you some pictures I took of 
                    her at the beach last summer.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. JULES  DEN - NIGHT

      Jules sits, thinking.  Tad comes downstairs, heading out.                                                                                    33.


                                  JULES 
                    Hey, before you go, I want you to 
                    know the other night was a one time 
                    deal.  The last thing I want to do 
                    is have my life make your life any 
                    more difficult.  I promise.  

                                  TAD
                          (relieved)
                    Thank you.
                        (a beat, then)
                    Ryan s picking me up. 

                                  JULES
                          (as he kisses her)
                    Remember, if there s any drinking 
                    and driving--

                                  TAD
                    Penis picture, I got it, Mom.

      And he s gone.  Jules pours two glasses of wine again.  She 
      looks out the side window to see Elle and Andy dancing in 
      their living room, a living image of what she doesn t have.  
      Jules sits down on her couch, again alone in her den. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. JULES  HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Tad stands on the curb waiting.  Grayson gets his mail.

                                  TAD
                    I m waiting for a buddy.

                                    GRAYSON
                    That s exciting news.  Looks like 
                    your mom s got a fun night ahead, 
                    too.

                                  TAD
                          (looks in)
                    Yeah, whatever.

                                    GRAYSON 
                    May I tell you something I picked 
                    up on in your sessions?  You re a 
                    selfish little shit.
                          (off Tad s look)
                    Sucks to hear, but you know it s 
                    true.  I mean, come on, does she 
                    really look like she s enjoying her 
                    life?  Still, she s doing what you 
                    want, isn t she?  So I suppose 
                    that s nice.  

      Ryan pulls up.                                                                                    34.


                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Good night, Tad.

                                  TAD
                    You re an asshole.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I know.  I m okay with it.

      As Grayson walks off, Tad gets in Ryan s car, lost in 
      thought.  We see his POV of his mom alone.  WE END ON TAD S 
      FACE RACKED WITH GUILT.  He knows he s a JERK. 

      INT. JULES  DEN - CONTINUOUS

      Jules casually looks out the window to see that Tad is gone.

                                  JULES
                    He s gone.

      MATT STEPS OUT.

                                  JULES (CONT D)
                    Take the wine upstairs and get 
                      undressed.  I ll make sure the door 
                    is locked.  

      Matt starts off, then stops.

                                  MATT
                    Do you want the lights on or off?

                                  JULES
                    No lights, I bought candles.  And 
                    Matthew, no more talking.

      As WE GO CLOSE ON Jules  hand locking the front door:

                                        END OF SHOW
