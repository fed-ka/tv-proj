An airline ticket is tossed INTO FRAME beside a suitcase; "EURO-AIR. FLIGHT #180. New York City (JFK) - Paris, Charles de Gaulle (CDG.) Departure: Thursday 13May. 16H25 - Arrival: Friday 14May. 05H40."
"And When I Die" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES:
AN OLD TABLE FAN
swivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan...
THE BED
A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages.
THE TABLE FAN
turns, head swiveling away from the bed.
TIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES
stop flipping, REVEALING A GULLOTINE from the Reign of Terror.
As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook...
THE TABLE FAN
swivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed.
THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES
FLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura.
CAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again.
TIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN
There is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze.
THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES
stop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted "This is the End." Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE.
BARBARA
Alex...
CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman."
One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant;
"Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!"
Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious.
BARABRA (Cont'd)
Tod and George's dad just called,
he's picking you up at 10 in the
morning. Bus leaves the high school
for JFK at noon.
Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son.
KEN
My suitcase workin' out for ya?
Alex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight.
ALEX
Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave
that on. It's like... the tag
made the last flight without
crashin' or anything, right?
So, it should stay on, or with,
the bag for good luck.
BARBARA
Where would you get a nutball
idea like that?
EXTREMELY CLOSE - THE AIRLINE BAGGAGE MARKER
is torn away from the suitcase handle.
RETURN
As Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor... a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if "you?" The guilty party shrugs.
KEN
I'm still here.
Barbara shakes her head as Alex smiles at his dad.
KEN (Cont'd)
Seventeen and on the loose. Ten
days in Paris. In the springtime!
Live it up, Alex...
CAMERA INCHES INTO KEN as he winks at his son...
KEN (Cont'd)
Got your whole life ahead of you.
ALEX
CAMERA CREEPS IN as, oddly, the words strike him portentously...
CUT TO:
The storm has ceased. The room is QUIET.
As if itself a presence, CAMERA CREEPS across the dark and motionless room TOWARD Alex, sleeping soundly. CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the level of the bed until Alex is in the f.g. and the room is visible behind him.
On the rear wall, the Fighting Colonials pennant begins to flutter slightly, as if affected by the moving breeze. The path of which is continued toward the bed, rustling the sheets, subtly blowing Alex's hair and continuing OVER CAMERA.
Even in his sleep, Alex shivers from the passing cold. His eyes open surprised to be suddenly awakened. He considers for a beat, then looks toward...
THE WINDOWS
which... are closed.
ALEX
puzzled, checks...
THE TABLE FAN
which is off.
ALEX
perplexed, rolls over toward his digital clock. It's 1:00 a.m., however... the middle digit bar in the first zero faintly flickers so this time appears to read... 1:80.
AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.)
(overlapping)
Attention airline travelers...
CUT TO:
FLIGHT 180 departs 4:25. Gate 39.
AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.)
This airport does not support

CAMERA ADJUSTS FROM the "Arrival-Departure Schedule" to REVEAL forty high school KIDS, four TEACHERS and several PARENTS are gathered inside the International terminal at J.F.K. Several of the students wear Fighting Colonial leterman's jackets or hats and shirts displaying "Mt. Abraham High, New York."
AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You are not required to give money
to solicitors.
Alex gathers his bags, as does his best friend TOD WAGGNER and his older brother GEORGE WAGGNER, standing before their father, JERRY WAGGNER. For Alex, any psychic tension from the night before seems forgotten in the fun and excitement of the trip.
MR. WAGGNER
Alright, you guys got everything?
TOD
Yeah, we're all set Dad.
MR. MURNAU, the French teacher (any further description necessary?) and leader of the class trip waves his arm.
MR. MURNAU
Les estudients, allons en France!
MR. WAGGNER
Does that mean "go?"
Tod shrugs, "I guess" as he moves to his father and gives him a warm hug goodbye. Mr. Waggner then gives his older son a hug.
AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.
Atencion senores pasajeros. No
es necesario contribuir...
MR. WAGGNER
I'll miss you guys.
Tod and George gives a wave, as does Alex, who is slapped on the back by Mr. Waggner.
MR. WAGGNER
Take care of those two, Alex.
ALEX
I will. Don't worry.
The group begins down the airport toward the check-in counter. In the f.g., before the boys, strides a girl, CLEAR RIVERS, 17, reading the TROPIC OF CANCER. The loner in the group, Clear wears dark colors against the insecerity of her sex appeal. She appears aloof and more wordly then the other students.
Readying his ticket and documents, Tod flips open his passport, checking out his photo.
TOD
I didn't think anything could
worse than my yearbook picture.
GEORGE
Now you know how I feel havin' to
look at you all the time.
AIRPORT P.A.
(V.O.)
Avis aux passagers...
Mr. Murnau stops the group. Excited, he cups an ear with one hand while raising a finger toward the public address system.
MR. MURNAU
Entendez classe, qu'est ce que
c'est l'announce?
Everyone begrudgingly stops to listen.
AIRPORT P.A. (O.S. CONT'D)
Vous n'etes pas dans l'obligation

CARTER HORTON
is the class dickhead who mix and matches his role models in the most superficial manner. His hand is tucked into his girlfriend, TERRY CHANEY'S, waistband...
CARTER
(re: MURNAU)
What the fuck's he want?
Terry, hot now, but with no idea what time will do to her in just five years, smiles obsequiously and mouths "shh."
P.A. SYSTEM (O.S., CONT'D)
cher aeroport n'est responsable

Mr. Murnau scans the group, his expression looking for an answer. Clear Rivers keeps her head in her book as...
CLEAR
The airport doesn't endorse
solicitors.
MR. MURNAU
Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit!
She doesn't react. Her expression remains cool as Murnau leads the
procession forward. The boys continue. Alex sighs...
ALEX
Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with
that shit the whole time?
A hand reaches out to gently detain Alex. He looks up to find a HARE KRISHANA, dressed in everyday clothes, but head shaved and a mark on his nose.
HARE KRISHANA
Death is not the end.
CAMARA PUSHES IN ON ALEX... unsettled by the soft spoken, yet ominous, "Solicitation." The Krishana offers a small book, REALITY BEYOND THE MATTER: VAISHNAVA PHILOSOPHY.
As he hands the book to Alex, a female form ENTERS FRAME between them. The women is MISS VALERIE LEWTON, 30, a feisty English teacher whose figure inspires all the boys' fantasies.
MS. LEWTON
It will be for you if you harass
my students.
She places a hand on Alex's shoulder, herding him to the group.
HARE KRISHANA
(pissy)
Hare Rama.
Ms. Lewton turns and, while walking backward, flashes a smile...
MS. LEWTON
(mouths)
Fuck off.
As she turns her back and continues down the terminal...
CUT TO:
Alex's passport and ticket are set INTO FRAME and picked up by a female TICKET CLERK. Alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport...
TICKET CLERK
I have a few questions to ask you
this afternoon.
O.S., LOUD, EXAGGERATED plastic tiles rapidly CLICK and CLACK.
TICKET CLERK (CONT'D)
Did you pack these bags yourself?
The CLACKING CONTINUES, demading Alex's attention. His eyes turn forward.
ALEX'S POV - THE FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD
Plastic tabs CLACK rapidly, settling on the word... "CANCELLED."
ALEX
CAMARA CREEPS IN on his dawning paranoia...
TICKET CLERK (CONT'D, O.S.)
Have your belongings remained in your
possession the entire time?
Alex absently nods. Again, O.S., CLACK CLACK CLACK. His eyes move to...
ALEX'S POV - (TIGHTER) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD
The plastic tabs FLIP and CLACK rapidly, stopping on... "DEPARTED."
TICKET DESK
Alex is still considering the "messages..."
TICKET CLERK
Have you recieved any packages
from persons unknown to you?
Alex quickly runs the day through his head and flashes her the REALITY BEYOND MATTER book. She smiles, then leans over toward the baggage scales. Alex's eyes turn toward...
CLOSE - (MOTION SLOWED)- ALEX'S LUGGAGE
a new airline I.D. marker is attached to his bag.
RETURN
Alex eyes the new tag hoping it's "good luck." As the clerk returns his ticket and passport... CLACK, CLACK, CLACK.
TICKET CLERK
Same as your birthday.
Alex is puzzeled by the comment. He shakes his head if, "pardon me?" CAMERA INCHES INTO the ticket clerk gesturing pleasantly to the passport and ticket...
TICKET CLERK (CONT'D)
April 25th. Four-twenty-five...
your birthday is the same as your
departure time.
CLACK. CLACK. CLACK. Alex's eyes flash toward...
ALEX'S POV - (FULL FRAME) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD
the title settles upon... "TERMINAL."
CUT TO:
SECURITY AREA - AIRPORT - MONITOR
The ghastly green and reds of the X-ray monitors flash as carry on bags flash through the machine. CAMERA MOVES COUNTER to the direction of the conveyor belt. The pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches.
Carter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions. Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action. Alex, Tod, George and BILLY HITCHCOCK, heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust.
BILLY
I can't believe they let that
dickhead on this trip.
GEORGE
His parents bought a ton of those
trip certificates we had to sell,
just to get him out of their hair
for ten days.
Excited, Tod speaks in a convert tone over Alex's shoulder.
TOD
Dude, I so worked the ticket clerk
so you're sittin' next to Christa
and I'm next to Blake.
Alex looks up ahead of the metal detectors...
ALEX'S POV - TWO GIRLS
Attractive and they know it, CHRISTA MARSH and BLAKE DREYER appear clearly out of Alex and Tod's league.
TOD (CONT'D)
That's seven hours and most of it is
in the dark.
ALEX AND TOD
The boys dump their change in a plastic bowl.
TOD
Dude, if we don't get someone
going on this flight, we should
just call Dr. Kervorkian and put
ourselves out of our fuckn' misery.
As Alex and Tod pass through the metal detector, their eyes performing reconnaissance on Christa and Blake, the opening drum BLASTS of Boingo's "No One Lives Forever" OVERLAPS...
CUT TO:
CAMERA ADJUSTS from the sign indicating GATE 39. The class is squirrely and
excited. Mr. Murnau, Ms. Lewton, and the parent chaperones are allowing kids to burn off steam at the gate, hoping for a calm flight.
CAMERA MOVES ALONG the awaiting passengers... Carter and Terry are making out, a step away from heavy petting...
Blake and Christa are flipping through Parisian fashion magizines... Billy Hitchcock lays into a Burrito Supreme...
CAMERA MOVES to an empty seat. Clear Rivers ENTERS FRAME and sits,
struggling with her Walkman, coffee, books, and a cassette box handmarked "Boingo" (a cheat that We hear the song)
As she places her stuff on the unoccupied seat beside her, a Paris guidebook falls on the floor, opened but face down. A passing, unidentified, student reaches down and hands her the book, still open and face down.
CLEAR
Thanks.
The student continues down toward the observation deck. Clear looks at the opened guidebook.
CLEAR'S POV - GUIDEBOOK
Princess Di's Mercedes is totaled in a Paris tunnel. Besides the photo are two portraits of Diana and Dodi Al Fayed.
CLEAR
CAMERA INCHES IN as she shakes off a shiver down her spine. She looks up from the book toward the student who handed it to her, the identity of which is fully REVEALED to be Alex Browning.
He stands at the gate window, looking out at the plane.
ALEX'S POV - 747
It is raining. In the distance, MUFFLED THUNDER RUMBLES.
CAMERA CREEPS AWAY from the plane... huge, seemingly incapable of flight and yet we unquestioningly trust our lives in this machine. Emotionless. Cold. Lifeless, and yet soon full of life.
ALEX
CAMERA inches in on him.
TOD (O.S.)
Dude, let's take a dump.
Tod MOVES INTO FRAME beside Alex...
ALEX
Man, that is one George Michael
notch from being gay.
TOD
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to
board a seven hour flight. The
toilets in coach are barely
ventilated closets. What if your
body wants that airplane food out of
your system and you have to go torgue
a wicked cable and then right after
you walks in Christa or Blake? You
want them to associate with you with
that reflexive gag and the watery
sting in their eyes?
Alex takes a beat to consider...
CUT TO:
CAMERA LOOKS DOWN on two stalls. Alex sits in one, Tod sits in the other. O.S., OVER the airports P.A. SYSTEM John Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" begins...
ALEX
John Denver...
Upon the mention, CAMERA CRANES DOWN, TURNING, TWISTING UNTIL FINDING ALEX in a straight on CLOSE-UP. He listens, tense...
JOHN DENVER (O.S.)
He was born in the summer of his
twenty-seventh year...
ALEX
He died in a plane crash.
A P.A. ANNOUNCMENT breaks into the song...
P.A. SYSTEM
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank-you for
your patience, at this time we would
like to begin pre-boarding of Euro-Air
Flight 180 to Paris through gate 39.
Really for the first time, Alex appears a bit tentative and pale. It is intensified by the return of the song...
JOHN DENVER (O.S.)
It's the Colorado Rocky Mountian High/
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky...

ALEX'S POV - RAMP TUNNEL
CAMERA CREEPS toward it... lit to cheat a feeling of no return.
O.S., distant THUNDER RUMBLES...
WIDER
There is something more emotionally tense about the moment of boarding than take-off. CAMERA PICKS UP Ms. Lewton searching...
MS. LEWTON
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
How'd we lose him?
Tod nudges Alex toward the tunnel, the three boys start down the ramp, passing Mr. Murnau who checks his list, counting heads...
MR. MURNAU
Vingt huit, vingt neuf...
PASSENGER RAMP
Alex, Tod, and George catch up to Christa and Blake, excited. As always, everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane. Alex looks out the ramp's side porthole window toward the back of the plane.
ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PORTHOLE
The enormous engine. The expansive wings. Behind the tail, distant, a bolt of lightning FLASHES!
ALEX
looks away. Just ahead, in the plane, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS greet the
passengers. He is next to enter the plane.
CLOSE - FLOOR
a slice of opening from where the ramp meets the plane provides a sense of how high up one actually stands.
ALEX
CAMERA PUSHES INTO HIM as he takes his first step into the plane.
CLOSE - AIRLINE CABIN FLOOR
Alex's Nikes land on the carpet.
SCREAMS! Its parents desperately comfort the child.
CAMERA ADJUSTS, LEADING George, Alex and Tod through the aisles. Alex and Tod wince at the screaming child. George, however feels comforted.
GEORGE
Good sign. Younger the better.
It would be a fucked-up God to
take down this plane.
In the first row slumps a young man with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. A cannula is set in his nostrils leading to an oxygon tank beside him.
The kids sneak sympathetic yet anxious glances at the man while continuing in their seats. George whispers over his shoulder...
GEORGE
A REALLY fucked-up God.
Alex's tension increases as he continues up the aisle.
ALEX'S POV - OVERHEAD COMPARTMENTS
CAMERA INCHES IN ON "Row 25. Seats H, I, and J."

CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD HIM, face to the glass; eyes scanning the plane and outside area.
CHRISTA (O.S.)
Alex?
He turns toward the aisle.
ALEX'S POV - CHRISTA AND BLAKE
Man, they look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.
CHRISTA
Could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I can sit together? I
asked Tod, but he says he's got some
medical thing?
ALEX
sneaks a quick check with Tod.
ALEX'S POV - TOD
shakes his head. "NO! NO! DON'T DO IT."
ALEX AND THE GIRLS
He looks to them and knows he is just plain overmatched. Alex shrugs, "Sure." In front of him Tod throws up his arms, disgusted. Alex climbs out of his seats. The girls are touchy-feely thankful, but only know guys dig that.
CHRISTA AND BLAKE
You're so sweet. Thanks, Alex.
Alex crames up into the aisles, making his way to Tod, sitting two rows up in 22 H.
Alex climbs over Tod to take the window seat. Clear Rivers sits in the seat directly behind Alex.
TOD
(mouths)
Fag.
ALEX
C'mon, man, like you really thought
you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over
Greenland, or something?
TOD
Because of you, I gotta sit here and
watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
As Alex sits, the tray table falls from its upright position.
He lifts the tray back up, but as he turns the latch, it BREAKS OFF in his hand. He briefly tries to jimmie the tray into postition, then gives up.
CAMERA FOLLOWS ALEX'S HAND as it rises. CAMERA SWEEPS IN EXTREAMLY CLOSE to the ATTENDANT CALL BUTTON. As Alex's finger engages the button, it lights up orange.
ALEX
The jet lurches. He looks...

Looking fore in the cabin...
ALEX'S POV - NEAR THE FLIGHT DECK
The flight attendants strap themselves in for take-off.
ALEX
O.S., the ENGINE VOLUME INCREASES in PITCH and INTENSITY as the jet begins to taxi. Alex sits back as the tray over his lap. He looks out the window.
ALEX'S POV - THE RIGHT WING
appears motionless in the f.g. as the tarmac and runway signs roll past the window. THE ENGINE PITCH RISES...
ALEX
The ENGINES WHIR as the jet gathers SPEED. He checks the window.
ALEX'S POV- THE RUNWAY
is a blur. The airport terminals in the b.g. streak past. The wings lift, angled as the jet leaves the ground.
ALEX
O.S., his classmates CHEER and "raise the roof." The trip has begun.
CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM ALEX, as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation. He finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat, slightly pushed by mild-g force. The upwarding angle increasing...
The cabin buffets, as if passing mild turbulance. Then...
The cabin sharply JOLTS! Everyone tenses, GASPS. CAMERA SWEEPS BACK TO ALEX. And just as he clenches his backpack... the cabin BANGS, ROCKS. THE ENGINES SPOOL TO A STALL. METAL TWISTS under extreme PRESSURE. The cabin dips, angles, sharply to the right.
ALEX'S POV - THE CABIN
Passengers SCREAM! Unrestrained personal belongings fly across the aircraft INTO CAMERA, which BUFFETS and SHAKES...
OXYGEN MASKS
deploy from the overhead compartments. A prerecorded message, like that recorded by the black box of the crash of JAL# 123 August 12, 1985, BLARES over the P.A., with erie calm...
MESSAGE (V.O.)
Fasten seat belts...put on oxygen
masks...
ALEX
his hand trembles as he reaches for the oxygen mask and places it over his face. The ENGINES resuscitate. SCREAMING. WHINING. Alex checks out his window.
ALEX'S POV - OUT OF WINDOW
The plane is on its side, losing altitude. A slow, sick spin.
ALEX
breaths deep into his oxygen cup.
The JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS.
Then...
KA-BOOM
A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds.
Dead students sit lifeless in their seats.
Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky.
Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare.
ALEX AND TOD
SCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff.
OUTSIDE... the sick familiar SOUND of an aircraft going down.
ALEX is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. FIRE, WIND, AND BLOOD WHIP across him. A BUILDING WHINE CRESCENDOES before a second EXPLOSION RIPS ACROSS FRAME...
CUT TO:
CLOSE - ALEX'S TERRIFIED EYES
dilating rapidly, as the shock of what appears to be happening before him washes over his very psyche.
CHRISTA (O.S.)
Alex?
ALEX
Drenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake. They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.
CHRISTA
Could you trade seats with Blake so
she and I can sit together? I asked
Tod, but he's got some medical thing.
Alex turns sickeningly disoriented. His eyes dart about, searching for evidnece of the catastrophe. There are none to be found. Alex blots from his seat, startling the two girls. He scrambles toward Tod, who looks at his friend, concerned.
TOD
Dude, what up?
Frenzied, Alex climbs over his friend, on top of the seat. Alex's panic has alerted the other students and a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT who makes his way to the row.
ALEX
grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat. IT BREAKS OFF, JUST AS BEFORE. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, terrified. He begins to hyperventilate.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Is there a a problem, sir?
Alex's wild eyes and expression convey "no fucking kidding there's a problem." The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode.
Directly across the aisle, Carter Horton and Terry look at him with severe expressions.
CARTER
What's your fuckin' problem?
Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward Alex.
MR. MURNAU
Alex? Qu'est-ce se?
ALEX
Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA
EXPLODE!
Obviously, no one ever wants to ever hear that. The students tense.
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
immediately turns to other attendants, signaling for assistance with a quick definite gesture. In the b.g., attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin.
CARTER AND TERRY
CARTER
TERRY
Shut up, Browning!
You're not funny.
ALEX
frenzied, begins moving toward the aisle.
ALEX
We have to get out!
This frightens everyone. Not the "prophecy," but his panicky, irrational behavior.
ALEX (CONT'D)
We have to get off this plane!
CLEAR RIVERS
CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER, hearing Alex's declaration.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Now! NOW!!
RETURN
Alex is desperately climbing over Tod, who is trying to calmly restrain his friend. Across the aisle, Carter Horton stands ready to quiet Alex, with force.
CARTER
Sit! DOWN! Browning!
TOD
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Alex. Alex! Easy, man. Take it
Sir, if this is a joke,
easy.
we don't tolerate such
humor.
The flight attendant restrains Carter with an extended forearm.
ALEX
I'm not joking! I'm not joking!
Ms. Lewton and Mr. Murnau move to the seats. Flight attendants try
restraining Alex from reaching the aisle.
MS. LEWTON
MR. MURNAU
Alex, Knock it off. It's alright.
Settle down, Alex.
ALEX
Listen to me! This plane will
explode on take-off!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir, we will remove you from the
aircraft if this continues.
CARTER
I'll remove him.
ALEX
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
Carter reaches for Alex, who pushes back, trying to get out. Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee.
The Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation. He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle.
A male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back. Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage. He begins removing Carter from the plane as well.
TERRY
He didn't do nothin'!
She follows the attendant, hitting him to help her boyfriend.
Just arriving in the cabin, Billy Hitchcock tries to fight past a
STEWARDESS to get to his seat. He is blocked by the mass of combatants as they are escorted out.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(he's had it)
Anybody in the aisle is off the
plane!
BILLY
No, wait, I was late... that's my
seat right there!
Under protest, Billy gets pushed back off the plane. Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton follow the pack of students and airline personnel as they move toward the exit, calling out to seated teachers and parents while hustling up the aisles.
MS. LEWTON
MR. MURNAU
Everybody just stay where you
Mr. Carpenter, keep an eye on
are. Just sit tight.
things for a moment.
Tod watches, amazed and concerned for his friend. He looks across the cabin to...
TOD'S POV - GEORGE
his brother gestures, mouths... "you should go with him."
TOD
starts off down the aisles. CAMERA COUNTERS... ADJUSTING TO CLEAR RIVERS. Amongst the chaos, she considers for a beat, then grabs her backpack, stands and moves into the aisle to exit the plane.
CUT TO:
Alex, the co-pilot, Carter, the attendant, Mr. Murnau, Ms, Lewton, Terry, Tod and Billy proceed down the tunnel. Billy is confused by the chaos.
BILLY
I didn't do anything! I have my
ticket right here!
Arriving SECURITY OFFICERS quickly have control of the situation. Alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co-pilot, who, winded, eyes the officers.
CO-PILOT
You got this?
The officers nod. One moves toward Carter as he dropped in a seat away from Alex. Terry sits behind Carter.
The co-pilot and attendants start back toward the plane. Ms. Lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive.
CO-PILOT
No one gets back on board. That's my
call.
MS. LEWTON
PLEASE... I've got forty students
going to Paris...
During these negotiations... CAMERA MOVES PAST Ms. Lewton and the Co-Pilot to the boarding ramp door...
Clear Rivers exits and takes a seat away from the others, aware she is unnoticed in the confusion. CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up toward...
ALEX
CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE TO HIM AS TOD and Mr. Murnau attempt to calm him down.
TOD
It's alright. It's alright. You're
off the plane. You're off the
plane...
Rattled, Alex attempts to compose himself. Ms. Lewton appears, hurriedly pulling aside Mr. Murnau.
MS. LEWTON
Airline's not taking this very well.
They'll let one of us back on and
the rest can grab a six-ten flight.
Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle.
It's alright. It's not that big of a
deal.
MR. MURNAU
I'll stay.
MS. LEWTON
No, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane.
Murnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door. Pleading his case, Billy follows Murnau.
BILLY
I was in the bathroom. The lock was
stuck. I didn't fight with anyone!
Hustling toward the door. Mr. Murnau gestures toward Ms. Lewton as if "talk to her." He disappears down the ramp. CAMERA PUSHES IN as airline personnel CLOSE THE DOOR...with an ominous THUD.
Carter turns over his shoulder, looking back angrily towards Alex. Terry wraps a calming/restraining arm around Carter's shoulder, but he starts towards Alex, seated with Ms. Lewton.
MENS ROOM ACROSS FROM GATE 39
Tod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he hands it to Ms. Lewton seated next to Alex. The teacher places it on Alex's forehead.
TOD
I called your mom and dad and
they're on their way.
MS. LEWTON
Alex, talk to me. What happened?
Alex looks at Tod, who nods. His friend's expression is soothing and open. With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him...
ALEX
I... I saw it... like, I don't
know... the plane took off. I saw
it leave the runway... I looked down
and saw the ground...
Ms. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances.
ALEX (CONT'D)
And then the cabin banged and the
left side exploded. The the whole
plane... blew up. It was so real.
Exactly how everything goes.
TOD
Been on many planes that blew up,
have you?
Good point. Alex looks away.
MS. LEWTON
You must have fallen asleep.
CARTER
We get thrown off the plane and blow
a half day in Paris because Browning
has a bad dream?
(mocking Alex)
It's going to explode! It's going to
explode!
TOD
Fuck off, Horton.
MS. LEWTON
Tod...
A raw nerve, Alex stands.
ALEX
Only trip you're gonna take is to
the fuckin' hospital.
Carter scoffs while moving aggressively toward Alex.
Carter makes a quick move and grabs Alex. The two security guards rush in to break it up. Chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal.
OBSERVATION DECK
CAMERA PUSHES INTO Billy Hitchcock, depressed as he watches the plane take off...
BILLY
There they go and here we stay.
AIRPORT TERMINAL
One guard restrains Alex; another Carter. In the b.g. out of the observation deck window... Flight 180 lifts off the runway.
CARTER
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
ALEX
I wish you were on the plane!
In the b.g. the 747 head and taillights suddenly, violently, ERUPT into a gigantic fireball of flame.
It takes a few seconds for the CONCUSSION to hit the terminal, but when it does... BOOM! A window SHATTERS! Chairs rock! People are knocked off their feet.
CAMERA SWEEPS INTO ALEX... stunned as he turns to the window...
ALEX'S POV - FLIGHT 180
The unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky.
CLEAR RIVERS
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, rattled, afraid, but aware of Alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him.
GATE 39
Billy Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out.
O.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy.
CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX... as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's... then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him.
CAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock... upon the doomed FLIGHT 180.
CUT TO:
SILENCE
A pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by Alex's presance.
The others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye.
ALEX'S POV - THE ROOM
Ms. Lewton, Carter and Billy glare at Alex. Terry averts her eyes from Alex to bury her face in Carter's shoulder.
ALEX
frightened as anyone over what has happened, tenses, defensive and scared. With softspoken strength...
ALEX
You're lookin' at me as if I caused
it. I did not cause this.
LEWTON, CARTER, TERRY, AND BILLY
maintain their uncertain expressions. With strained apprehansion, as if not wanting to "dabble in the occult," but needing an immediate answer.
MS. LEWTON
Is everyone dead? Are there any
survivors?
WIDER
Alex is taken aback by the question, yet even his best friend looks at him for an answer.
ALEX
How would I know? You think I'm
some sort of...
CLEAR
He's not a witch.
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Alex, relieved and thankful, as he turns to her...
CLEAR RIVERS - ALEX'S POV
CAMERA MATCHES the move INTO HER as she looks up at Alex, not with fear or repulsion... but with knowledge of an unwanted but irrefutable connection.
WIDER
Causing a startle, the DOOR OPENS. Everyone's head whips reflexively toward the entrance. The strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten.
A half dozen MEN and WOMEN enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being F.B.I. Special Agents WEINE and SCHRECK. HOWARD SEIGEL and DON HAWKS are representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board. EILEEN WHALE and JACK ARNOLD are members of the Euro-Air "Trauma Team."
The officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time.
SEIGEL
Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National
Transportation Safety Board vice
chairmen. We've notified your families
and they are on their way. Does anyone
feel they need medical attention or
spiritual counseling at this time?
Although the words are comforting, being in the position of having to hear them macabre. Ms. Lewton reacts, snapping...
MS. LEWTON
Have they found any survivors?
What's going on?
Seigel is calm, yet honest... carefully honest.
SEIGEL
The cause of the explosion is
undetermined. Nassau county
authorities are on the scene. Naval
search and rescue are en route.
He gestures... "and that's all we know." The group slips deeper into despair.
WEINE
We understand how you must be
feeling at this hour... and although
we know it may be difficult, we must
ask you some questions... regarding
today's events, while it's still
fresh in your minds.
The survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience, yet collectively are ready to co-operate.
WEINE
It may be valuable to our rescue
attempts, or any potential...
criminal investigation.
The agents, F.B.I. badges displayed in their pockets, turn their eyes, suspicioulsy, toward Alex.
ALEX
reacts, puzzled, as he realizes the Agents are focused on him...
CUT TO:
are direct and professional, with no hidden agenda in searching for the truth. Seigel and Hawks from the NTSB are behind them taking notes...
SCHRECK
You said...
(checks notes)
"Listen to me! This plane will
explode on take-off."
(to Alex)
How did you know that?
ALEX
CAMERA PUSHES IN as he looks up, nervous... not about suspicion toward him, but trying to explain what even he doesn't understand.
ALEX
I got this... feeling... a weird
feeling... I can't explain it...
WEINE
Did you take any seditives before
boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping
pills?
ALEX
No. I saw it. I saw it!
Tears well as he grows frustrated trying to convey the unique experience. Being trained, veteran officers, Schreck and Weine obsereve; allow him to talk.
ALEX
Not like a dream... more than that.
I experienced the plane exploding...
it was so horrible... I know what
they all went through tonight...
The officers remain quiet, gauging his explanation.
ALEX (CONT'D)
I'm not a pyschic... I've never had
this happen before...
The officers study him, unsure yet carefully...
SCHRECK
Did this "weird feeling" have
anything to do with you saying
you wished Carter Horton was on the
plane... just before it exploded?
Alex looks up, stunned. He didn't even recall this until now.
ALEX
No!
SCHRECK
Why'd you say it?
He considers, owing them an explanation. The he realizes...
ALEX
Because... I... never thought it
would really happen.
Weine leans foward...
WEINE
If that's the case, Alex... why did
you really get off the plane?
CAMERA INCHES IN as Alex considers, confused, emotional...
CUT TO:
CAMERA CONTINUES THE MOVE on Tod... as if just realizing...
TOD
My brother... told me to keep an eye
on Alex. He stayed... and I went to
make sure Alex was okay.
(a whisper)
He told me to get off the plane.
displaying a similar sickened expression as Tod...
MS. LEWTON
Larry Murnau told me to get back
on... but I told him to go.
(pause, guiltily)
I sent him back on the plane.
WEINE
No one forced you to get off the
plane. You told us you aren't friends
with any that did... so, why did you
leave the airplane?
CLEAR RIVERS
CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up. With total resolve...
CLEAR
Because I saw and I heard Alex.
And... I believed him.
CUT TO:
The surviviors have all returned to the room. They may be a group, but they are alone with their thoughts. The door is opened by Ms. Whale.
Alex's Mother and Father lead by a group of parents into the room. Each moves with grief, yet relief, to their child.
Barbara Browning grabs hold of Alex and holds him tight. The mother begins to cry. Ken Browning, eyes welling with tears, grabs his son's hand and squeezes. Alex does not cry. While holding his mother, he watches the others.
ALEX'S POV - CARTER AND TERRY
Their parents are concerned, but do not demonstratively show affection. Carter appears as if he wants to hug his MOTHER, but he can't bring himself to betray his self-image.
ALEX
his eyes moves toward...
CLEAR RIVERS
alone, hurt that no one has come to take her home.
ALEX
his eyes find...
TOD AND HIS FATHER
JERRY WAGGNER holds his son, both of them releasing anguished tears. Through his grief, however, Jerry stares at Alex with an expression of anger and accusation.
ALEX
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he holds his mother tightly. OVERLAPPING... A CRACK OF THUNDER!
CUT TO:
Alex sits in the back against the door, looking out the window at the storm. Clear Rivers is pressed against the other door. Everyone is slient. Outside, the STORM angrily rages.
Alex is unaware that Clear is watching him, searching for some answer that she will not now find. She looks up.
CLEAR
Here's good.
The car pulls over.
CLEAR
Thank you for the ride.
She opens the door and flashes one more look at Alex, but he appears unaware. She exits the car and as the door SHUTS...
CUT TO:
The room is empty, but the CAMERA is SLOWLY MOVING, as if ITSELF a PRESENCE. O.S., FOOTSTEPS move up the stairs. Alex appears, his parents behind him. He clicks on the light, sending a soft, safe, orange glow across the room.
ALEX
stands in the threshold of the doorway. His mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder.
ALEX'S POV - PENNANT
Mt. Abraham High School Fighting Colonials.
ALEX
and now, the tears arrive. He begins crying, SOBBING, as his mother and father hold him. O.S., OUTSIDE... lighting FLASHES... THUNDER RUMBLES...
CUT TO:
CNN broadcasts video footage of the disaster. Seat cushions and personal belongings float in the harsh floodlights.
LIVING ROOM
It is late and dark. Only the pale light of the TV spills across the living room. Ken and Barbara have fellen asleep, but their son remains awake.
Alex's red eyes are locked on the screen, mortified. O.S., a VICIOUS CRACK of LIGHTNING and immediate THUNDER... as if calling Alex to the window. He remains fixed on the TV.
ALEX'S POV - TV
An image of Hell as jet fuel burns on the ocean. O.S., as if furious at the slight, THUNDER BANGS...
ALEX
He turns, stands... and moves to the picture window, pulling the curtains aside as CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM...
ALEX'S POV - THE STORM
It is as if Nature is angry. Lightning BOLTS spiderweb across the sky. THUNDER BOOMS.
A shard of lightning breaks across the front yard. Oddly, it does not make contact. In the split-second strobe of lightning flash, the bolt abstractly appears as if it were a hand pointing directly at Alex.
ALEX
horrified, lurches away from the window, considering what he has seen. Just felt on the ROAR OF THUNDER...
CUT TO BLACK:
Over black:
MINISTER (V.O.)
Thirty-nine days have passed since
we've lost our thirty-nine loved ones,
friends, and teachers.
FADE IN:
A lone light glows. Jerry Waggner has fallen asleep, perhaps passed out, reclined in "dad's chair." Tod's mother is asleep on the sofa, balls of tissue on the floor. Tod enters the room and stares sadly at his parents...
Tod picks up a glass and swigs the remainder of his father's scotch before moving off and climbing the stairs.
CUT TO:
swivels as it distributes its breeze.
ALEX
sits at his desk, dark circles beneath his eyes. Swamping the desk are printouts of Internet Web pages and newspaper articles concerning the crash of Flight 180, forensic engineering textbooks, NTSB reports on past airline disasters and... REALITY BEYOND MATTER: Vaishnava Philosophy.
Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed.
An O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service.
CAMERA PUSHES IN as he sighs, troubled...
ALEX'S POV - NEWSPHOTO
Clear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and
mysterious.
ALEX
closes the paper, puzzled by his reaction. He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk. Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer. Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash... the April 1997 issue of Penthouse.
CUT TO:
Alight CLICKS on REVEALING an old, '20's built bathroom. The toilet is beside the bathtub/shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat.
Tod puts the lid down and UNSNAPS his jeans. As he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, CAMERA MOVES to the CURTAINS... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. CAMERA FOLLOWS the wind as it CONTINUES into the room, rippling across shower curtains.
As the breeze passes Tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not
understanding... this is more than a wayward autumn breeze. He moves to close the window, however, CAMERA CONTINUES as the air makes ITS way to the door.
The door is softly pushed closed by the breeze.
BACK OF THE TOILET TANK
Tod sits, back to CAMERA, which CRANES DOWN the tank, STOPPING behind the locking nut and water line pipe.
As the toilet FLUSHES O.S., CAMERA NOW MOVES INTO the locking nut, which begins to slightly rattle. Drips of water stream from the tank onto the floor.
CUT TO:
Alex flips the magazine open to a centerfold.
PENTHOUSE PICTORIAL
The model's pose and expression tempt Alex towards the momentary respite form his troubles. The caption beneath the centerfold pictorial reads, "Tymme Has Come Today!"
ALEX
considers the reports on the Flight 180 crash, then returns his attention to the magazine. He unzips his pants, then pauses... his eyes returning hesitantly to the newspaper photo of Clear...
CUT TO:
waits on the counter. CAMERA PULLS AWAY as Tod picks it up. He looks at his face in the mirror, as if behind him... a black indiscernible form, like a shadow, however, actually a presence incapable of reflecting light.
Tod whips around...
a puddle forms, creeping toward the heel of Tod's stocking feet.
TOD
turns on the faucet and grabs his toothbrush, squeezing paste onto the bristles.
CLOSE - FAUCET
the f.g. running water is out of FOCUS. In the b.g. sits an unplugged radio.
TOD

TOD

spooked, quickly turns it off, unplugs it and pushes it aside.
THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR
continues to grow...
CUT TO:
Odd how one can appear so erotic at a funeral.
ALEX
studies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however...
A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window!
ALEX'S POV - WINDOW
An OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature.
WIDER
Startled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off.
THE TABLE FAN
swivels, a page catching in the whirling blades.
A PIECE OF PAPER
torn form the magazine flits across the room.
ALEX
CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over...
ALEX'S POV - PIECE OF PAPER
is torn in such a manner that the only lettlers remaining from the
centerfold's caption are "...Tod..."
CUT TO:
is pulled aside REVEALING two pairs of Linda Waggner's nylons drying on a retractable clothesline.
THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR

TOD

THE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE

THE SOAP DISH
Tod's hand tries to grab anything to hold him. His hand slips, knocking over a bottle of shampoo.
TOD'S NECK
the thin clothesline coils around his neck. The plastic anchor wraps beneath the cord, essentially creating a noose.
PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR
He slips again.
TOD

TOD'S EYES

ON THE COUNTER
a pair of nose-hair scissors.
TOD
CHOCKING, GASPING, face turning purple, reaches for the counter.
ON THE COUNTER
Tod's hand ENTER FRAME. The scissors, sadistically just out of reach.
TOD'S FACE
FALLS INTO FRAME, suspended by the cord, propped against the back wall of the shower stall, his bluish purple tongue grotesquely juts from his mouth.
TOD'S POV - DEATH
all four edges of FRAME appear to collapse as if by weight of the darkness until forming a myopic center. Then, from within the center... appears Tod's face. Although the expression is serene the pallor is grayish, until... suddnely, shockingly... Tod's face decays, as if ten years of rot in the grave is compressed into 72 FRAMES.
TOD
The moment of realization...
HIS FEET
kick upon the slippery basin. After a beat... they stop.
TOD
As his body settles... dies... CAMERA PULLS AWAY fully revealing his lifeless form. Once behind the toilet tank, CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the floor. The water eerily retreats from the floor, slipping back toward the base of the toilet and like a murderer, slips out of the night.
CUT TO:
Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.
CLEAR
Know what this is?
She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.
ALEX
Like, um... you're mad about
something?
She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.
CLEAR
A piece of debris... from the plane.
I went to the shore off the crash
site and it washed up on the beach.
ALEX
You went there? I've wanted to go
there, but I thought it was off
limits.
CLEAR
It is. But that didn't stop me.
Shouldn't stop you.
Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear...
ALEX
Why were you there last night?
While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...
CLEAR
Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know
the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen
suicides. But they were there last
night, that means: one, they still
don't have a clue what caused the
crash. Two, they haven't ruled out
anything. And the fact that seven
people got off the plane is probably
weird enough, not to mention, that
one of those people had a vision, or
whatever, of it exploding minutes
before it did explode, is highly
suspicious. And it doesn't help that
the visionaries' friend just
committed suicide.
Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.
ALEX
Why were you there last night?
Clear turns to Alex. The two couldn't appear more different. She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.
CLEAR
Know what this is?
Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."
CLEAR
It's you.
Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable.
CLEAR
Not a likeness. It's how you make
me feel, Alex.
ALEX
I'm... really sorry.
CLEAR
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even
know what, or why, it is. Reluctant
to take form. And, yet, creating an
absolute but incomprehansible
attraction.
Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
Before that day, you were just
another suburban nothing that would
never have anything to do with my
life. And I'm sure you thought I was
some Marilyn Manson body-pierced
freak, or whatever.
(beat)
But at that moment... on the plane...
I felt what you felt. I didn't know
where all those emotions were coming
from until you started freaking out.
Alex sighs, embarrassed.
CLEAR (CONT'D)
I didn't see what you saw, but I
felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that
X-Files bullshit... but it was a
psychic connection. Why to me? Why
to you?
Jarred, he eyes her, frightened.
CLEAR
And you can still feel it, can't
you? Something from that day is
still with you. I know, because I
can still feel you.
Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone...
CLEAR
That's why I was there last night.
ALEX
I've never dealt with death before.
I wasn't alive when my grandparents
died. I wish I could know. I mean,
all this... could just be in our
heads. Now it feels like it's
everywhere.
CLEAR
"It?"
ALEX
What if Tod... is just the first...
of us?
The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.
CLEAR
Is that something you're "feeling?"
ALEX
I don't know. I wish I could just see
him... one more time, then, maybe...
I would know.
CLEAR
Then, let's go see him!
Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting...
CUT TO:
CAMERA is LOW, moving across the paisley carpet. Dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose Laura Ashley, floor model coffins and urns. CAMERA CONTINUES, TILTING UP to the CEILING, REVEALING a stained glass skylight. Outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear...
The skylight hinges CRACK open. Clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window.
Alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet.
CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. A bronze plaque identifies: "MT. ABRAHAM FUNERAL HOME. THE JOURNEY'S END. WILLIAM BLUDWORTH - INTERMEDIARY."
CLEAR
(whispering)
Gives me a rush...
ALEX
This place?!
CLEAR
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
With a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway. Alex anxiously sighs... then follows.
An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor.
A faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on.
CLEAR
Good call. Very "Quincy."
Alex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart.
From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK!
A lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red.
As Alex and Clear approach...
ALEX
That... him?
CLEAR
I think. But why'd they make him
up like... Michael Jackson?
ALEX
That's him, but... he's not here.
That... whatever... that whatever
made him Tod is gone.
Suddenly, Tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches...
ALEX
CLEAR
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking		 Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD!
asshole. You think this
He's not dead?
is funny, you fucking
dick? Tod, if you're
not dead I'm gonna
fucking kill you!
MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.)
Please don't yell...
Both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice...
MR. BLUDWORTH
CAMERA PUSHES, LOW ANGLE, INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH, an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie.
MR. BLUDWORTH
You'll wake the dead.
He flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth..
ALEX
Why..?
Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding...
MR. BLUDWORTH
Chemicals in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasm.
As the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation.
ALEX
I'm... a friend of his. His best
friend. See, his father...
MR. BLUDWORTH
(ominous)
I know who you are.
The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area.
CLEAR
They said he hung himself, but
there's no marks.
MR. BLUDWORTH
I crafted a reconstruction of the
Laryngeal prominence region with
Velvetone Surgical Wax and
Permaseal.
Clear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body. After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck.
ALEX
What are all those tiny marks?
ALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK
The wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint. At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire.
MR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.)
Cuticle lacerations.
WIDER
ALEX
Why would he pull at the wire if he
were committing suicide?
CLEAR
Why would they say it was a
suicide... if it weren't?
Because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation.
ALEX
His father's pretty fucked up with
denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with
the thought of an other accident...
taking another son.
MR. BLUDWORTH
In Death...
CAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject.
MR. BLUDWORTH
... there are no accidents. No
coincidencess. No mishaps.
(smiles)
And no... escapes.
ALEX
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Bludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals.
MR. BLUDWORTH
Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What
does it matter? He was going to end
someday. From the minute you're cut
loose from the womb... it's a one
way ticket on a trip to the tomb.
Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table.
MR. BLUDWORTH
You may not realize it, but we're
all just a mouse that a cat has by
its tail. Every single move we
make, from the mundane to the
monumental... the red light we stop
at, or run; the people we have sex
with, or won't with us; the airplane
we ride, or walk out of... is all a
part of Death's sadistic design
leading to the grave.
ALEX
Design?
The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work...
MR. BLUDWORTH
If Life is like a box of
chocolates... Death... Death is like
a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse
Trap." The day you're born is just
the boot, hanging from the
streetlamp, kicking the marble to
get things rolling. Growing up is
only the marble rolling down the
curving chute. You feel immortal
having survived school, sex, drugs
'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really
only upset the big hand holding the
steel ball that falls into the
bathtub. Marriage and kids and
career seem to make it all worthwhile
until the ball hits the see-saw and
flips the diving man into the big
barrel. In the old folks home or the
hospital you just see the big cage
rattling down until it captures...
the mouse.
(beat)
Game over.
Alex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked!" Alex moves toward Bludworth...
ALEX
Maybe there's no way to win...
but... if you figured out the
game... you knew where the "steel
ball was rolling" couldn't you
avoid the trap and extend the
playing time? Couldn't you... cheat
Death at Its own game?
Mr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH,
INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them.
MR. BLUDWORTH
You already did that by walking off
the plane. Now you gotta out when
and how it'll come back at you.
(beat)
Play your hunch, Alex. If you think
you can get away from it.
(beat)
But beware the risk of cheating the
plan, disrespecting the design...
could iniciate a horrifying fury that
would terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
(beat)
And you don't even want to fuck with
that Mack Daddie.
Alex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. The mortician yanks on a tube, REVEALING a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column. The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex.
ALEX
I'm sorry we broke in.
MR. BLUDWORTH
No harm. No foul.
Alex grabs her arm, starting toward the door.
CLEAR
We didn't find what we were looking
for.
Alex looks at Bludworth...
ALEX
Yeah, we did.
MR. BLUDWORTH
CAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved.
MR. BLUDWORTH
I'll see you soon.
CUT TO:
FIZZLES in the glass, while O.S., a PHONE RINGS...
ALEX
has crashed, watching CNN. It's a tense recline. Red circles rim the lids of his eyes. He sips from the glass to settle his stomach. Ken appears from the kitchen, hand over the reciever.
KEN
It's that girl... Clear.
No response from Alex. Ken sighs, then into the phone...
KEN
He's in the shower, Clear. Can I
have him get back at ya? Sure...
bye.
Ken returns to the living room, concerned about his son. Alex averts his eyes, stressed and ashamed. Ken sits nearby.
KEN (CONT'D)
She's concerned about you.
(beat)
I'm concerned about you.
Alex turns his eyes to the glass.
KEN (CONT'D)
Why don't you want to talk to her...
or me?
ALEX
Dad... you and mom have helped me
out, so much. But there's... some
things I need to understand before
I can talk... to anyone about it.
The father respects this young man's wishes. Ken nods "fair enough." In the silent moment, O.S., from the television...
CNN ANCHOR (O.S.)
The National Transportation Safety
Board has a new theory tonight on the
possible cause of Euro-Air Flight 180...
Alex quickly grabs the remote and turns up the VOLUME...
TELIVISION
A computer graphic illustrations the area of the lower fuselage.
CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.)
Deterioration of silicon insulation
on an electrical connector to the
scavenger pump may have leaked
combustible fluids.
ALEX AND KEN
Alex remains riveted to the screen.
CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.)
A spark in the fuel switch...
TELEVISION
The graphic ZOOMS into the area in the rear right side, nearly above Tod's seat.
ALEX (O.S.)
That's Tod's seat...
ALEX
CAMERA PUSHES IN as he listens...
CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.)
... may have ignited the fuel line. And
proceeded to the fuel pump.
TELEVISION
The high-tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane. A red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane, making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump, which explodes. Jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane.
MATCH CUT TO:
drawn in Alex's hand, and hundreds of steps down from CNN computer image, yet accurate as Alex's finger traces the path, away from the seats marked "ME" and "CLEAR." The path starts over "TOD," then moves to "TERRY." The line moves forward away from "CARTER" toward the fuel pump.
The corresponding jagged picture of the explosion back is reminiscent of the "hand of Death," seen earlier in the lightning. It is a graphic demonsration of the arbitrary nature of Death.
ALEX
is amped, intensely more frightened as he believes...
ALEX
The path of the explosion...
(a whisper)
That's Death's design.
It instantly, frightfully, occurs to him, he now knows who will be next...
CLOSE - SCHEMATIC
Alex's finger quickly moves along the fuel line. After "TERRY," the seat intersecting the path of the fule line, over the fuel pump, is marked "MS. LEWTON."
CUT TO:
ENTER'S FRAME, on the phone, wearing a t-shirt and sweats.
MS. LEWTON (O.S.)
Some nights I'm woken up by the
sound of my own voice, you know,
inside my head, goin', "No, you know
the whole French thing. Get on the
plane."
Moving boxes are stacked in the living room; organized disarray of
relocating. The house is old, been in the family forever. Dust marks the walls where framed photos and artwork were once displayed.
MS. LEWTON (CONT'D)
Everything here reminds me... of
sending Mr. Murnau back on the
plane... Right, I'm hoping a change
will help... I lived here my whole
life and wherever I looked were great
memories, you know... but now all I
can see is Mr. Murnau... those kids.
Just looking out my own front yard...
makes me feel mothing but fear.
She peeks out of the front curtains and looks sadly upon her front yard. Her expression alters... alarmed...
Ms. Lewton steps away from the curtains.
MS. LEWTON
(quickly)
Laura, I gotta call you back.
She immediately hangs up and speed dials.
MS. LEWTON (CONT'D)
This is Valerie Lewton. I need Agent
Schreck...
TIME CUT:
is watching, peeking out her front curtains. O.S., CAR DOORS CLOSE. The vehicle ROARS OFF. She releases the curtains and moves back, feeling somewhat better, but still rattled.
Then...
The curtains billow as if blown by a breeze. Ms. Lewton appears puzzled as she moves the curtains aside to find the windows closed. As CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, tensing and uneasy...
CUT TO:
Alex sits behind a table in the cinderblock room painted police station green. Sitting across from him, with a good cop tone, is Agent Weine, while Schreck stands with a hard-ass posture.
ALEX
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
WEINE
"Next?"
ALEX
Yes... see, there's this...
pattern... that's occuring.
WEINE
(sarcastic)
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
CUT TO:
Ms. Lewton moves to a closet door, opens it and CLICKS on an overhead light.
Kneeling down, she tugs on a heavy box and opens it to check the contents. Her expression warms, as if recalling a far off memory.
MS. LEWTON
Oh... mom's favorite.
She slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf, thick with dust.
Valerie places the record on the stereo and sets the needle on the album. CAMERA SWEEPS IN CLOSE TO THE TURNTABLE, although spinning around and around... the bold letters of the center label can be read... JOHN DENVER... the opening acoustic guitar of "Rocky Mountain High" has never sounded so eerie...
JOHN DENVER (V.O.)
He was born in the summer of his
twenty-seventh year...
Pleased with the feeling of a pleasant memory, Lewton moves off.
Schreck moves closer to Alex.
SCHRECK
Where'd you get this "pattern" from?
You have another "vision?" Maybe saw
it in some T.V. static?
Alex is insulted by the condescending tone.
ALEX
I didn't ask for what happened to me
on the plane. You can make fun of me.
You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to
it. I saved six lives but the entire
school acts like I'm a freak. Fine.
Alex takes a nervous breath...
ALEX
I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic
Stress. I haven't developed a
narcissistic deity complex. I'm not
going Dahmer.
(beat)
This just is. There's a pattern in
place for you. And you. There's a
design for everyone.
The agents study Alex...
ALEX
(sighs)
And I'm not sure yet how... but I
intend to break this one.
CUT TO:
held in a wooden block, sits atop the kitchen counter.
In the b.g., Valerie removes the chrome teapot from the stove and moves it to the sink. JOHN DENVER CONTINUES in the next room. Ms. Lewton turns on the faucet, pours water into the kettle. Some water spills on the side of the kettle. As she wipes the pot with a blue checked hand towel, a dark shadow appears to cross behind her.
Lewton turns. CAMERA FOLLOWS, CIRCLING as she looks about the room only to find she is alone. Unsetteled, she absently tosses the towel on the counter the edge which, catches a knife blade held in the cutery block.
STOVE
Ms. Lewton turns on the gas, adjusts it, however... the flames blow out. She pauses, nerves on edge. Her eyes cautiously move about the room and find nothing. She grabs a pack of nearby matches and strikes one.
JOHN DENVER (V.O.)
He left yesterday behind him/
You might say he's born again...
CAMERA PUSHES INTO the burner as the flames re-ignite and FILL THE FRAME...
CUT TO:
Weine sits across from Alex, symapthetic, but professional...
WEINE
Alex, you got our attention, at
first, because you were under
suspicion in the plane explosion.
Alex tenses, but Weine shakes his head.
WEINE (CONT'D)
I know you didn't blow up that plane.
Alex sighs, eases.
WEINE (CONT'D)
I don't believe you have magical
powers. No one has any... control
over life and death... unless...
that person is taking lives and
causing death.
Weine leans forward toward Alex...
WEINE (CONT'D)
Alex... can you promise me that
no one else will die?
ALEX
No... I can't. As long as I'm in
here, it's outta my control.
The agents are taken aback by his answer; unnerved by his sincerity. Weine sighs and looks to his partner, who sighs, frustrated and turns away.
WEINE
Alright, go on. Get outta here.
Alex stands and, with no urgency, moves off. He exits the room.
SCHRECK
Kid gives me the creeps.
WEINE
We got nothing to hold him.
SCHRECK
I don't mean that...
(beat)
There's a couple of times, there...
I almost believed him.
Weine considers, yet remains skeptical.
WEINE
Sometimes, you give me the creeps.
CUT TO:
Whistles.
JOHN DENVER (V.O.)
When he first came to the mountains,
his life was far away...
COFFEE MUG - OVERHEAD
two tea bags are dropped inside, then the steaming hot water.
MS. LEWTON
picks up the cup, raising it toward her lips. She pauses, her expression turning tragic.
On a reflex, she spins toward the sink and throws the hot contents into the drain. She sits the mug down...
A COFFEE MUG
ENTERS FRAME... displaying the logo of the Mt. Abraham Fighting Colonials.
MS. LEWTON
Trembling. She takes a deep breath, getting a hold of herself.
MS. LEWTON
You gotta stop this! Stop this! It's
just a stupid mug.
(composed)
You're outta here. Pretty soon...
you'll be gone.
Opening the refrigerator frezzer, she grabs some ice and a bottle of pure Polish Vodka then deliberately turns back toward the same mug...
COFFEE MUG
the ice cubes PLUNK. The cold alchohol pours into the hot mug. CAMERA PUSHES INTO THE MUG as... it slightly CRACKS, Vodka dripping out of the base.
Lewton's hand picks up the mug, oblivious to the crack. She moves off toward the living room, leaving a trail of alcohol.
CUT TO:
Valerie Lewton tears off a piece of plastic bubble wrap. She stands over her desk, placed against the wall. On the desk is her desktop computer monitor.
JOHN DENVER (V.O.)
It's the Colorado Rocky Mountain
High...
She pauses to swig from her cup of vodka.
EXTREMELY CLOSE - COFFEE MUG
alcohol drips from her mug...
EXTREMELY CLOSE - COMPUTER MONITOR VENT
... fluid drips inside the circuitry.
MS. LEWTON
sets the mug out of the way on the back edge of her desk.
CLOSE - COFFEE MUG
The remaining vodka oozes from the crack, pools, then drips off the edge of the desk...
JOHN DENVER
I've seen it rainin' fire from the
sky...
CAMERA CRANES DOWN to REVEAL the moniter cabel inserted into an electrical wall socket. The vodka drip... drip... drips PAST FRAME. Then, Lewton's hand ENTERS and pulls the monitor plug, creating tiny SPARKS at the connection...
ON THE FLOOR
the alcohol ignites...
MS. LEWTON
her back is to the desk, while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box. In the b.g., FLAMES, nearly supernaturally, leap up the walland toward the computer monitor.
CLOSE - COMPUTER MONITOR - THROUGH THE VENTS
the interior catches fire, causing an electrical POP!
MS. LEWTON
turns, holding her sheet of bubble wrap, shocked by the flames.
THE COMPUTER MONITOR
On the screen, the reflection of the approaching shadow passes before the monitor... EXPLODES!
MS. LEWTON
a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat. Blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap. Her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock.
JOHN DENVER (V.O.)
Rocky Mountain High/ Colorad-oh.
She reaches up to reflexively pull the glass from her throat, creating a flood of spurting blood.
She drops the glass and quickly stumbles toward the kitchen, blindly banging the turntable as she passes. The needle skips, BUMPS... and settles... umercifully at the start of "Rocky Mountain High."
CUT TO:
reach the coffee mug, igniting the trickling stream leading to, and away from, the crack in the cup.
FLOOR
Flames ride the small trickle of vodka back toward the kitchen...
Valerie Lewton races in, desperately pressing her hand to her throat as she GURGLES and CHOKES on the blood from the wound. She leans over the now red sink. She turns pale from the blood loss.
THE STOVE
the flaming stream shoots up the stove, lighting the burners.
MS. LEWTON
behind her, the stove ERUPTS in FLAMES. They jump, leap like a tiger, landing on her shoulders and hair, which catch on fire...
CUT TO:
DROPS INTO FRAME ON HER KITCHEN FLOOR, hair and sweatshirt aflame. She desperately rolls on the floor and manages to extinguish the flames.
On her back, on the floor, she is badly burned. Her open neck wound continues to bleed. Blood pools on the floor. In shock and moving on pure survial instincts, she reaches up...
LEWTON'S POV - (LOOKING UP) - THE HAND TOWEL
the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top. Her hand grabs it, and pulls.
COUNTER TOP
the draped edge of the towel pulls over the cutlery block. The knives spill out, entangled with the hand towel.
ALEX (O.S.)
Ms. Lewton!
KITCHEN DOORWAY
Alex rushes across the threshold as Ms. Lewton pulls the knives over the counter.
MS. LEWTON
a half dozen knives, from small, but sharp, cutting blades to large butcher knives, cascade into her body.
JOHN DENVER (V.O.)
They say that he got crazy once and
he tried to touch the sun...
Her hand trembling, her expression horrified, Lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade, trying to pull it out. Alex quickly kneels next to her. She looks at him, in shock, her eyes pleading. Alex gathers his courage, places his hand on the handle of the largest blade. As he's about to remove it...
THE STOVE
a gas line ERUPTS, creating a small EXPLOSION.
THE COUNTER TOP
the cutlery block is knocked off of the counter...
MS. LEWTON
the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle, driving the blade further into Ms. Lewton's body.
LEWTON'S POV - THE SHADOW
descends, the FRAME COLLAPSING until her face, eerily peaceful, but lifeless gray, horrifically decays... flesh rotting, worms feeding on muscle until only a skull remains.
MS. LEWTON
as Death arrives, her eyes are macabrely focused above her.
ALEX
Even as blood squirts on him from her open wound, he appears to realize she is "seeing" the moment of death.
ALEX
Ms. Lewton!
Flames leap from the stove to the curtains, which catch fire.
Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out. He quickly removes another and another... yet there is no reaction from the woman.
Knowing she is dead, Alex pauses with guilt. He looks at the knife in his hand, then realizes how incriminating this could appear. In that moment, another small EXPLOSION from the stove brings Alex quickly to his feet. He drops the knife to the floor and races from the house. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood.
CUT TO:
Tense, her eyes look left, then right...
CLEAR
I don't know where he is. He's not
talking to me.
WIDER
Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage.
WEINE
Why?
She studies the men before averting her eyes.
CLEAR
Because I didn't believe him.
The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however...
SCHRECK
If he should contact you, it
would be in the best interest
of your own safety to contact us.
Schreck hands his card. She takes it and nods. Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car.
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks at the business card.
CUT TO:
Carter checks the rearview mirror. Clear looks out the front passenger window. She shakes her head, as if "no one's following us." Billy leans forward from the backseat...
BILLY
Um... okay... drive the speed limit,
right?
He sits back, OUT OF FRAME, but quickly darts forward.
BILLY (CONT'D)
And don't pass on the right.
CARTER
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!
You're the next one...
BILLY
(nervous)
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
CARTER
'Cause if you say another word,
I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Billy sits back, gesturing, "hear ya. Got it." Clear pays no attention to their exchange as she stare out into the darkness, her thoughts a million miles away.
Carter drives. Billy rides shotgun. Alex and Clear are in the back. Everyone anxious, looking for cops.
ALEX
I can't go home. After Lewton's,
they'll be after me.
CLEAR
We're takin' you to a cabin in the
woods, it's only a couple miles from
my house.
(to Carter)
Keep off the highways, they'll be
lookin' for us.
Carter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking Alex. Finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further...
CARTER
Alright, Browning, you fuckin'
warlock... did you know about Ms.
Lewton, or what?
ALEX
Why do you think I was hiding?
CLEAR
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you
runnin' away from her house.
ALEX
They blame me for everything. Her,
Tod, the plane crash...
BILLY
Your shoe prints were in the blood.
Your fingerprints on the knives...
ALEX
I already told you...
CARTER
(interrupting)
I'm not talkin' about if you did it.
Or if you knew she was dead...
(beat)
Did you know she was going to be
next... before she was?
Alex looks at Clear, her expression asking the same question...
ALEX
(quietly)
Yeah.
(almost to himself)
When she died... at that moment, I
could tell she saw something... horrible.
The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be...
CARTER
Out of us... who's next to see it?
Alex eyes them... hesitant to respond.
BILLY
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see
the Jets win the Super Bowl.
CARTER
Me, right? That's why you're not
saying.
Billy looks out the window, despondent.
BILLY
Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool,
that time...
CARTER
(to Billy)
Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm
next.
CLEAR
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
CARTER
You have a responsibility to tell me.
ALEX
Is knowing going to make it easier?
It makes it harder.
CARTER
You get off havin' control over me.
Let me choose how to deal with it.
ALEX
It doesn't matter who's next...
we're all on the same list.
The three are silent.
CARTER
Aww, fuck... really?
Carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this. He counters with an irrational bravado.
CARTER
Then why bother? What's the fuckin'
point? Terry and me will be back
together on the other side, so why
wait any longer?
Carter bares down on the wheel, hits the GAS...
The muscle car ROARS past a stop sign.
The interior bounces as the car clears a dip past the intersection. Alex, Clear, and Billy tenses...
CLEAR
Knock it off!
CARTER
May as well go out under my own
free will, right?
CLEAR
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
The car GUNS IT through another stop sign.
Every passenger hangs on as the car BOUNCES from the next dip.
CLEAR
BILLY
Stop it!
Hey, c'mon, man...
CARTER
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's
not your time...? I could get nailed
runnin' this red light and you all
wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
ALEX
CLEAR
No!
Knock it off!
Red light. A car approaches with the greenlighted right of way. Carter's car TEARS INTO FRAME, just missing being T-boned in the intersection as the other car HITS THE BRAKES, fishtailing.
BILLY
And I fuckin' HATED FRENCH CLASS!
ALEX
CLEAR
Carter, stop it, you
Get control of yourself!
fuckin' maniac!!
CARTER
That's what I'm doin'!
CLEAR
I know what you're doing! It's
alright to be scared, Carter. You
don't have to prove to us how big
your balls are. Not now.
CARTER
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S
TIME! I control my life! I control
my death!
BILLY
Watch it! Watch it!
Carter barrels through the intersection as a car makes a left turn at the intersection.
TURNING CAR DRIVER'S POV - CARTER'S CAR
flying down the road, appears to be heading straight towards him.
Carter takes his hands off the wheel and raises them in the air, like a terrorized child on a roller coaster...
The turning car HONKS, ROARING through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car.
Cater hooks his elbow on the window and his right arm around the front seat, driving; no hands.
CLEAR
ALEX
Stop the car!
Let us out!
BILLY
I am... so close to puking, you
don't wanna know.
CLEAR
We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're
not going to quit. Maybe you are. You
act like you're not, but you are!
Carter eyes Clear in the rearview mirror.
CLEAR
So, stop what you're doing and STOP
THIS CAR! Right fucking now!
Billy opens the door and pours out. Clear and Alex are quickly behind him. Carter remains in the drivers seat.
Arms crossed, Carter remains in the front seat. As the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train, Carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile, pleased that he's shown how brave he truly is. With a beam of cocky definace...
CARTER
It ain't my time.
He cooly turns back to the ignition, grabs the key and turns it over... only to be met with the DULL CLACK of a dead engine.
CAMERA SWEEPS INTO HIM AS his EYES FLARE with tension...
CLOSE - IGNITION
he turns it, again and again... nothing.
CARTER
looks up...
As he turns away from them, Carter sees something in the rearview mirror...
CARTER'S POV - REAR VIEW MIRROR
the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness.
CARTER
as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in.
He tries to open the door... it won't open. He pulls at the door handle... tugs at the seatbelt... panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others.
CARTER
I can't get out!
A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light.
CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.
ALEX
finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach.
Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight.
He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can.
Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.
Pause... he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.
CUT TO:
A pink circle fills THE ENTIRE FRAME.
EXTREMELY CLOSE - CLEAR'S EYES
look downward, anxious and full of thought.
A HOME PREGNANCY TEST
the results are positive, two pink dots, confirming.
WIDER
Clear sighs, frightened as she tosses the test upon a half dozen other discarded tests. You can never be too sure. Outside, WIND of an approaching storm blows. CAMERA tensely INCHES IN ON Clear...
CUT TO:
The resulting THUNDER RUMBLES. A breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some Autumn leaves. CAMERA FOLLOWS the breeze across the floor to Alex's pant legs which slightly flutter.
CAMERA RISES TO ALEX, sitting in his safe chair. Paranoid and obsessively cautious, his eyes move towards the door, anticipating the consequential events. Following the path of the breeze, Alex turns around...
ALEX'S POV - TRASH BAG
the brown shopping bag tips over. Amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor.
ALEX
tenses. He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going.
ALEX'S POV - CAN
rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner. The pole teeters and falls over.
FISHING HOOK
falls, hooking a closet door. The door begins to swing open.
ALEX
is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards...
THE DOOR
Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition.
Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.
CLOSET FLOOR
a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.
ALEX
(as if to Death)
Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch.
(defiant)
I overlooked it. You tried to
capitalize. But I caught you,
you fuck. I can beat you. Not
forever, but I got this cabin
rigged to beat you NOW!
O.S., a sound. Like a THUMP near the cabin steps. He freezes, like an animal sensing danger. THUNDER RUMBLES. The light around him begins to flicker and sway.
COLEMAN LANTERN
a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure. The flame, dancing.
CUT TO:
ENTERING FRAME, Clear peeks out the window, careful not to be seen.
Distant... APPROACHING THUNDER RUMBLES as she steps away. The weight of the world on her shoulders, Clear paces, considering her options. She looks to a bookshelf...
CLOSE - AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH
A man, early thirties, holds a six year old girl in his arms, waving at the camera. Both appear happy and alive. They are standing before the cabin surrounded by the thick woods.
The photograph is turned over. On the back is marked in a young girl's handwriting, "me and dad at the cabin. 1986."
CLEAR
As CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER... considering life. Then, now and what is to come.
CUT TO:
Weine sits in the passenger seat looking through the pair of binoculars. Schreck is behind the wheel.
WEINE
She was up there a minute ago...
A figure steps into the drivers side window, from the rear. The two agents are startled as Clear Rivers leans into FRAME. She pauses, gauging their trustworthiness, then...
CLEAR
I'm not turning him in. There's
another life that needs him now.
The two agents remain respectful...
CLEAR
I go with you.
WEINE
You can't.
She considers... and understands.
CLEAR
Don't hurt him.
WEINE
Tell us where he is. Wait at home,
and I promise... we'll bring him
back safe, in protective custody.
As she senses the agents' sincerity...
Distant THUNDER ECHOES. Alex kindles a fire in the fireplace, balling up old newspapers. He begins to crumble the local news... then pauses.
A headline catches his attention. CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM, tense, while THUNDER RUMBLES. As he unrolls the paper, his expression is rocked... anxious... he cocks his head to consider... recalling... as CAMERA PUSHES ALL THE WAY INTO...
HEADLINE - CRUMPLED NEWSPAPER
"PARENTS TO ESTABLISH MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIPS." Besides the headline are two yearbook photos; Christa Marsh and Blake Dreyer.
ALEX
his expression reflects a terrifying revelation...
ALEX
I... never moved. Christa asked
me to move, but I didn't change
seats. I would've moved up...
next to Tod... How could I not
remember... that... I never
moved. Clear's seat was in front
of mine...
CAMERA PUSHES into a TIGHT CLOSE UP...
ALEX (CONT'D)
She's next.
CUT TO:
Clear paces in her living room. She moves to the curtains and checks out the window. Although it is not raining, LIGHTNING CRACKS across the sky!
The power goes out. The room turns dark. Outside, brilliant bluish white arc lights CRACKLE. Clear moves to the window.
She assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle, lightning them with a Bic. O.S., from the backyard, a DOG BARKS. Clear brings the candle through the small house.
Clear moves quickly to the kitchen, holding the candle. Outside, BLUE ARC LIGHT CRACKLES. She looks out the backyard.
Clear considers the danger of venturing out to get the dog.
Although no window is open, and the power outage has shut off any air conditioning... the candle flame whips, then extinguishes. The blue smoke swirls ominously into the room.
Weine is driving, leading the other vehicles. Schreck points out the passenger window.
SCHRECK
There!
Clear River's stands in her bedroom just as it fills with blinding blue light. Her television screen BLOWS OUT. Sparks jet across the room. Blasts of FLAME erupt from the electrical outlets. She quickly turns, racing toward the hallway.
CAMERA IS LOW, RACING WITH HER as SPARKS EXPLODE FROM the lamps and electrical outlets. She cuts and leaps three steps at a time down the staircase...
CUT TO:
A mid-eighties Corolla is parked amongst Clear's artwork. A door, adjacent to the kitchen flies open. Clear hustles through, running to the car and entering via the passenger door, for the sake of expediency.
Clear scoots into the driver's seat. She CLICKS the automatic garage door opener...
GARAGE DOOR OPENER MOTER
connected to a metal arm, attached to the door, remains motionless - there is no power.
Realizing the motor is dead, Clear takes a beat, STARTS THE ENGINE and SHIFTS INTO REVERSE...
Clear guns the small car in reverse.
GARAGE DOOR
as the rear of the car makes impact with the door...
THE GARAGE OPENER
trembles, the long metal arm collapses, falls...
The car SHUDDERS, wheels spinning uselessly, as the arm "holds" onto the car.
the screws holding the arm to the ceiling begin to pull away...
A METAL CAN
on a shelf, is rocked as, O.S., the CAR rattles the garage, trying to break free. The can is marked "TURPENTINE: EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE." The can tumbles over the shelf.
GARAGE FLOOR
the can SMACKS on the floor, edgewise, REVREALING the can is sealed tight with a cap.
Foot to the floor, Clear SCREAMS for the car to move.
pulls away from the ceiling.
a chunk of the ceiling collapses upon Clear's artworks, including the canvas incorporating a jagged piece of debris from Flight 180. The metal SLAMS to the floor, on top of...
THE CAN OF TURPENTINE
which causes the flammable liquid to stream out, toward the driveway.
An ear splitting CRACKLE. SPARKS FLY! The electrical system of the samll car erupts and the engine dies. The car stops.
Clear looks up desperately to Alex.
SCREAMS, as if reacting to Alex's death, but in actuality it is a reaction to the pain of delivering her child.
DOCTORS AND NURSES
stand between Clear's legs in the stirrups...
DOCTOR
A little more. Little more!
CLEAR
breathes, pushes hard. Alex's parents stand on each side of her, holding her hand, wiping her forehead.
THE DOCTOR
cuts the umbilical cord.
DOCTOR
He's here. A beautiful boy.
CLEAR, KEN AND BARBARA
smile and fight back the tears. Clear begins to laugh euphorically through the tears.
CLEAR
I felt him! When the baby was
born... I felt Alex pass through me...
like the night he died...
Clear lifts her head up, still battling the pain of labor...
CLEAR'S POV - THE BABY
covered in goop, eyes shut... a new life arrives.
DOCTOR
looks at the clock and reprots to an attending nurse. Another nurse cleans up the baby, wieghs him and places him in a hospital bassinet.
DOCTOR
13th of May... 4:25 p.m.
CLEAR, KEN AND BARBARA
Barabra places a cool wet cloth on Clear's forehead...
BARBARA
Exactly a year... to the minute.
Everyone recognizes the eerie, yet beautiful coincidence. Clear leans her haed back, relieved, euphoric...
CLEAR
We beat it, Alex.
Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms. The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the I.D. braclet...
WRIST BRACLET
"Alexander Chance Browning II."
DELIVERY ROOM
CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost.
As "Long May You Run" OVERLAPS...
DISSOLVE TO:
A bright, colorful arrangment of flowers is carefully placed into a vase. CAMERA ADJUSTS to REVEAL Alex's bedroom is now lived in by Clear and the baby. Clear makes the final adjustment in the arrangement, then checks the sleeping baby in the bassinet.
Clear moves to her bed with a book. As she settles in, O.S., a faint RUSTLE. CAMERA INCHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks to...
CLEAR'S POV - THE FLOWERS
a soft breeze causes the petals to flutter...
CLEAR
looks toward...
CLEAR'S POV - THE WINDOWS
which are closed.
CLEAR'S POV - THE FAN
which... is off.
CLEAR
looks across the room...
CLEAR'S POV - THE ROOM
The breeze moves through the flowers... billows the cutains, posters and photos on the wall... until seemingly settling over the bassinet. The lace trim and blankets rustled by the breeze, it is hovering over the child.
CLEAR
CAMERA SETTLES, but her expression does not reflect fear. She knows Alex is here... and she smiles, tears welling in her eyes.
THE BABY
the bassinet trim settles, as if the presence is leaving. Before it fully departs...
CLEAR
the wind softly and rapidly passes over Clear. He smile remains as the room becomes still and her eyes looks across the room.
CLEAR'S POV - ON THE WALL
is a pencil rubbing, like people take away from the Vietnam veteran's Memorial. The name... "ALEX BROWNING..."
