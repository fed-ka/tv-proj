SOUND of office busywork: shuffling, typing, arguing.
PERSONAL OFFICE is a cluttered disarray. Sheets with heading
"Marvis, B&W, Acme" and so forth are tacked to crumbling
plaster wall: It is March. Desk is cluttered with forms,
reports and an old upright Royal typewriter.
Dishelved middle-aged New Yorker looks up from the desk. We
CUT IN to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged
PERSONNEL OFFICER and a YOUNG MAN standing in front on his
desk.
The young man is TRAVIS BICKLE. He wears his jeans, boots
and Army jacket. He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette.
The PERSONNEL OFFICER is beat and exhausted: he arrives at
work exhausted. TRAVIS is something else again. His intense
steely gaze is enough to jar even the PERSONNEL OFFICER out
of his workaday boredom.
PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.)
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
TRAVIS (O.S.)
No Sir.
PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.)
Got your license?
TRAVIS (O.S.)
Yes.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
So why do you want to be a taxi
driver?
TRAVIS
I can't sleep nights.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
There's porno theatres for that.
TRAVIS
I know. I tried that.
The PERSONNEL OFFICER, though officious, is mildly probing
and curious.
TRAVIS is a cipher, cold and distant. He
speaks as if his mind doesn't know what his mouth is saying.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
So whatja do now?
3.
TRAVIS
I ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd
I might as well get paid for it.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
We don't need any misfits around
here, son.
A thin smile cracks almost indiscernibly across TRAVIS' lips.
TRAVIS
You kiddin? Who else would hack
through South Bronx or Harlem at
night?
PERSONNEL OFFICER
You want to work uptown nights?
TRAVIS
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know
I can't be choosy.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
(thinks a moment)
How's your driving record?
TRAVIS
Clean. Real clean.
(pause, thin smile)
As clean as my conscience.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Listen, son, you gonna get smart,
you can leave right now.
TRAVIS
(apologetic)
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Physical? Criminal?
TRAVIS
Also clean.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Age?
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Twenty-six.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Education?
4.
TRAVIS
Some. Here and there.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Military record?
TRAVIS
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
You moonlightin?
TRAVIS
No, I want long shifts.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
(casually, almost to himself)
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
TRAVIS
So I hear.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
(looks up at Travis)
Hell, we ain't that much fussy
anyway. There's always opening on
one fleet or another.
(rummages through his
drawer, collecting
various pink, yellow
and white forms)
Fill out these forms and give them
to the girl at the desk, and leave
your phone number. You gotta phone?
TRAVIS
No.
PERSONNEL OFFICER
Well then check back tomorrow.
TRAVIS
Yes, Sir.

CREDITS
CREDITS appear over scenes from MANHATTAN NIGHTLIFE. The
snow has melted, it is spring.
A rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre
district.
5.
Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed
pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. The
high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows
are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the
poor and common is also falling on them.
The unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against
the dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and
green lights reflects off the pavements and autos.
"When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" -
so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular
night's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the
situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and
traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please.
Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so
glittering.
The rain also falls on the street bums and aged
poor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners,
hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service
them too.
All through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if
coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner.
The listener is at a safe but privileged distance.
After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife,
CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is
assumed that this taxi is being driven by TRAVIS BICKLE.
END CREDITS
CUT TO:
Travis's yellow taxi pulls in foreground. On left rear door
are lettered the words "Dependable Taxi Service".
We are somewhere on the upper fifties on Fifth Ave. The rain
has not let up.
An ELDERLY WOMAN climbs in the right rear door, crushing her
umbrella.
Travis waits a moment, then pulls away from the
curb with a start.
Later, we see Travis' taxi speeding down the rain-slicked
avenue. The action is periodically accompanied by Travis'
narration. He is reading from a haphazard personal diary.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(monotone)
April 10, 1972. Thank God for the
rain which has helped wash the
garbage and trash off the sidewalks.
6.
TRAVIS' POV of sleazy midtown side street: Bums, hookers,
junkies.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I'm working a single now, which
means stretch-shifts, six to six,
sometimes six to eight in the a.m.,
six days a week.
A MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT hails Travis to the curb.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
It's a hustle, but it keeps me busy.
I can take in three to three-fifty
a week, more with skims.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT, now seated in back seat, speaks up:
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
(urgent)
Is Kennedy operating, cabbie? Is it
grounded?
On seat next to TRAVIS is half-eaten cheeseburger and order
of french fries. He puts his cigarette down and gulps as he
answers:
TRAVIS
Why should it be grounded?
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
Listen - I mean I just saw the
needle of the Empire State Building.
You can't see it for the fog!
TRAVIS
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
The Empire State in fog means
something, don't it? Do you know,
or don't you? What is your number,
cabbie?
TRAVIS
Have you tried the telephone?
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
(hostile, impatient)
There isn't time for that. In other
words, you don't know.
TRAVIS
No.
7.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
Well, you should know, damn it, or
who else would know? Pull over
right here.
(points out window)
Why don't you stick your goddamn
head out of the goddamn window once
in a while and find out about the
goddamn fog!
TRAVIS pulls to the curb. The BUSINESS MAN stuffs a dollar
bill into the pay drawer and jumps out of the cab. He turns
to hail another taxi.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
Taxi! Taxi!
Travis writes up his trip card and drives away.
It is LATER THAT NIGHT. The rain has turned to drizzle.
Travis drives trough another section of Manhattan.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I work the whole city, up, down,
don't make no difference to me -
does to some.
STREETSIDE: TRAVIS' P.O.V.
Black PROSTITUTE wearing white
vinyl boots, leopard-skin mini-skirt and blond wig hails
taxi. On her arm hangs half-drunk seedy EXECUTIVE TYPE.
TRAVIS pulls over.
PROSTITUTE and JOHN climb into back seat. TRAVIS checks out
the action in rear view mirror.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
Some won't take spooks - Hell,
don't make no difference tom me.
TRAVIS' taxi drives through Central Park.
GRUNTS, GROANS coming from back seat. HOOKER and JOHN going
at it in back seat. He's having a hard time and she's
probably trying to get him to come off manually.
JOHN (O.S.)
Oh baby, baby.
PROSTITUTE (O.S.)
(forceful)
Come on.
8.
TRAVIS stares blankly ahead.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS' APARTMENT.
indicating this is not a new scene.
TRAVIS is sitting at plain table writing. He wears shirt,
jeans, boots.
An unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent
coffee can ash tray.
CLOSE UP of notebook. It is a plain lined dimestore notebook
and the words TRAVIS is writing with a stubby pencil are
those he is saying.
The columns are straight, disciplined.
Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. The
handwriting is jagged.
CAMERA continues to PAN, examining TRAVIS' apartment. It is
unusual, to say the least:
A ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. The floor
is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets
maps and pornography.
The pornography is of the sort that
looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos
of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and
clothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety
chair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright
melon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like
a Vietnamese flag. Indecipherable words, figures, numbers
are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. Ragged black wires
dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
They're all animals anyway. All the
animals come out at night: Whores,
skunk pussies, buggers, queens,
fairies, dopers, junkies, sick,
venal.
(a beat)
Someday a real rain will come and
wash all this scum off the streets.
It's EARLY MORNING: 6 a.m. The air is clean and fresh and
the streets nearly deserted.
TRAVIS pulls his taxi into garage
stall. TRAVIS reaches across the cab and extracts a small
vial of bennies from the glove compartment.
TRAVIS stands next to the cab, straightens his back, and
tucks the bottle of pills into his jacket pocket. He lowers
his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends
inside.
He shakes a cigarette out of his pack of camels and lights it.
SLIGHT TIMECUT: TRAVIS books it at garage office. Old,
rotting slabs of wood are screwed to a grey crumbling
concrete wall. Each available space is covered with hand-
lettered signs, time schedules, check-out sheets, memos. The
signs read:
BE ALERT!!
THE SAFE DRIVER
IS ALWAYS READY
FOR THE UNEXPECTED
SLOW DOWN
AND GAUGE SPEED TO
ROAD CONDITIONS
YOU CAN'T STOP
ON A DIME!
ALL NIGHT DRIVERS
HAVING PERSONAL INJURY
ACCIDENTS
MUST PHONE IN AT ONCE TO
JUDSON 2-3410
AND MUST FILE A REPORT Promptly
AT 9 AM THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT
43 W. 61st.
A half dozen haggard cabbies hang around the office. Their
shirts are wrinkle, their heads dropping, the mouths
incessantly chattering. We pick up snatches of cabbie small
talk:
1ST CABBIE
... hadda piss like a bull steer,
so I pull over on 10th Ave, yank up
the hood and do the engine job.
(gestures as if
taking a piss into
the hood)
There I am with my dong in my hand
when a guy come up and asks if I
need any help. Just checking the
battery, I says, and, meanwhile...
(MORE)
10.
1ST CABBIE (CONT'D)
(takes imaginary piss)
2ND CABBIE
If he thinks I'm going up into The
Jungle this time of night, he can
shove it.
3RD CABBIE
(talking into pay phone)
Fuck that Violets First. Fucking
saddle horse. No, no, the OTB. Fuck
them. No, it was TKR. TCR and I'da
made seven fucking grand. Fuck them
too. Alright, what about the second
race?
4TH CABBIE
Over at Love, this hooker took on
the whole garage. Blew the whole
fucking joint and they wouldn't
even let her use the drinking
fountain.
Travis hands his trip sheet to a CAB OFFICIAL, nods slightly,
turns and walks toward the door.
OUTSIDE, TRAVIS walks pleasantly down Broadway, his hands in
his jacket pockets.
The sidewalks are deserted, except for
diligent fruit and vegetable VENDORS setting up their stalls.
He takes a deep breath of fresh air, pulls a white pill from
his pocket, pops it into his mouth.
Travis turns a corner, keeps walking. Ahead of him is a 24-
hour PORNO THEATRE. The theatre, a blaze of cheap day-glow
reds and yellows, is an offense to the clear, crisp morning
air. The permanent lettering reads, "Adam Theatre, 16mm
Sound Features". Underneath, today's feature are hand-
lettered: "Six-Day Cruise" and "Beaver Dam".
Travis stops at the box office, purchases a ticket, and
walks in.
Travis stands in the aisle for a moment. He turns around,
walking back toward the concession stand.
CONCESSION STAND
A plain dumpy-looking GIRL sits listlessly on a stool behind
the shabby concession stand. A plaster-of-Paris Venus de
Milo sits atop a piece of purple velvet cloth on the counter.
11.
The SOUND of the feature drones in the background.
CONCESSION GIRL
Kin I help ya?
Travis rests his elbow on the counter, looking at the Girl.
He is obviously trying to be friendly - no easy task for him.
God knows he needs a friend.
TRAVIS
What is your name? My name is Travis.
CONCESSION GIRL
Awh, come off it, Pal.
TRAVIS
No, I'm serious, really...
CONCESSION GIRL
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh?
That what you want?
CONCESSION GIRL
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a
big Coca-Cola - without ice - and a
large buttered popcorn, and...
(pointing)
... some of them chocolate covered
malted milk balls... and ju-jukes,
a box. They last.
CONCESSION GIRL
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't
have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal
Crown Cola.
TRAVIS
That's fine.
CONCESSION GIRL
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Travis lays two dollar bills on the counter.
Slight TIMECUT to Travis sitting in theatre, drinking his
Royal Crown Cola, eating his popcorn and milk balls. His
eyes are fixed on the screen. A MALE VOICE emanates from the
screen:
MALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.)
Come here, bitch. I'm gonna split
you in half.
12.
Male Voice yields to Travis' monotone narration.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Twelve hours of work and I still
cannot sleep. The days dwindle on
forever and do not end.
FADE TO:
He lies on his mattress at the ceiling. He is fully clothed
and appears deep in thought.
Near his mattress rest several medications: A large bottle
of vitamin pills, two smaller bottles of pills, a bottle of
peach-flavored brandy.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
All my life needed was a sense of
direction, a sense of someplace to
go. I do not believe one should
devote his life to morbid self-
attention, but should become a
person like other people.
ANOTHER DAY - LATE AFTERNOON
Travis' taxi is driving down Broadway with the "Off Duty"
sign on.
POV TRACKING SHOT down Broadway. CAMERA stops at Palantine
Campaign Headquarters. A few WORKERS remain in the office.
Betsy's desk is vacant.
FIFTH AVENUE - THE SAME AFTERNOON
CAMERA TRACKS with crowded mass of MANHATTANITES as they
ooze through the sidewalks toward their various destination.
Individuals are indiscernible: It is simply a congested mass.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I first saw her at Palantine
Campaign Headquarters at 58th and
Broadway. She was wearing a yellow
dress, answering the phone at her
desk.
17.
Suddenly: Cut of the congested human mass, IN SLOWING
MOTION, appears the slender figure of BETSY in a stylish
yellow dress. The crowd parts like the Red Sea, and there
she is: Walking all alone, untouched by the crowd, suspended
in space and time.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
She appeared like an angel out of
this open sewer. Out of this filthy
mass. She is alone: They cannot
touch her.
He is at the table, writing in his diary.
CLOSEUP - His stubby pencil rests on the word "her".
CUT TO:
It is 3:30 IN THE MORNING in a bacon-shaped all night WEST
SIDE REATAURANT. The thick smell hangs in the air - fried
grease, smoke, sweat, regurgitated wine.
Whatever doesn't flush away in New York at night turns up in
places like this. A burly grease-stained COOK stands over
the grill. A JUNKIE shuffles from one side of the door to
another. Slouched over the small four-person formica tables
are several WELL-DRESSED BLACKS (too well-dressed for this
time and place), a cluster of STREET PEOPLE and a lost OLD
COOT who hangs onto his cup of coffee as if it were his last
possession.
The restaurant, brightly lit, perfectly conveys the image
urban plasticity - without the slightest hint of an
accompanying cleanliness.
Toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies: WIZARD,
a worn man about fifty, DOUGH-BOY, younger family man,
CHARLIE T., fourtyish Black.
Wizard is telling Dough-Boy a story. Charlie T., his elbows
popped against table top, is not listening. He stares
silently down at a plate of cold scrambled eggs and a Racing
Forum. His eyes may not be open.
WIZARD
First she did her make-up. You
know, I hate it when they do that.
I mean she does the whole works,
the mascara, the eye-shadow, the
lipstick, the rouge...
18.
DOUGH-BOY
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
WIZARD
The kind with a brush.
Travis appears at the door. He has to push aside the JUNKIES
to enter without making physical contact - something Travis
would not relish. He may be repulsed with these people and
this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his
feelings rise to the surface.
Wizard gives Travis a perfunctory wave.
WIZARD
Travis.
TRAVIS
Hey Wizard.
Travis straddles a seat at the table. Dough-Boy gives Travis
something between a wink and an eye-twitch saying:
DOUGH-BOY
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses
it,
WIZARD
(ironic)
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Travis shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee.
WIZARD
(continuing)
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she
used it. And then the spray perfume.
You know, the real sweat kind -
and, on top of that, get this,
right when we're crossing the Tri-
boro bridge - she changes her
pantyhose!
DOUGH-BOY
No.
Travis turns his head. He appears not to be interested, but
is.
WIZARD
Yeah.
DOUGH-BOY
Could you see anything?
19.
WIZARD
Well, she was trying to keep her
skirt down, sort of, you know. But
it was pretty obvious what she was
doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush
hour and the traffic's practically
standing still.
DOUGH-BOY
What did you do?
WIZARD
Threw on the emergency, jumped the
seat and fucked her brains out -
What do you think!
(they laugh)
What do I have to do? Draw you a
picture?
DOUGH-BOY
Yeah.
WIZARD
What was I supposed to do? I was
watching in the rear view. You
know, just checkin' traffic.
(to Travis)
So howsit?
TRAVIS
(w/o inflection)
Some fleet driver for Bell just cut
up. Just heard it on the radio.
DOUGH-BOY
Stick up?
A WAITRESS brings Travis' coffee and a glass of water. He
asks for a cheeseburger.
WIZARD
Sure. What do you think? She wanted
to get out of the cab. I said
"Look, you're in the middle of the
fucking bridge..."
DOUGH-BOY
You said that?
WIZARD
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're
on a bridge..."
20.
DOUGH-BOY
And what happened?
Travis awaits Wizard's answer.
WIZARD
She stayed in the cab, what's she
gonna do? but she stiffed me. A
real skunk.
DOUGH-BOY
A real skunk.
Wizard realizes Travis and Dough-Boy may not have met.
WIZARD
(paternal)
Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie
T.?
Charlie T. nods sleepily. Travis indicates he knows Dough-Boy.
DOUGH-BOY
Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
(laughs)
WIZARD
We call him Dough-Boy cause he
likes the dollars. He'll chase a
buck straight into Jersey.
DOUGH-BOY
Look who's talking?
(gestures around table)
Who else would stay up all night to
catch the morning rush hour?
Travis sips his coffee. Charlie T.'s eyelids slip shut.
WIZARD
(to Travis)
So howsit?
TRAVIS
(w/o inflection)
Some fleet driver for Bell just got
cut up.
Just heard it on the radio.
DOUGH-BOY
Stick up?
21.
TRAVIS
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut
have his ear off.
DOUGH-BOY
Where.
TRAVIS
In the jungle. 122nd.
Travis' eyes turn toward the restaurant's other patrons.
POV: THREE STREET PEOPLE sitting at a table. One GUY,
stoned, stares straight ahead. A raggedly attractive GIRL
rest her head on the shoulder of the other, a heavily
bearded YOUNG MAN with a headband.
They kiss and tease each
other, momentarily lost in their separate world.
Travis watches the hippie couple closely, his feeling
sharply divided between cultural contempt and morose jealousy.
Why should these people enjoy the love and intimacy that has
always eluded him? He must enjoy these schizoid emotions,
because his eyes dwell on the couple.
DOUGH-BOY
(changing the subject)
You run all over town, don't you,
Travis?
WIZARD
(referring to 122nd St.)
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what
it is.
Travis turns back to his companions.
TRAVIS
Huh?
DOUGH-BOY
I mean, you handle some pretty
rough traffic, huh?
TRAVIS
(catching on)
I have.
DOUGH-BOY
You carry a piece? You need one?
TRAVIS
Nah.
(a beat)
I suppose not.
22.
Waitress slaps down smudge-marked glass of water, and a
cheeseburger plate that looks more like a shrunken head on a
serving platter.
DOUGH-BOY
Well, you ever need one, I know a
feller that kin getcha a real nice
deal. Lotsa shit around.
WIZARD
The cops and company raise hell
they find out.
Travis drops two Alka-Seltzer into his glass of water.
DOUGH-BOY
Truck drivers bring up Harlem
Specials that blow up in your hand.
But this guy don't deal no shit.
Just quality. If you ever need
anything, I can put you in touch.
WIZARD
For a fee.
DOUGH-BOY
For a fee.
WIZARD
I never use mine. But it's a good
thing to have. Just as a threat.
DOUGH-BOY
(getting up)
well, if there's this many hackies
inside, there must be lots of hares
outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
WIZARD
What ya gonna do with all that
money, Dough-Boy?
DOUGH-BOY
Support my kids. Can you dig it?
(pause)
nice to meet ya, Travis. So long,
Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for
me.
(nods to Charlie T.)
Charlie T. remains unmoved: He is sleeping.
23.
Dough-Boy exits. Travis smiles perfunctorily, then looks
back at Wizard. They really don't have much to talk about,
and the Wizard doesn't care to manufacture any more
conversations.
Travis scans the greasy spoon: The scene is unchanged.
CUT TO:
Tom and Betsy are talking. She takes out a cigarette. He
takes out matches to light it.
BETSY
Try holding the match like this.
TOM
This is gotta be a game, right?
BETSY
(putting on glasses)
This I gotta see.
TOM
(burning fingers)
Ouch!
BETSY
(giggling)
Oh, are you all right?
TOM
I'm great. Always set my fingers on
fire. If you want to see another
trick. I do this thing with my nose.
BETSY
No. I just wanted to see if you
could light it that way. The guy at
the newsstand can.
TOM
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand,
Mr. Asbestos...
BETSY
He happens to be missing fingers. I
first noticed when -
24.
TOM
Is he Italian?
BETSY
No, why?
TOM
You sure he's not Italian?
BETSY
He's Black, OK?
TOM
Well, If he had been Italian, they
could have been shot off. Sometimes
the mob does that to teach guys a
lesson, If they blow a job or
something.
BETSY
As I said, he isn't Italian.
Besides, I thought they just killed
them.
TOM
Don't be naive. They can't kill
everybody. They have different
punishments for different things.
Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon,
they leave a canary on the body.
It's symbolic.
BETSY
Why don't they leave a pidgeon
instead of a canary?
TOM
I don't know. Maybe they don't
leave a canary. Don't be technical.
What I'm saying is if this newsstand
guy's Italian and his fingers are
gone, maybe he's a thief.
BETSY
First, he's not Italian. Second
he's not a thief. I noticed the
fingers when he was getting my
change - the right change. Two of
his fingers are missing. Just stubs.
Like they were blown away. I was
putting my change in my purse when
I saw him get out a cigarette. I
couldn't help watching. I was dying
to see how he'd light it.
25.
TOM
With the other hand, right?
BETSY
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's
the whole point.
TOM
I know that guy. His hand looks
like a paw. An old Black guy, the
newsstand at -
BETSY
No, this is young - well, I'm never
sure how old Black people are -
but, anyway, he isn't old. That's
for sure.
TOM
Show me how he did that again.
Travis and Betsy are sitting in a booth of a small New York
Coffee Shop. They both have been served coffee; Travis is
nervously turning his cup around in his hands.
As Travis speaks V.O., WAITRESS brings their orders: Apple
pie for TRAVIS, fruit compote for BETSY.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow
cheese.
I think that was a good
selection. Betsy had coffee and a
fruit salad dish. She could have
had anything she wanted.
Betsy's conversation interrupts Travis' V.O.:
30.
BETSY
We've signed up 15.000 Palantine
volunteers in New York so far. The
organizational problems are becoming
just staggering.
TRAVIS
I know what you mean. I've got the
same problems. I just can't get
things organized. Little things, I
mean. Like my room, my possessions.
I should get one of those signs
that says, "One of these days I'm
Gonna Organezizied".
Travis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation,
than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin. The very
sight of it makes one's heart proud.
Betsy cannot help but be caught up in Travis' gin. Travis'
contagious, quicksilver moods cause:
BETSY
(laughing)
Travis, I never ever met anybody
like you before.
TRAVIS
I can believe that.
BETSY
Where do you live?
TRAVIS
(evasive)
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint.
It ain't much.
BETSY
So why did you decide to drive a
taxi at night?
TRAVIS
I had a regular job for a while,
days. You know, doin' this, doin'
that. But I didn't have anything to
do at night. I got kinda lonely,
you know, just wandering around. So
I decided to works nights. It ain't
good to be alone, you know.
BETSY
After this job, I'm looking forward
to being alone for a while.
31.
TRAVIS
Yeah, well...
(a beat)
In a cab you get to meet people.
You meet lotsa people. It's good
for you.
BETSY
What kind of people?
TRAVIS
Just people people, you know. Just
people.
(a beat)
Had a dead man once.
BETSY
Really?
TRAVIS
He'd been shot. I didn't know that.
He just crawled into the back seat,
said "West 45th Street" and conked
out.
BETSY
What did you do?
TRAVIS
I shot the meter off, for one thing.
I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid.
Then I dropped him off at the cop
shop. They took him.
BETSY
That's really something.
TRAVIS
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in
a cab. Especially when the moon's
out.
BETSY
The moon?
TRAVIS
The full moon. One night I had
three or four weirdoes in a row and
I looked up and, sure enough, there
it was - the full moon.
Betsy laughs. Travis continues:
32.
TRAVIS
Oh, yeah. People will do anything
in front of a taxi driver. I mean
anything. People too cheap to rent
a hotel room, people scoring dope,
people shooting up, people who want
to embarrass you.
(a bitterness emerges)
It's like you're not even there,
not even a person. Nobody knows you.
Betsy cuts Travis' bitterness short:
BETSY
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad.
I take lots of taxis.
TRAVIS
I know. I could have picked you up.
BETSY
Huh?
TRAVIS
Late one night. About three. At the
plaza.
BETSY
Three in the morning? I don't think
so. I have to go to bed early. I
work days. It must have been
somebody else.
TRAVIS
No. It was you. You had some manila
folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Betsy, realizing Travis remembers her precisely, scrambles
for a polite rationale for her behavior:
BETSY
You're right! Now I remember! It
was after the Western regional
planners were in town and the
meeting went late. The next day I
was completely bushed. It was
unbelievable.
TRAVIS
If it wasn't for a drunk I would
have picked you up. He wanted to go
to the DMZ.
33.
BETSY
The DMZ?
TRAVIS
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to
ditch him, but he was already in
the cab, so I had to take him.
That's the law. Otherwise I would
have picked you up.
BETSY
That would have been quite a
coincidence.
TRAVIS
You'd be surprised how often you
see the same people, get the same
fare. People have patterns. They do
more or less the same things every
day. I can tell.
BETSY
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every
night.
TRAVIS
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary
people. A guy I know - Dough-Boy -
met his wife that way. They got to
talking. She said she usually
caught the bus so he started
picking her up at the bus stop,
taking her home with the flag up.
BETSY
That's very romantic. Some of your
fares must be interesting. See any
stars, politicians, deliver any
babies yet?
TRAVIS
Well, no... not really... had some
famous people in the cab.
(remembering)
I got this guy who makes lasers.
Not regular lasers, not the big
kind. Little lasers, pocket sized,
small enough to clip your belt like
a transistor radio, like a gun, you
know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
BETSY
(laughs)
What hours do you work?
34.
TRAVIS
I work a single, which means
there's no replacement - no second
man on the cab. Six to six,
sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours
a week.
BETSY
(amazed)
You mean you work seventy-two hours
a week.
TRAVIS
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I
squeeze a few more hours in the
morning. Eighty miles a day, a
hundred miles a night.
BETSY
You must be rich.
TRAVIS
(big affectionate smile)
it keeps ya busy.
BETSY
You know what you remind me of?
TRAVIS
What?
BETSY
That song by Kris Kristofferson,
where it's said "Like a pusher,
party truth, partly ficition, a
walking contradiction".
(smiles)
TRAVIS
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I
never have pushed.
TRAVIS
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just
the part about the contradiction.
TRAVIS
(more at ease)
Oh. Who was that again?
BETSY
The singer?
35.
TRAVIS
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too
much.
BETSY
(slowly)
Kris Kristofferson.
Travis looks at Betsy intently and they exchange smiles.
CUT TO:
Travis is walking confusedly around SAM GOODY'S at MIDDAY,
obviously unable to locate what he desires.
Travis is lost among the hip, young intellectual type that
populate the store. He watches the stylish, attractive
female help, unable to come right out and requests what he
desires.
A young SALESGIRL sees his plight, walks over and asks if he
needs any help. Travis INAUDIBLY says a name to her, although
the name is obviously Kris Kristofferson.
The Salesgirl digs out Kristofferson's "Silver-Tongued
Devil" album for him.
Travis says something additional to the Salesgirl and she
goes off to gift-wrap the album.
Travis emerges from the RECORD STORE, the brightly gift-
wrapped album proudly tucked under his arm.
CUT TO:
A lengthy POV SHOT from Travis' vantage point behind the
wheel.
We see the city as Travis sees it. The front windshield is a
little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right
screen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES.
The light turns green; we take off with a start. A short
first gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases
to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares.
Our eyes scan the long lines of PEDESTRIANS. The regular -
bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies -
they mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks
and lighted storefronts.
Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the
curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?
36.
In the next block there are perhaps three, four fares -
quick gas-up through this yellow light - brake sharply -
check the action. The first: Tourist, nickel tipper - let
the next guy pick them up. Let the second go also, the
third - there's a live fare. Middle-aged LOCAL WOMAN: Short
fare to the East Side, good tip.
We pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in. It is a long
wait - a Black STREET WALKER crosses in front of the cab. We
focus on (as Travis would) a YOUNG COUPLE embracing in the
distance.
As we travel, we hear Travis' random thoughts about selecting
fares and tips:
TRAVIS (V.O.)
You work at night, you get an
instinct. You can smell them. The
big tippers, the stiffs, the
trouble makers. Quarter is good tip
for Manhattan. Queens is better,
Brooklyn is best. go for the guys
with suitcases. The rich are the
worst tippers, hooks are lousy.
Spooks are okay, but they don't
live at Park Ave after all.
The meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A
quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly,
"192 East 89".
We take off with another jolt. Cross back up
9th Ave, then cut through the park.
We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we
string together? Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but
quickly steps back again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a
$1.40 fare.
Now through the park and we're almost there. Check the
numbers - 134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40.
Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters
and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35.
The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take
off again with a jolt.
This is Travis' world: Dark side streets, garish glaring
main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen
instantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are
these objects?
Travis speaks intensely into a wall pay phone.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I tried to call her several times.
We hear Travis' Voice on the phone.
TRAVIS
(smoking a cigarette)
you feeling better? You said you
didn't feel so good...
TRAVIS (V.O.)
But after the first call, she would
no longer come to the phone.
Travis holds the receiver in his hand. The other party has
hung up.
TRACKING SHOT across interior lower wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT.
Against the stark wall there is a row of wilted and dying
floral arrangements.
Each one of the four or five bouquets
is progressively more wilted than the one closer to the door.
They have been returned.
47.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I also sent flowers with no luck. I
should not dwell on such things,
but set them behind me. The smell
of the flowers only made me sicker.
The headaches got worse I think
I've got stomach cancer. I should
not complain so. "You're only as
healthy as you feel."
A drama is acted out at PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS: Travis,
groggy and red-eyed from lack of sleep, walks into the
campaign headquarters about NOONTIME.
Betsy is standing near the rear of the office; she ducks
from sight when she sees Travis enter. Travis' path is cut
short by Tom's large-framed body. There is no live sound.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I realize now how much she is like
the others, so cold and distant.
Many people are like that. They're
like a union.
Travis tries to push his way past Tom but Tom grabs him.
Travis says something sharply to Tom and the two scuffle.
Tom, by far the taller and stronger, quickly overcomes
Travis, wrenching his arm behind his back.
Travis kicks and protests as Tom leads him to the front door.
ON THE SIDEWALK
Travis' efforts quickly subside when Tom motions to a nearby
POLICEMAN.
Travis quiets down and walks off.
CUT TO:
Travis follows Andy up the worn carpeted stairs and down the
hallway.
Andy unlocks the door to one of the rooms.
The HOTEL ROOM is barren and clean; there's no sign anyone
is staying in it. The fire escape is appropriately near.
Andy locks the door behind them, steps over to the closet,
unlocks it and pulls out two grey Samsonite suitcases - the
kind you can drive a truck over.
ANDY
Dough-Boy probably told you I don't
carry any Saturday Night Specials
or crap like that. It's all out of
State, clean, brand new, top-of-
the-line stuff.
Andy places the suitcases on the white bedspread. The
suitcases are equipped with special locks, which he quickly
opens.
52.
Andy opens the suitcases: Stacked in grey packing foam are
rows and rows of brand new hand guns.
TRAVIS
You got a .44 Magnum?
ANDY
That's an expensive gun.
TRAVIS
I got money.
Andy unzips a cowhide leather pouch to reveal a .44 Magnum
pistol. He holds it gingerly, as if it were a precious
treasure. Andy opens the chambers and cradles the long
eight-inch barrel in his palm. The .44 is a huge, oversize
inhuman gun.
ANDY
(admiringly)
It's a monster. Can stop a car --
put a bullet right into the block.
A premium high resale gun. $350 --
that's only a hundred over list.
Easy Andy is a later version of the fast-talking, good-
looking kid in college who was always making money on one
scheme or another. In high school he sold lottery tickets,
in college he scored dope, and now he's hustling hand guns.
Andy holds the Magnum out for Travis' inspection. There's a
worshipful CLOSEUP of the .44 Magnum. It is a monster.
Travis hefts the huge gun. It seems out of place in his hand.
It is built on Michelangelo's scale. The Magnum belongs in
the hand of a marble god, not a slight taxi driver. Travis
hands the gun back to Andy.
ANDY
I could sell this gun in Harlem for
$500 today - but I just deal high
quality goods to high quality
people.
(pause)
Now this may be a little big for
practical use, in which case I'd
recommend the .38 Smith and Wesson
Special. Fine solid gun - nickel
plated. Snub-nosed, otherwise the
same as the service revolver. Now
that'll stop anything that moves
and it's handy, flexible.
(MORE)
53.
ANDY (CONT'D)
The Magnum, you know, that's only
if you want to splatter it against
the wall. The movies have driven up
the price of the Magnum anyway.
Everybody wants them now. But the
Wesson .38 - only $250 - and worth
every dime of it.
(he hefts the .38)
Throw in a holster for $10.
Travis hefts the nickel-plated .38, points it out the window.
ANDY (CONT'D)
Some of these guns are like toys,
but a Smith and Wesson, man, you
can hit somebody over the head with
it and it will still come back dead
on.
Nothing beats quality.
(pause)
You interested in an automatic?
TRAVIS
I want a .32.
Revolver. And a
palm gun. That .22 there.
ANDY
That's the Colt .25 - a fine little
gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but
it's as fast as the Devil. Handy
little gun, you can carry it almost
anywhere. I'll throw it in for
another $125.
Travis holds the .32 Revolver, hefts it, slips it under his
belt and pulls his shirt over it. He turns from side to
side, to see how it rides in his waist.
TRAVIS
How much for everything.
ANDY
The .32's $150 - and you're really
getting a good deal now - and all
together it comes to, ah, seven
eighty-five for four pieces and a
holster. He'll, I'll give you the
holster, we'll make it seventy-five
and you've got a deal - a good one.
TRAVIS
How much to get a permit to carry?
54.
ANDY
Well, you're talking big money now.
I'd say at least five grand, maybe
more, and it would take a while to
check it out. The way things are
going now $5.000 is probably low.
You see, I try not to fool with the
small-time crap. Too risky, too
little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I
get the permit it'll be as solid as
the Empire State Building.
TRAVIS
Nah, this'll be fine.
ANDY
You can't carry in a cab even with
a permit - so why bother?
TRAVIS
Is there a firing range around?
ANDY
Sure, here, take this card, go to
this place and give 'em the card.
They'll charge you, but there won't
be any hassle.
Travis pulls out a roll of crisp one hundred dollar bills
and counts off eight.
ANDY
You in Nam? Can't help but notice
your jacket?
TRAVIS
(looking up)
Huh?
ANDY
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket.
Where were you? Bet you got to
handle a lot of weapons out there.
Travis hands Andy the bills. Andy counts them and gives
Travis a twenty and five.
TRAVIS
Yeah. I was all around. One
hospital, then the next.
55.
ANDY
(through counting)
It's he'll out there all right. A
real shit-eatin' war. I'll say
this, though: It's bringing a lot
of fantastic guns. The market's
flooded. Colt automatics are all
over.
(pockets the money)
TRAVIS
(intensely)
They'd never get me to go back.
They'd have to shoot me first.
(pause)
You got anything to carry these in?
(gestures to pistols)
Travis is like a light switch: For long periods he goes
along dark and silent, saying nothing; then suddenly, the
current is turned on and the air is filled with the
electricity of his personality. Travis' inner intensity sets
Andy back a bit, but he quickly recovers.
ANDY
Sure.
Andy pulls a gym bag from under his bed. He wraps the gun in
the sheet in the bag and zips it up. An identical gym bag
can be partially seen under the bed. He hands Travis the bag.
ANDY
You like ball games?
TRAVIS
Huh?
ANDY
I can get you front and center.
What do you like? I can get you
Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can
get you the Mayor's box.
TRAVIS
Nah. I ain't interested.
Andy closes and locks the suitcases.
ANDY
Okay, okay.
Travis turns to leave.
56.
ANDY
Wait a second, Travis. I'll walk
you out.
CUT TO:
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER.
The face of TRAVIS' apartment has
changed. The long, blank wall behind the table is now
covered with tacked-up charts, pictures, newspaper-clippings,
maps. CAMERA does not come close enough to discern the exact
contents of these clippings.
Travis is in C.U. in the middle of the floor doing push-ups.
He is bareback, wearing only his jeans. There is a long scar
across his left side.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
May 29, 1972. I must get in shape.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.
Twenty-five push-ups each morning,
one hundred sit-ups, one hundred
knee-bends. I have quit smoking.
Travis, still bareback, passes his stiff arm through the
flame of a gas burner without flinching a muscle.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Total organization is necessary.
Every muscle must be tight.
The CRACKING SOUND of rapid-fire pistol shots fills the
musty air of the firing range. The walls are heavily
soundproofed, and sawdust is spread over the floor.
Travis stands rock solid, firing the .44 Magnum at an arm's
length.
With each blasting discharge from the Magnum,
Travis' body shudders and shakes, his arm as if each recoil
from the giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity.
Travis fires the Magnum as quickly as he can re-set, re-aim
and re-fire. The Magnum is empty, he sets it down, picks up
the .38 Special and begins firing as soon as he can aim.
After the .38, comes the .25: It is as if he were in a
contest to see how quickly he can fire the pistols. After
all the guns are discharged, he begins reloading them
without a moment's hesitation.
Downrange, the red and white targets have the black outline
of a human figure drawn over them. The contour-man convulses
under the steady barrage of Travis' rapid-fire shots.
57.
TRAVIS, now wearing an unfastened green plaid western shirt,
sits at the table writing in his diary. The vial of bennies
is on the table.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
My body fights me always. It won't
work, it won't sleep, it won't
shit, it won't eat.
LATER.
TRAVIS, his shirt still revealing his bare chest,
sits on his straight-backed chair watching the TV. The .44
Magnum rests on his lap.
The TV is Broadcasting ROCK TIME, a late afternoon local
teenage dance and rock show.
On screen YOUNG TEENYBOPPERS
are dancing, and the TV CAMERAMAN, as any devotee of the
genre knows, is relentlessly ZOOMING-IN on their firm young
breasts, fannies and crotches -- a sensibility which reflects
TRAVIS' own. These supper-hour rock dance shows are the most
unabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium has
yet developed.
The HARD ROCK NUMBER ends, and the TV CAMERA CUTS TO the
local DISC JOCKEY, a hirsute plastic-looking man about 35.
FIVE scrumptious TEENYBOPPERS are literally hanging on his
shoulders and arms, their faces turned up to him in droolish
awe. Out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc
jockey blather. He is the complete asshole; I don't know who
is currently performing this function in New York, but in
Los Angeles his name is Real Don Steele.
TV DISC JOCKEY
Freshingly, fantastic, freaked-out
dance time. Can you dig it? Dig on
it. You got it, flaunt it.
TRAVIS watches the show, his face hard and unmoving. He is,
as the Scriptures would say, pondering all these things in
his heart. Why is it the assholes get all the beautiful
young chicks? He takes a swig of peach brandy.
CUT TO:
EARLY EVENING, about 6:30 p.m.
TRAVIS' taxi, with 'Off
Duty' light on, sits near the curb somewhere in midtown
Manhattan.
TRAVIS runs his hand down the left side of his jacket,
attempting to smooth out the bulge underneath.
TRAVIS opens his jacket partially, checking underneath.
There rests the nickel-plated .38 Special in its holster.
58.
P.O.V. down the street where TRAVIS' taxi is parked: Several
blocks ahead the red, white and blue campaign headquarters
of CHARLES PALANTINE are visible.
TRAVIS' eyes resume their watch.
TRAVIS starts the car and drives toward the PALANTINE
HEADQUARTERS.
TRACKING P.O.V. shot of row of storefronts leading up to
Palantine Headquarters.
P.O.V. passes headquarters: it is
half-empty.
A few stalwart SUPPORTERS continue to work
toward the rear of the office.
BETSY'S desk ----
Sign in window reads: "Only 4 More Days Until Arrival of
CHARLES PALANTINE."
TRAVIS' "Off Duty" light goes off as he speeds up and heads
toward a prospective fare.
LATER THAT NIGHT, about 9:30.
UPTOWN -- 128th and Amsterdam.
The Jungle.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls up to an address, lets off
YOUNG BLACK MAN.
TRAVIS receives fare and tip, takes off.
P.O.V. as TRAVIS works his way through Harlem back down
Seventh Ave.
Cluster of YOUNG BLACK STREET PUNKS pretend to
hail cab -- we ignore them.
One throws wine bottle which
crashes in our path -- taxi swerves to avoid it.
CAMERA TRACKS through sidewalk CROWDS with the roving,
suspicious, antagonistic eye of a taxi-driver.
LATER THAT NIGHT, about 12:30.
TRAVIS is on the LOWER EAST
SIDE, somewhere on B Street, east of Tompkins Square.
The sidewalks are populated with the remains of what once
was the hippie movement: TEENAGE STREET-WALKERS, JUNKIES,
THUGS, emaciated LONERS on the prowl.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls over, letting out a fare.
TRAVIS pockets his fare, but the rear right door doesn't
slam -- instead there is the SOUND of another person jumping
into the cab.
TRAVIS checks the back seat in the rear-view mirror: there
sits a pale HIPPIE PROSTITUTE.
The GIRL is, at best, 14 or 15, although she has been made
up to look older.
She wears floppy, Janis Joplin clothes.
Her face is pallid.
She wears large blue-tinted sunglasses
and multi-colored leg stockings.
59.
Her name, as we shall learn later, is IRIS.
TRAVIS hesitates, looking at her in the mirror.
IRIS
Come on, mister, let's get outta
here -- quick.
TRAVIS moves to activate the meter, when the rear door opens.
IRIS is helped out of the cab by a MAN TRAVIS cannot see.
SPORT
(to IRIS)
Come on, baby, let's go.
This is
all a real drag.
IRIS lets herself be taken out of the cab.
The rear door
closes.
Sport leans partially in the front window, throwing something
on the front seat.
TRAVIS looks: it is a crumpled $20 bill.
SPORT
Just forget all about this, cabbie.
It's nothing.
TRAVIS cannot see the Sport's face lime green completely,
but notices he is wearing a jacket.
The voice is that of a
man in his early twenties.
TRAVIS turns to catch a glimpse of Sport as he walks off
with Iris.
TRAVIS shrugs and turns around.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls away.
CUT TO:
EARLY MORNING, 6:00 a.m.
Quitting time -- TRAVIS pulls into
TAXI GARAGE.
TRAVIS pulls into his stall.
TRAVIS sits in driver's seat, thinking a moment.
He looks
to his right: the crumpled $20 bill still lies there,
untouched since it was thrown there six hours previously.
TRAVIS reluctantly picks up the $20 bill and stuffs it into
his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab.
He gathers up
his time report and heads toward book-in table.
60.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS is walking down the sidewalk
near the taxi garage.
His hands are in his jacket pockets,
obscuring the slight bulge on his left side.
TRAVIS turns into the box offfice of PORNO THEATER.
He
reaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and
pulls out crumpled $20 bill.
Seeing the $20 bill, he
decides not to use it, and pays for ticket out of his wallet
instead.
TRAVIS walks past concession stand en route to the darkened
theater auditorium.
A YOUNG MAN is now sitting listlessly
behind the concessions counter.
TRAVIS slouches down into his seat, his face glowing in the
reflected light from the screen.
FEMALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.)
Oh, come on, now, down, lick it,
come on...
(a beat)
Mmm, that's good.
Ahh, ahh, more ...
TRAVIS averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes too
graphic.
Placing his stiffened right hand beside his eyes,
TRAVIS can, by turning it inward, shut off or open up his
field of vision by small degrees.
MOVIE VOICE DIMINISHES, replaced by SOUND of TRAVIS' voice
over.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
The idea had been growing in my
brain ...
CUT TO:
TRACKING SHOT to wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT.
CAMERA MOVES
slowly across wall covered with clippings, notes, maps,
pictures.
We now see their contents clearly:
The wall is covered with CHARLES PALANTINE political
paraphernalia; there are pictures of him, newspaper articles,
leaflets, bumper stickers.
As the CAMERA MOVES along it
discovers a sketch of Plaza Hotel, Kennedy Airport and cut-
up sections of city maps with notations written in.
There
is lengthy N.Y. Times clipping detailing the increased
Secret Security Protection during the primaries.
A section
pertaining to PALANTINE is underlined.
Further along there
is a sheet reading "traveling schedule" and a calendar for
June with finely written notations written over the dates.
61.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
... for some time.
True Force.
All the king's men cannot put it
back together again.
As the CAMERA reaches the end of its track, it finds TRAVIS,
standing, his shirt open, but the mattress.
He is wearing
the empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand.
In the SHOTS that follow TRAVIS gives the audience a lesson
in gunmanship:
TRAVIS practices fast-drawing the .38 Special from his
holster and firing it.
He hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices
withdrawing it.
He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length,
tightening his forearm muscles.
He has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his
inner forearm, whereby the Colt .25 can rest hidden behind
the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated,
sending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm.
He
has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and
now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden.
He straps an Army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit
in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly.
He now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater and
jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide
all the handguns he wishes to carry.
Finally, wearing two
western shirts, a sweater and jacket, he manages to obscure
the location of all three guns, although he resembles a
hunter bundled up against the Arctic winter.
He sits at the table dum-dumming the .44 bullets -- cutting
"x's" across the bullet heads.
P.O.V.: he scans the objects of his room through the scope
of the .38.
TRAVIS stands in the middle of his apartment, staring at his
PALANTINE wall.
His eyes are glazed with introspection; he
sees nothing but himself.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
Listen you screwheads: Here is a
man ...
TRAVIS lies on his mattress, all bundled up in his shirts,
sweater, jacket and guns.
His face is turned toward the
ceiling, but his eyes are closed.
Although the room is
flooded with light, he is finally catching some sleep.
62.
The big furry animal drifts into his own world.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
... who wouldn't take it any more,
a man who stood up against the
scum, the cunts, the dogs, the
filth.
Here is ...
(voice trails off)
C.U. of diary: entry ends with words "Here is" followed by
erratic series of dots.
CUT TO:
NIGHT: the taxis are roaming the slick streets.
Sometimes after 2:00 a.m., TRAVIS pulls his cab to the curb
near an all-night delicatessen in Spanish Harlem.
The
streets are relatively deserted.
TRAVIS waves to STOREKEEPER as he walks past counter:
TRAVIS
Hey 'Melio.
Spanish rhythm and blues blares from a cheap radio.
TRAVIS walks over to dairy counter in rear of store, picks
out a pint of chocolate milk, goes over to the open cooler
and picks through various chilled prepackaged sandwiches.
He overhears a VOICE as he looks at the sandwiches.
When TRAVIS returns to the counter with the chocolate milk
and a sandwich in one hand, he sees a YOUNG BLACK MAN
holding a gun on 'Melio.
The STICK-UP MAN is nervous,
hopped-up, or both; he bounces on the balls of his cheap
worn black tennis shoes -- a strung-out junkie on a
desperation ride.
The STICK-UP MAN, a thorough
unprofessional, doesn't notice TRAVIS.
'MELIO watches the STICK-UP MAN closely, deciding what to do
himself.
STICK-UP MAN
(shaking gun)
Come on, man.
Quick, quick, quick.
Hand over that bread.
It doesn't take TRAVIS long to decide what to do: without
hesitation he pulls his .32 from his jacket pocket.
TRAVIS
Hey dude!
63.
The STICK-UP MAN, surprised, turns toward TRAVIS, finding
only an exploding .32.
The MAN's lower jaw bursts open with
blood as he reels and crashes to the floor.
There is no
emotion on TRAVIS' face.
As the STICK-UP MAN falls, 'MELIO leans over the counter,
wielding his battered .38.
He is about to fire when he
realizes the MAN is already dead.
'MELIO, charged up, turns his gun toward TRAVIS, then,
realizing the danger is over, lowers it again.
'MELIO
Thanks, man.
Figured I'd get him
on the way out.
TRAVIS sets his .32 on the counter.
TRAVIS
You're gonna have to cover me on
this one, 'Melio.
I can't stay for
the cop show.
'MELIO
You can't do that, Travis.
You're
my witness.
TRAVIS
The hell I can't.
It's no sweat
for you.
What is this for you,
number five?
'MELIO smiles and holds up four fingers:
'MELIO
No, only four.
(shrug)
Alright, Travis, I'll do what I can.
TRAVIS
Thanks a lot.
TRAVIS exits.
'MELIO picks up the phone and starts dialing.
The bloody BODY lies on the floor unmoving.
TRAVIS, still carrying his pint of chocolate milk and
sandwich, walks down the empty sidewalk and enters his cab.
The street is deserted.
CUT TO:
DIRECT CUT TO PORNOGRAPHIC MOVIE: this is the first time we
have actually seen the porno movie itself.
64.
SEVERAL ACTORS and ACTRESSES are dallying on screen in
whatever manner the ratings board deems permissible.
Whatever the action, the movie's decor is strictly Zody's --
ersatz landscape paintings, tufted bedspreads.
As in most
porno films, the ACTORS look up occasionally toward the
CAMERA to receive instructions.
Studio grunts, groans and
moans of pleasure have been dubbed in.
Action on screen begins to go into SLOW MOTION, the ACTORS
and ACTRESSES gradually transforming obscenity into poetry.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS, sitting in his chair in his APARTMENT, watching
afternoon soap opera.
He is cleaning his .38 and eating
from a jar of applesauce.
Soap opera audio continues.
He watches the soap opera without expression.
SOUND TRACK of film also SLOWS DOWN, gradually mixing with
and then becoming the sound track of a midafternoon TV soap
opera.
A YOUNG GIRL and BOY are talking in those familiar soap
opera voices and a third party, the GIRL's mother, who had
tried to terminate their "relationship."
CUT TO:
TELEVISION: The BOY is visiting the GIRL in her hospital
room.
Both look as if they've stepped out of the Blue Chip
stamp catalogue.
SOAP OPERA BOY
Is it that she just doesn't -- like
me?
SOAP OPERA GIRL
(hesitantly)
Well, Jim, it's just that -- I
don't know how to say this -- it's
that she thinks your parents
aren't... good enough, I guess.
TRAVIS, through cleaning his gun, begins to play a game with
the television set.
He places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate
which supports the TV.
Then, slowly rocking his heel back
and forth, he sees how far he can tip the melon crate
without knocking it over.
65.
The TV, still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama,
rocks back and forth.
TRAVIS pushes the TV farther and farther until finally the
inevitable happens -- the crate tips backward, sending the
portable TV crashing to the floor.
There is a short flash and the TV screen turns white.
TRAVIS, realizing what he has done, bends over, turns the TV
upright on the floor, fiddles with the knobs, slaps it, and
tries to reactivate the vanished image.
TRAVIS' efforts are
futile; a tube has broken, and the TV will not come back to
life.
TRAVIS
(to himself)
Damn, damn.
TRAVIS bends over in the chair and places his head in his
hands, despairing of himself.
FADE TO:
About 1 a.m.
TRAVIS pulls his cab behind a line of empty
taxis parked outside the Bellmore Cafeteria, a cabbie
hangout on Park Avenue South.
He locks his cab and walks past the line of taxis.
He
sidesteps TWO DRUNKEN FIGHTING BUMS and enters the Bellmore.
A LOUD BUZZER RINGS as TRAVIS steps INTO THE BELLMORE.
He
pulls a ticket from the dispenser (silencing the buzzer) and
walks toward the wall-length counter.
An assortment of CABBIES are seated around a formica-topped
table near the rear of the cafeteria.
Some are barely
awake, some are eating, the rest are swapping stories and
smalltalk.
Wizard, Dough-Boy, Charlie T and a FOURTH CABBIE are seated
at a long table.
WIZARD
You know Eddie, he's the new hippie
kid in our group, long hair...
Wizard demonstrates length of hair and others nod.
WIZARD
...he called up the Dispatcher last
night.
Charlie McCall, our
dispatcher...
66.
DOUGH-BOY
One-Ball McCall?
WIZARD
That's the guy.
Eddie calls him up
and says, "Hey, what do you want me
to do.
I'm over here at Poly Prep.
I got a girl in the back and she
doesn't have the fare.
She wants
me to come in back and collect.
What should I do?
The cabbies laugh.
Across the cafeteria Travis selects a
cup of coffee and some pastries.
CHARLIE T
This is on the two-way with about a
hundred and fifty cars listenin in.
WIZARD
McCall says. "How much on the
meter?"
Eddie comes back and says
"Two-fifty." McCall says, "Is she
worth it".
More laughter.
DOUGH-BOY
Fuckin One-Ball.
WIZARD
And the kid says, "Yeah.
She's
about 19, good-lookin."
McCall
says, "What can I tell you?"
FOURTH CABBIE
She should have told him to get an
OK from the front office.
(laughter)
WIZARD
McCall says, "Well, if you want
some help I'll see if I can send
some units out."
CHARLIE T
Yeah.
About a hundred and fifty.
DOUGH-BOY
I hope he had a checker.
67.
WIZARD
She was just a kid.
Stoned, you
know.
Travis, carrying his coffee and pastries, walks over to
their table.
Charlie T spots him.
CHARLIE T
Hiya Killer.
Charlie forms his hand into a pistol, cocks and fires,
making the SOUND, "Pgghew."
TRAVIS nods.
WIZARD
You're getting a rep, Travis.
TRAVIS sits down and the other CABBIES resume their
conversation.
CHARLIE T
Got the five you owe me, Killer?
TRAVIS reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of small
denomination bills.
The crumpled $20 bill falls onto the
table.
TRAVIS stares at it a moment.
He unfolds a five,
gives it to CHARLIE T, then picks up the crumpled $20 and
puts it back into his jacket pocket.
WIZARD (O.S.)
(to Travis)
What's the action around?
TRAVIS
Slow.
CHARLIE T
Shit yes.
Night woulda been dead
if I hadn't grabbed an outatowner
at Kennedy.
Took him roun the horn
and got a five dollar tip to boot.
WIZARD
(joking)
One of these days we're gonna turn
you in, Charlie T.
Fleecin the
hicks like that.
DOUGH-BOY
Remember the time this cat picks up
four dudes from the other side,
Pakastanis I think they were, holds
up their passports, to the toll
booth collector on the bridge and
charges em ten bucks each for
'crossing the border?
68.
They all laugh.
CHARLIE T
Hell, I know'd you to do worse.
DOUGH-BOY
Least I'm no airport rat.
I work
the whole town.
CHARLIE T
(chuckling)
It's a living.
WIZARD gets up to leave.
WIZARD
Well, I'm shovin' on.
WIZARD gets up, nods and walks toward the CASHIER.
After a
second's thought, TRAVIS calls to him:
TRAVIS
Hey Wiz, just a second.
I wanna
talk to you.
WIZARD waits for TRAVIS as he takes a final gulp of coffee
and catches up with him.
CHARLIE T calls to TRAVIS as they
go:
CHARLIE T
See ya, Killer.
Don't forget your
pea shooter.
CHARLIE T cocks his imaginary gun again, fires and chuckles.
WIZARD and TRAVIS nod goodbye, pay the CASHIER and exit.
where TRAVIS sits at his table.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(resuming reading)
I hope this card finds you all
well, as it does me.
I hope no one
has died.
Don't worry about me.
One day there will be a knock on
the door and it will be me.
Love, Travis.
TRAVIS, at his desk, examines the card upon which he has
just written this letter.
79.
C.U. cover of card.
It is a 25 Wedding Anniversary card
with a four-color embossed cover.
The design could only be
described as ur-kitsch.
A cartoon Mr. and Mrs. All-America
stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill, clicking salt and
pepper shakers in a toast.
Sentiment reads:
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
To a Couple
Who Have Found
the Perfect Combination
For Marriage...
The card opens to read:
LOVE!
Underneath the word "Love!" begins TRAVIS' short message to
his parents, a message which extends to the back cover of
the card.
CUT TO:
NIGHT on the LOWER EAST SIDE.
TRAVIS sits parked in the
dark shadows of a side street.
The lone wolf waits.
TRAVIS watches the SLUM GODDESSES as they work the section
of the street reserved for hippie hookers.
TRAVIS' P.O.V.: some of the YOUNG STREET GIRLS are arrogant,
almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced.
A BLACK MAN charges down the sidewalk across the street from
TRAVIS.
He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at
the sidewalk in front of him.
Out of his mouth comes a
continuous stream of invective: "That-cock-sucking-crazy-no-
good-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-her-
nigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass..." and so
on.
He is Out of Control.
Nobody seems to notice or care.
TRAVIS takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake-
out.
Finally, TRAVIS spies the object of his search: IRIS walks
down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND.
Iris wears her large
blue sunglasses.
TRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens
the door and exits from the cab.
Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket, TRAVIS slouches
over and walks toward IRIS.
He sort of sidles up next to
her and walks beside her: TRAVIS always looks most suspicious
when he's trying to appear innocent.
80.
TRAVIS
(shy)
Hello.
IRIS
You looking for some action?
TRAVIS
Well...I guess so.
IRIS
(eyeing him)
All right.
(a beat)
You see that guy over there?
(nods)
His name is Sport.
Go talk to him.
I'll wait here.
Travis' eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport,
standing in a doorway in his lime green jacket.
Travis
walks toward him.
Sport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a
black pimp.
His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snapping.
He sings to him self, "Going to the chapel, gonna get
married..." His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and
venal.
He could only seem romantic to a confused underaged
runaway.
TRAVIS
You name Sport?
Sport immediately takes Travis for an undercover cop.
He
extends his crosses wrists as if to be handcuffed.
SPORT
Here, officer, take me in.
I'm
clean.
I didn't do it.
Got a
ticket once in Jersey.
That's all.
Honest, officer.
TRAVIS
Your name Sport?
SPORT
Anything you say, officer.
TRAVIS
I'm no cop.
(looks back at Iris)
I want some action.
81.
SPORT
I saw.
$20 fifteen minutes.
$30
half hour.
TRAVIS
Shit.
SPORT
Take it or leave it.
TRAVIS digs in his pocket for money.
SPORT
No, not me.
There'll be an elderly
gent to take the bread.
TRAVIS turns to walk away.
SPORT
Catch you later, Copper.
TRAVIS freezes, not saying anything.
He turns back toward
SPORT.
TRAVIS
I'm no cop.
SPORT
Well, if you are, it's entrapment
already.
TRAVIS
I'm hip.
SPORT
Funny, you don't look hip.
(laughs)
TRAVIS walks back to IRIS.
IRIS motions for TRAVIS to follow her and he does.
IRIS and TRAVIS turn the corner and walk about a block,
saying nothing.
IRIS turns into a darkened doorway and
TRAVIS follows her.
At the top of the dark stairs IRIS and TRAVIS enter a dimly
lit hallway.
On either side are doors with apartment
numbers.
IRIS turns toward the first door, No. 2.
IRIS
This is my room.
82.
At the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge OLD MAN.
His face is obscured by shadow.
TRAVIS is about to enter
the room when the OLD MAN speaks up:
OLD MAN
Hey cowboy!
TRAVIS turns his head toward the OLD MAN who has stood up
and is advancing toward him.
OLD MAN
(motioning to TRAVIS' jacket)
The rod.
(a beat)
Gimme the rod, cowboy.
TRAVIS hesitates a moment, uncertain what to do.
The OLD
MAN reaches in TRAVIS' jacket and pulls out the .38 Special.
OLD MAN
This ain't Dodge City, cowboy.
You
don't need no piece.
(glances at watch)
I'm keepin' time.
TRAVIS enters No. 2 with IRIS.
TRAVIS looks around IRIS' room: although dimly lit, the room
is brightly decorated.
There is an orange shag carpet, deep
brown walls and an old red velvet sofa.
On the walls are
posters of Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda.
A Neil
Young album is playing on a small phonograph.
This is where IRIS lives: it bears the individual touch of a
young girl.
IRIS lights a cigarette, takes a single puff and places it
in an ashtray on the bedstand.
TRAVIS
Why you hang around with them
greasers?
IRIS
A girl needs protection.
TRAVIS
Yeah.
From the likes of them.
IRIS
(shrugs)
It's your time mister.
Fifteen
minutes ain't long.
(gestures to cigarette)
That cigarette burns out, your time
is up.
83.
IRIS sits on the edge of the bed and removes her hat and
coat.
She takes off her blue-tinted sunglasses--her last
defense.
Without the paraphernalia of adulthood, Iris looks
like a little girl she is.
About 14, 15.
TRAVIS
What's your name?
IRIS
Easy.
TRAVIS
That ain't much of a name.
IRIS
It's easy to remember.
Easy Lay.
TRAVIS
What's your real name?
IRIS
I don't like my real name.
TRAVIS
(insistent)
What's your real name?
IRIS
Iris.
TRAVIS
That's a nice name.
IRIS
That's what you think.
IRIS unbuttons her shirt, revealing her small pathetic
breasts -- two young doves hiding from a winter wind.
TRAVIS is unnerved by her partial nudity.
TRAVIS
Don't you remember me?
Button your
shirt.
IRIS buttons only the bottom button of her shirt.
IRIS
(examining him)
Why?
Who are you?
TRAVIS
I drive a taxi.
You tried to get
away one night.
Remember?
84.
IRIS
No.
TRAVIS
You tried to run away in my taxi
but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't
let you.
IRIS
I don't remember.
TRAVIS
It don't matter.
I'm gonna get you
outta here.
(looks toward door)
IRIS
We better make it, or Sport'll get
mad.
How do you want to make it?
TRAVIS
(pressured)
I don't want to make it.
I came
here to get you out.
IRIS
You want to make it like this?
(goes for his fly)
TRAVIS pushes her hand away.
He sits beside her on the edge
of the bed.
TRAVIS
(taking her by the shoulders)
Can't you listen to me?
Don't you
want to get out of here?
IRIS
Why should I want to get out of
here?
This is where I live.
TRAVIS
(exasperated)
But you're the one that wanted to
get away.
You're the one that came
into my cab.
IRIS
I musta been stoned.
TRAVIS
Do they drug you?
85.
IRIS
(reproving)
Oh, come off it, man.
IRIS tries to unzip TRAVIS' fly.
This only unnerves TRAVIS
more: sexual contact is something he's never really
confronted.
TRAVIS
Listen...
IRIS
Don't you want to make it?
(a beat)
Can't you make it?
IRIS works on TRAVIS' crotch OFF CAMERA.
He bats her hand
away.
TRAVIS
(distraught)
I want to help you.
TRAVIS is getting increasingly panicked, but IRIS only
thinks this is part of his particular thing and tries to
overcome it.
IRIS
(catching on)
You can't make it, can you?
(a beat)
I can help you.
IRIS lowers her head to go down on TRAVIS.
TRAVIS, seeing
this, jumps up in panic.
TRAVIS stands several feet from IRIS.
His fly is still
open, and the white of his underwear shows through his jeans.
He is starting to come apart.
TRAVIS
Fuck it!
Fuck it!
Fuck it!
Fuck
it!
Fuck it!
Fuck it!
Fuck it!
IRIS
(confused)
You can do it in my mouth.
TRAVIS
Don't you understand anything?
IRIS says nothing.
After a moment, TRAVIS again sits on the
bed beside IRIS.
She no longer tries to make him.
86.
There is a moment of silence.
IRIS puts her arm around his
shoulder.
IRIS
You don't have to make it, mister.
TRAVIS rests a moment, collecting himself.
Finally, he says:
TRAVIS
(slowly)
Do you understand why I came here?
IRIS
I think so.
I tried to get into
your cab one night, and now you
want to come and take me away.
TRAVIS
Don't you want to go?
IRIS
I can leave anytime I want.
TRAVIS
But that one night?
IRIS
I was stoned.
That's why they
stopped me.
When I'm not stoned, I
got no place else to go.
They just
protect me from myself.
There is a pause.
TRAVIS smiles and shrugs apologetically.
TRAVIS looks at Iris' cigarette.
It's burning down to the
butt.
TRAVIS
Well, I tried.
IRIS
(compassionate)
I understand, mister.
It means
something, really.
TRAVIS
(getting up)
Can I see you again?
IRIS
That's not hard to do.
TRAVIS
No, I mean really.
This is nothing
for a person to do.
87.
IRIS
Sure.
All right.
We'll have
breakfast.
I get up about one
o'clock.
Tomorrow.
TRAVIS
(thinking)
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I
got a...
IRIS is interfering with TRAVIS' assassination schedule.
IRIS
Well, you want to or not?
TRAVIS
(deciding)
O.K. It's a date.
I'll see you
here, then.
TRAVIS turns; IRIS smiles.
TOM
Oh, Iris?
IRIS
Yes?
TOM
My name's Travis.
IRIS
Thank you, Travis.
TRAVIS
So long, Iris.
(a beat)
Sweet Iris.
(smiles)
TRAVIS exits.
TRAVIS closes the door to No. 2 and stands in the corridor
for a moment.
The OLD MAN slowly walks from the dark end of the hallway
with TRAVIS' .38 in his hand.
OLD MAN stands near TRAVIS,
and checks his watch.
OLD MAN
(holding gun)
I think this is yours, cowboy.
88.
TRAVIS reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out the
familiar crumpled $20 bill.
He makes a big show of stuffing
the wrinkled bill into the OLD MAN's hand.
The OLD MAN
doesn't understand the significance of it.
TRAVIS
(restrained anger)
Here's the twenty bucks, old man.
You better damn well spend it right.
TRAVIS turns and walks away.
OLD MAN says as TRAVIS walks down stairs:
OLD MAN
Come back anytime you want, cowboy.
But without the rod -- please.
TRAVIS does not respond.
CUT TO:
Palantine, Tom and Palantine's Assistant are seated in
garishly decorated suite.
ASSISTANT
Well, at least it wasn't chicken.
PALANTINE
It wasn't?
I thought it was.
It
tasted like chicken.
TOM
C'mon, Senator.
That was a class
dinner.
The St. Regis is a class
joint.
That was veal.
PALANTINE
Was it?
It sure tasted like
chicken to me.
(a beat)
Lately, everything tastes like
chicken to me.
ASSISTANT
Everything?
Got to watch your gut.
PALANTINE
What about it?
I took 20 off
before we started this thing.
89.
ASSISTANT
And you've put ten of it back on.
PALANTINE
Ten?
I don't think so.
You really
think so?
Ten?
TOM
Those TV cameras do.
I caught the
rally on CBS.
You looked a little
paunchy.
PALANTINE
I don't think I gained ten pounds.
Palantine gets up and walks over to the window.
Its bars
form a cross-sight on his head.
He thinks to himself:
PALANTINE
(weary)
Jesus Christ.
He looks at the crowded traffic on Fifth Avenue eighteen
floors below.
It is a mass of yellow.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS is again writing at the table.
His western shirt is
open, exposing his bare chest.
A note of despair and doom has entered into TRAVIS' normally
monotone narration voice: this will be the last entry in his
diary.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
My whole life has pointed in one
direction.
I see that now.
There
never has been any choice for me.
CUT TO:
LENGTHY P.O.V. SHOT from TRAVIS' taxi: we see New York's
nightlife as TRAVIS sees it.
CAMERA TRACKS down midtown
sidewalks in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.
There we see:
COUPLES, walking in SLOWING MOTION, young couples, middle-
aged couples, old couples, hookers and johns, girlfriends,
boyfriends, business friends -- the whole world matched up
in pairs, and TRAVIS left wandering alone in the night.
Others would notice the breasts, the asses, the faces, but
not TRAVIS: he notices the girl's hand that rubs the hair on
her boyfriend's neck, the hand that hangs lightly on his
shoulder, the nuzzling kiss in the ear.
TRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTD)
Loneliness has followed me all my
life.
The life of loneliness
pursues me wherever I go: in bars,
cars, coffee shops, theaters,
stores, sidewalks.
There is no
escape.
I am God's lonely man.
MATCHCUT TO P.O.V.: another neighborhood, LATER IN THE NIGHT.
Still in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.
The CROWDS are more sparse here, the streets darker.
A
JUNKIE shudders in a doorway, a WINO pukes into a trash can,
a STREET-WALKER meets a prospective CLIENT.
98.
TRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTINUED)
I am not a fool.
I will no longer
fool myself.
I will no longer let
myself fall apart, become a joke
and object of ridicule.
I know
there is no longer any hope.
I
cannot continue this hollow, empty
fight.
I must sleep.
What hope is
there for me?
CUT TO:
TRAVIS, his shirt fastened, stands beside table.
C.U.: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the table.
We
read it.
Dear Iris,
This money should be enough for your trip.
By the time you
read this I will be dead.
Travis
TRAVIS stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the
letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an
envelope.
TIMECUT: A SHORT WHILE LATER.
TRAVIS has cleaned up his
apartment.
Everything is neat and orderly.
CAMERA PANS across room.
The mattress is bare and flattened
out, the floor is spotless, the cans and bottles of food and
pills put out of sight.
The wall is still covered with
Palantine political paraphernalia, but when we reach the
desk we see only four items there: an open diary and three
loaded revolvers: .44, .38, .25.
TRAVIS, freshly shaved and neatly dressed, stands in the
middle of his clean room.
The empty holster hangs on his
shoulder.
Metal .25 gliders can be seen under the slit in
his right sleeve.
He turns toward table.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS, envelope in hand, closes the door behind him and
walks down the corridor.
He passes a ajar door and we are suprised to see the room is
empty--and trashed.
Travis lives in a decaying, if not
condemned building.
99.
TRAVIS begins dressing:
-- He straps the Army combat knife to his calf.
-- He reflexes the metal gliders and the Colt .25 on his
right forearm.
102.
INTERCUT: SPORT stands in his doorway on the LOWER EAST SIDE
shot with LONG DISTANCE LENS.
It is EARLY EVENING.
INTERCUT: A pudgy middle-aged white PRIVATE COP walks up to
SPORT.
The two men laugh, slap each other on the back and
exchange a soul shake.
They discuss a little private
business and the PRIVATE COP walks off in the direction of
IRIS' apartment.
-- TRAVIS straps on holster and fits the .38 Special into it.
INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP walks down block.
-- TRAVIS hooks the huge Magnum into the back of his belt.
He puts on his Army jacket and walks out the door.
INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP turns up darkened stairway to IRIS'
apartment.
NIGHT has fallen: TRAVIS' taxi careens down 10th Ave.
He
speeds, honks, accelerates quickly.
The glare of speeding
yellow and red lights flash through the night.
TRAVIS' P.O.V.: PEDESTRIAN attempts to flag down TRAVIS'
taxi, but quickly steps back up on the curb when he sees
TRAVIS has no intention of stopping for anything.
INTERCUT: SPORT maintains his post in the dark doorway.
He
waves to a GIRL who passes, and she waves back.
TRAVIS' taxi screeches to a stop and parks obliquely against
the curb.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS walks down the block to the doorway where SPORT
stands.
CAMERA TRACKS with TRAVIS.
Without slowing, TRAVIS walks up to SPORT and puts his arm
on his shoulder in a gesture of friendliness.
TRAVIS
Hey, Sport.
How are things?
SPORT
(shrugs)
O.K., cowboy.
TRAVIS
(needling him)
How are things in the pimp business,
hey Sport?
103.
SPORT
What's going on?
TRAVIS
I'm here to see Iris.
SPORT
Iris?
TRAVIS pushes SPORT back into the dark recesses of the
corridor.
SPORT
Wha -- ?
TRAVIS
Yeah, Iris.
You know anybody by
that name?
SPORT
No.
(beat)
Hillbilly, you'd better get your
wise ass outa here and quick, or
you're gonna be in trouble.
TRAVIS is being propelled by an inner force, a force which
takes him past the boundaries of reason and self-control.
TRAVIS
(restrained anger)
You carry a gun?
SPORT looks into TRAVIS' eyes, saying nothing: he realizes
the seriousness of the situation.
TRAVIS pulls his .38 Special and holds it on SPORT, pushing
him even further back against the wall.
TRAVIS
Get it.
SPORT
(submissive)
Hey, mister, I don't know what's
going on here.
This don't make any
sense.
TRAVIS
(demanding)
Show it to me.
SPORT reluctantly pulls a .32 caliber pistol (a "purse gun")
from his pocket and holds it limply.
104.
TRAVIS sticks his .38 into SPORT's gut and discharges it.
There is a muffled blast, followed by a muted scream of pain.
TRAVIS
Now suck on that.
Agony and shock cross SPORT'S face as he slumps to the floor.
TRAVIS turns and walks away before SPORT even hits.
As TRAVIS walks away, SPORT can be seen struggling in the b.g.
TRAVIS, he gun slipped into his jacket, walks quickly up the
sidewalk.
AROUND THE CORNER, TRAVIS walks into the darkened stairway
leading to IRIS' apartment.
As he walks up the stairs, TRAVIS pulls the .44 Magnum from
behind his back and transfers the .38 Special to his left
hand.
He walks up the steps, a pistol dangling from each
hand.
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, TRAVIS spots THE OLD MAN sitting
at the far end of the dark corridor.
THE OLD MAN starts to
get up when TRAVIS discharges the mighty .44 at him.
BLAAM!
The hallway reverberates with shock waves and gun powder.
THE OLD MAN staggers at the end of the corridor: his right
hand has been blown off at the forearm.
There is the sharp SOUND of a GUNSHOT behind TRAVIS: his
face grimaces in pain.
A bullet has ripped through the left
side of his neck.
Blood flows over his left shoulder.
TRAVIS' .44 flies into the air.
TRAVIS looks down the stairway: there SPORT lies choking in
a puddle of his own blood.
He has struggled long enough to
fire one shot.
Falling, TRAVIS drills another .38 slug into SPORT's back
but SPORT is already dead.
TRAVIS slumps to his knees.
Down the corridor THE OLD MAN
with a bloody stump is struggling toward him.
TRAVIS turns
his .38 toward THE OLD MAN.
The door to No. 2 opens: IRIS' scream is heard in the b.g.
The bulky frame of the PRIVATE COP fills the doorway.
His
blue shirt is open, in his hand hangs a .38 service revolver.
The PRIVATE COP raises his gun and shoots TRAVIS.
TRAVIS,
blood gushing from his right shoulder, sinks to the floor.
His .38 clangs down the stairs.
105.
THE OLD MAN grows closer.
TRAVIS smashes his right arm
against the wall, miraculously, the small Colt .25 glides
down his forearm into his palm.
TRAVIS fills the PRIVATE COP's face full of bullet holes.
The PRIVATE COP, SCREAMING, crashes back into the room.
THE OLD MAN crashes atop TRAVIS.
The .25 falls from TRAVIS'
hand.
Both men are bleeding profusely as they thrash into IRIS'
room.
IRIS hides behind the old red velvet sofa, her face
frozen in fright.
TRAVIS, trapped under the heavy OLD MAN, reaches down with
his right hand and pulls the combat knife from his right calf.
Just as TRAVIS draws back the knife, THE OLD MAN brings his
huge left palm crashing down on TRAVIS: THE OLD MAN's palm
is impaled on the knife.
OLD MAN SCREAMS in pain.
Police SIRENS are heard in b.g.
With great effort, TRAVIS turns over, pinning THE OLD MAN to
the floor.
The bloody knife blade sticks through his
upturned hand.
TRAVIS reaches over with his right hand and picks up the
revolver of the new dead PRIVATE COP.
TRAVIS hoists himself up and sticks the revolver into the
OLD MAN's mouth.
THE OLD MAN's voice is full of pain and ghastly fright:
OLD MAN
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
IRIS screams in b.g.
TRAVIS looks up:
IRIS
Don't kill him, Travis!
Don't kill
him!
TRAVIS fires the revolver, blowing the back of THE OLD MAN's
head off the silencing his protests.
The police SIRENS screech to a halt.
SOUND of police
officers running up the stairs.
106.
TRAVIS struggles up and collapses on the red velvet sofa,
his blood-soaked body blending with the velvet.
IRIS retreats in fright against the far wall.
First uniformed POLICE OFFICER rushes in room, drawn gun in
hand.
Other POLICEMEN can be heard running up the stairs.
TRAVIS looks helplessly up at the OFFICER.
He forms his
bloody hand into a pistol, raises it to his forehead and,
his voice croaking in pain, makes the sound of a pistol
discharging.
TRAVIS
Pgghew!
Pgghew!
Out of breath fellow OFFICERS join the first POLICEMAN.
They survey the room.
TRAVIS' head slumps against the sofa.
IRIS is huddled in the corner, shaking.
LIVE SOUND CEASES.
OVERHEAD SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT surveys the damage:
-- from IRIS shaking against the blood-spattered wall
-- to TRAVIS blood-soaked body lying on the sofa
-- to THE OLD MAN with half a head, a bloody stump for one
hand and a knife sticking out the other
-- to POLICE OFFICERS staring in amazement
-- to the PRIVATE COP's bullet-ridden face trapped near the
doorway
-- to puddles of blood and a lonely .44 Magnum lying on the
hallway carpet.
-- down the blood-specked stairs on which lies a nickle-
plated .38 Smith and Wesson Special
-- to the foot of the stairs where SPORT's body is hunched
over a pool of blood and a small .32 lies near his hand
-- to CROWDS huddled around the doorway, held back by POLICE
OFFICERS
-- past red flashing lights, running POLICEMEN and parked
police cars
107.
-- to the ongoing nightlife of the Lower East Side, curious
but basically unconcerned, looking then heading its own
way.
FADE TO:
FADE IN:
Room appears
pretty much the same, although there is a new portable TV
and an inexpensive easy chair.
VISUAL: TRACK begins at table and works across the room to
the mattress.
We see these items:
-- On the table rests the diary, closed.
A desk calendar
stands on the table: it is October.
-- Across the wall where the Palantine clippings once hung
there are now a series of new newspaper clippings.
Right to
left, they read:
1. The first is a full back page from the N.Y. Daily News.
Headline reads: "CABBIE BATTLES GANGSTERS." There are large
photos of police standing in IRIS' room after the slaughter,
and a picture of TRAVIS' cabbie mug shot.
2. Underneath there is a more discreet clipping without
photo from the N.Y. Times.
Two-column headline reads:
"Cabbie Shootout, Three Dead."
3. A follow-up story from the News.
Two-column photo shows
plain middle-aged couple sitting in middle-class living room.
Two-column headline reads: "Parents Express Shock, Gratitude."
4. A two-column Daily News story without photo.
Headline
reads: "Taxi-Driver Hero to Recover."
5. A one-column two-paragraph News story stuck on an obscure
page.
Headline reads: "Cabbie Returns to Job."
-- At the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the
wall.
It is a simple letter hand-written on plain white
paper.
The handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear
neat and orderly.
We recognize that it is the same letter
that is being read in voice over.
108.
-- When we finally arrive at the mattress, we find it is
barren.
A pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at
the head of the mattress.
AUDIO: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a middle-
aged uneducated man reading in voice over.
It is the voice of IRIS' FATHER and he is reading a letter
he sent to TRAVIS, and which TRAVIS has tacked to his wall.
IRIS' FATHER (V.O.)
Dear Mr. Bickle,
I can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma
and I were to hear that you are
well and recuperating.
We tried to
visit you at the hospital when we
were in New York to pick up Iris,
but you were still in a coma.
There is no way we can repay you
for returning our Iris to us.
We
thought we had lost her, but now
our lives are full again.
Needless
to say, you are something of a hero
around this household.
I'm sure you want to know about
Iris.
She is back in school and
working hard.
The transition has
been very hard for her, as you can
well imagine, but we have taken
steps to see she never has cause to
run away again.
In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you from
the bottom of our hearts.
Unfortunately, we cannot afford to
come to New York again to thank you
in person, or we surely would.
But
if you should ever come to
Pittsburgh, you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma
