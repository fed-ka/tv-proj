With the LAST TOLL of the CLOCK punctuating the CUT, we are
FLOATING IN TOWARDS the shattered board room window.
The woman's SCREAM on the street below is FAINT, ECHOING,
MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN.
THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting
around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and
disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g.
At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty and
oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray.
There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak
table.
One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to
his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to
his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from
his nose.
We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.
SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall middle-
aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a
commanding presence.
He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his
knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board members'
heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately
for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader.
Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers.
Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair.
He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's
ashtray.
MUSSBURGER
Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.
The other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed.
AN EXECUTIVE
He could've opened the window.
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
Waring Hudsucker never did anything
the easy way.
ADDISON
My God, why?! Why did he do it?!
Things were going so well!
MUSSBURGER
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the
man was unhappy.
ADDISON
He didn't look unhappy!
EXECUTIVE
Yeah, well, he didn't look rich.
ELDERY EXECUTIVE
Waring Hudsucker was never an easy
man to figure out.
(reminiscing)
He built this company with his bare
hands. Every step he took was a step
up. Except of course this last one.
MUSSBURGER
Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but
when the president, chairman of the
board and holder of eighty-seven
percent of the company's stock drops
forty-four floors --
PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Forty-five --
ELDERY EXECUTIVE
Counting the mezzanine --
MUSSBURGER
-- Then the company has a problem.
Stillson, what exactly is the
disposition of Waring's stock?
STILLSON
Well, as you know, Hud left no will
and had no family. The company bylaws
are quite clear in that event. His
entire portfolio will be converted
to common stock and will be sold
over the counter as of the first of
the fiscal year following his demise.
MUSSBURGER
Meaning?
STILLSON
Meaning simply that Waring's stock,
and control of the company, will be
available to the public on January
first.
MUSSBURGER
You mean to tell me that any slob in
a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy
Hudsucker stock?
Stillson shrugs.
STILLSON
The company bylaws are quite clear.
ADDISON
My God! You're animals! How can you
discuss his stock when the man has
just leapt forty-five floors --
PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Forty-four --
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
-- Not counting the mezzanine.
MUSSBURGER
Quit showboating, Addison, the man
is gone. The question now is whether
we're going to let John Q. Public
waltz in and buy 87 percent of our
company.
PIPE-SMOKING EXECUTIVE
What're you suggesting, Sidney?
Certainly we can't afford to buy a
controlling interest.
MUSSBURGER
Not while the stock is this strong.
How long before Hud's paper hits the
market?
STILLSON
January first.
AN EXECUTIVE
Thirty days.
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
Four weeks.
ADDISON
A month at the most.
MUSSBURGER
One month to make the blue-chip
investment of the century look like
a round-trip ticket on the Titanic.
AN EXECUTIVE
We play up the fact that Hud is dead.
ALL
(in unison)
Long live the Hud!!
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
We depress the stock --
YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
-- to the point where we can buy
fifty-percent.
PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Fifty-one.
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
Not counting the mezzanine.
CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE
It could work.
OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE
It should work.
PRACTICAL EXECUTIVE
It would work.
MUSSBURGER
(at ticker tape machine)
It's working already. Waring Hudsucker
is abstract art on Madison Avenue.
All we need now is a new president
who will inspire real panic in our
stockholders.
ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE
Yeah, a puppet!
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
A proxy!
YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
A pawn!
Mussburger strides across the room from the still CHATTERING
TICKER TAPE MACHINE and lowers himself into Waring Hudsucker's
chair. He takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly exhales
a cloud of smoke.
MUSSBURGER
Sure, sure. Some jerk we can really
push around.
CUT TO:
SWINGING STEEL DOORS
that read, "MAILROOM." They burst open as Norville, who wears
a mail clerk's leather apron, imprinted: HUDSUCKER
MAILROOM/The Future is Now. The hellish mailroom is criss-
crossed by pipes that emit HISSING jets of STEAM.
As he wheels a piled-high mail cart down the aisle, Norville
is accompanied by an orientation AGENT who bellows at him
over the clamor and roar of many men laboring in the bowels
of a great corporation.
AGENT
You punch in at 8:30 every morning
except you punch in at 7:30 following
a business holiday unless it's a
Monday and then you punch in at eight
o'clock!
You punch in at 7:45
whenever we work extended day and
you punch out at the regular time
unless you've worked through lunch!
NORVILLE
What's exte --
AGENT
Punch in late and they dock ya!
People on either side bellow at Norville and stuff envelopes
and packages under his elbows, into his pockets, under his
chin, between his clenched teeth, etc.
FIRST SCREAMER
This goes to seven! Mr. Mutuszak!
Urgent!
AGENT
Incoming articles, get a voucher!
Outgoing articles, provide a voucher!
Move any article without a voucher
and they dock ya!
SECOND SCREAMER
Take this up to the secretarial pool
on three! Right away! Don't break
it!
AGENT
Letter size a green voucher! Folder
size a yellow voucher! Parcel size a
maroon voucher!
THIRD SCREAMER
This one's for Morgatross! Chop chop!
AGENT
Wrong color voucher and they dock
ya! Six-seven-eight-seven-zero-four-
niner-alpha-slash-six! That is your
employee number! It will not be
repeated! Without your employee number
you cannot cash your paycheck!
FOURTH SCREAMER
This goes up to twenty-seven! If
there's no one there bring it down
to eighteen! Have 'em sign the waiver!
DON'T COME BACK DOWN HERE WITHOUT A
SIGNED WAIVER!!
AGENT
Inter-office mail is code 37! INTRA-
office mail is 37-dash-3! Outside
mail is 3-dash 37! Code it wrong and
they dock ya!
FIFTH SCREAMER
I was supposed to have this on twenty-
eight ten minutes ago! Cover for me!
AGENT
This has been your orientation! Is
there anything you do not understand?
Is there anything you understand
only partially? If you have not been
fully oriented -- if there is
something you do not understand in
all of its particulars you must file
a complaint with personnel! File a
faulty complaint... and they dock
ya!
CUT TO:
NORVILLE
standing in front of a shelf of cubbyholes. As we FOLLOW his
hand drawing an 8 X 10 envelope across the line of
alphabetized mail slots. The envelope is addressed to Max
Kloppitt, Jr.
NORVILLE
(muttering to himself)
...Bring it down to fif(?)...
fifteen... sign the voucher, uh,
waiver... cover for Mr. Anatole...
he's a swell guy... Morgatross...
He was on, uh...
He is COASTING ACROSS the "K" mail slots, finally COMES TO
Max Kloppitt, Sr. His hand moves to the next slot, Max
Kloppitt, Jr. This slot is half the size of all the others.
The envelope will not fit in.
He frowns.
He is about to fold the envelope, but notices something
stamped in red on its face. DO NOT FOLD.
Norville frowns. As he stares at the envelope, we see
envelopes swishing across the f.g., whipping one by one in
rapid succession, left to right.
CLOSEUP - ANCIENT SORTER
An old man sitting at the adjacent shelf, sorting mail.
Without ever even looking up, with a constant high-speed
back and forth flicking of his right hand, he is whisking
pieces of mail one by one out of the pile of mail in his
left hand.
ANCIENT SORTER'S SHELF
As his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots.
NORVILLE
He raises his voice over the mailroom din:
NORVILLE
Say, what do you do when the envelope
is too big for the slot?
The ANCIENT SORTER considers this as he continues whisking
his mail.
ANCIENT SORTER
Well... if ya fold 'em, they fire
ya...
Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.
ANCIENT SORTER
...I usually throw 'em out.
Norville takes out a pencil and writes on the face of the
envelope:
INSERT - LETTER
Dear Mr. Kloppit, Please give this letter to your son. Thank
you, Norville Barnes.
After a moment he adds:
Your friend in the mailroom.
BACK TO SCENE
NORVILLE
(talking as he writes)
Just got hired today!
ANCIENT SORTER
Terrific.
NORVILLE
Ya know, entry level!
ANCIENT SORTER
Tell me about it.
NORVILLE
I got big ideas, though!
ANCIENT SORTER
I'm sure you do.
NORVILLE
For instance, take a look at this
sweet baby...
Norville is taking an envelope from his pocket and handing
it to the Ancient Sorter.
NORVILLE
...you look like you can keep a
secret...
The Ancient Sorter is pulling a ragged piece of paper from
the envelope. On the paper is a crudely-drawn circle.
NORVILLE
...Something I developed myself.
Yessir, this is my ticket upstairs.
The Ancient Sorter looks questioningly from the circle to
Norville.
NORVILLE
(explains)
...You know, for kids!
The Ancient Sorter nods with feigned understanding as Norville
takes the paper back.
ANCIENT SORTER
Terrific.
NORVILLE
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom
long.
ANCIENT SORTER
(deadpan)
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
He resumes his sorting.
NORVILLE
How long've you been down here?
ANCIENT SORTER
Forty-eight years...
Whisk. Whisk.
ANCIENT SORTER
...Next year they move me up to
parcels...
Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.
ANCIENT SORTER
...If I'm lucky.
A BELL CLANGS.
The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM SPUTTERS to life.
PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
Attention Hudsucker employees.
We
regretfully announce that at 12:01
this afternoon, Hudsucker time, Waring
Hudsucker, Founder, President, and
Chairman of the Board of Hudsucker
Industries, merged with the infinite.
To mark this occasion of corporate
loss, we ask that all employees
observe a moment of silent
contemplation.
All HUBBUB ABRUPTLY STOPS and the sounds of HEAVY MACHINERY,
HISSING STEAM PIPES, and GENERATORS WIND DOWN TO leave total
SILENCE. After a moment:
PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
...Thank you for your kind attention.
This moment has been duly-noted on
your time cards and will be deducted
from your pay. That is all.
The MACHINERY GROANS back INTO ACTION and the people return
to their jobs just as:
A STEAM WHISTLE SCREECHES.
ALARM BELLS go OFF.
From the PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM:
PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
'Blue letter! Blue letter!'
The mail room is thrown into pandemonium.
VARIOUS VOICES
Blue letter...! It's a blue letter...!
They're bringing down a blue letter!
One MAN spins to face the CAMERA, his hands pressed over his
ears. STEAM JETS and HISSES behind him.
MAN
Blue letter!!
Animated for the first time:
ANCIENT SORTER
Jumpin' Jehosephat, a blue letter!
Mail carts and other paraphernalia are abruptly swept out of
the crowded aisle to form a clear path running down to an
elevator in the b.g.
With a SIREN SOUND, a light above the elevator goes on.
The elevator door sweeps open. It reveals a wall into which
a four-foot high hinged door is set.
This door swings open and an old dwarf emerges: Old man
HUTCHINSON, the boss of the mailroom. He emerges from the
blinding light of the interior of the elevator.
He is holding aloft a letter.
He takes loping drawf strides down the aisle.
CLOSEUP - LETTER
TRACKING ON letter as Hutchinson bears it along. In the b.g.,
the faces that the letter passes are agog.
CROSSCUT the approaching blue letter WITH: Norville and the
Ancient Sorter.
BACK TO SCENE
The Ancient Sorter is leaning over to whisper into Norville's
ear.
ANCIENT SORTER
It's a blue letter... top, top
level... confidential communication
between the brass... usually bad
news... they hate blue letters
upstairs... Hate 'em!
Norville gulps.
HUTCHINSON
You!
Norville looks over his shoulder, but the Ancient Sorter has
disappeared.
HUTCHINSON
...Yeah, you! Barnes!
As he points, the people around Norville shrink away.
HUTCHINSON
...You don't look busy! Think you
can handle a blue letter?
(laughs sadistically)
...This letter was sent down this
morning by the big guy himself! 'At's
right, Waring Hudsucker! It's
addressed to Sid Mussburger!
Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a
blue letter! That means you put it
right in Mussburger's hand. No
secretaries! No receptionists! No
colleagues! No excuses!
DRAMATIC TRACK IN ON Norville. As Hutchinson talks, he thrusts
the blue letter into Norville's face. Norville looks at it
with terrific apprehension. As Hutchinson's speech ends, we
are TIGHT ON Norville's sweating face.
COMPLEMENTARY TIGHT DUTCH ANGLE ON HUTCHINSON
We can see the veins in his eyes, the veins in his nose, the
hairs in his ears.
HUTCHINSON
Mussburger!!
CUT TO:
ELEVATOR DOORS
ROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator
who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform,
white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched
onto his breast pocket.
As Norville enters the elevators:
BUZZ
Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got
the fuzz...
He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then
lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his
head.
BUZZ
...I make the elevator do what she
duzz!
He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he
snaps it away and pats down his crewcut:
BUZZ
...Hang it up to dry.
He cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR. Norville's
knees buckle under a huge upward surge; Buzz is accustomed
to it.
BUZZ
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
NORVILLE
(regaining his balance)
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
BUZZ
Forty-four, the top brass floor say,
buddy! What takes fifty years to get
up to the top floor and thirty seconds
to get down?
NORVILLE
I --
BUZZ
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Say, buddy!
With a powerful DOWN-SHIFTING SOUND, Buzz brakes the elevator
to a sharp halt. Norville continues upward with the inertia,
painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator.
Buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter.
BUZZ
Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell,
personnel. Mr. Levin, thirty-seven.
MR. LEVIN
Thirty-six.
BUZZ
Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen,
step to the rear; here comes
gargantuan Mr. Grier.
An obese MAN enters, smoking a cigar:
FAT MAN
Buzz.
Buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator
into its power-rise. Norville, bracing himself now, sinks
only a little under the G-force.
BUZZ
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid
businessman on the street?
NORVILLE
Well, I --
BUZZ
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk
fully dressed? When it's 'wearing'
Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
He turns to look at Norville.
BUZZ
...Ya get it, buddy, it's a pun,
it's a knee-slapper, it's a play on
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a
blue letter?!
All heads in the elevator turn, aghast, to look, and those
near Norville shrink away.
BUZZ
...Cripes a'mighty, whyn't ya tell a
guy?! Hold on, folks, we're express
to the top floor!
The ELEVATOR SCREAMS into overdrive and we:
CUT TO:
ELEVATOR DOORS
Sweeping open. Norville staggers out.
BUZZ
(hissing)
Good luck, buddy!
The door sweeps shut. Norville looks nervously around.
Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again.
BUZZ
-- You'll need it!
The elevator doors slam shut and we hear its ENGINES SCREAM
as it power-dives away.
Norville turns toward the executive offices.
Plush, thick-carpeted silence.
Norville starts walking.
A SCRAPING SOUND stands out in the high-powered executive
quiet. Norville looks to one side.
A workman in painter's overalls squats in front of a pair of
heavy oak doors. With a razor blade he is scraping off the
name "WARING HUDSUCKER."
NORVILLE
...Mr. Mussburger's office?
The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville.
With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction.
Norville enters the adjacent office.
OUTER OFFICE
Two secretaries are in Mussburger's outer reception office.
The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the
f.g., her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder,
as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious
sneer which stays pasted on throughout.
The second secretary -- the RECEPTIONIST -- is seated behind
a desk in the b.g. that flanks the door to Mussburger's
private office. The Receptionist sits with her hands clasped
on the desk, staring at Norville with the hunch-shouldered
down-from-under look of a patient vulture.
RECEPTIONIST
Do you have an appointment?
NORVILLE
Uhh, no, I --
The filing secretary sneers.
RECEPTIONIST
Shall we look in the book, hmmmmmmmmm?
She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed crinkly
pages.
NORVILLE
No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in
the --
RECEPTIONIST
We don't seem to be in the boooook.
Norville is groping in his apron pocket.
NORVILLE
No, ma'am, ya see I don't have an --
RECEPTIONIST
If we had an appointment we'd be in
the booook.
NORVILLE
I know but ya see I have this --
here it is, this letter --
A low, unearthly WAIL fills the room, the sound of a million
souls moaning in purgatory.
The Receptionist looks up.
FAST TRACK IN ON SNEERING FILE SECRETARY
who is no longer sneering. Her mouth is stretched wide as
she wails and her finger points...
FAST TRACK IN ON BLUE LETTER
that Norville holds innocently at his side.
BACK TO TRACK IN ON WAILING SECRETARY
As her wail becomes deafening and we TRACK INTO her mouth
and the SCREEN GOES BLACK and:
CLICK
The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound
of a DOOR OPENING. We are:
Norville is still loping behind Mussburger, trying to keep
up with his long strides.
NORVILLE
...You don't happen to remember the
plan I outlined to you the day I set
fire to your off -- uh, the day I
was promoted?
MUSSBURGER
I do remember and I was impressed.
Anyway, that's all forgotten now.
Driver!
NORVILLE
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I
mention it is, it would require such
a small capital investment -- again,
you're the expert here --
MUSSBURGER
Damnit, where's my car!
NORVILLE
-- But there's such an enormous
potential profit-wise given the
demographics -- baby boom --
discretionary income in the burgeoning
middle class --
A black limousine pulls up to the curb.
MUSSBURGER
Finally.
NORVILLE
-- So if you think it's appropriate,
I'd like to bounce the idea off a
few people at lunch --
Mussburger is getting into the back seat --
MUSSBURGER
Sure, sure, tell whoever you want...
And, to Norville's surprise, slamming the door shut behind
him.
MUSSBURGER
...And I'd like to hear more about
it at some point, too.
SCREEEECH -- the CAR pulls away. Norville is left talking to
himself on the empty sidewalk.
NORVILLE
But, Sid, I thought you and I were...
DOORMAN
Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk
clear here?
NORVILLE
But I'm the president of this --
aww, forget it.
CUT TO:
where the PARTY NOISE is DISTANT, TENETTA'S SONG just
FILTERING OUT.
We are on a FULL SHOT of the back of a man who stands facing
the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture,
with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand
pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a
stiff neck tossing back a drink.
REVERSE
Amy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him.
AMY
...Norville?
He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a
dripping icepack against one eye.
AMY
...What happened?
NORVILLE
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the
more timid investors are no longer
running for cover.
AMY
Let me look.
He does.
NORVILLE
Sid found me the icepack.
AMY
Let me hold it, or you'll have a
real shiner.
NORVILLE
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot
over this imbecile story.
AMY
...I'm sorry.
NORVILLE
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy.
You're the one person who's been
standing by me through all this.
As she rolls the pack gently across his eye:
AMY
Norville... there's something I have
to tell you. You see, I'm not really
a secretary.
NORVILLE
I know that, Amy.
AMY
...You do?
NORVILLE
I understand that you're not very
skilled yet in the secretarial arts.
I'm not that skilled as president.
Oh sure, I put up a big front --
(massages his eye)
-- not that everyone's buying it.
AMY
I believe in you, Norville --
At least I believe in your...
intentions --
NORVILLE
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I
guess I have sort of made a mess of
things. These folks have to protect
their investment. Most of them are
very nice people --
AMY
Norville, you can't trust people
here like you did in Muncie...
They gaze out at the city.
AMY
...Certain people are --
NORVILLE
Didja ever go to the top of old man
Larson's feed tower and look out
over the town?
AMY
...Huh?
NORVILLE
You know, on farm route 17.
AMY
Oh yes! In Muncie!
NORVILLE
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
AMY
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well
no, I -- I never really... There's a
place I go now, the cutest little
place near my apartment in Greenwich
Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's
a beatnik bar.
NORVILLE
You don't say.
AMY
Yes, you can get carrot juice or
Italian coffee, and the people there --
well, none of them quite fit in.
You'd love it -- why don't you come
there with me -- they're having a
marathon poetry reading on New Year's
Eve. I go every year.
NORVILLE
(puzzled)
Every year?
AMY
Well -- this year -- if it's good I
plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my
it certainly is beautiful --
She nods out at the city to avoid Norville's quizzical look.
AMY
...The people look like ants.
NORVILLE
Well, the Hindus say -- and the
beatniks also -- that in the next
life some of us will come back as
ants. Some will be butterflies.
Others will be elephants or creatures
of the sea.
AMY
What a beautiful thought.
NORVILLE
What do you think you were in your
previous life, Amy?
AMY
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a
fast-talking career gal who thought
she was one of the boys --
NORVILLE
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so
but I find that very farfetched.
AMY
Norville, there really is something
I have to tell you --
NORVILLE
That kind of person would come back
as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I
think it more likely that you were a
gazelle, with long, graceful legs,
gamboling through the underbrush.
Perhaps we met once, a chance
encounter in a forest glade. I must
have been an antelope or an ibex.
What times we must have had --
foraging together for sustenance,
picking the grubs and burrs from one
another's coats. Or perhaps we simply
touched our horns briefly and went
our separate ways...
AMY
I wish it were that simple, Norville.
I wish I was still a gazelle, and
you were an antelope or an ibex.
NORVILLE
Well, can I at least call you deer?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the
whole thing is what your beatnik
friends call 'karma' -- the great
circle of life, death and rebirth.
Morosely:
AMY
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
What goes around comes around.
NORVILLE
That's it. A great wheel that gives
us each what we deserve...
He slaps his fist into his palm.
NORVILLE
...Tomorrow's my big presentation to
the board. I've gotta show Sidney
and the guys that I deserve all their
confidence!
Sadly:
AMY
Oh, Norville --
NORVILLE
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for
luck!
AMY
Sure, Norville, sure...
She gives him a peck. They look at each other.
AMY
...Oh, Norville!
She embraces him. They kiss again.
Norville's eyes widen.

Crooning the end of his song.

FADE IN:
DOUBLE OAK DOORS
Labeled "Executive Conference Room." A secretary is hanging
up a sign that reads: "Quiet Please! Board Meeting in

We PAN WITH Norville OFF the bar facade and, ENDING the PAN

WIPES UP INTO FRAME. Next to a picture of Norville is the
headline "MUNCIE MENTAL CASE." The subhead: "Hud Chief to

NEWSIE (O.S.)
Extra! Extra! New Year's Eve Edition!
Norville's hand ENTERS FRAME to push the newspaper away and
leave us looking up the empty street. Norville's back ENTERS
as he stumbles off alone up the street, pulling up his coat
collar as he recedes, the NEWSIE's VOICE continuing:
NEWSIE (O.S.)
...Ring out the old! Ring in the
new!
CLOSE ON NORVILLE
trudging. VOICES WELL UP, ECHOING. A face looms with each
voice, hellishly lit, superimposed over the walking Norville:
VOICES (V.O.)
...You're not so slow but you're not
so swell either and it looks like
you're an imbecile after all!...
Noooo, I don't guess you will be
here long... Sure, sure, but even
there they called you dipstick...
lamebrain... dope... schmoe... And
is this sap from chumpsville?!...
imbecile after all... Norville, you
let me down... You let Mrs. Eisenhower
down... You let the American people
down... imbecile after all...
imbecile... I predict you're going
to lose all the good things your
ideas brought you... Please, buddy...!
When you're dead, ya stay dead...
Sure, sure, the kid's screwy -- it's
official...
This last voice and supered face is Mussburger's.
Norville DISSOLVES away to leave us ON Sidney in the:

The broom handle has been jammed between two cogs, stopping

thrust it there, and who now TURNS back over his shoulder to
address the CAMERA.
MOSES
Strictly speakin', I'm never spozed
to do this but... have you got a
better idea?
NORVILLE
Twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a DISTANT --
very distant -- SINGING.
HIS POV
Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building. Someone or
something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down
from the stars.
We can make out a male voice, accompanied by STRUMMING:
VOICE (V.O.)
She'll be comin' around the mountain
when she comes, She'll be comin'
around the mountain when she comes...
NORVILLE
He gapes.
ANGEL
-- For it is an Angel, arrives. He is a balding man, wearing
rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings
sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes
to rest, in midair. He puts aside the harp he has been
strumming on a nearby windowsill.
ANGEL
Love that tune. How ya doin', kid?
NORVILLE
Mr... Mr. Hudsucker?
HUDSUCKER (ANGEL)
Ta-daaaa!
Presenting himself, he spreads his arms and stamps his forward
foot, forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to
stamp. He lurches forward, momentarily losing his balance.
HUDSUCKER
...Wooooo!
He rights himself. The halo spinning lazily over his head
has been jarred askew. With a flick of his forefinger he
rights it.
HUDSUCKER
...How d'ya like this thing? They're
all wearin' em upstairs now.
He blows a dismissive raspberry.
HUDSUCKER
...It's a fad.
He pats at his robe, produces a white cigar.
HUDSUCKER
...Anyway. I hear you've been having,
uh...
He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist, lighting it.
He lights the cigar off his thumb, takes a puff.
HUDSUCKER
...Been having some problems with
the board. The more things change,
know what Iyayayeeeeee...
Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his
flaming thumb, which he now waves frantically about.
HUDSUCKER
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts...
Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I
guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws
to ya, huh, Norman?
NORVILLE
Norville.
HUDSUCKER
Mm. Well, say what you like about
the man's ethics, he's a balls-to-
the-wall businessman. Beat ya any
way he can. Straight for the jugular.
Very effective.
NORVILLE
Yes sir...
HUDSUCKER
Anyway. Any particular reason you
didn't give him my Blue Letter? I
mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying
man's last words and wishes, no big
deal.
NORVILLE
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I
apologize, there was an awful lot of
excitement and I guess I must've
mislaid --
HUDSUCKER
It's sittin' in your apron pocket,
right where you left it. Imbecile.
Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter.
NORVILLE
Oh, geez.
HUDSUCKER
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is
grounds for dismissal.
NORVILLE
Geez, I --
HUDSUCKER
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna
add to your woes. I'm just saying.
NORVILLE
Yessir.
HUDSUCKER
Well, why don't ya read it.
NORVILLE
Sir?
HUDSUCKER
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
NORVILLE
Yes sir...
He tears open the envelope, reads:
NORVILLE
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker.
To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding.
My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you
read this, I will have joined the
organization upstairs -- an exciting
new beginning. I will retain fond
memories of the many years you and I --
'
HUDSUCKER
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard
resignation boilerplate -- go down
to the second paragraph.
NORVILLE
'Many years, uh... I know that you
will be wondering why I have decided
to move on, ending my tenure at
Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You
will be thinking, Why now, when things
are going so well? Granted, from the
standpoint of our balance sheet and
financials, sure, sure, we're doing
fine. However, Sid. These things
have long since ceased to give me
pleasure. I look at myself now and
no longer see the idealistic young
man who started this company. Now I
see only an empty shell whom others
call a 'success.' How has this come
to pass? When and why did I trade
all of my hopes, dreams and
aspirations, for the emptiness of
power and wealth? What the heck have
I done?
As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails,
then pats down a yawn.
NORVILLE
'...Looking back now, Sid, I see
that I allowed time and age to corrupt
my dreams. Instead of fiercely
guarding what was timeless inside of
myself, I let the hubbub of earthly
commerce erode my character, and
dissolve my better self. How is it
that some manage to preserve
themselves where I have failed?
Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if
others love you, you may more securely
love yourself -- but I am alone. I
loved a woman once, Sid, as you well
know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady,
an angel who in her wisdom saw fit
to choose you instead of I...'
Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up.
Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief.
He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently
quavers in a voice strangled with emotion:
HUDSUCKER
Skip this part...
He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles.
HUDSUCKER
...Last paragraph, last paragraph.
Norville looks down the page.
NORVILLE
'...And so, Sid, the future does not
belong to such as I -- nor even you.
We have made our compromises with
time. The future belongs to the young,
who may more energetically wage the
battle against corruption.
Accordingly, in the spirit of hope,
and the ringing in of the new, I
hereby bequeath my entire interest
in the company, and my seat on the
board, to whomever is Hudsucker's
most recent employee at the time of
my demise. I know this will disappoint
you -- you, Sid, who have served so
diligently and for so long. But --'
HUDSUCKER
-- tough titty toenails!
He roars with laughter.
HUDSUCKER
...That'll show the bastard!
He merrily wipes his eyes.
HUDSUCKER
...Yeah, go ahead.
NORVILLE
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work
closely with the new president, and
to keep giving Hudsucker Industries
all your energies -- but not your
soul. For while we must strive for
success, we must not worship it.
Long live the Hud. Waring
Hudsucker...'
Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod.
HUDSUCKER
...Geez.
Pleased with himself:
HUDSUCKER
Yup. It's all there. Well, see that
it gets delivered in the morning.
Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the
stars.
HUDSUCKER
Sheeel beeee...
MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE
Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great
arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on
his way back to the heavens.
HUDSUCKER
...Ridin' six white horses, She'll
be ridin' six white horses She'll be
ridin' six white horses When she
comes...
We hear a great WRENCHING SOUND from the GEAR ROOM next door.
GEAR ROOM
Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear.
With a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn --
SWEEP SECOND HAND
Lurching forward --
PERPETUAL MOTION BALL
Swinging down --
As Norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face
with one last mighty BONG of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.
BOOM DOWN
FROM a tavern sign that says ANN'S 440, DOWN TO the front
door, which Norville is entering.
