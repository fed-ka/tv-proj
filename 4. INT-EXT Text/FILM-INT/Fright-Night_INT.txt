Inside the house. A middle-class family lives here. The
living room is empty, but the TV's on.
ON THE TELEVISION
A commercial for PETER VINCENT. A Las Vegas institution,
he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie
imagery.
Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy. He's cutting a
girl up with a chain saw. And grinning like a mad man.
TELEVISION ANNOUNCER
Peter Vincent's "FRIGHT NIGHT."
The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left
of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box.
TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
Something's moving in the dark.
2.
Also on the table -- a role-playing game in progress.
"Magic, the Gathering"... Elves and Wizards.
TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
Only at The Hard Rock. Nightly
Wednesday Through Sunday.
Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT
coming from another room.
DISTANT VOICE
Get off her!!
More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly
domestic scene.
We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps
through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes
toward us.
He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind
terror.
We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A
teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping.
We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if
something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it.
We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered,
as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the
wall, which Adam nearly falls over.
ADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS' ROOM. Another horrible glimpse -
- his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed.
Blood on pale pink sheets.
ADAM goes to his FATHER'S SIDE OF THE BED and now we see
Adam's father's body. His father was reaching for A GUN he'd
hidden under the bed.
ADAM gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the
gun. It's just beyond his grasp.
ADAM
Come on, come on, come on...
He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in
his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry.
3.
ADAM (CONT'D)
Come on, come on!
He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking
hands.
THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw. Adam is
exposed. We see only a hint of the creature that looms over
HIM --
Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin...
Human but not quite.
Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead.
HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear:
DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
.we're looking at a nice day here
in Clark County, hitting a season
low of only 89 degrees...
The Beetle zips through a commercial strip. More suburban
paradise.
Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the
wheel. Casually drops one on Charlie's leg. Charlie tries
to act casual, but he's stoked and... amazed.
Cara half-sleeps in the back while BEE leans forward, flirty,
and eyes Charlie's COLORFUL PUMA SNEAKERS. Charlie's a
sneakerhead, a serious collector.
BEE
Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck.
AMY
Charlie.
BEE
Chuck likes it when I call him
Chuck, right Chuck?
Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort.
CHARLIE
It's -- they're not -- that's,
like, puce? That's a macho puce.
CARA
Can you stop someplace? I'm
severely under-caffeinated.
AMY
(ignores her/to Bee)
Did you see the poster for the
formal? The theme is "Hope"?
BEE
I know. They asked me to be on the
committee again but I was like --
hope is completely 2008. Grow up.
CHARLIE
Did you suggest "Despair?" Nobody
would see that coming. Or --
global warming? Everybody has to
wear tin foil.
AMY
(laughs/to Charlie)
Did you go last year? We basically
did the whole thing, Bee and me.
9.
CHARLIE
(LIES)
Me? I, ah, was in training that
week. This big triatha--
BEE
(cutting him off)
Chuck was still under his rock.
We're so glad you crawled out.
CARA
Caffeine!? Hello!
CHARLIE
I have Econ first period.
Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices.
CARA
Charrrliiieeeee.
CHARLIE
(KILLING HIM)
Okay. Yeah. It's no big deal.
Amy PULLS into a coffee place. Parks. The girls climb out.
CARA
Thank you, Jesus.
Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting.
AMY
You're not going to flunk for
missing Econ, Brain.
CHARLIE
Brain? I -- what? No, I'm--
But she's already walking away.
AMY
Five minutes.
He watches her move off, anxious and smitten.
Later. Charlie's in Econ class. Seated in a back row near
MARK and BEN. A number of seats in class are EMPTY.
TEACHER
Ben Wegner?
BEN
Here.
TEACHER
Adam Noris?
Nothing. Teacher looks around.
12.
TEACHER (CONT'D)
Adam?
(marks chart/then)
Courtney Heuer?
A girl raises her hand.
Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class. Stops when he
sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him.
EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been
picked on by bullies his whole life.
He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And
his binder is covered with COMIC BOOK STICKERS.
TEACHER (CONT'D)
Nick Straley?
(NOTHING)
Nick?
Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly
at him. Like -- "you know and I know..."
Charlie looks away. As if he didn't see him.
Charlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall. Mark shows Charlie
a picture on his phone. A woman posing seductively.
MARK
Miss Granada. Geometry.
CHARLIE
Holy crap. Where did you get that?
MARK
She's hard up, man. Equations
don't keep you warm at night.
They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and
Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt.
BEN
I think "it's" going to talk to us.
ED
(TO CHARLIE)
I need a minute.
MARK
"It's" going to talk to Brewster.
13.
BEN
(TO ED)
When are you going to get the
message? We don't know you--
ED
(RE: CHARLIE)
He does. Or did. Before the
summer and his Jock Lobotomy.
CHARLIE
(to Ed/uncomfortable)
What's the deal, man?
ED
Alone.
Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out
laughing. Mark looks at Charlie.
MARK
Just the two of you. That's sweet.
He can school you in the ways of
geek-douchery.
ED
It's important. "Brewster."
The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into
action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch
with interest -- out of earshot.
Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.
ED (CONT'D)
Adam's missing.
Charlie's looking around, self-conscious.
CHARLIE
What do you mean, he's missing?
ED
I keep trying him -- nothing. No
texts, no phone. And he's not the
only one who's gone. You heard
roll call.
CHARLIE
So kids aren't coming to school.
What do you want me to do about it?
14.
ED
Meet me at his house after school.
We'll check around. See what's up,
if he's okay.
CHARLIE
I can't after school. I'm busy.
ED
I don't think you get what I'm
TELLING YOU--
CHARLIE
Look, do we have to do this here?
Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He
starts to lose it, raises his voice--
ED
What, am I not even suppose to
speak to you now?--
CHARLIE
Keep it down. Don't spaz--
ED
It's so horrible! Crossing the
streams! Will High School as we
know it cease to exist?!
Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance.
ED (CONT'D)
You want me to tell your pals how
well we know each other? The Lego
contests, the Farscape conventions,
THE COSTUMES--
CHARLIE
UIET--
ED
Or how your first sexual experience
was with an Electra figurine--
CHARLIE
No. No.
ED
Then be my backup.
CHARLIE
(DEFEATED)
Fine. Adam's after school.
15.
ED
Don't be late.
Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He
shrugs like "I have no idea what that was about..."
FADE TO:
Ed wriggles in through the DOG DOOR. He turns, lets Charlie
in. Charlie looks around.
CHARLIE
This is nuts.
It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely
righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's
proper place. It's perfect.
They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.
21
ED
Hello? Ed and Charlie here!
(TO CHARLIE)
Come on.
Charlie follows him in. Resigned and placating.
CHARLIE
Okay. Fine.
Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY
WATER, even a small AX.
ED
Take this.
Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous.
CHARLIE
You've got to be kidding me.
Ed stops. This is it.
ED
I hate to tell you this but that
guy, your neighbor.
(DEAD SERIOUS)
He's a vampire. One of the undead.
CHARLIE
My neighbor. Next door.
ED
Yeah.
CHARLIE
I just met him. Jerry.
ED
Jerry.
A beat.
CHARLIE
That's a terrible vampire name.
"Jerry." Seriously--
ED
I didn't name him, man, I'm just
reporting the facts!
Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's
darker up here. Lights off.
22.
CHARLIE
Come on, this is a gag -- right?
Ed's barely listening -- cautious. Every shadow is potential
death. Total shmuck bait...
ED
Hey! Anybody here?
They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's
parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty.
Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery.
Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him.
The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY
HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure.
Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked.
Charlie also reacts, scared.
ED (CONT'D)
Get back, demon!
Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open,
toppling A MOVIE CHARACTER STANDEE.
A beat. Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh.
ED (CONT'D)
Ha! I killed that sucker dead!
CHARLIE
(ANGRY)
They're not here, okay? They left
town. His dad was a deadbeat--
Ed pulls a MAP out of his pocket. It has lots of red and
black DOTS marked on it. He thrusts it at Charlie.
ED
No, see, it's not just them. It
started -- there was this thing on
Channel 13, a lady escaped an
attacker who tried to bite her.
Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose
circle around CHARLIE'S house.
ED (CONT'D)
Adam and me, we graphed the attack,
the disappearances. Whole
families, gone.
(MORE)
23
ED (CONT'D)
And that's you guys at the center,
see? His windows are totally
BLACKED OUT--
CHARLIE
There's a ton of houses like that.
People work nights on the strip--
ED
But every window? No. I've been
watching him. It all fits--
CHARLIE
That Jerry's a Dracula.
ED
No. Dracula is a specific vampire.
I'M SAYING--
CHARLIE
I know what you're saying! I'm
mocking you. You've been reading
too much Twilight--
ED
Fiction, okay? This is real. A
real monster. And he's not
brooding. Or lovesick. Or noble.
He's the fucking shark from JAWS.
He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't
move on until everyone around him
is dead.
(MOST EMPHATIC)
And that book SUCKS.
Charlie can't help but pause. Ed's conviction is so real.
But he shakes it off.
CHARLIE
COME ON--
ED
What about your neighbors, the
Perrys? He moved into their house.
Haven't seen them around, have you?
CHARLIE
Yeah, in San Diego like a month
ago!
ED
Exception, proves the rule. You
haven't asked him in, have you? He
can't get in without an invitation.
24
CHARLIE
No, but--
ED
Your mom? Lonely divorcee...
CHARLIE
You're on drugs.
ED
No! Well, yeah... I thought you'd
take my word, but I have evidence
at home. Hard evidence.
Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it.
CHARLIE
Yeah. Okay.
ED
(INTENSE)
We have to stake him in his nest.
You and me. Not now, it's dark.
CHARLIE
Right. Cause he's nocturnal.
ED
Just for -- okay -- for a minute
pretend you're not a douche now--
CHARLIE
Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun
when we were eight--
ED
SIXTEEN--
CHARLIE
(LOSING IT)
Whatever! I grew up, okay? You
don't want to, fine. But don't get
an attitude because I'd rather have
a life than make shit up!
Ed stops. Stung.
ED
Right. Got it. You're soooo cool
"Brewster." Go ahead, join the
Clark High early-peakers. This is
the pinnacle for them. And that
includes your girl--
25.
CHARLIE
Shut up.
ED
Undeniably doable, but we used to
make fun of her and her pals,
remember? They're bimbos--
CHARLIE
Shut up!
Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves
him away. Ed stumbles. Falls.
He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate.
ED
Adam's gone -- you act like it has
nothing to do with you.
(THEN/PAINED)
We were inseparable, man.
CHARLIE
Yeah. And you know when I got
popular? The minute I stopped
hanging out with you.
Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go.
FADE TO:
Ed falls through the window into the kitchen. Looks out.
JERRY stalks toward him. All hulking menace.
But Ed's safe now. Calls out--
ED
Forget it sucker! No invite!
BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls
back.
JERRY
Abandoned. I thought you did your
homework.
ED
-- what?
JERRY
You've been watching me. I've been
watching you. Seems fair.
Ed BOLTS into the house.
28.
As he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his
pocket. We see he's wearing a cross around his neck on a
long chain.
JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat.
Ed sees A SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the back. He fumbles with
the lock, gets it open and runs into the backyard.
Through the kitchen window, Jane watches the DUMPSTER drive
away. She's pleased, a little surprised. Says to herself...
30.
JANE
Good on his word.
A knock at the door. It's Amy. She lets herself in.
AMY
Morning. Charlie?
JANE
You try. My voice seems to be on
some frequency he can't hear.
AMY
CHARLIE!
CHARLIE (O.S.)
Coming!
Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head. Amy moves to the
island. Grins a little.
AMY
Talk to Hot Neighbor again? You
should facebook him.
JANE
(shakes her head)
Temptress. I'm resolved.
Charlie runs down. Wet from the shower, discombobulated.
pecks Amy, grabs food off a plate. He's out of sorts.
AMY
Oversleep?
CHARLIE
Didn't.
(off her look)
Weird dreams.
Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out.
Charlie's in class. He's restless, agitated. On his pad, he
absently draws VAMPIRE images, blood...
TEACHER
Sally Cabella?
SALLY
Here.
TEACHER
Ed Lee?
Nothing. Charlie looks up.
TEACHER (CONT'D)
Edward Lee?
Charlie looks around. No Ed. And just like he said -- quite
a few other kids are missing. Charlie takes this in, looks
around.
ABOVE CHARLIE
SEATS ALL AROUND HIM ARE EMPTY. This time it makes an
impact.
Victoria pulls Charlie in and hugs him, happy. Calls out--
VICTORIA
Rick! Charlie's here!
(TO CHARLIE)
Look at you. So handsome!
CHARLIE
Oh, I -- you don't have to--
Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand.
RICK
Ed said you'd sprouted. And
you're, the--
Rick awkwardly gestures around his face.
CHARLIE
Cleared up. Yes sir--
VICTORIA
Ed will be so sorry he missed you,
But -- you should both be in school
now, shouldn't you?
CHARLIE
He's not here? Did you see him
today?
RICK
He's usually up and out early.
Everything okay?
CHARLIE
No, sure. We're working on a class
project. I guess we crossed paths.
VICTORIA
I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed,
he'd be mad that I said so, but he
talks about you all the time.
This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been.
CHARLIE
Yeah. That's... He's great.
(THEN)
Would it be okay if I went
upstairs? Ed has a book we need.
34.
VICTORIA
Of course. Make yourself at home.
Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick --
"that's good!" They're both pleased.
Ed's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy
movies.
There's an art table where Ed has been working on some
illustrations for a noir-style graphic novel. Charlie stops
and looks at them. They're fantastic.
He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few
pictures of Ed, Charlie and Adam when they were friends.
CLOSE ON A PHOTO
Charlie and Ed, arms around each other. Charlie is shorter
and thinner -- with really bad acne. Not cute. WAY not.
ON CHARLIE
Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees--
PETER VINCENT'S "FRIGHT NIGHT" POSTER on a wall. Charlie
takes it in, laughs a little.
Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's
investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore
printed off the internet, books, etc.
If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more
of Ed's fictional world.
Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head.
It's all a fantasy -- nothing more.
CHARLIE
This is crazy.
He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on --
and one file stands out. "THE JERRY DIARIES."
Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds
a bunch of Quicktime files.
He opens one. Stops.
CLOSE ON COMPUTER
35.
As BLURRY short clips play:
Jerry's truck, in motion but it looks like NOBODY'S DRIVING
IT.
DORIS the neighbor chatting on Jerry's lawn -- with nobody.
Over and over, it's appears that JERRY DOESN'T SHOW UP on
video.
OFF CHARLIE
Taking this in. Chilled.
Charlie bursts into his room, freaked out -- races to the
window.
His room is free of all geekery. Now it's all sports and
sneakerhead stuff.
AMY's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books.
She's reading Wuthering Heights.
AMY
Where've you been? You told me to
meet you here an hour ago.
CHARLIE'S POV
Jerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet. Lights on
behind BLACKED OUT WINDOWS.
38.
AMY (CONT'D)
Hello?
Charlie breaks away from the window. It's an effort. His
focus is still half there, even as he tries to talk to Amy.
CHARLIE
Sorry. You okay? Everything okay?
He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.
AMY
Yeah. Why shouldn't it be?
CHARLIE
No, it should. Nothing.
AMY
(re: her book)
You ever read this? It's good.
Sexy, actually.
Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him.
AMY (CONT'D)
In a frustrated, unconsummated sort
of way.
CHARLIE
Like us, you mean.
Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.
AMY
Kinda makes it hotter.
CHARLIE
Yeah, so you keep saying.
He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance.
AMY
Am I boring you? What's up?
CHARLIE
What? No. I'm kind of wiped out,
that's all.
AMY
I can fix that.
She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in
and turned on. She pulls back, serious.
39.
AMY (CONT'D)
Want to get under the covers?
CHARLIE
-- now? Seriously?
AMY
Calm down. Let's just... see how it
goes.
Charlie's dying inside. Now?! Could not be a worse time.
CHARLIE
Believeme when I say--thereis
nothing in the worldI'dratherdo
BUT--
AMY
Charlie. Don't be nervous.
She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie
weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait...
Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God--
DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie
stops. Practically tosses Amy off him.
CHARLIE
You hear that?
He rushes to the window. Looks outside.
CHARLIE'S POV
DORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Shit.
AMY
What?
JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's
flirting up a storm.
CHARLIE
Shit, shit, shit--
Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs.
AMY
He's hot. She's a stripper. They
were bound to find each other.
40.
CHARLIE
GO-GO DANCER--
AMY
Take away two tiny pieces of cloth,
stripper.
(LIGHTLY)
You jealous?
CHARLIE
What? No--
Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT
CHARLIE. It's chilling.
Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling
her down too.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
He looked right at us.
AMY
Maybe. Not a big deal--
Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.
CHARLIE
No, it is a big. A very big. He
saw us and he was pissed.
AMY
Okay...
Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.
AMY (CONT'D)
If you're not into this, say so.
Don't do me any favors.
CHARLIE
What? No! I am, I totally am.
just -- I don't trust that guy.
He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used
to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff.
AMY
I'm going.
CHARLIE
Amy. Don't--
41.
AMY
No. You've got your neighborhood
watch thing.
CHARLIE
Come on, don't be that way--
But she's gone.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Crap!
A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But
Doris's muted LAUGH from the other house draws his attention.
He looks again at Jerry's house. He can see faint shadows
moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts.
Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do? He picks up
the phone. Dials 911. Then thinks better of it. Hangs up.
Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on JERRY'S PLACE.
Listening and watching intently. Keeping sentry.
FADE TO:
Later. Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window.
He's startled awake by a woman's SCREAMS. They sound like
they are coming from Jerry's.
But are they screams of pleasure or pain?
Charlie looks out the window. Jerry's house is dark. It's
all quiet. Charlie looks at the clock. tam.
Charlie sits back on his bed. Was it a dream? Then Charlie
hears A MOTOR START. Charlie goes back to the window.
Jerry's TRUCK starts and Jerry drives off.
Off Charlie, unsettled.
CUT TO:
Charlie moves through the first story of the house. He's
cautious, on edge.
At first the place seems totally unremarkable. A typical
"guy pad". Lots of inexpensive furniture, bad art, a salt
water fish tank...
At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump
out at him. It's unbearably tense.
Charlie looks upstairs. Moves through a plain white hallway,
finds an open door that leads to Jerry's office, where he
keeps an EXTENSIVE LIBRARY.
On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old, decorated
with a strange INSIGNIA. Charlie takes a picture of it with
his phone.
Charlie goes into Jerry's bedroom - opens his closet. Sees a
variety of UNIFORMS. Cop, gas man, UPS, etc. Charlie
reacts, chilled.
Charlie stops. JERRY'S TRUCK is pulling into the driveway.
Charlie's in a panic. Jerry will be inside any moment.
43.
There's no time to get out so Charlie ducks into the CLOSET.
Charlie pushes as far back into the closet as he can go.
Leans against the back wall.
The BACK OF THE CLOSET SWINGS OPEN and Charlie falls back
into a HIDDEN HALLWAY.
Charlie stands, stunned, see that the hallway is lined by
small rooms on either side.
It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added. Each room
has a small rectangular WINDOW, so you can see in.
Charlie reacts, sick. It looks like a prison. Despite the
danger, he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms--
WHAM!!
A pale HAND slaps against the window. Charlie jumps.
CHARLIE
Fuck! --
DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks
almost BLUE.
DORIS
Help...
CHARLIE
Oh my God. Oh, shit--
Charlie tugs on the door. Locked.
He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The
FRONT DOOR. And then -- JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.
DORIS
Oh... Oh no... Get me out of here!
Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.
CHARLIE
I'm -- I won't leave you--
But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.
DORIS
Please! No! Don't go!
44.
Charlie ducks inside one of the CELLS across from Doris,
moves behind the door.
JERRY steps into the hallway, walks right by Charlie's hiding
place. Pauses near him.
The door is ajar. Was it that way before? Charlie holds his
breath.
Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORIS's half-alive body
from it.
Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door.
DORIS (CONT'D)
.no... . God, no... please...
The door to Doris's cell open. Charlie can see PART of
Doris's body and face.
Jerry is mostly obscured, bent over Doris -- holding her.
Charlie watches helplessly, horrified.
DORIS (CONT'D)
Please, please... don't kill me.
Doris's body TENSES and starts to jerk, as Jerry TUGS AND
RIPS AT IT SAVAGELY. It's clear he's FEEDING ON HER,
although we can't see his face.
Doris screams, then starts to cry. It's stark and REAL and
terrifying.
It seems to go on and on. Doris weakens, her head lolling to
one side, her light fading.
A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement.
In the position she's in, she is eye to eye with CHARLIE.
She sees him, smiles weakly. Then mouths something -- too
weak to make much sound.
DORIS (CONT'D)
Cha... Cha...
CHARLIE is petrified. Doris gets it -- smiles a little
grimly, puts a finger to her lips. Silence.
After what seems like an eternity, Jerry is satisfied. He
tosses Doris aside and stands away from her.
Charlie DUCKS behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually
wipes a spot of blood from his mouth.
45.
Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell. Pockets the key
and moves off toward the stairs. After a moment, he's gone.
The sound of a TV starts in Jerry's living room. Something
banal like "The Real Housewives of Orange County."
Charlie knows this is his moment. With shaking hands, he
retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the "HOW TO PICK A LOCK"
screen.
Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell. She's
breathing -- alive.
Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny
screwdriver on the lock.
CHARLIE
Please... Please...
The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies
himself. Tries again.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Come on.
The tension is unbearable. Charlie can hear JERRY moving
downstairs.
CLICK
The lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he
grabs Doris and BOLTS.
Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's
feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet.
He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE.
His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back --
every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's
happening, let alone where she is.
A moment later. Charlie and Doris emerge downstairs, near
the entry hall. They can see the front door -- and hear
Jerry moving in another room.
Charlie looks around, trying to get oriented.
JERRY emerges -- almost sees them. Charlie ducks into a
hiding spot and grabs Doris, covering her mouth.
46.
A long beat as Jerry returns to the living room with a beer.
Settles in a chair facing away from the door.
Charlie considers his options. Says almost silently:
CHARLIE
Same floor plan.
He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.
A back door. Leading out. Charlie and Doris race for it,
DORIS stumbles and bumps into a chair. Stifles a cry.
Jerry turns at the noise.
Charlie throws the back door open, he and DORIS ESCAPE.
Jerry moves into the kitchen.
47.
The back door is closed now -- but the blinds sway slightly.
And there are BLOODY prints on the floor from Charlie's
sneakers.
Jerry takes this in, coldly furious.
FADE TO:
Charlie sits on his bed -- still in a state of shock. This
shit is for real.
Jane comes to the door, her knock cursory. She enters.
JANE
You're going to be late.
Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie
winces at the sun. He got no sleep, looks like hell.
JANE (CONT'D)
The hours you keep. It's like
living with a vampire.
Charlie stops. Looks at her. She has no idea.
CHARLIE
Listen -- promise me -- that guy
next door, Jerry? Under no
circumstances do you invite him
into our house. He's dangerous.
JANE
I think I can handle myself.
CHARLIE
No, no you can't--
JANE CHARLIE
Charlie-- Don't even look in his
direction, understand? And
at night, you stay inside.
JANE
Because he's dangerous. What kind
of dangerous?
Charlie starts gathering his things. Getting ready to bolt.
48.
CHARLIE
Can you trust me? For once, don't
ask a million questions--
JANE
Charlie. Stop. I'm your mom, not
some ridiculous woman--
CHARLIE
(GENUINE)
I'm sorry. Okay? I know... We
just don't have time for a big
thing! I'm telling you--
JANE
That's enough. I'm done with this
conversation.
She moves away.
CHARLIE
Mom! Mom--
But she's gone. Charlie looks after her, worried.
Later. Charlie approaches the school. Kids swarm around
him, happy and care-free. Charlie's in another world.

How to kill a vampire
ON CHARLIE
As he scrolls and frantically scribbles notes.
CLOSE ON CHARLIE'S NOTE PAD/COMPUTER SCREEN
As Charlie notes tons of CONTRADICTORY facts;
49.
Vamps must avoid all daylight. Vamps can walk in fog or
twilight.
Vamps always sleep in the dirt. Vamps never sleep.
Vamps can only die from stake through the heart. Vamps
only die from Fire.
Three bites to turn a victim into a vamp. One bite and the
victim has to feed from the vamp...
Vamps change form -- bats, animals, etc. Vamps absolutely
can NOT shape-shift.
ON CHARLIE
We see now that he's on a computer in the SCHOOL LIBRARY,
isolated behind some stacks.
He clicks a link on one of the sites -- which leads him to
PETER VINCENT'S website. It's an elaborate interactive site.
It says that Vincent is a serious student of all things
occult -- especially VAMPIRES -- and has amassed a vast
collection of books and artifacts.
It also claims that there are different TRIBES of vampires.
ON CHARLIE'S NOTEBOOK
He writes in big letters
TRIBES?
PETER VINCENT -- VAMP EXPERT?
AMY (O.S.)
Hey.
Charlie looks up. Amy stands over him, a little wary.
Charlie covers his writing and closes his computer screen.
He looks like hell. Disheveled, sleep deprived, tense.
CHARLIE
Hey...
AMY
You weren't in class. What are you
working on?
CHARLIE
Porn. Hacked it.
50.
AMY
Oh, good. I thought it was
something creepy.
Charlie nods. Smiles wanly. Then--
CHARLIE
Look, I'd better...
AMY
Get back to your porn. Got it.
She looks away, losing patience. Charlie rallies.
CHARLIE
No. Sorry. I'm just -- I could
use some coffee.
She looks back. Okay.
CLOSE ON -- A NEWSPAPER STAND
As Charlie grabs a LAS VEGAS SUN from a rack.
Charlie watches a bunch of CONVENTIONEERS with BADGES in the
FOOD COURT.
A guy about Charlie's size leaves his coat and badge on his
chair -- goes to get his food.
Charlie sweeps in and quietly takes it.
CLOSE ON
PETER VINCENT
40's, but all wiry rock n' roll attitude. Leather pants and
tattoos, Long black hair wrapped in a bandana. Dark painted
nails and heavy eye make-up. HEAVY METAL MUSIC BLARES.
53.
The whole scene is OVER THE TOP GOTH cheesiness. Lots of
stage effects and fire...
PAMELA ANDERSON look-alikes in skimpy outfits prance on stage
as another SEXY GIRL is handcuffed, S&M; style, to a CIRCULAR
TORTURE BOARD.
ON THE AUDIENCE
We see that this is a run-through. Tech guys work light
boards, etc. A director and scattered others sit in the
seats.
CHARLIE
Sneaks in one of the back doors. Silently moves close to the
stage.
He's WEARING THE STOLEN COAT.
The badge holder now has the SUN masthead logo inside. It
looks, at first glance, like a legit credential.
ON STAGE
Peter reveals a tray full of SHARP DAGGERS. He raises them
to the audience.
PETER
The knives are real.
He CUTS his OWN PALM with one, bleeds. Doesn't even wince.
Stud.
PETER (CONT'D)
The girl is real.
He GRABS HER, feels her up. She giggles.
SEXY ASSISTANT
Ooooo!
Peter YANKS down on the circular board the assistant's tied
to -- sending her SPINNING.
PETER
And if I miss, she'll really be
dead.
The music switches. It's all TENSION. Peter FLINGS a
dagger. SCHWACK! The assistant DUCKS as the KNIFE embeds in
the board behind her, this close where her head was.
She screams! Breaks character.
54.
SEXY ASSISTANT
Holy Shit! Pete!
Also out of character -- PETER speaks in a thick QUEEN'S
ACCENT.
PETER
You can't say that!
(moves to her)
Stop the-- STOP. CUT!!
The music stops. The spinning board stops.
SEXY ASSISTANT
You almost tore my extensions out!
Why do you have to throw a real
knife!?
PETER
(RE: KNIFE)
It barely cuts! That board is like
butter.
He tears the MAKEUP appliance off his hand that made it look
like he cut himself. The assistant pulls out of her VELCRO
straps.
SEXY ASSISTANT
Everybody else fakes it!
PETER
But this looks authentic--
SEXY ASSISTANT
Then learn how to throw!
She stomps off the stage. Peter can't believe it.
PETER
Screw this.
He starts to stalk off stage. CHARLIE rushes toward him.
CHARLIE
Mr. Vincent! Mr. Vincent--
A tech guy moves in on Charlie.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Charles Brewster. From the Sun?
We had an appointment.
PETER
I don't think so. Talk to my guy.
55
CHARLIE
We're doing a piece -- "Vampires.
Separating myth from fact."
PETER
You want a comment? That's a shit
idea for an article.
Peter starts to move off. Charlie, anxious, follows.
CHARLIE
Please. I really -- I need your
expertise. You're the man on this
stuff, right?
Peter sees how desperate Charlie is. Stops.
PETER
What is this, like your first
assignment?
CHARLIE
Actually -- yeah.
PETER
(takes this in/then)
Ten minutes.
Peter lives in a two story penthouse at the top of one of the
casino hotels that he works in. It's lavish, floor to
ceiling windows, etc.
Still, goth influence reigns. The decor is tacky Haunted
Mansion all the way.
Charlie is shown into the "museum" by Peter's ASSISTANT,
ARTHUR, who looks and sounds A LOT LIKE PETER.
ARTHUR
Don't touch anything, dude.
Charlie enters -- comes face to face with a SNARLING
WEREWOLF. He starts. Then realizes it's a life-size model.
CHARLIE
Ho -- wow.
56.
Charlie stands back, takes in the place. It's an amazing
combination of FANTASY memorabilia and ACTUAL occult weapons
and objects. It seems to go on and on.
ARTHUR
Got rooms of this crap. Ebay.
Charlie examines a case that holds all kinds of TORTURE
DEVICES and battle axes, as well as SPIKED BALL MACES, etc.
Cases hold ancient texts and scrolls, haunted objects, etc.
CHARLIE
Amazing.
Charlie is genuinely impressed. The geek in him can't help
it. Peter enters, talks to Arthur--
PETER
Midori me.
Arthur pours Peter a green drink as Peter pulls off his black
wig (bandana attached) and peels off a nude body shirt that
has a bunch of TATTOOS printed on it.
He steps out of his boots, with three-inch LIFTS. Collapses
into an arm chair. He's just another balding, middle-aged
guy with bad eyes.
Peter downs his drink. Arthur hands him the bottle. Peter
looks at Charlie.
In truth, Peter's isolated himself to the point that he
actually welcomes a visitor -- though he'd never admit it.
PETER (CONT'D)
(RE: MIDORI)
Looks like pee but I'm hooked. You
want?
CHARLIE
No, thanks. Not...on the job.
Peter scratches avidly at his crotch.
PETER
Leather, it doesn't breath. You
know? Fucking rashes are killing
me... So I'm your expert, huh?
For your vampire thing.
(BITTER)
They're all the rage, huh.
57.
CHARLIE
Yeah. I guess... So -- say I want
to kill one. But really. How how
would you do it?
PETER
Depends. You got fire, beheading.
Or go classic -- stake through the
heart. Bam!
CHARLIE
So all that actually works?
PETER
How the fuck do I know.
CHARLIE
I thought you're--
PETER
I read books, man. You think I'm
hanging out with Dracula and the
Easter Bunny?
CHARLIE
Sorry. No.
Charlie realizes he has no choice. He has to reveal more.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I -- I have a personal interest in
this story.
(off Peter's look)
A friend's missing, actually. I
think one of them got him.
PETER
Them, meaning a "vampire."
CHARLIE
Jerry. He lives next door to me.
PETER
"Jerry?"
CHARLIE
I know.
(THEN)
But it's no joke. If you look at
these clips, you'll see. They take
some time to load but...
Charlie moves to Peter, shows him his phone. Digs into his
pocket.
58.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
And I printed up some photos I
took. In his place. Or lair...
Charlie put the photos in front of Peter on the table.
Peter's expression closes. He stands, pissed.
PETER
Arthur!
CHARLIE
No, come on, I'm--
PETER
You're a nutjob. Arthur!
Charlie deflates -- his desperation showing again.
CHARLIE
Listen to me. I saw it. I saw him
kill a girl. She burned up in my
hands. You have to tell me how to
stop him.
Arthur enters.
PETER
Get this loser out of my sight.
CHARLIE
I know what I saw.
PETER
No you don't. See this guy?
He gestures to ARTHUR.
PETER (CONT'D)
My cousin, Art. He's "me" on
stage. That's how I teleport.
People see what they want to see.
CHARLIE
(URGENT)
This is what you've been looking
for, I promise. I can take you to
him, to his place.
PETER
In Clark County Nevada. A hot bed
of supernatural activity.
59.
CHARLIE
Yes! It's genius. A transient
population. A town where people
work all night, sleep all day...
PETER
A town full of con-artists.
(not buying it)
No. You're working me, or
somebody's working you.
Charlie's getting angry now.
CHARLIE
He already got my friend! I know
how I sound. But I'm not crazy. I
didn't want this. I don't want to
know this. Just tell me what to
do!
Peter feels Charlie's sincerity. For a moment he looks
genuinely conflicted. But his expression hardens.
PETER
Run.
CHARLIE
What?
PETER
You heard me.
He moves away. But Charlie is on his heels. Peter looks to
ARTHUR, nods.
CHARLIE
So I save my own skin so he can
keep killing!? I won't. We have
to kill him! Please!--
Arthur THROWS Charlie out, the door closed firmly behind him.
Charlie stands, shut out. What the hell is he going to do
now?
FADE TO:
60.
Now we find that Charlie's entire room is decked out in anti-
vamp decor. Not just the garlic but crosses and other
religious pictures, etc.
Charlie LOOKS at the clock -- night coming too quickly. He's
grimly focused as he starts sharpening a STAKE.
A knock. Jane doesn't enter this time. Another knock.
CHARLIE
What?
Jane walks in. Takes in the decor.
JANE
The whole house looks like that
show Dark Shadows.
CHARLIE
It's a gag. For Amy. Long story.
JANE
(takes this in/then)
You like her a lot, don't you?
A moment when they could connect. But Charlie just nods.
Jane's disappointed. Then--
JANE (CONT'D)
Don't use tape on the walls.
(THEN)
Oh. Ed's parents left a few
messages, looking for him.
Charlie looks up at this. Pained.
CHARLIE
Okay.
He goes back to his work. Jane looks at him for a beat, then
she starts to go.
61.
THE DOORBELL RINGS. Before Jane can really react, Charlie
pushes past her.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
DON'T. Don't open it.
Charlie races downstairs. Stops. AMY is standing in the
living room.
CHARLIE
How'd you get in?!
AMY
It was unlocked.
CHARLIE
MOM! You have to lock the door!
AMY
Okay, whatever, listen. You're
flipping out. Punching out your
friends and blowing everything off
and is that a stake?
A beat. He forgot he was holding it. He hides it behind his
back.
CHARLIE
No.
Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room
is decked in more anti-vamp decor.
AMY
Look. Even if you're losing it --
you don't get to blow me off. You
don't go from something to nothing
overnight.
(EMOTIONAL)
You're not nothing to me, Charlie.
Whatever's happening, just -- talk
to me.
Charlie takes this in, emotional. But--
CHARLIE
I can't let you get hurt. You need
to forget about me for a while.
62.
AMY
What? How am I going to get hurt?
Tell me. Charlie--
Now there's another KNOCK at the door. Jane comes downstairs-
JANE
I got it--
CHARLIE
NO. Don't answer it.
A tense moment. Another knock.
INNERCUT WITH
Charlie races to a window. SEES JERRY MOVE out of sight.
CHARLIE
Shit, shit...
JANE
What? What is he doing?
CHARLIE
Whatever it is, it's not good.
Charlie's running from window to window now, trying to see
what's going on.
64.
CHARLIE
Just -- if we stay in here -- he
has to give up. He can't get in
without an invitation.
AMY
OH--
(GETTING IT)
Oh... Really? Like a--
CHARLIE
Vampire. Really.
Amy and Jane are blown away. Charlie's going crazy.
Jane follows Charlie, worried.
JANE
Think about what you're saying--
CHARLIE
I have. I've "processed," believe
me.
Jane takes this in. Then SMILES.
JANE
Ooooh. This is the gag! For Amy.
I can't believe you got Jerry to go
along with it!
Charlie stops. Fuck.
Charlie hands Amy and Jane both CROSSES on CHAINS.
65.
CHARLIE
Take these. Put them on. Just do
it.
JANE
(HUMORING HIM)
Okaaaay. Vampire protection!
AMY
I don't think this is funny.
But she puts it on.
Hisssssssssss. A strange sounds coming from under the floor.
AMY
WHAT'S THA--
BOOM!! The GAS FIREPLACE EXPLODES, the STOVE EXPLODES, THE
WATER HEATER ALL EXPLODE at once!!
WINDOWS BLOW OUT as Charlie JUMPS on Jane and Amy, dragging
them to the ground.
The room starts to BURN.
Charlie, Amy and Jane are in a panic. They try to put the
fire out, but it's no use.
Charlie stops. A CHILLING SIGHT:
Jerry stands on the other side of the blown-out windows. His
expression dark. Through the flames he says--
JERRY
Don't need an invitation if there's
no house.
A beat. Charlie GRABS Amy and Jane and they RUN through the
house.
y, Charlie and Jane race into the garage
66.
AMY
I can drive--
JANE
I drive!
They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener--
CHARLIE
Gun it Mom! Go!!!
Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it.
She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk
as she takes off.
Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into
an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!!
They narrowly avoid a head-on collision with a FIRE TRUCK.
ON JERRY
As he sees the dirt bike in the driveway. He jumps on.
Tries to start it. NO GO. Fuck.
JANE
What did we do!? What does he
want!?
They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING
THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW of the car, nearly taking Amy's head
off.
AMY
HOLY--
Everyone reacts. Then the BIKE STARTS - the wheels spinning
wildly in the back seat.
CHARLIE
Amy!
Amy's hair gets caught in the spokes - it's horrible as it
YANKS part of her hair out.
Charlie grabs her away from the bike -- she falls into his
arms, crying as JERRY's BIG PICKUP appears in the rear
windshield.
67.
JANE
He's coming!
THEY SWERVE OUT THE SHADOW HILLS GATES
Charlie's giving a report to a pair of uniformed cops.
COP #1
So a gas leak caused the fire at
your home and...
CHARLIE
My mom didn't feel right, we were
trying to get her to the hospital.
It was stupid to let her drive.
COP #1
Yeah it was. And driver who rear-
ended you, you get the exact make
and name of the van?
CHARLIE
It wasn't there when you got there?
COP #2
Hit and run. Happens all the time.
Charlie stifles his surprise. Nods.
ANGLE ON AMY
On her cell, pacing as she eyes Charlie with the cops.
AMY
We won't stay up all night. Bee
and Cara need help with Trig --
it's not a party. Okay. Okay...
(THEN/EMOTIONAL)
Mom? I love you.
She stops at the open door of a hospital ROOM. Her gaze
FALLING ON--
JANE
Who lies motionless in a bed. A doctor checks her chart.
AMY hangs up. Charlie, finished with the cops, joins her.
They're both pained as they look at Jane.
AMY (CONT'D)
Maybe you should have said
something to the police.
73
CHARLIE
Like what? A vampire moved next
door, borrowed some beer, ate a
stripper and then blew up our house
because we wouldn't invite him in?
Amy looks at him.
AMY
Okay.
The DOCTOR approaches.
DOCTOR
You should get some rest.
CHARLIE
She's going to wake up, right?
DOCTOR
Assuming the swelling is minimal, I
hope so.
CHARLIE
But you don't know.
DOCTOR
Not yet. We need to give it time.
The doctor puts a hand on Charlie's shoulder, leaves.
Charlie turns away, upset. Amy watches, feeling helpless.
Peter, in a bathrobe, looks out his floor-to-ceiling windows
at the lights of the strip.
The ASSISTANT from the show toddles out on high heels and a
ridiculous mini-dress. Her hair is messy, post sex.
ASSISTANT
Bye babe. Good show tonight.
He's barely paying attention.
PETER
You were late again on "The Devil's
Torture Chamber."
But she's gone.
A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he
does he notices the PHOTOS Charlie took at Jerry's place.
74.
Absently, he sifts through them. Stops.
He picks up the one of the INSIGNIA.
Peter reacts. Stunned. This means something to him.
He goes to a WALL SAFE. Opens it. Hidden inside are a bunch
of personal items. Some from his childhood. Old photos of
his mother and father...
And a hand-drawn sketch, in a youthful scrawl, of THE
INSIGNIA. He puts the two side by side. They MATCH.
Off PETER, looking at the sketches. Haunted.
Charlie and Amy sit on a tiny couch. Both are scared and
regretful.
CHARLIE
This is my fault.
AMY
You didn't make any of it happen.
CHARLIE
Ed came to me. I turned my back on
him.
AMY
How were you supposed to believe
him? None of it makes sense.
CHARLIE
He did talk a lot of demented crap.
(but.. )
He was my best friend. He asked
me, begged me, to believe him.
AMY
People change. Everybody--
CHARLIE
Yeah they do. I turned into a
dick. I figured my dweeb past, not
big with the ladies.
AMY
(WRY)
So you're saying this is my fault.
75.
CHARLIE
I wanted you to like me. I tried
to erase Ed -- all of it. I know
how that feels.
AMY
I knew you were a dweeb.
(off his look)
You think I want a "dude" like Mark
or Ben? I like that you're
different... It didn't hurt that
your skin cleared up.
She smiles, takes his hand. A sweet, connected moment. Then
something alarming occurs to Amy:
AMY (CONT'D)
I can't believe we didn't have sex.
CHARLIE
AMY-
AMY
No, seriously. I'm going to die a
virgin? Me? How did this happen?
CHARLIE
We're not going to die--
AMY
But what if we do? Let's do it.
Now. The bathroom. Charlie.
A beat.
CHARLIE
I think we should kill the vampire
first. I'll perform much better.
They laugh -- trying not to cry. Then:
AMY
Oh my God, Charlie. What are we
going to do?
CHARLIE
We're going to fight.
Then Charlie's phone rings. He answers.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Hello?
INNERCUT WITH:
76.
Peter stands with the photo of the insignia in hand.
PETER
I can help you. My place. One
hour.
CLOSE ON
A MIDORI cocktail
WIDEN to reveal that PETER is pouring himself a whopper. Amy
and Charlie sit nearby.
PETER
I'll tell you what I know, but
that's it. Don't expect me to join
your Scooby gang.
CHARLIE
Anything. I'll take it.
PETER
I found the origin of that insignia
you showed me. It's a species that
originated in the Mediterranean.
They nest in the earth -- explains
that hole you saw. And they kill
slowly, keep their victims alive
for days.
(MORE)
77.
PETER (CONT'D)
(GRIM)
"Snackers."
CHARLIE
So -- they turn all of them?
(off Amy's look)
Make their victims into vampires.
AMY
I know. I read.
PETER
No. It takes a while before they
complete the change. They usually
finish them off before that.
AMY
So how do you kill these guys, this
"tribe"?
PETER
Usual stuff. But it's a strong
breed. You need a plan--
A VOICE interrupts over an intercom. It's ARTHUR, Peter's
assistant.
ARTHUR (O.S.)
Delivery. Guy says you need to
sign for something.
PETER
Send him in.
(TO CHARLIE)
I order things when I've had a few
cocktails. It's a--
CHARLIE
(ALARMED)
Wait. You get deliveries this
late?
PETER
I don't know. Maybe--
Charlie stands.
CHARLIE
No. You said he could come in.
The delivery guy. That's--
AMY
What? Charlie--
78.
VOICE (O.S.)
An invitation, airhead.
They turn and see EVIL ED, in one of Jerry's "uniforms."
It's clear he's changed. A glint in the eye, more muscular.
Charlie takes Ed in, pained. Ed grins at him.
Ed flips open a cell phone. Dials.
ED
Looking at them now. Yes sir.
(hangs up/then)
He's modern, Jerry, dispensed with
all that "master" stuff.
(TO CHARLIE)
Hey bud.
Charlie steps in front of Amy.
CHARLIE
You've got a problem, keep it with
me.
ED
Problem? You let him get me, man.
CHARLIE
(ANGUISHED)
I KNOW--
Ed is CREEPING TOWARD Charlie.
AMY
CHARLIE--
ED
You let him turn me into this.
At that, ED VAMPS. Black eyes, black veins. Those teeth.
It's terrifying.
SMASH!! One of the cabinets shatters. Ed, Charlie and Amy
spin to see PETER standing by the open collection case. A
SMALL NAIL in his hand. He's shaking like a leaf.
PETER
Stay away, demon.
ED
(amused/queens accent)
"Stay awaaaay, demon!"
Ed closes in on Peter. Peter looks to Charlie. It's real.
79.
ED (CONT'D)
Whatcha got there? Itsy bitsy
little stakey?
PETER
Crucifixion nail. Lethal to you.
ED
Old school. Nice. Got to get
pretty close to use it, though.
Peter looks at the short piece of metal in his hand. Fuck.
HE BOLTS down the nearest hallway.
ED (CONT'D)
Uh uh. No you don't.
ED BOLTS AFTER PETER. Charlie and Amy race the other way.
CHARLIE
The elevator!
Peter pushes a BUTTON on a doorway, bolts into a PANIC ROOM.
Ed is on his heels, but JUST MISSES grabbing Peter before the
door closes.
The POWERFUL DOOR CLOSES ON ED'S ARM, crushes it. ED HOWLS
as his arm SEVERS. The door LOCKS.
But what doesn't kill him makes him stronger and crazier.
ED
A panic room!? You better panic,
loser! You better watch your neck!
Peter's in shock -- watching Ed's severed arm twitch on the
floor.
ED (0.S.)
Prince of darkness is a little baby
man! I love it! All the fat
chicks in your fan club are gonna
be so bummed!
He hears ED flipping out, but ED DOESN'T SHOW UP ON THE
SECURITY SCREEN.
80.
Charlie runs with Amy to the ELEVATOR. The CONTROL BOX has
been ripped from the wall. They're trapped.
AMY
Oh my God, oh my God...
Amy's starting to lose it. Charlie grabs her.
CHARLIE
Look at me. Stop.
(SHE DOES)
There's another way out of here.
And there are a million things to
fight with in here. Understand?
We're going to make it.
Amy pulls herself together. Nods. They RUN.
CHARLIE AND AMY race through the ROOMS of Peter's extensive
collection.
INNERCUT WITH ED
Tracking them -- not far behind, his stub of an arm bleeding
and HEALING as he goes.
ED
Give it up, Chuck! You're dead.
(THEN)
If you hadn't ended up such a dick,
I might have tricked you out. We
could have rocked this evil shit!
But you blew it. Nothing but the
big dirt nap for you and your lady.
AMY AND CHARLIE
Round a corner -- it's a dead-end. They see a large antique
CONFESSIONAL at one end of the room.
ON ED
As he comes around the same corner a moment later. AMY and
CHARLIE are NOWHERE to be seen.
81.
Jerry enters, his appearance different. Healing from the car
incident has taken it out of him.
He's pale and weakened -- and still has lots of cuts and
bruises.
He's also changed into new clothes, jeans and a SWEATER.
We see THE SAME GUARD that Charlie spoke to earlier.
GUARD
Sign in, please.
JERRY
I know where I'm going.
GUARD
Sign in. No exceptions.
Jerry ignores him, keeps moving toward the elevator.
GUARD (CONT'D)
Hey! I'm talking to you. Sign in,
or you're not going nowhere.
Jerry turns. Slow and deliberate. Expression cold.
Ed is MOVING IN ON the CONFESSIONAL. Sees MOVEMENT behind
the curtain.
ED
I expected more of a fight. Girl's
made you lazy in the head.
Pussy'll do that.
ED YANKS the curtain on the confessional open.
ARTHUR hides there, terrified.
ED (CONT'D)
Look at that. Vincent's got a
Vincent.
CLOSE ON
A large cabinet on the other side of the room. AMY AND
CHARLIE are squeezed behind it. They react to HORRIBLE
SCREAMS as Ed rips ARTHUR apart.
82.
CHARLIE holds AMY close, muffling her sobs.
Blood seeps across the floor, under their feet...
ON ED
His face bloodied. Eyes wild. The trembling body of ARTHUR
on the ground at his feet.
Ed turns Arthur over. Arthur's still breathing, reaches for
something around his neck. A cross? No, it's a chain with
PICTURES of sweet-faced children on silver charms.
HE PLEADS--
ARTHUR
.I have ...kids ...
ED
Had.
Ed lifts Arthur off his feet and chokes him with one hand...
ED (CONT'D)
Don't take it personal. I'd eat
you -- but I'm saving my appetite.
Arthur's turning a horrible purple, eyes bulging... Ed
breaks his neck with a HORRIBLE WRENCHING CRUNCH. Drops him.
ED (CONT'D)
Dinner with an old friend.
A door to a STAIRWELL opens, Jerry steps into a hall. He
looks healthy again. Robust.
He wipes a small smear of blood from his mouth.
AMY AND CHARLIE hold their breath as ED looks around the
room. Arthur is motionless at his feet now.
ED
I know you're here. I can hear you
breathing. It's totally cool.
He laughs, hyper. Excited.
CHARLIE EYES A CASE WITH A BATTLE AXE
83.
ED (CONT'D)
Sooo, I take out the prom king and
queen? Embarrassment of riches!
CHARLIE SHOVES the case he hides behind with Amy over ONTO
ED. Yells to Amy--
CHARLIE
GO!
Amy bolts from the room as Charlie punches the glass out on
another case that holds the battle axe. He grabs the weapon.
Ed SHOVES the cabinet off him with his good hand, stands.
Charlie and Ed face off.
ED
Mano e...one mano. Piece of cake.
Cause I'm a God Damned killing
machine, and you're like all the
Clark High big shots -- nothing.
(THEN)
You picked the wrong side, man.
Ed lashes out, slicing CHARLIE on the arm with his SHARP
NAILS. Charlie yells, but holds his ground.
CHARLIE
I didn't pick--
ED
You didn't think.
Charlie's wrecked about what he has to do.
CHARLIE
I know. I'm sorry.
Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING
around the room, avoiding Charlie's swings as he clings to
walls and, impossibly, THE CEILING.
ED
Steeeerike! Call that a swing,
Slugger?
Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him.
Finally, Charlie connects with ED'S NECK. Blood flies,
Charlie can't look -- anguished.
ED (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Come on! You're not even trying.
84.
Charlie looks back, Ed's HEAD is only HALF OFF. He's
grinning even as he bleeds everywhere. It's macabre,
horrible.
Ed SLASHES Charlie again with his claw-like nails. Charlie
cries out.
Amy can hear Charlie yell.
AMY
Charlie!
She smashes into one GLASS CABINET after another, pulling out
and pocketing everything she can find to fight ED. Finds a
GUN loaded with silver bullets...
JERRY
You are something, aren't you?
Amy spins. Jerry's closing in on her. Beautiful, seductive.
She's shaking, terrorized. BAM, BAM, BAM!!
She empties the GUN into JERRY anyway. It knocks him back,
but he's still standing. He picks a silver bullet out of his
shoulder, unimpressed.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Werewolves.
Amy FLINGS holy water in his face.
JERRY SCREAMS, burns.
AMY
Vampires.
She RUNS.
ED is already starting to heal as he and Charlie continue to
fight. But his head still flops hideously to one side.
ED
Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles.
Hard to cut.
Charlie takes another swing with his axe. Ed jumps out of
the way.
85.
Ed manages to get Charlie in a one-arm embrace of sorts,
positions himself so he can BITE HIS NECK.
ED (CONT'D)
Is this weird for you too? I feel
like such a homo--
Charlie FLIPS ED -- they are wrestling when Charlie sees AMY
approaching with A SPIKED MACE. Charlie DUCKS and AMY
smashes ED in the head. Hard.
Charlie grabs a long, sharp piece of the shattered wooden
cabinet.
Ed is on the ground. Moaning, laughing. Charlie has his
shot. But he hesitates.
AMY
Do it. Charlie!
Charlie's frozen.
Ed starts to get up, his head a mess. It's now or never.
ED
Wow. Bimbo has some juice--
AMY
Jerry's here. He's coming!
CHARLIE
(to Ed/pained)
I'm sorry.
WHAP, Charlie stakes ED in the heart. Ed looks at Charlie
with surprise...
Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment --
he looks like himself again.
ED
I wasn't even a badass vamp. I was
his Renfield. Funny if you--
Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY, his WHOLE BODY moving so
impossibly fast he's little more than a BLUR...
Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt.
Amy grabs him. Pulls him out of the room.
86.
AMY
I found the stairs. Come on.
JERRY, VAMP-FACED and recovering from the holy water, sees
AMY and CHARLIE running up ahead.
He sprints after them. Charlie sees him and TOPPLES A GIANT
FIGURINE in his path, as well as cabinets, etc...
They slow Jerry down enough to get slightly ahead.
AMY
OVER HERE--
She flings the door to the stairwell open and they RACE DOWN
THE STAIRS.
Peter sits huddled in a corner, ashamed and shaking.
The SECURITY CAMERA flicks through different rooms, until it
lands on his dead cousin, ARTHUR.
It's like Peter's looking at his own mutilated corpse.
OFF PETER, terrified.
Amy and Charlie emerge from the stairway.
They find themselves ON THE FLOOR of a HARD ROCK TYPE CASINO,
which is on the bottom of the building where Peter lives.
Amy slows as they fold into the crowds. Relieved.
AMY
Stop. Stop, I need to--
CHARLIE
Not now. He's coming for us.
AMY
He can't kill us, not here--
CHARLIE
Who's going to notice? Who's going
to care? Amy, look around--
87.
Amy takes in the people on the floor. Drunk, oblivious. Two
guys YELL and FIGHT at a craps table. A couple makes out in
a dark corner, etc. It's loud, chaotic.
AMY
Oh, God...
CHARLIE
Keep moving. Come on.
Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now, moving
toward them in the crowd. They meet eyes.
Charlie grabs Amy, scans for someplace to hide. He spots a
nightclub -- "REFLECTIONS".
The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit
diamond.
ON JERRY
Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club.
The inside of the club is made up of MIRRORS AND WINDOWS.
The dance floor is PACKED. All writhing bodies and sweaty
abandon.
It's dizzying, disorienting.
Charlie sees JERRY enter, look around for them. The best bet
to get lost is to dive into the crowd.
Charlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the
different levels of the club are like a maze. Glass
staircases lead to mirrored balconies...
A hopped-up DJ climbs up on a balcony, starts throwing t-
shirts into the crowd.
DJ
Tequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh!
The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward...
Someone bumps Amy and Charlie and they lose hands.
AMY
Charlie!
Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way -- tries to
dance with him. He pushes past her.
88.
CHARLIE
Amy? Amy!
Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over
again in a series of mirrors -- the infinity effect.
It's dizzying, disorienting.
THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd,
disappearing behind mirrored columns, reemerging...
Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESN'T REFLECT in the mirrors
around them. Instead the crowd parts as if by magic.
Jerry's heading straight toward--
AMY
who's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd. She's
spinning, looking desperately for Charlie.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Amy!
Charlie's frantically pushing toward her. But the CRUSH of
people makes it nearly impossible to gain ground.
CLOSE ON AMY
As a HAND slips into hers. She turns, relieved, to find--
JERRY
Holding her with a firm grip.
AMY
No. No!
Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from
CHARLIE, toward ramp that leads to another dance floor.
Jerry laughs, throws her over his shoulder.
AMY (CONT'D)
Help!!
A GUY in the crowd high-fives him. All part of another crazy
night in Vegas.
GUY
Go get her, man!
AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror -- she
appears to be FLOATING above the people.
89.
AMY
Help me! Help!!
CHARLIE can SEE HER, but can't get to her. The crowd is
indifferent to her cries.
Charlie grabs his cell -- hits a button. It dials, then--
CHARLIE
(INTO PHONE)
Peter! We're in the casino, the
club! Jerry's got Amy! He's got
HER--
Peter's holding his cell. It's ringing.
He hangs up.
Jerry, hidden away from Charlie now, puts Amy down. She
tries to run, but he holds her tight.
AMY
Charlie's coming, he'll find me--
JERRY
I'm counting on it.
Amy SPITS on him. Jerry reacts -- a flash of RAGE and he
exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Come on.
He grips her harder, sways with her to the music. Leans
close to her ear, seductive.
His predatory skills in high gear.
JERRY (CONT'D)
You just need a taste. You'll see.
It can be like a dream.
Jerry draws a nail over his wrist, draws a line of blood. He
puts his mouth over the cut, bloodying it.
He forces her into a DEEP KISS. She struggles mightily --
but then her body relaxes, as if she's been sedated.
90.
JERRY (CONT'D)
That's it... Good girl.
JERRY looks up sees CHARLIE coming toward them.
But Amy's altered now. Staring into Jerry's eyes like a
child.
CHARLIE'S GETTING CLOSER when--
CHARLIE
Amy! No!--
BAM! A hand falls on his shoulder.
A DOORMAN
DOORMAN
How'd you get in here?
CHARLIE
You have to help me. That guy,
he's going to kill her, he's a
KILLER--
The doorman glances at JERRY and AMY. Jerry stokes Charlie's
anguish -- running his hands over Amy's ass, kissing her
neck.
DOORMAN
Yeah? Then she's liking it.
Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.
CHARLIE
You don't understand!--
DOORMAN
ID. Then you can tell me your
whole sad story--
CHARLIE
No! There's no time-- Amy!!
Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the
doorman has a good grip, pulls him back.
JERRY
Sees that CHARLIE is restrained.
Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs
exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman -- and enjoying it.
91.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
No! NO!
CHARLIE'S POV
As he's being dragged away -- JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY.
It's a nightmare.
Charlie loses it, screaming and flailing. But there is no
helping her.
FADE TO:
Peter packs a bag, getting out of town.
CHARLIE (O.S.)
I see you got my message.
Peter turns. Sees Charlie standing in the doorway.
PETER
How'd you get in here?
CHARLIE
Security's a little lax. Everybody
got their throat ripped out.
Peter backs away as Charlie moves in.
Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a
decade in one night.
PETER
You too? He change you?
CHARLIE
Look at your monitor.
PETER turns to a security monitor in his closet. Charlie
SHOWS UP ON THE SCREEN.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I don't know if Amy's alive or dead
or turned -- but he's got her. My
mom may not make it. And Ed...
(COLD)
I'm going to end him, or he's going
to end me.
(MORE)
92
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
One way or the other, that's how
it's going to be and you're going
with me.
PETER
Don't you get what this is?
There's no fighting. There's only
surviving, if you're lucky--
CHARLIE
You call this surviving? If you
live and we all die, you think
you'll ever be able to get us out
of your head?
PETER
I know I won't. I never could --
not after the first time.
This stops Charlie.
PETER (CONT'D)
I told myself I probably made it
up. I was a kid. Maybe it was
easier to believe in monsters...
CHARLIE
Made what up?
PETER
The vampire who killed my parents,
my brothers. But not me. I hid.
Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense.
Peter continues, haunted--
PETER (CONT'D)
I didn't collect all this stuff for
fun. I thought maybe I could find
the tribe, "avenge" my people.
CHARLIE
So do it. We'll go in at dawn.
He's got to rest sometime--
PETER
(HARD)
It's not like that. When I was a
kid, I hid because I wanted to
live. I still do! This isn't the
comics. You want to be a dead
hero. Good for you. But I'm out.
(THEN)
(MORE)
93.
PETER (CONT'D)
You think I'm a coward. I'm just a
realist.
Moment of hesitation for Charlie. Has he been affected by
Peter's words? Then--
CHARLIE
So you bail on people, erase them.
(THEN)
I don't want to make it to
tomorrow, not if you're the kind of
man I have to be.
A moment. Peter is full of self-loathing, but resolved.
Charlie turns to leave.
PETER
Wait.
Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from
WHITE WOOD. He hands it to Charlie.
PETER (CONT'D)
Blessed by Saint Michael. Kill a
vampire with it -- it's supposed to
turn his victims back. If Amy's
changed, you can still save her.
CHARLIE
(RE: STAKE)
If it's for real.
PETER
Who knows what's for real any more.
Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him--
PETER (CONT'D)
There's no guarantee he'll be
asleep during the day. He's
housebound, not hibernating.
CHARLIE
I'll figure it out.
PETER
No, you need a plan. To stake him,
you have to get close -- he's
stronger than you.
CHARLIE
Holy water?
94
PETER
Slow him down. Won't stop him.
(THEN)
Torch him, you'll have a few good
minutes before he really goes up.
Believe me, a vampire on fire isn't
thinking clearly.
CHARLIE
But if he's on fire, how do I get
close enough to stake him?
A beat.
PETER
Fuck.
CHARLIE
(POINTED)
You just worry about yourself.
With that, Charlie leaves.
Off PETER. Disgusted with himself.
Charlie sits by Jane's bedside. She's still comatose.
We move closer and see that Charlie's drawing a MAP OF
JERRY'S HOUSE on some scrap paper -- laying it out from
memory as best he can.
He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA
As Charlie plots, he talks to Jane -- his silent confidante.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Those rooms upstairs, that's
probably where he's got Amy.
I get her out, assuming she's--
(NOT DEAD)
Then I have to get him on the
ropes.
He thinks... Then looks up, an idea occurring. Jane lies
there peacefully.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I have to go.
More energized, Charlie stands and gathers his things.
He stops, contemplates his mother for a moment -- regretful.
95.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I'm coming back for you, Mom.
Charlie buys FIREPROOF CLOTHING, a small open-flame lighter,
and a SPRAY CANISTER like the kind an exterminator uses.
The guy at the counter looks Charlie up and down. Charlie
takes this in. Finally, Charlie's like -- fuck it.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Going to kill a vampire.
The guy looks at him. Then--
STORE GUY
Good for you.
The store guy waits. Charlie hands over his money.
CLOSE ON WET FOOTPRINTS
Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house.
The blacked-out windows give the place a gray, stifled air.
Behind Charlie, we see that the front door has been broken
open with the crow bar.
96.
Charlie anxiously looks around for Jerry -- fully expecting
him to jump out and go for his throat...
He takes the stairs up to the second floor, two at a time.
Charlie moves down the hall, stops at some of the small
rooms. Looks in.
NO AMY
Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the
door for yet another room.
AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's
not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her.
CHARLIE
AMY--
Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns...
And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck -- she looks
normal. She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down.
AMY
CHARLIE--
She reaches through the window. They link hands, emotional.
AMY (CONT'D)
You shouldn't be here--
CHARLIE
Where is he?
AMY
I don't know. He dumped me here.
I'm bait. He said so--
CHARLIE
How do you feel?
AMY
I'll survive. Please get out of
here. He's too strong--
CHARLIE
I'm stronger.
(WAVERING)
In a nerd power way. You know...
97.
He reaches into his jacket, pulls out a CROSS.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Take this. It should--
He looks up. AMY IS GONE. Disappeared.
Charlie, reacts. Calls out in a hushed panic--
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Amy? Amy!?
Nothing. It's like she vaporized.
Charlie races down a hallway, looking for ANY.
He tries door after door that won't open.
He finally finds one door that's unlocked, rushes through --
almost FALLS through an open floor in an unfinished portion
of the house.
Jerry's building more cells.
Charlie backs out of the doorway, turns a corner and BAM!
He runs into JERRY. No, wait -- it's PETER.
He's not wearing his wig, etc. But he's cleaned up and
standing tall. Dressed all in black.
CHARLIE
Shit! You--
PETER CHARLIE
Sorry-- How'd you--
A beat. Then:
PETER
Guess I don't want to be a man like
me either.
Peter opens his leather coat -- it's loaded with weapons.
And a flask. Peter grins.
PETER (CONT'D)
Let's kill something.
98.
CHARLIE
(RE: FLASK)
You reek. Midori?
PETER
Don't get greedy. I'm here.
(THEN/PROUD)
And I found something else. From
my collection. Powerful shit.
From around his back, he reveals A DOUBLE-BARRELLED SHOTGUN
with a CROSS MOUNTED ON THE BARREL.
CHARLIE
Wooden bullets? Nice.
PETER
No, you think I'm fucking MacGyver?
Bullet, bullets. They'll buy us
some time.
Charlie is grateful, but now's not the time for man hugs.
CHARLIE
We have to find Amy. She was in a
room upstairs, then she just
disappeared. This house--
PETER
What do you mean she "disappeared?"
CHARLIE
She was there. I looked away,
looked back -- she was gone.
Peter takes this in.
PETER
Show me where.
Peter and Charlie pry open the door to the room where Amy was
held. Peter walks over the floor -- finds a TRAP DOOR.
PETER (CONT'D)
Floor trap. I use it all the time.
CHARLIE
Where does it go?
PETER
Only one way to find out.
99.
Peter lowers himself into the hole under the trap door--
CHARLIE
Wait -- you're going in?
PETER
See that? Like a great date. Get
me drunk and I'll try anything.
Peter lets go and FALLS. Charlie steels himself, goes in
after him.
THUD! Charlie and Peter land painfully on a dirt floor.
PETER
Ow, crap...
They look around -- eyes adjusting. There's barely any
light.
They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt
and the main story of the house is held up by numerous
SUPPORT POSTS.
At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to
another room/storage area.
ON CHARLIE
As he sees something. Stops.
A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave.
Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:
CHARLIE
You uncover him. I'll light him
up, then stake him.
Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face.
Peter looks at him.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Flame retardant.
They're standing over the grave now. Both nervous.
Charlie nods to Peter. Peter does his best to hold the
shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his
free hand. He's shaking.
100.
After a moment Peter UNCOVERS PART OF THE BODY. Then he
moves up toward the face...
Charlie douses the body with liquid from the canister.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
(TO PETER)
Gas.
PETER
You should be a magician.
As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches
for his STAKE--
PETER (CONT'D)
Stop! No--
CHARLIE stops JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO TOSS the match.
PETER (CONT'D)
Who is that?
IT'S ADAM, sleeping in a shallow dirt grave.
Charlie reacts. Holy shit. He pushes his mask back.
CHARLIE
Adam. I know him. Knew him.
PETER
Shh. Don't wake him up, for
CHRIST'S--
Peter stops. He's looking over Charlie's shoulder,
horrified.
In the dirt behind CHARLIE are MORE GRAVES. Eight or ten at
least. Charlie turns. Sees the graves.
PETER (CONT'D)
You know them too?
Charlie reacts, stunned.
Peter moves to another grave, uncovers another sleeping face.
And then another. A hulking man, a suburban mom...
Charlie uncovers another body. Stops, chilled.
CHARLIE
Ms. Granada. My geometry teacher.
(RUEFUL)
She was hard up.
101.
PETER
How about we go back to my "run
away" plan?
CHARLIE
(IGNORING HIM)
We can't burn Jerry out. There's
no way we'll get all these people
out if the house goes up.
PETER
I thought you're here for Amy.
(off Charlie's look)
Great. Right. Save the Geometry--
A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin -- it's
coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat.
They're both petrified as they move toward the door.
Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along
with the stake.
They creep toward the door.
CLOSE ON CHARLIE
Charlie puts his hand on the doorknob... Turns it...
WHAMP! -- Charlie's VIOLENTLY SHOVED THROUGH THE DOOR into
the STORAGE AREA
Charlie hits the dirt hard.
The door SLAMS SHUT AND LOCKS BEHIND HIM. He's in a smaller
room with a LARGE DIRT GRAVE in the middle. Jerry's grave.
Peter's confronted by JERRY. Who smiles darkly.
JERRY
You look bigger on TV.
Peter fires the shotgun, BLAM!
But he misses Jerry and the power of the blast sends PETER
HURTLING BACKWARD.
102.
Charlie reacts to the blast -- but sees that ST. MICHAEL'S
STAKE has fallen from his hand and rolled to the edge of the
grave.
He cautiously moves to retrieve it...
He stops as he sees A FIGURE emerge from the dark. AMY.
Her clothes are torn now, a thin trickle of blood runs down
her neck. She looks impossibly sexy. Her hair, her eyes,
her lips -- all shining and full.
Forgetting himself, he goes to her. Pulls her into his arms.
CHARLIE
Amy, God...
She clings to him, near tears.
AMY
Charlie.
Peter scrambles on the ground, SHOTGUN trained on JERRY --
who moves toward him calmly. The cross on the gun the only
thing holding him back.
BLAM!
Peter fires again -- grazes JERRY.
JERRY
In pain, he TRANSFORMS and VAMPS before our eyes with a blood-
curdling yell. It's chilling.
CLOSE ON GRAVES
One by one, the TRIBE of vampires wake. ADAM, MS. GRANADA...
Amy pulls away from Charlie -- says:
AMY
You should have run with me while
we had the chance. You should have
saved me, Charlie.
103.
Charlie takes this in, pained. Then--
CHARLIE
It's not too late.
She brings her lips close to his ear. Rasps...
AMY
It is. He's inside me now.
Her EYES GO DARK -- fingernails grow SHARP and dig into
Charlie. He feels the change.
CHARLIE
AMY--
Charlie shoves her off, hard. But she holds him tight -- and
they TUMBLE INTO THE GRAVE.
JERRY, backed by ADAM, MS. GRANADA and a handful of other
vampires, closes in on PETER.
JERRY
It's over, guy. Charlie -- his
girl's having her way with him.
(THEN)
She's way out of his league anyway.
Peter, trapped, won't be able to keep them at bay much
longer.
PETER
Stop! Stop!
Desperate, he BLASTS them again. Hits one on the shoulder.
But it's not stopping them.
JERRY
And your aim--
PETER
You don't get it! I'm on your
side.
Peter smiles a little. Shows his rows of SHARP FANGS.
Jerry and the others stop. What?
104.
Amy and Charlie struggle. He reaches for his cross -- but
she throws him off her with a violent HISS.
Charlie gets his first look at AMY in full VAMPIRE glory.
She's even more freaky looking than Jerry or Ed. Her face is
nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp
teeth. Her eyes are crazed and blood-red.
It's gruesome and terrifying.
Charlie sees THE STAKE at the lip of the hole. Dives for it.
Amy's on him in a flash. She throws him to the ground. He's
got the STAKE in hand. Ready to strike.
AMY
You wouldn't.
CHARLIE
Try me.
She STRADDLES HIM, sexual and raw. Charlie's repulsed,
terrified.
AMY
I'll be the best you ever had. The
only you had.
(THEN)
Charlie. We can be together
forever.
She leans in, licks his neck seductively...
AND GASPS.
She sits back, the STAKE IN HER CHEST. She falls away,
shuddering.
Charlie pulls the stake out -- scrambles out of the nest.
He looks back at her, anguished.
A beat. AMY, in terrible pain, LAUGHS. Nothing's happening.
No kablooey.
AMY (CONT'D)
Missed. You missed.
Charlie BREAKS THE DOOR OPEN with his crowbar.
105.
CHARLIE
I know.
He backs away from her. Into--
The basement where Jerry and the THE TRIBE are CIRCLED around
a body as MS. GRANADA feeds.
ON PETER, who's pale and shaking...
Charlie attacks them with THE CROWBAR.
CHARLIE
Get off him!
He hits MS. GRANADA off Peter. Manages to hold off JERRY for
a beat. Spins and HITS ADAM in the head.
ADAM
Dude!
CHARLIE
Sorry.
AMY enters from the other room -- already healing. Jerry
sees her -- holds up a hand and backs the others off.
JERRY
I'll finish this.
Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie.
Charlie sees Peter, barely alive, spit out his FAKE VAMP
teeth. Peter meets his gaze, wry and weak. Done for.
PETER
Worth a shot. "Master of
illusion."
Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He
dives for it, but Jerry steps on it -- kicks it away.
JERRY
(TO CHARLIE)
You think that's going to stop me?
Time to man up.
Jerry brutally kicks Charlie, sends him sprawling.
106.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Now. I'm going to kill your girl --
make you watch. I'll take my time
with you. And once you're dead,
I'll finish your mother.
(RE: AMY)
Too bad about that one. She sucked
me dry. Like a pro.
Amy smiles a little. Jerry GRABS CHARLIE, lifts him off his
FEET--
Charlie, enraged, SPRAYS JERRY WITH GAS FROM the CANISTER --
right in the eyes.
Jerry recoils, HISSING. Adam and the OTHER VAMPS MOVE IN.
Jerry's over it. He's on CHARLIE in a flash, FANGS BARED.
About to RIP HIS NECK OUT.
BLAM!
PETER has the gun again -- has managed to pull himself up
into a sitting position.
He BLOWS away ONE OF THE SUPPORT BEAMS.
BLAM! And ANOTHER.
BLAM! And ANOTHER.
BLAM -- he misses.
PETER
Fuck.
BLAM! AND ANOTHER.
Charlie DIVES for SAFETY as the CEILING COLLAPSES in part of
the basement. SUNLIGHT STREAMS in -- forcing JERRY, AMY and
the other vamps into a corner.
PETER (CONT'D)
(TO JERRY)
Fuck yeah! Nice sweater, loser!
BLAM!
Another BEAM collapses. BURYING JERRY, AMY and the others
under DEBRIS from the floor above.
A stunned beat.
Peter slumps, exhausted from the effort.
107.
Charlie looks at him -- amazed.
PETER (CONT'D)
(WEAK)
I'm better with stationary targets.
CHARLIE
Yeah you are.
Peter looks at him, sad.
PETER
Get out of here. We don't have
much time before they dig out.
CHARLIE
(RE: STAKE)
I can save you. I have to kill him
with this.
PETER
You're a brave mother, I get it.
And you were right. This is how I
had to go... But we didn't count
on an army.
CHARLIE
He'll kill you both, he said--
PETER
We're already dead.
(THEN)
Go now, you live to fight another
day. Stay -- there won't be one.
Charlie stops. Swayed. Pained.
PETER (CONT'D)
Do it.
CLOSE ON CHARLIE
Accepting it. It's what he has to do.
He starts DIGGING.
PETER (CONT'D)
Charlie!
But Charlie ignores him, determined. Pulls his MASK DOWN
over his face again.
PETER (CONT'D)
Stop!
108.
WHAM! JERRY BURSTS OUT OF THE RUBBLE, attacks Charlie.
Charlie falls back, PULLING JERRY with him into THE LIGHT
Jerry BURSTS INTO FLAME -- but holds Charlie tight
AMY and the other vamps start to claw their way OUT of the
rubble.
Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly ENGULFED IN FLAMES now
PETER (CONT'D)
Charlie!
Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help.
Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle.
Finally, Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the
ground as they fight. Trying to put out the flames.
Jerry starts to DISINTEGRATE -- he's about to EXPLODE into
bits. Charlie's stake is now ON FIRE.
CHARLIE
NO!
A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to
burn away.
HE STAKES JERRY.
AMY suddenly SCREAMS - she's burning inside, DYING. Or so it
seems. The vampire is being burned out of her.
PETER cries out too, reacting less violently. But in pain.
JERRY
Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in
his CHEST. Right through the heart.
He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster, just like
Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR.
For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air...
JERRY
Blow me.
THEN HE BLOWS INTO A MILLION PIECES.
ON CHARLIE AND PETER
109.
Thinking fast, PETER tackles CHARLIE -- who is still in
flames. They tumble into one of the open graves.
DIRT pours in around them, extinguishing the fire.
ON AMY
Transformed and healed. Herself again. She rushes to the
edge of the open grave.
ABOVE THE OPEN GRAVE
Peter pulls Charlie's mask back. Charlie is burned,
unconscious.
AMY
Charlie!
She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms.
AMY (CONT'D)
Charlie...
Amy starts to cry. Peter looks on, concerned. Finally,
Charlie opens his eyes. Says weakly...
CHARLIE
Blow me? Seriously?
Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Those are his last words? What a
tool.
We pull away, leaving this tableau...
UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe
emerge from the rubble. Disoriented, freaked.
A beat.
MS. GRANADA
Let's agree to never talk about
this.
FADE TO:
Charlie, Amy, Jane and Peter are in Peter's penthouse. It's
a glittering night, a spectacular view.
110.
Jane, released from the hospital, looks healthy and glowing.
She smiles at Peter, who also looks more together.
She has a glass of wine -- he's drinking a COKE.
JANE
Think you'll ever feel the same
about a nighttime sky?
PETER
Same as what? I was always
terrified.
JANE
Right. We're just catching up.
ON AMY AND CHARLIE
Charlie sees the connection between Peter and Jane.
Shudders.
CHARLIE
I'm not seeing that.
AMY
She deserves some fun. Your mom
fully cheated death.
CHARLIE
(SUGGESTIVE)
You too. You deserve fun.
AMY
Oh, I plan on it. Now that you've
killed your first vampire...
CHARLIE
I am so going to perform.
Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's
different, they're different. The childish part of them long
gone.
He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close.
SOMETHING BEEPS, talks...
VOICE
"Frak!" "Frak!"
AMY
(PULLS BACK)
What is that?
Charlie, a little sheepish, shows her. He's wearing a
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA wrist watch.
CHARLIE
Battlestar.
AMY
Right.
CHARLIE
It was Ed's.
Amy smiles a little, softens.
AMY
Right.
(THEN)
Frak?
PETER is passing. Hears this. Is down with it.
PETER
Frak! Right on.
(TO AMY)
Perfect Woman, can I get you a
drink?
AMY
I'll take another. Thanks.
CHARLIE
(TO PETER)
I'll give you a hand.
Charlie follows PETER into the DINING ROOM, where a BAR CART
is set up. Peter moves to it. Pours himself a Midori.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I thought you were on the wagon.
PETER
It's dark.
(off his look)
I'm on the "day" wagon.
CHARLIE
Thanks for inviting us.
PETER
We should celebrate. Being alive.
Your mom's clean bill of health.
CHARLIE
You wanted to put the moves on her.
112
PETER
What? No. What?
CHARLIE
Just -- I'm watching you. I've got
to look out for her.
PETER
Yeah you do. So here's what I'm
thinking. We faced the beast and
we won. Can you imagine the
possibilities if we had got that
shit on film?
CHARLIE
VAMPIRES DON'T--
PETER
Show up on film, yeah. But
werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get
proof, catch something -- we could
build a stage act around that, you
wouldn't believe. We'd blow those
Cirque bitches away!
CHARLIE
An act? Seriously? What about
saving people from evil? What
ABOUT--
A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And
somehow familiar.
Peter nods to his COLLECTION CABINETS.
PETER
It happens. All this stuff...
CHARLIE
Ever think about collecting
something else? Snow globes or--
Charlie stops, catches sight of something MOVING IN THE
REFLECTION ON THE FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOW.
Just a wisp, a phantom. The face - is it ED? His features
twisted in a grimace of fear and pain... It's CHILLING.
Charlie's spooked. But he looks again and the face is gone.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Yeah, definitely get new stuff.
113.
Peter leads CHARLIE OUT, back to the ladies in the other
room. Still on about his idea...
WE HOLD ON THEIR REFLECTION IN THE WINDOW
PETER (O.S.)
I'm serious, man. Do you know how
much we could make? Think about
how much people pay to see a tiger,
or boobs, right? What if we had a
tiger, boobs -- and a zombie!
After they've gone we linger on the window. Is that Ed's
eerie reflection again?, barely visible...
AS WE GO TO BLACK
ED (0.S.)
You're so coooool Brewster!!
