      The hustle and bustle of an alien home morning can best be 
      described as hectic. A hurried Susan crosses to the sink 
      with a pot full of bubbling goo where she grabs a baby 
      bottle. A determined Emily is at her heals.

                                  EMILY
                    But mum -

      Susan begins pouring the goo into Vessna's bottle.

                                  SUSAN
                    Emily, you're going to bed much too early. 
                    More than five hours will fade your spots.

                                  EMILY
                    But what am I supposed to do?                                  SUSAN
                    Read. Watch that Postman show --

                                  EMILY (rolls eyes)
                    It's the Letterman show, mum and I thought 
                    you wanted me to stay awake.

        A distracted Susan spills the goo all over her hands.

                                  SUSAN (RE: SPILL)
                    Oh great -- I'm already late as it is.
                            (yelling O.S.)
                    George, hurry up!
                            (Handing the bottle to Em)
                    Here put this in the fridge.

      Just then Buck enters carrying Vessna. He interrupts Emily 
      as he hands the baby to Susan.

                                  BUCK
                    Vessna's cleaned and lubed.

                                  SUSAN
                    Good, honey.
                            (then)
                    Any change in her eyes --

                                  BUCK
                    Not open yet, but they should be soon.

      Emily closes the fridge with a bit of frustration.

                                  EMILY
                    Mum, we have to talk...

      But before she can go further George enters carrying two 
      ties.

                                  GEORGE
                    Susan, I can't find my purple tie.

                                  SUSAN
                    Try looking in your left hand.

                                  GEORGE
                    This isn't purple it's green.                                  SUSAN
                    George, it's purple, trust me.

                                  GEORGE (squinting at it)
                    It is not. It's lime -- it's avocado -- 
                    it's puce.

                                  SUSAN
                    When are you going to see the doctor?

                                  GEORGE (peeved)
                    I don't need to see the doctor.

                                  SUSAN
                    George, I'm worried. Yesterday you tried to 
                    adjust the colour on a black and white TV 
                    show.

                                  GEORGE (defensive)
                    Susan, if I didn't know better I'd say 
                    you're talking as if I had Polahanahama 
                    syndrome.

                                  SUSAN (does a take)
                    I hadn't thought of that.
                            (beat)
                    You really ought to see a doctor.

      Buck grabs his bag and looks at his father.

                                  BUCK (RE: TIE)
                    Purple.
                          (to all)
                    See you later.

                                  SUSAN
                    Buck, what about breakfast?

                                  BUCK
                    No time, don't want to be late for first 
                    period -- {ciao}

      He grabs an apple and exits.                                  GEORGE
                    My son can't wait to go to school? Maybe HE 
                    should see a doctor.

      Emily grabs her books, her wheels turning.

                                  EMILY
                    Okay, Okay, how about a compromise, mum -- 
                    11:00 O'clock?

                                  GEORGE
                    Is this about going to bed early again? I 
                    don't want to see the light in your room 
                    off before midnight, understand?

                                  EMILY
                    I should have expected this attitude from 
                    people who grew up on a spaceship.

      Emily huffs out. Susan and George share a look as she hands 
      him the baby.

                                  SUSAN
                    I need to get to work.
                              (indicating)
                    Vessna's bottle is in the fridge.

      George opens the fridge and looks in.

      GEORGE'S POV

      Vessna's bottle which seemingly turns into two bottles as 
      is seen cross-eyed. Then two bottles over this...

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    George?

      RESUME SCENE

                                  GEORGE
                    Which bottle did you want?

                                  SUSAN
                    Which one? There is only one.

      George looks back inside.

      He's still seeing two bottles...      GEORGE gets a strange, somewhat pained expression on his 
      face. He shakes it off, rubbing his temple. Susan picks up 
      on his confusion, joins him and puts her arm around his 
      upper torso lovingly. George flinches with pain.

                                  SUSAN
                    Your gleeny glands hurting again, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    They're only slightly distended.
                            (sharing a look)
                    It's not polahanahama disease.

      Susan reaches in and grabs one bottle. She hands it to her 
      slightly bewildered husband.

                                  SUSAN
                    I want you to go see the doctor.

      Susan touches George's temple lovingly and exits, leaving a 
      slightly shaken George to wonder.


      A flustered George holding Vessna in a child carrier 
      enters. He brushes past a snickering Sikes who seems to be 
      waiting for him near the booking desk. He winces at the 
      underarm pain he is feeling and begins walking with his 
      arms out, flexed like a penguin.

                    So, I saw Delany pull you over on seventh. 
                    Any problem?

                                  GEORGE
                    The problem is Officer Delany is blind

                    You still ran a red light.

                                  GEORGE
                    I did not.

                      Ninety-eight dollars for running a red 
                    light that I did not run.

                    Wrong, George, I was right behind you, that 
                    light was redder than Rudolph's nose on 
                    Christmas eve.

                                  GEORGE (indignant)
                    I have twenty-to-one vision, which means I 
                    can see from twenty feet what you can see 
                    from one. Eyesight better than a hog.

                    It's my gleeny glands, if you don't mind. 
                    Very uncomfortable.

      They are interrupted by Zepeda who joins them quickly, 
      George not far behind.

                                  ZEPEDA (to Sikes)
                    Don't look now but little chief Grazer's on 
                    the warpath, and his tomahawk has your name

                    Not so fast, Sikes!

      A pissed Grazer joins them holding a file and a handgun. A 
      gun that is sleek and modern-looking.

                    Guess it's time for a refresher course in

                    C'mon Bri, I've used my 38 since my first

                                  GRAZER
                    I'm touched, Sikes, but the weapons have 
                    outlived their usefulness. We're getting 
                    too many reports of malfunction. End of 
                      discussion.

      Grazer turns to Zepeda.

                                  GRAZER
                    Zepeda, there was a break out from the 
                    Lasorda state pen last night. You'll be our 
                    point person on this one.
                          (to George and Sikes)

                    over in Culver. Bring a mop, I hear it's 
                    messy.


      George, holding Vessna, and a grumbling Sikes (who inspects 
      the new weapon) approach the day care room.                                  SIKES

      They enter into...

      INT POLICE STATION - DAY CARE ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      George's face immediately tenses up as he looks around the 
      rows of cribs and playpens for Mrs. Chernin, but she's not 
      there. They are then joined by a kindly, older human 
      gentleman whom we'll come to know as EMIL. A bit ragtag 
      from his age and mileage, Emil nonetheless always has a 
      smile and a twinkle in his eyes. Throughout this scene, 
      Sikes examines the new gun carefully.

                    Mrs Chernin abruptly decided to change 
                    careers.

                    Yes, well aren't you a little --

      But George can't say it.

                                  EMIL
                    It's Okay, you can say it -- old. But I'm 
                    not just old I'm experienced.

                                  EMIL
                    I got more than a degree --

      with this Emil pulls out his wallet, unfolding many photos.

                    Mind if we get acquainted?

      Emil again reaches for the baby and Vessna begins to cry. 
      George pulls her away.

                    Please, she's not comfortable around 
                      strangers. Mrs Chernin was the only one 
                    outside the family she'd allow to pick her 
                    up.

                    Quiet, Neemu, I'll find your 'wiggle worm', 
                    he makes you happy.

                                  EMIL
                    'Wiggle worm' -- not necessary.

                                  GEORGE
                    I know my daughter. And the only thing that 
                    makes her happy when she's upset is playing 
                    with that worm. Now where is it?

      While George is digging around in the diaper bag, Emil 
      takes from his pocket a set of measuring spoons on a ring 
      and hands them to Vessna.

      VESSNA

      feels them, then quiets immediately and plays with them 
      happily.

      RESUME SCENE

      George is taken aback.

                    It'll screw up their values down the line. 
                    Let her use her imagination.

      Emil picks up Vessna.

                                  GEORGE (defensive)
                    Well, that's not the way Mrs Chernin did

      Sikes exits, leaving George to throw another worried look 
      at the smiling Emil.


      Amidst storyboards and mock-ups Susan pours over two 
      drawings for TENCTA JELL TOOTHPASTE. One reads: GET THE 
      BLOOD OFF, the other: FOR GUMS THAT HUM. Unable to make-up 
      her mind she hits her intercom buzzer.

      A concerned Susan takes the phone.

                    No, he hasn't, but I'll get to the bottom 
                    of it.

      A concerned Susan hangs up. Paco, picks up on her emotions.

                                  PACO
                    What is it?

                    My son hasn't been to school in three 
                    weeks.

      Susan's face is etched with concern.

      scratches different spots on his body ending on Sikes who 
      sits terribly close to the scratcher and looks on with 
      disbelief.

      A nervous George sits across from him next to an old lady 
      who seems to be involuntarily chewing air.

                                  GEORGE
                            (nervous, to Sikes)

      Just then a nurse pops her head out of the door to the 
      patient rooms.

      With a look to Sikes, George enters. The Nurse then crosses 
      the air-chewing old lady sitting across from Sikes.

                                  NURSE
                    The doctor needs a specimen.

      She hands the old lady a specimen bottle that could hold 
      three gallons of liquid. Sikes looks at it then the old 
      lady who takes another bite of air. He smiles uncomfortably 
      wondering.

      INT PATIENT ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      Doc Tari, a young Newcomer doctor looks at an electronic 
      screen as a nervous George sits on the examining table.

                                  GEORGE
                    I told my wife that my symptoms were 
                    probably caused by a simple blockage of my 
                    \evets drainal flow. I mean we're an 
                    adaptable species but we've never been on 
                    planet this polluted before.

      The Doctor looks at the information that comes up on his 
      screen and a frown appears on his face.

                                  DOC TARI (intrigued)
                    Hummm.

                                  GEORGE
                    Hummm? It couldn't possibly be the 
                      Polahanahma disease.

      Doc Tari hits a few more keys. He watches the results.                                  DOC TARI (confused)
                    Hummm.

      He hits a few more keys as George tucks in his shirt and 
      stands.

                                  GEORGE (nervous)
                    Hummm.

                                  DOC TARI
                            (re: screen, confirmed)
                    Hummm.

                                  GEORGE
                    Hummm? What's 'hummm?'

      George crosses over to look at the screen but gets there 
      just in time to see it flicked off by the doctor.

                                  GEORGE
                      Everything is normal, isn't it?

                                  DOC TARI
                    How old are you, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    In earth years about seventy-seven.

                                  DOC TARI
                    Sit down, George.

                                  GEORGE (concerned)
                    I don't want to sit down.

                                  DOC TARI
                    George, you've reached a turning point. 
                    It's a little surprising though, you're 
                    much younger then most.
                            (then)
                    But over the next two days you can expect 
                    your mind and body to continue playing 
                    tricks on you. Abdominal spasms will 
                    probably be the first sign that you're 
                    entering your primary phase. I'll give you 
                      a prescription to ease the pain of your 
                      transition.                                  GEORGE
                      Transition? What are you saying?

                                  DOC TARI (sober)
                    Judging from your fluptel count, I'd say in 
                    a day or two you'll experience the gahsac.

      At the mention of 'gahsac' George slowly sits down, this 
      information having hit him like a slow motion ton of 
      bricks.

                                  DOC TARI (trying to be 
                                  light)
                    It's like death and taxes. Just in your 
                    case premature, who knows maybe it WAS 
                    brought on by the pollution. We can never 
                    be sure about these things.

      As quickly as George sat down he now pops up, a smile 
      forced on his face.

                                  GEORGE
                    You're right Doctor, we can't be sure about 
                    these things, and I'm afraid this is one 
                    patient you've misdiagnosed.

      George exits, Doc Tari in tow.

                                  DOC TARI
                    George -- Wait.

      INT WAITING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      The scratcher leans over and moans on Sikes just as George 
      enters Doc Tari right behind him.

                                  GEORGE (to Sikes)

                    prepare properly. George?

      But George is gone. The Doctor turns to Sikes.                                  SIKES

                      machinery.

      Doc Tari exits back into the office, Sikes grabs his coat 
      and, as he turns to leave, bumps into the air-chewing old 
      Lady Newcomer. She hands the Nurse the three gallon 
      specimen jar which is nearly full of a viscous yellow green 
      substance.

                                  LADY (to nurse)
                    I'm sorry but that's all I had.

      Sikes looks at the goo, swallows hard then gets the hell 
      out.

                    Oh yes, the secondary gahsac, usually 
                    occurs several months later and signals the

      INT DAY CARE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      A pissy George enters, and finds the furniture rearranged. 
      He marches over to a crib but is surprised to find the 
      child in it is not Vessna. Emil joins him.

                                  EMIL (smiling)
                      Afternoon, Detective.

                                  GEORGE (impatient)
                    Where is Vessna, Vessna is always in this 
                    crib.

                                  EMIL
                    Oh I put her over here in the corner. She's 
                    doing just fine.

      George hurries over and begins gathering up Vessna and her 
      stuff.

                                  GEORGE
                    She was 'fine' where Mrs Chernin had her.                                  EMIL
                      I suppose, but I noticed that crib gets a 
                    lot of sun and if she opened her eyes today 
                    I didn't want the bright light to hurt her.

                                  GEORGE (terse)
                    Thank you, but I'm sure she'd be happier 
                    with her crib where it always is.

      With this, Emil backs away and joins the other kids, 
      recognising George's mood.

                                  GEORGE (to Vessna)
                    Don't worry, little neemu, I won't have 
                    this doddering old geyser turning your 
                    routine upside down.

      ANGLE TO REVEAL

      Sikes who's heard all of this. He joins George who starts 
      out, now having Vessna and gear in tow.

                                  SIKES
                    George, calm down. I've heard of human 
                    women becoming emotional during the change, 
                    but --

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm not a human woman and I'm not going 
                    through the change. I haven't had any 
                    abdominal spasm and that's the litmus test 
                    -- so don't tell me anything.

                                  SIKES
                    Calm down George, so your water works are 
                    drying up, it's no big deal.

                                  GEORGE
                    This is not about my water works. Why must 
                      everything with you humans be sexual?

      George exits with Vessna, leaving Sikes to wonder.

      bathed in the glow of a streetlight.      INT FORD - NIGHT

      Bill Meelator cleans a gun while Jay Walker counts into 
      separate piles the stacks of twenty dollar bills like the 
      one found at the murder scene. Bill stuffs his cash in a 
      bag.

                                  BILL
                    I'm heading to Brazil, gonna buy me some 
                    desert property in the Amazon Basin.

                                  WALKER
                    We're not done yet.

                                  BILL
                    Not done?

      Walker produces a gun of his own.

                                  WALKER
                    Francisco killed my brother.

                                  BILL
                    Whoa, wait. You kill a cop and I'm dead 
                    meat, too. My deal was to help you break 
                    out and get the cash that's all.

                                  WALKER
                    The job's not done -- we'll stake him out 
                    and when the time's right, we'll slice him.

                                  BILL
                    Not me, I'm out.

                                  WALKER
                    We're a team.

                                  BILL
                    Not when it comes to killing a cop. That's 
                    dumb man. We got the money.

      Meelator starts to get out of the car, but Walker grabs him 
      and pulls him back in. Ad-libbing curses they begin to 
      grapple.

      Susan is working on her drawings as George enters the room.

                                  GEORGE
                    Vessna's out like a prizefighter --

                                  SUSAN
                    Do her eyes seem to be opening?

                                  GEORGE
                    No and I think the new -- old child care 
                    worker upset her routine.
                            (then)
                    Is buck upstairs?

                                  SUSAN (nodding)
                    I haven't said anything, I thought we 
                    should do this together.
                            (calling)
                    Buck! Buck, come down here!
                            (then)
                    I tried to reach you all afternoon where 
                    were you?

                                  GEORGE (covering)
                    Just working a case.

      After a beat Buck saunters in carrying his book bag, a 
      smile on his face.

                                  BUCK
                    Hey, Dad, Mum. I didn't hear you come in.

                                  GEORGE
                    We need to talk.

                                  BUCK
                    Can't now, going to the library.                                  SUSAN
                    Like you've been going to school for the 
                    last three weeks?

      This stops Buck in his tracks.

                                  GEORGE
                    Sit down, Buck.
                            (then)
                    Where have you been going?

                                  BUCK
                    To study.

                                  GEORGE
                    You are in enough trouble now without lying 
                    more!

                                  BUCK
                    I have been studying -- with the elders.

                                  GEORGE
                    The elders -- that's ridiculous.

                                  SUSAN
                    Buck, they are just old people with old 
                    ways.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well Susan, just because they are old, 
                    that's no reason to dismiss them.

                                  SUSAN
                    I didn't mean --

                                  BUCK
                    See, Dad understands.
                          (to George)
                    You're always talking about the importance 
                    of learning from our Elders.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well, yes, I did say that, but --

                                  BUCK
                    I want to become one, learn from them.                                  GEORGE
                    And just ignore your education?

                                  BUCK
                    What is education? For six years I've gone 
                    to human school to learn human ways. I've 
                    tried to give it a chance, but I'm just 
                      contracting. But even after just one day 
                    with the elders they opened up an entire 
                    world to me, the world of myself. After 
                    that, how do I go back to their high 
                    schools?

                                  GEORGE
                    Buck, I don't want you wasting your time!

                                  BUCK
                    Wasting my time? Reading contemporary 
                    American civics is a waste of time. All 
                    these people know are the experiences of 
                    one tiny planet. The elders know of a lot, 
                    they've experienced an entire universe.

                                  GEORGE (firm)
                    Well you are going to stay in school, their 
                    school, because we live on their 'tiny' 
                    planet. End of discussion.

      Buck stews for a moment, then exits, slamming the door 
      behind him.

      INT FRANCISCO BEDROOM - NIGHT

      George sits up in bed, still irritated by the previous 
      scene. Susan lies under the covers on her stomach eyeing 
      George.

                                  SUSAN
                    George, go to sleep, Buck is only sixteen, 
                    he'll grow out of this stage.

                                  GEORGE
                      I sometimes wonder.                                  SUSAN
                    Of course he will. He's spirited now, we 
                    all settle down as we grow older.

      George thinks about this, not sure he likes what he's 
      thinking. Susan is almost nodding off.

                                  GEORGE (fishing)
                    Have I settled down?

                                  SUSAN
                    Um-hum.

                                  GEORGE
                    So, you think of me as 'growing older?'

                                  SUSAN
                    Go to sleep, Neemu.

                                  GEORGE (a bit hurt)
                    I have plenty of spirit. People say that 
                    about me, you know.

      With this, George looks at Susan, smiles to himself and 
      begins slowly making his way humming up Susan's back. 
      During this Susan winces a couple of times obviously not 
      enjoying George's overzealous performance.

                                  SUSAN
                    George, be careful.
                            (beat)
                    Ow, George.

      George stops his humming and rolls over frustrated.

                                  GEORGE
                    You always like it when I'm a little rough 
                    on your hoved rakstafs.

                                  SUSAN
                    Well I do, but something's different.

                                  GEORGE (defensive)
                    Nothing's different. That's the way I 
                    always do it.                                  SUSAN
                    Then maybe your hummer is askew.

                                  GEORGE (indignant)
                    There is nothing wrong with my hummer.
                            (beat)
                    Maybe it's all just getting old for you.

      He stands up.

                                  SUSAN
                    George.

                                  GEORGE
                    There's nothing different with me, if 
                      anything's different it's with you.

      He gets up and goes into the bathroom closing the door 
      behind.


      INT BATHROOM - NIGHT (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

      A weary George examines himself in the mirror not pleased 
      with what he sees. He rubs his arm as if it is in slight 
      pain as a KNOCK is heard.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    Neemu, I'm sorry. It's just been a rough 
                    day, the kids, and work... I'm just tired. 
                    It doesn't have anything to do with you.

      Just then a jolt of pain doubles George over.

                                  GEORGE (trying to muffle it)
                    Augghhh!

                                  SUSAN (O.S.) (concerned)
                    George, are you alright?

      Just then he's hit with another jolt of pain which knocks 
      him to his knees.

                                  SUSAN (O.S.)
                    George.                                  GEORGE (covering)
                    I'm fine.

      He rips his pyjama shirt away from his abdomen and we can 
      see the muscles underneath rippling involuntarily.

                                  GEORGE
                    I'm fine...

      On George's look of fear and misery.

                                                                              FADE OUT

      INT FRANCISCO HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

      Susan enters, joining Emily at the kitchen island.

                                  SUSAN
                    Have you seen your father this morning, Em?

                                  EMILY
                    Nope. Sounded to me like you guys were 
                    arguing last night.

                                  SUSAN
                    It was nothing serious. But it's not like 
                    him to leave in the morning without telling 
                    me.

      Just then, George enters vigorously from the outside, 
      dressed in a jogging suit, immediately leaping into a few 
      deep knee bends and other warm down exercises. Emily and 
      Susan are clearly a bit confused.

                                  GEORGE
                    Good morning.

                                  SUSAN
                    Jogging, George?

                                  GEORGE
                    Just a few laps around the track with the 
                    other kids, I left them in dust.

                                  SUSAN
                    I thought you were getting ready for work, 
                    have you lost track of time?

      He opens the refrigerator and, upon searching, pulls out a 
      jar.

                                  GEORGE
                    There is plenty of time, Suse. I thought 
                    that this morning, I would whip up some 
                    breakfast and we could all sit down as 
                                  (MORE)                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    family and --

                                  SUSAN (interrupting)
                    I'm sorry, George, but I have an early 
                      conference this morning.

                                  GEORGE
                    Well okay, just you and me, Em.

                                  EMILY
                    I don't think so. I was up half the night 
                    eating, since I wasn't allowed to go to 
                    bed.

                                  GEORGE
                    But you used to love it when I made 
                      breakfast.

                                  EMILY
                    When I was a kid, Dad -- I have a life now.

                                  GEORGE
                    I suppose Buck's run off for the day as 
                    well.

                                  EMILY
                    Said he was going to school.

                                  GEORGE (disappointed)
                    No one wants to eat with the old man, huh? 
                    There was a time around here when we ate 
                    breakfast together, talked and acted like a 
                    family.

                                  SUSAN
                    We're still a family, sometimes its just -- 
                      different.

                                  GEORGE (childish)
                    Fine. Fine. Then I'll just make breakfast 
                    for myself.
                            (then, re: jar)
                    Suse, you know I like MARINATED arteries, 
                    better.

      George strains to open the jar.                                  SUSAN
                    I wanted something new for a change.

                                  EMILY (to Susan)
                    What's with Dad, did he get into the sour 
                    milk last night -- he seems pretty well 
                    hung this morning.

                                  GEORGE (tersely correcting)
                    The term is HUNG-OVER and no, I'm not. It's 
                    also very impolite to talk about someone 
                    while they're standing in the room -- like 
                    I'm some kind of doddering old geyser who 
                    can't understand a word you're saying.

      Emily shares a look with Susan.

                                  EMILY (giving up)
                    I have to go.

                                  GEORGE
                    Fine, if you can't stand the meat then get 
                    out of the kitchen.

      Emily grabs her books, rolls her eyes and exits. George 
      finally lets out a frustrated grunt giving the jar lid all 
      of his strength -- it won't open.

                                  GEORGE (irked)
                    Celine!

      He angrily shoves the jar away. Susan grabs the jar and 
      opens it without a second thought.

                                  GEORGE (throw away)
                    Well I loosened it.

                                  SUSAN
                    What's wrong with you?

                                  GEORGE
                    Who knows? Maybe nothing, maybe something 
                    -- maybe it's just that my 'hummer's 
                    askew.'                                  SUSAN
                    George, if this is about last night --

                                  GEORGE (interrupting)
                    Forget it, it's not important.

      George exits leaving Susan to wonder.

      EXT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY

      Sikes pulls up in his car alone, alights and then joins 
      Bert and Lois and other departmental personnel at work 
      behind the shell of what once was a car.

                    If you ask me it's a little early for a

      Sikes looks over to where she's indicating.

      ANGLE

      A jaunty George, wearing saddle oxfords, a polo sportshirt 
      and a college letter sweater is flirtatiously questioning 
      an attractive younger Newcomer women. After a beat, Sikes 
      joins and pulls George aside.

                                  GEORGE (not understanding)
                    Matthew, good morning. I got in early and 
                    caught a ride with Bert.
                            (then, winking to Sikes)
                    I'll be finishing my questioning of this 
                    witness now, detective.

      Sikes shrugs, shoots George a queer look and rejoins Lois 
      and Bert.                                  SIKES

                    Your buddy Walker.

      Sikes looks at the charred remains of the body and winces.

                    Silly me, I shoulda recognised him.

      Bert hands him a semi-charred wallet, and a bag with some 
      singed twenties.

                                  BERT
                            (re: wallet)
                    Found this on the body, smells so bad it 
                    would hairlip a dog -- interesting though.

      Sikes checks this charred out I.D. bracelet.

                                  SIKES
                    Walker's I.D. -- what's left of it.
                          (to Lois)
                    Need I ask cause of death?

                                  LOIS
                    I'll run the usual tests to be certain.

      Sikes takes the singed twenties.

                                  BERT
                    Part of the stash from the film vault.

                                  SIKES
                    Looks like Walker's buddy got greedy, took 
                    all the cash and left his partner to take 
                    the heat.

      Bert notices a jaunty George finishing up with the girl.

                                  BERT
                    Looks like your big man on campus got him a 
                    hot one too.

      Sikes rolls his eyes again in disbelief at George's       appearance.

      INT UNMARKED CAR - DAY

      With Sikes driving, George waves to the Newcomer girl as 
      they pull away from the curb. Sikes shakes his head.

                                  GEORGE

                    control.

      But we see George is not in control as we SLOWLY PUSH IN on 
      his face -- his concentration directed on the road ahead, 
      his expression noticeably alters.

      GEORGE'S POV

      This deserted two lane road they're on. Just then, away in 
      the distance, a semi truck appears -- it's heading in the 
      opposite direction they are, but in their lane...      RESUME

      George swallows, squinting, a sudden look of pain beginning 
      to erase his previous mood. Sikes concentrates on driving, 
      not noticing George.

      GEORGE'S HANDS

      begin to grip the seat tightly.

      RESUME

      With growing panic, George looks over at Sikes for his 
      reaction. Sikes continues driving...

      The truck about to plow into them...      RESUME

      In a flash, George jerks the steering wheel to the left, 
      much to the shock of Sikes.

                            (breaking down)
                    I'm dressed like a fool and flirting with a 
                    child.

                    It is none of your concern.

      George takes off and throws his shoes. He then shoulders 
      his door open and begins climbing out.

      George defiantly takes off his saddle shoes and Argyll 
      socks and tosses them away as well. He's now barefoot.

      Sikes tries to open the driver door, but it is jammed shut. 
      George begins running off in the distance as Sikes 
      desperately smashes his window and climbs out, calling 
      after him.

                    Just leave me alone!

      He doesn't follow, he merely slams his hand on the driver 
      door and picks up the car radio.

      EXT CITY STREET - DAY

      We see a confused Buck, carrying a bookbag, on the steps of 
      the Elders hall from earlier. The door slowly opens and 
      Balbalbut looks out.

                                  BALBALBUT
                    You are late.

                                  BUCK
                    My parents made me go to school -- human 
                    school.

                                  BALBALBUT
                    What did you learn?

                                  BUCK
                    Nothing -- just some stuff about a human 
                    named Custer. He was stupid, got all his 
                    men killed fighting a bunch of Native 
                      Americans.

                                  BALBALBUT
                    This Custer, he sounds interesting.

                                  BUCK
                    C'mon, his men never had a chance and he 
                    knew it.                                  BALBALBUT
                    Oh.

                                  BUCK
                    They just don't teach you anything at their 
                    school.

                                  BALBALBUT
                    Maybe, but what did you learn?

                                  BUCK
                    Learn?

                                  BALBALBUT
                    Custer?

                                  BUCK
                    Nothing -- He was just a human who let his 
                    pride be his ruin.

                                  BALBALBUT
                    Perhaps -- there is something to learn from 
                    these humans.

      Balbalbut goes back inside, leaving Buck to ponder these 
      words.

                    He came in and picked up Vessna and left 
                    just as quick. He was acting spaced or 
                      something. Running into desks, mumbling, 
                    and he wasn't wearing any shoes.                                  SIKES

                    Detective Sikes, I'm concerned about 
                    George. He wasn't making much sense and he 
                    said something about his hallucination?

                                  SIKES
                    Yeah, a sixteen wheeler.

                                  ALBERT
                    Visions like that are a sign that he is 
                      approaching primary Gahsac. It may only be 
                    a matter of hours now.

                    He's scared.

                                  DOC TARI
                    For many, the Gahsac is frightening. It's a 
                    point in one's life where he realises 
                    there's no going back -- and what's ahead 
                    is still cloudy.
                            (re: chart)
                    I would say tonight is George's night.

                    He will look and feel the same. He will 
                    change somewhat innerly. But I don't want 
                    to lie to you. The actual Gahsac change 
                    will bring on temporary loss of vision and 
                    weakness, pain and -- other side effects in 
                    George.

                                  SIKES

                    There're usually no problems -- but at 
                    George's early age, the Gahsac could be 
                      traumatic. Very traumatic.

                    eight more cycles left.

                                  GEORGE
                    That is what I thought. But the doctor's 
                    sure.

                    I'm supposed to pick them up at the library 
                    later. George, I want to be with you.

                                  GEORGE
                    No, Susan, it's alright. I'll be fine,

      George looks, somewhat like a frightened child.

                                  GEORGE (remembering)
                      I remember once, when I was young, a number 
                    of us had been left on a small planet 
                    awaiting a transport ship. It was a 
                    beautiful place -- a surprisingly serene 
                    place. Well, as we were being transported 
                    off, I remember feeling this tremendous 
                    longing for this piece of my life that I 
                    would never be able to return to and 
                    fearful of where I was going next.

                    {Where ever you go I'll be with you.}

      George hangs up, then removes the phone from it's cradle.

      We then go to Susan who ponders for a beat, then dials her 
      phone.

      his hands as if with discomfort. His breathing is becoming 
        increasingly laboured and he begins to shiver. INTERCUT

      EXT FRANCISCO HOUSE - DAY

      Outside, we see a Newcomer from behind, stalking around the 
      house very suspiciously. As he turns to contemplate his 
      options, we see it is none other than Jay Walker. He moves 
      in, toward the rear of the house...

      George breathes harder and harder. He begins rubbing his 
      temples and squinting his eyes...

      GEORGE'S POV

      He looks up at the chandler, but we see it go in and out of 
      focus, then fade in and out of blackness -- George is 
      losing his sight. We go to black.

      RESUME

        A frightened George feels around then grips the table as if 
      to steady himself from a sudden sharp pain. His look is one 
      of determined intensity.

                    The victim we found in the car didn't burn 
                    to death, he was stabbed.

                                  BERT
                    Crispy critter also wasn't Walker -- I did 
                    genetic tests -- body belonged to Bill 
                    Meelator.

                    Walker's ID?

                                  BERT
                    Maybe Walker wanted you to think he was 
                    dead.

                                  ZEPEDA
                    Then where the hell is he?

      Zepeda ponders.

      INT FRANCISCO HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY

      START ON the phone, off the hook, then RACK FOCUS to the 
      sliding glass patio doors where Jay Walker comes into 
      frame, peering menacingly in, checking around to see if 
      George is in sight. He pulls out his signature knife and 
      slides the door open, quickly entering the home...

      GEORGE remains at the dining room table, it is clear his 
      sight is gone as his focus is scattered, his expression a 
      bit more fear-filled -- we can only imagine what is going 
      through his mind as he stares somewhat blankly, as if in 
      the midst of an intense daydream...

      WALKER doing his best to remain silent, stalks through the 
      den, into the hallway that boarders the dining room -- his 
      knife glistens as he approaches the open door and peers       carefully into the dining room at...

      GEORGE who's gahsac daydream continues, inaudibly mumbling 
      to himself.

      WALKER wipes the knife down, as if to shine it for the 
      kill...

      INT FRANCISCO HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      Walker steps into the dining room directly in front of 
      George's sight line. Walker smiles, but gets no reaction 
      from George who is looking straight at him, but clearly not 
      seeing. Perplexed, Walker takes another step toward George 
      and waves his hand, then realising George is blind. 
      Suddenly, a knocking comes at the front door, starting both 
      George and Walker.

                                  SIKES (OS)
                    George, open up, it's me. George?

      A weakening George stands and begins feeling his way toward 
      the front door, moving mere inches past Walker who must now 
      alter his plans.

      ANGLE FRONT DOOR

      George finds the door, not opening it immediately. Walker, 
      at his heels, stealthily hides behind the front door, 
        anticipating George opening it.

                                  GEORGE (struggling)
                    Matthew, I'm fine, really.

                                  SIKES (OS) (sarcastic)
                    Oh yeah, you sound great.
                            (then)
                    Look, I'm not gonna interfere, I just want 
                    to hang around, just in case.

      George thinks about this, then opens the door revealing 
      Sikes. As Sikes steps in...

                                  SIKES
                    You don't look so good...

      But before he can get the whole sentence out, Walker steps 
      out and cold cocks Sikes on the head with the butt of the       knife handle. Sikes collapses toward George who falls with 
      Sikes.

                                  GEORGE
                    Matthew?
                            (then)
                    Who's there?

      Walker doesn't answer -- but keeps approaching. Walker then 
      takes note as George, on his knees next to the unconscious 
      Sikes, grabs his stomach in pain.

                                  WALKER
                    Gahsac? Kinda young aren't ya?

                                  GEORGE (recognises voice)
                    Walker --

      George's wheels turn as he tries to flip Sikes over. In 
      doing so...

      GEORGE'S HAND

      Comes upon Sikes' holstered gun...

      RESUME

      George leans over Sikes' body as if to finish flipping him 
      over, but grabs his gun, spins and fires.

      He hits Walker in the leg with the first shot, sending a 
      surprised and yelping Walker falling backward over the 
      coffee table. But, that's all George gets from the weapon 
      as it jams on him. With desperation, he tosses it away and 
      staggers toward the kitchen, fighting his blindness and 
      weakness.

      WALKER dazed, checks his bloody leg, and tries to shake out 
      the cobwebs. He retrieves his knife and watches as George 
      disappears into the kitchen.

                                  WALKER (yelling)
                    I'm gonna dice you up good now, Francisco!

      GEORGE falls to the floor partly from pain, partly from 
      blindness. He can hear the approaching Walker.                                  WALKER (OS)
                    You're a dead man, Francisco!

      George, lying on the floor under the sink, feels his way, 
      opening up the under-sink cupboard. With only his wits 
      left, he feels around, his hand resting upon an aerosol can 
      and some wires leading from the garbage disposal.

                                  WALKER (OS)
                      Francisco!

      Just then, the kitchen swinging doors burst open, revealing 
      the bleeding Walker, his knife poised to kill...

      GEORGE fumbles quickly, pulling the wires, causing sparks, 
      flipping the lid from the aerosol can as...

      SCENE

      Walker rushes in to pounce, the knife about to be plunged 
      into George as...

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      George raises the sparking wires and sprays the aerosol can 
      on then, creating a temporary torch that flames upward into 
      Walker's face and eyes, stumbles over a chair and lands 
      clumsily.

      George heaves a sigh of relief as he remains on the floor. 
      A semi-groggy Sikes appears, taking note of the incapable 
      Walker, then joins George.

                                  SIKES
                    It's okay, George, it's over.

                                  GEORGE
                    No, my gahsac is --

      George's expression takes on many faces -- fear, joy, pain 
      and wonder -- alternating with each other for seconds at a 
      time. George's breathing continues to be irregular.

                                  GEORGE
                    My gahsac -- Oh, Matthew, it's...

      But again, George drifts off to another place, as Sikes 
      cradles him in friendship.                                  SIKES
                    It's okay, George, it's okay.

      We then PULL BACK on this touching moment, friend helping 
      friend.

      DISSOLVE TO

      INT FRANCISCO HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      George stands looking at his family. Emily and Buck are 
      asleep in front of the glowing TV, while Susan sits near 
      Vessna's crib.

      Susan joins George, wrapping her arms around him.

                                  SUSAN
                    Oh, George, are you sure you're --

                                  GEORGE
                    I am better than I have ever been.
                            (then, re: O.S.)
                    Your car isn't in the garage.

                                  SUSAN
                    It died halfway up the drive. I'll call the 
                    mechanic again tomorrow.

                                  GEORGE
                    No. Let's just get a new one.

      They touch temples. George closes the front door, then 
      looks at each of his children.

                                  GEORGE
                    I was thinking, Susan -- perhaps we should 
                    let Emily experiment with human sleep 
                    patterns. And it probably won't hurt for 
                    Buck to study the old ways, as long as he 
                    learns the new ones as well.

      He looks into Vessna's crib and extracts a set of measuring 
      spoons and smiles.                                  SUSAN
                    Measuring spoons, can you believe it, she 
                    won't let go of them.

                                  GEORGE
                    It's good for her to use her imagination -- 
                    a very wise man told me that.
                            (then)
                    Look.

      THEIR POV

      Baby Vessna finally opens her eyes and is gazing up at her 
      parents.

      RESUME

      Susan and George touch temples, their loving expressions 
      glow.

                                  SUSAN
                    Our children are getting older.

                                  GEORGE
                    And so am I.

      Vessna closes her eyes.

                                  SUSAN
                    She'll sleep now.

                                  GEORGE
                            (re: Buck and Emily)
                    Our children are getting older.
                            (beat)
                    And so am I.

      Susan cuddles next to him sexually.

                                  SUSAN
                    Why don't we go to our room? And you can 
                    show me how an old dog turns a good trick.

      They share a smile. On his devilish look we...

                                                                              FADE OUT                                        THE END
