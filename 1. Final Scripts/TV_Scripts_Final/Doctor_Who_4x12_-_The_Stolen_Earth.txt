11EXT. SUBURBAN STREET -- DAY

      CU on THE DOCTOR, racing out of the TARDIS door -  

      WIDE SHOT, as he stops dead.  It's the most ordinary street
      in the world; a good distance away, a MILKMAN and his float. 
      DONNA steps out, but stays by the Tardis. 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...but it's fine.  Everything's
                    fine.  Nothing's wrong.  All fine!
                          (yells across)
                    'Scuse me!  What day is it?

                                      MILKMAN
                    Saturday.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Saturday.  Good.  I like Saturdays.

                                      DONNA
                    ...so I just met Rose Tyler?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yep.

            DW4 - Ep 12 - Pink
                                      DONNA
                    But she's locked away in a parallel
                    world, yeah?

        www.thewriterstale.com
                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Exactly.  If she could cross from
                    her parallel world, to your parallel
                    world, then that means the walls
                    of the universe are breaking down. 
                    Which puts everything in danger,
                      everything!  But how...?! 

      He runs back to the Tardis, Donna follows, door slams shut.

      The Milkman's strolling back to his float.  But he hears a
      noise.  A rattling.  Ting-ting-ting.  Glass.  He looks...

      The empty milk bottles in their crates are shivering, just
      a little, ting-ting-ting...

      He walks closer, puzzled...

      They rattle, harder.  Shaking.

      The milkman looks round.  Tiny, fractional CAMERA SHAKE.

      He sees a couple of slates slide off a roof...

      HIGH SHOT on the Milkman, as he looks up.  In horror...

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 12 - Shooting Script - 12/02/08       page 2.



22INT. TARDIS - DAY

      THE DOCTOR at the console, busy.  DONNA calmer.

                                      DONNA
                    Thing is though, Doctor.  No matter
                    what's happening, and I'm sure
                    it's bad, I get that, but...  Rose
                    is coming back.  Isn't that good?

      And for the first time, he allows himself the biggest smile.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yeah.

      WHUMPH!  CAMERA SHAKE, just one, big jolt.  Then nothing.

                                      DONNA
                    What the hell was that..?!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Wasn't us - came from outside -

      - and he runs down the ramp, opens the door, Donna following -

      FX: the door opens onto black, empty space.  Just dusty
            DW4 - Ep 12 - Pink
      swirls of gas and a few small, lonely rocks tumbling past.

        www.thewriterstale.com
                    that happen, what did you do?

      He runs back to the console - slams switches - impossible! -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    ...we haven't moved, we're fixed -
                    it can't have!  No! 

      - runs all the way back to Donna at the door.  Stunned.

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    The Tardis is still in the same
                    place.  But the Earth has gone. 
                    The entire planet!  It's gone!

      NEW YORK.

      She lifts herself up.  It's an office block, smart, swanky,
      all desks & smoked glass, though now in disarray, everything
      having been jolted about, though now still.  Other WORKERS
      & UNIT SOLDIERS picking themselves up from the floor.

                                      MARTHA
                    What was that?  Some sort of
                      earthquake, or..?  Jalandra, you
                    all right?  Wikowsky?  Anyone hurt?

      Mutters of 'No,' 'I'm okay,' etc. everyone slowly standing.

      SUZANNE, 20s, is by the window.  Looks at Martha, terrified.

                    Doctor Jones.  You'll come with

      And into another CORRIDOR -  lined with a wall of CABINETS,
      floor to ceiling, each with a three pronged handle. 

      The Soldier turns a handle - the cabinets SLIDE open to

                    Project Indigo, it's not safe -

                    You'll take your orders from UNIT,

      Martha's already hauling it on, strapping up, the soldier
      helping, buckles clicking into place, and during this -

                                      MARTHA
                    But why me?

                                      GENERAL SANCHEZ
                    You're our only hope.  Of finding
                    the Doctor.  But failing that...
                          (quieter, sad)
                    If no help is coming...  Then with
                    the power invested in me by the
                    Unified Intelligence Taskforce, I
                    authorise you, to take this.

      From his pocket: an electronic KEY, a square of metal, on
      a chain.  Martha knows what it means, horrified.

                    You know what to do.  For the sake
                    of the Human Race.

      Scared, in awe of the Key, she takes it.

      PRAC FX: EXPLOSION at the far end of the corridor as the

      GWEN & IANTO looking at him, fearing the worst.

                    Humans here!  Prepare the Crucible!

      Then, over COMMS, a cold, clever, quiet voice:

                                      VOICE OOV
                    Supreme Dalek.  Is there news?

4949INT. CRUCIBLE VAULTS - NIGHT

      (Command Deck redressed.)  Sinister, quiet.  A dark, echoing
      chamber, with three free-standing computer banks arranged
      in a wide semi-circle, a silent DALEK at each one.

      Still, only the voice.  A FIGURE hidden in shadow.

                    We are beyond the Doctor's reach!

      CUT TO CU of a black & silver DALEK base, gliding forward...

                                      VOICE
                      Fascinating.  If I had not elevated
                    you beyond crude emotions, I could
                    almost mistake that tone for one
                    of victory.  Beware your pride.

      Travelling up, to find CU HAND.  A metal hand, chrome,
      jointed fingers, poised over switches built into the base.

                                      SUPREME DALEK OOV
                    The Doctor cannot stop us!

                    And yet, Dalek Caan is uneasy.

      The HAND flicks a switch.

      A SPOTLIGHT SLAMS ON, far end of the chamber, throwing
      into harsh relief, on a plinth of its own, a holy relic...

            DW4 - Ep 12 - Pink
      A weird shape.  A Dalek that's been opened, gutted and
      melted, its harsh lines now curved and warped; DALEK CAAN.

                                      SUPREME DALEK OOV
        www.thewriterstale.com

                                      VOICE
                    Show respect.  Without Dalek Caan,
                    none of this would be possible. 
                    And he speaks only the truth. 

      CUT CLOSER.  In the middle of the warped, open shell sits
      a DALEK MUTANT, tentacles stirring. This creature is more
      distorted than ever, its skin bubbled.  One blind eye
      staring out; voice ancient, sing-song, mad.

                                      DALEK CAAN
                    ...he is coming.  The threefold
                    man, he dances in the lonely places. 
                    Oh, creator of us all.  The Doctor
                    is coming...

5050INT. SHADOW ARCHITECT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Lights low, quiet, all strangely calm.  JUDOON, one
      UNHELMETED, standing back, on guard.  THE DOCTOR hunched
      over the terminal, hard at work, but frustrated, getting
      nowhere, with the SHADOW ARCHITECT beside him.

      But all this seen from a distance.  By DONNA.  She's
      exhausted, sits alone towards the back of the room.

      She's been crying, a little.  Wipes her face.  Sits there.

      And then...

      SLOW ZOOM into Donna.  She's just staring to the middle
      distance, lost in thought.  But as the zoom creeps closer...

      Natural sound lowers, muffled, then fading to nothing... 

      Bring in a new sound...

      Softly, but getting stronger...

        A heartbeat.

      Closer on Donna, staring...

      Louder...

      She snaps out of it as someone steps into foreground -
      It's an ALBINO SERVANT.  A gaunt, white woman, 20's, red
      eyes, humble, black robes.  She offers Donna a china bowl.

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    You need sustenance.  Take the

      Donna takes the bowl.  But the Albino stays, staring.

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    There was something on your back.

                    How d'you know that?

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    You are something new. 

                                      DONNA
                    Not me, love.  I'm just a temp. 
                      Shorthand, filing, 100 words per
                    minute, fat lot of good that is
                    now.  I'm no use to anyone.

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    I'm so sorry for your loss.

                                      DONNA
                    Yeah.  My whole planet's gone.

                                      ALBINO SERVANT
                    I mean the loss that is yet to
                    come.  God save you.

      The Albino walks away, Donna unnerved - then, calling across -

                    something coming, some sort of

                          (to Donna)
                    The Tandocca Scale is a series of
                      wavelengths used as a carrier signal
                    by Migrant Bees.  Infinitely small! 
                    No wonder we didn't see it, it's
                    like looking for a speck of cinnamon
                    in the Sahara, but look -

      Donna runs to join him, seeing on the terminal, GRAPHICS:
      a MAP OF SPACE, with tiny, faint, dust-like trails -

                    There it is.  The Tandocca trail. 
                    The transmat that moved the planets
                    was using the same wavelength, we
                    can follow the path!

                                      DONNA
                    And find the Earth?!  Well come on

      CUT TO WILF.  He's a good distance away, hidden in the
      shadows of an alley.  Grim.  Holding a PAINT GUN.  SYLVIA,

      wall, furious, glaring, but powerless. 

      IANTO sitting separately, desolate. 

      GWEN sitting apart, upset.  Hearing, under the music: Dalek
      radio voices, ADR; taunting, crowing about victory.

                                                                            MIX TO:

      Sarah Jane Smith, with no hope.

      A sound.

      In all three locations.  (Sc.63, 64, 65 now continuing,
        intercutting constantly.)  The noise is like a radio tuning
      in, white noise shashing.  And under that, fluctuating...

                    ...can anyone hear me?  The Subwave
                    Network is open.  You should be
                    able to hear my voice.  Is there
                    anyone there..?

      CUT TO SARAH JANE'S ATTIC.  SARAH JANE & LUKE hearing this.

                                    LUKE

                    Some poor soul calling for help.

      The Nobles have got an old COMPUTER on a dresser.  The

                    The whole world's crying out. 
                    Just leave it.

      Harriet leans forward, presses a button.

      On Mr Smith's screen, Gwen's terminal, and the Nobles'
      computer, the image divides into four; displaying COMPUTER
      POVs of HARRIET, TORCHWOOD, SARAH JANE, the fourth square
      still just white noise.  (Rose, Sylvia & Wilf staring at
      the same display, listening to every word, unable to
      communicate - everything they say goes unheard.)

                    failed.  A testament, don't you

      The Doctor looks at her, eh?

      Donna's just smiling.  The Doctor looks the other way...

      Far off in the distance, as far away as possible, on a
      cold and empty ordinary street...

      A woman.  Walking towards them.

      ROSE.

      And the Doctor smiles.
