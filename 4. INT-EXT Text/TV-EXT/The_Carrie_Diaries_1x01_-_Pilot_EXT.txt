      CLOSE ON Carrie's face in her mother's glamorous sunglasses 
      as she looks up at her high school - a place so familiar, yet 
      almost foreign with every thing she has been through.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    The first day of school was something 
                    I usually found exciting. A new 
                    beginning with endless possibilities. 
                    But the last time I had stood on 
                    these steps, my father had come to 
                    tell me my life as I knew was about 
                    to come to an end.   I was afraid to 
                    walk through those doors.  So much 
                    had changed for me.  But in those 
                    halls so much remained the same.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL Carrie - insecure, hesitant - surrounded 
      by laughing, giddy students rushing up the stairs, ready to 
      start their new year.  Carrie takes a breath and walks up the 
      stairs.  Hesitant, she opens the door.  It creaks, loudly.  
      She takes a breath and enters.  WE SEE...



                                  MAGGIE (V.O.)
                    Even his name is cool.  

      An Olympic size pool.  Kids running everywhere.  CARRIE 
      stands on the high dive.  HER POV SEBASTIAN KYDD, already 
      handsome with an edge of cocky, watching her.  Their eyes 
      lock, she breaks the moment by leaping gracefully off the 
      board&

                                  MAGGIE (V.O.)
                    Kicked out of three boarding schools. 
                    His parents are totally rich.  He 
                    drives a Corvette.  Super fox.



      Carrie and Sebastian sit side-by-side, feet dangling in the 
      pool.  It's the end of the day--everyone else is gone.

                                  CARRIE
                    I can t believe you don t know Atari 
                      Adventure.                                                                         24.


                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Space Invaders.  That s my game.

                                  CARRIE
                      Seriously? Adventure is so cool. You 
                    have to get this magic chalice to the 
                    gold castle and there s these dragons 
                    that want to kill you.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    So you re the princess who slays her 
                    own dragons, huh?

                                  CARRIE
                    Somebody has to. Might as well be me.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    I d slay a dragon for you.

      He leans toward her.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I knew he was going to kiss me. So I 
                    did what any scared fourteen-year-old 
                    girl would do. 

      She pushes him in the water. As he falls he grabs onto her 
      leg taking her with him.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Now you re in for it.

      Carrie laughs, as he scoops her up into his arms to toss her 
      across the pool. They are both aware of the their proximity 
      to one another.  He puts her down gently, arms still wrapped 
      around her waist.  They are now face to face.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I wasn t sure who leaned in first.

      They begin to kiss--a  deep, tender kiss.  Carrie wraps her 
      arms around his neck as the kiss deepens.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    But there we were. Kissing.  My first 
                    kiss.

      They break a part. Just a little bit.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    My parent s are putting in a pool.  
                    It s almost done.

      Carrie nods.                                                                       25.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I knew in that moment, once he had 
                    his own pool, I would never see him 
                    again.  And I was right...



      Tom grills hamburgers. Carrie sets the table while Dorrit 
      listens to her Walkman, super loud.                                                                       26.


                                  TOM
                    So how was school today, you guys?

      Dorrit bops to her music not hearing her dad.

                                  CARRIE
                    I didn t pass out. If that s what 
                    you re asking.

      Tom puts down his tongs and walks over.  The phone rings.

                                  DORRIT
                    I got it.

      She runs off.

                                  TOM
                    She can t hear me, but the phone no 
                    problem?

                                  CARRIE
                    It s a teenage thing. We have special 
                      phone-hearing powers.

                                  TOM
                    Notice you didn t jump up for it.

                                  CARRIE
                    No one to jump up for.

                                  TOM
                    So...

                                  CARRIE
                    So?

                                  TOM
                    I talked to one of my buddies at the 
                    law firm I used to work for...

                                  CARRIE
                    Are you giving up your practice?

                                  TOM
                    No, sweetie.  I was talking to him 
                    about you. Your guidance counselor 
                    and I thought it might be good for 
                    you to take on an internship.  For 
                    school credit, of course.

                                  CARRIE
                    Like, work in a office?

      Tom nods.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    That could be cool.  Where?                                                                       27.


                                  TOM
                    At my friend s firm. In Manhattan.

      Carrie jumps up, practically hyperventilating.

                                  CARRIE
                    No way! No way!

                                  TOM
                    So you like this idea?

      She squeals and hugs her dad hard!



      Carrie looks up at what will become her fashion mecca.



      Carrie, with a small bag from the store, exits with Larissa 
      close behind her.  The alarms go off.  Larissa keeps moving 
      but Carrie stops, nervous.  Is she the reason the alarm is 
      going off?  A SECURITY GUARD comes out of the store.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Miss.  Miss.

      Carrie looks at him.

                                  CARRIE
                    Me?

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Yes.  Can I look in your bag?

      Carrie hands him the bag.  He looks in it.

                                  CARRIE
                    Umm, sure.  Here s my receipt. One 
                    pair of nude panty hose.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Sorry.  Must have been a false alarm.  
                    Happens all the time.



      Larissa hugs Carrie.  She unbuttons her jacket, revealing the 
      jumpsuit.

                                    LARISSA
                    That whole innocent, young thing you 
                    have going.  You could come in handy, 
                    Miss Carrie Bradshaw. I might have to 
                    keep you around.  I collect people, 
                    you know.

                                  CARRIE
                    What does that even mean??

                                    LARISSA
                    Some people collect art or like my 
                    mother...
                          (she shudders)
                                  (MORE)                                                                       37.

                                    LARISSA (CONT'D)
                      ...porcelain frogs.  I collect 
                    people.  

                                  CARRIE
                    I guess we re less creepy.  Do you 
                    need money or something?

                                    LARISSA
                    No, why?

                                  CARRIE
                    Because you just stole...

                                    LARISSA
                    The jumpsuit?  When I was a teenager, 
                    I used to steal lipstick from 
                      Woolworth s and as an adult I ve just 
                    upped the ante a little bit.  I like 
                    the thrill.

                                  CARRIE
                    I ve never stolen anything before.

                                    LARISSA
                          (loves her)
                    You have to come out with me tonight.  
                    We re starting at Odeon.

                                  CARRIE
                    As in the restaurant your magazine 
                    did a write up of down in Tribeca. 
                          (quoting)
                     In the hinterlands of lower 
                      Manhattan... 

                                    LARISSA
                       ...exists a place so magical.  I 
                    wrote that piece. Mostly so I could 
                    get free champagne and frites.  How 
                    have you never been there? 

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                      I couldn t decide whether to admit I 
                    was a high school student from 
                      Connecticut who had never been 
                    anywhere.  Or create a life for 
                    myself.  The life I wanted.  

                                  CARRIE
                    There s this guy I hooked up with 
                    from my office and he always hangs 
                    out there so...

                                    LARISSA
                    So screw him.  He doesn t own Odeon.  
                    We do.  Meet me at my office at six.                                                                       38.



      Carrie hails a cab in the fabulous neon poof dress. She looks 
      amazing.  It s magical, just like a movie.  A taxi screeches 
      to a halt in front of her.  She opens the door...

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    As my head buzzed with the 
                      possibilities of the night, I 
                    wondered where this chariot would 
                    take me.  To the New Beginnings dance 
                    and Sebastian? Or to Larissa and a 
                    new world?  



      A taxi pulls up and the door opens.  A leg peeks out, it s 
      Carrie.  She gets out of the car and looks up in awe.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I had kept my promise to take a cab.

      THE CAMERA SPINS from Carrie s face to the object of her awe.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Bitchy Barbara was right. This dress 
                    didn t belong at a dance. It belonged 
                    here in this city.  And so did I.

      The neon sign for Odeon is like a beacon for Carrie.  She 
      walks up to the door, takes a deep breath and heads inside.



      Carrie holds the phone as it rings.  And rings.

                                  CARRIE 
                    Come on, Dad.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    While I was getting no answer, The 
                    Mouse was getting an answer she 
                    didn t like.



      Carrie and her crew fall out of a taxi.  It's like the most 
      glamorous clown car ever.  Carrie looks up, amazed.

                                  CARRIE
                      Danceteria??

      There s a line of people around the block but Larissa and her 
      entourage walk right up to the front. The velvet rope lifts.  
      Larissa puts her arm around a star struck Carrie.  

                                    LARISSA
                    Stick with me, kid.                                                                       47.



      Sebastian and Donna sit on the bleachers. It is only them.

                                  DONNA
                    Well, that dance was lame.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    You looked like you were having a 
                    good time.

                                  DONNA
                    I m always having fun.  Even if I 
                    have to make my own.  

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Oh really? And how do you do that?

      She stands up, taking his hand and pulling him up.

                                  DONNA
                    Come with me.  I ll show you.

      Sebastian smiles.  He s game.



      Maggie is throwing up in the bushes while Walt holds back her 
      hair.  She wipes off her mouth.  

                                  MAGGIE
                    I m sorry, Walt.  You re so good to 
                    me.  I m an asshole.

                                  WALT
                    It s okay.  You re my asshole.

      A police car slowly drives into the parking lot, shining it s 
      lights in Maggie and Walt s eyes.  Both are nervous.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Just act normal.

      The police car pulls up next to them and the window goes 
      down.  A YOUNG POLICE OFFICER looks at them suspicious.                                                                       50.


                                  YOUNG POLICE OFFICER
                      Everything alright here?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Fine.  

                                  YOUNG POLICE OFFICER
                            (recognizing Maggie)
                    Very good.  You kids be careful.

      He drives off, leaving a very relieved Walt and Maggie.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Pays to be the police chief s 
                    daughter.

                                  WALT
                    I ll say.

      Walt watches the tail lights of the police car fade away as 
      he does he sees Donna slipping out of Sebastian s Corvette. 



      Carrie walks down her leafy, suburban neighborhood street, 
      practically sashaying to her house.

                                  CARRIE
                    You must be my lucky star.  Cause you 
                    shine on me...

      She swings several of Larissa's necklaces around.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                      ...wherever you are.  I just think of 
                    you and I start to...

      As she rounds the corner, she sees her house with two cop 
      cars in the driveway.  She starts to run to the house, 
      panicked. Her dad is outside.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    I m here. I m here.  I m sorry I m 
                    late!

                                  TOM
                    It s Dorrit.  She s missing.

      OFF CARRIE, filled with fear as she looks at her father s 
      worried face.


                                    END OF ACT IV                                                                       51.


                              ACT V - THE NEXT DAY



                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I wasn t sure if I was growing up, 
                    growing apart from him, or just 
                    acting my age. But in that little 
                    lie, I knew things were changing.

      Carrie spots Walt sitting outside at the picnic table, 
      reading Interview magazine.

                                  CARRIE
                    Hey.

      He shuts the magazine. So excited to see her.

                                  WALT
                    I want details. Every last one.

                                  CARRIE
                    It was amazing.

                                  WALT
                    How amazing?

                                  CARRIE
                    I m grounded for life.  

                                  WALT
                    That good?

                                  CARRIE
                    My dad thinks I was at the school 
                    dance so...

                                  WALT
                    Cover for you? Of course.

                                  CARRIE
                    I met a girl who works at Interview 
                    magazine.  She took me to Odeon and 
                      Danceteria.

                                  WALT
                    No way. Did you see anyone famous?  
                    What were people wearing?

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    I looked at Walt as if for the first 
                    time. His love of fashion, his desire 
                    to escape this town, his family...                                                                       55.


                                  WALT
                    Ucch, all we did here was pretend to 
                    care about a stupid football game.  

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                      I wondered in that moment if Walt was 
                    telling lies, too.  If there were 
                    secrets he was keeping from me.  Or 
                    maybe didn t even know himself.

                                  CARRIE
                    How was the dance?

                                  WALT
                    How do you think it was?  Maggie got 
                    wasted. And Donna hooked her claws 
                    into the new kid.

                                  CARRIE
                      Sebastian?

                                  WALT
                    Saw her sliding out of his car late 
                    night. She s such a ho.

                                  CARRIE
                          (disappointed)
                    He stopped by my house yesterday.  I 
                    thought maybe...

                                  WALT
                    He likes you? Just  cause he hooked 
                    up with Donna doesn t mean he doesn t 
                    like you.  It just means he ain t 
                    worthy of you.

                                  CARRIE
                          (fishing)
                    Like Maggie is of you?

                                  WALT
                    I m not sure she is. That s why I 
                    don t want to have sex with her. 

                                  CARRIE
                          (confused)
                    You guys haven t?

                                  WALT
                    No.  I must be the only seventeen 
                    year old guy who is saying no to his 
                      girlfriend.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.) 
                    I didn t understand.  If Maggie was 
                    no longer a virgin and Walt had said 
                    no, who had said yes?                                                                         56.


      SFX the roar of Corvette pulling up to the Barn.  Walt and 
      Carrie look over at the sound.

                                  WALT
                    Oh look, it s the new kid.

      They watch Sebastian and Donna LaDonna get out of the car.

                                  CARRIE
                    And Donna.  I should go.

      Sebastian looks over, sees Carrie.  Their eyes lock.

                                  WALT
                    Don t go  cause of him.

                                  CARRIE
                    No, I promised my dad I d be home to 
                    help with something. 

      She gives him a kiss on the cheek and heads off, walking 
      right past Sebastian and Donna, head held high. 

                                  SEBASTIAN (O.C.)
                          (calling out)
                    Carrie. Carrie! Wait.

      Carrie stops and turns to see Sebastian heading towards her.

                                  CARRIE
                    What s up?

      As Donna and Walt look on...

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    Look, I just want to explain... this 
                    isn t what you think.

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, it s exactly what I think.  

                                  DONNA
                          (calling out)
                      Sebastian, are you coming? 

      He looks at Carrie.  

                                  CARRIE
                    You should go.  See you around.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                    That s it?

                                  CARRIE
                          (confident; smiling)
                    For now.                                                                       57.


      Carrie walks off, feeling surprisingly in control of the 
      moment. Sebastian watches her leave.  Donna takes in the 
      situation.  Not liking what she sees.  Her animosity towards 
      Carrie is growing.  



      Walt sits with his Interview magazine - the one with Rob Lowe 
      on the cover.  He lingers on the inside photo spread of the 
      actor and then quickly shuts it as if caught.                                                                       59.


                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Of who you thought you might be.  



      A police car sits at the end of the street.  Maggie looks 
      around and then gets into it.  She sits down in the passenger 
      seat next to the YOUNG POLICEMAN who checked on her and Walt 
      at the dance.

                                  CARRIE (V.O.)
                    Of your innocence.

                                  YOUNG POLICE OFFICER
                    No one saw you right?

                                  MAGGIE
                          (shaking her head no)
                    No one.

      They start passionately kissing.



      Carrie swims.  She stops, sensing someone s gaze.  She looks 
      up.  It s Sebastian.

                                  CARRIE
                    I thought you didn t like swimming.

                                  SEBASTIAN
                          (with meaning)
                    I don t.   

      He smiles at her.  She smiles back.  And then he canonballs 
      into the pool, splashing her.  She squeals and splashes him 
      back AS THE CAMERA PANS to the Jens watching their every 
      move.  The Jens look at each other.

                                  THE JENS
                    Donna is going to be so pissed.

      Carrie doesn t notice them.  Blissfully unaware that the most 
      popular and vengeful girls in the school now have their 
      sights on her.
