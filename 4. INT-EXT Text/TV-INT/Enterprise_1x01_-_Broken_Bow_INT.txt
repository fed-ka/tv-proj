               CAPTAIN JONATHAN ARCHER and CHIEF ENGINEER, COMMANDER 
               CHARLIE

               (CHARLIE) TUCKER sit side by side in the cramped cockpit. 
               Archer, early 40's, is in civilian clothing. Unlike the 
               Starfleet Captains in centuries to come, he exhibits a sense 
               of wonder and excitement. Charlie, early 30's, is a 
               Southerner who enjoys using his offbeat, often sarcastic 
               sense of humor to disarm people.

               They're both looking straight up through a ceiling PORTAL 
               at a section of the HULL.

                                     CHARLIE
                         The Ventral Plating Team says 
                         they'll be done in about three days.

                                     ARCHER
                         Be sure they match the color to the 
                         nacelle housings.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You aiming to sit on the hull and 
                         pose for some postcards?

                                     ARCHER
                         Maybe...

               He continues to look upward and inspect the hull.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         God, she's beautiful

                                     CHARLIE
                         And fast.
                              (beat)
                         Warp four point five next Thursday.

                                     ARCHER
                              (awed)
                         Neptune and back in six minutes.
                              (beat)
                         Let's take a look at the lateral 
                         sensor array.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Give me a sec.

               Charlie whips the control throttle to his left 
               (intentionally harder than he needs to).


               Archer looks a little queasy --he's obviously not 
               comfortable in such a tiny vessel.  Charlie is enjoying this 
               --he likes to get a rise out of people.

                                     CHARLIE
                         If I didn't know better, I'd think 
                         you were afraid of flying.

                                     ARCHER
                         If I'm afraid of anything, it's the 
                         scrambled eggs I had for breakfast.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Pretty soon you'll be dreaming 
                         about scrambled eggs. I hear the new 
                         resequenced protein isn't much of an 
                         improvement.

                                     ARCHER
                         My number one staffing priority was 
                         finding the right chef. I think 
                         you'll be impressed.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Your galley's more important to you 
                         than your warp core. That's a 
                         confidence-builder.

                                     ARCHER
                         A starship runs on its stomach, 
                         Charlie.
                              (sees something)
                         Slow down. There. Those are the 
                         ports that buckled during the last 
                         test. They need to be reinforced.

               Charlie grabs a high-tech stylus and pad, makes a note. 
               With his hands off the controls, the pod drifts slightly 
               toward Enterprise.


                                     CHARLIE
                         Sorry.

               Archer cranes his neck to inspect the point of impact

                                     ARCHER
                         Great. You scratched the paint.

               A COM CHIRP goes off. Charlie taps a control.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to com)
                         Orbital Six.

                         Captain Archer, sir?

                                     ARCHER
                         Go ahead.

                                     COM VOICE
                         Admiral Forrest needs you at 
                         Starfleet Medical right away.

               OFF Archer.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A dimly-lit chamber with a large window looking into a 22nd 
               century intensive care unit. Klaang is lying on a bed, 
               unconscious, with myriad tubes and monitoring devices 
               attached to his gigantic body. A small team of doctors and 
               nurses are busily tending to him. Two armed Security Guards 
               stand watch.

               In the anteroom, a heated discussion is taking place 
               between three Starfleet Officers (ADMIRALS MAXWELL FORREST 
               and DANIEL LEONARD, and COMMANDER WILLIAMS) and three Vulcan 
               dignitaries (AMBASSADOR SOVAL, TOS and a striking young 
               female named T'POL).

                                     CMDR. WILLIAMS
                         Who was chasing him?

                                     SOVAL
                         We don't know. They were 
                         incinerated in the methane 
                         explosion, and the farmer's 
                         description was vague at best.

                                     ADMIRAL LEONARD
                         How did they get here? What kind of 
                         ship?

                                     TOS
                         They were using some kind of 
                         stealth technology. We're still 
                         analyzing our sensor logs.

                                     CMDR. WILLIAMS
                         I'd like to see those logs.

                                     SOVAL
                              (patronizingly calm)
                         The Klingons made it very clear... 
                         they want to expedite this.

                                     ADMIRAL LEONARD
                         It happened on our soil.

                                     TOS
                         That's irrelevant

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Soval)
                         Ambassador... with all due respect, 
                         we have a right to know what's going 
                         on here.

                                     SOVAL
                         You'll be apprised of all pertinent 
                         information.

                                     CMDR. WILLIAMS
                         And just who gets to decide what's 
                         pertinent?

               At this point, the door opens and Archer ENTERS, still in 
               civilian clothes. The conversation stops as everyone turns 
               to him.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Forrest)
                         Admiral.

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                         Jack... I think you know everyone.

               Archer sees the unconscious Klaang through the window.

                                     ARCHER
                              (walking to the 
                              window)
                         Not everyone.

                                     ADMIRAL LEONARD
                         He's a Klingot.

                                     TOS
                         A Kling-Qn.

                                     ARCHER
                         Where'd he come from?

                                     CMDR. WILLIAMS
                         Oklahoma.

               Archer reacts.

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                         A corn farmer named Moore shot him 
                         with a plasma rifle... says it was 
                         self-defense.

                                     TOS
                         Fortunately, Soval and I have 
                         maintained close contact with Kronos 
                         since the incident occurred.

                                     ARCHER
                         Kronos?

                                     ADMIRAL LEONARD
                         It's the Klingon's homeworld.

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                              (re: Klaang)
                         This gentleman is some sort of 
                         courier. Evidently, he was carrying 
                         crucial information back to his 
                         people.

                                     SOVAL
                              (pointed)
                         When he was nearly killed by your 
                         "farmer."

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                              (carefully)
                         Ambassador Soval thinks it would be 
                         best if we push off your launch 
                         until we've cleared this up.

                                     ARCHER
                              (dry)
                         Well, isn't that a surprise?
                         You'd think they'd've come up with 
                         something a little more imaginative 
                         this time.

                                     SOVAL
                         Sarcasm aside, Captain, the last 
                         thing your people need is to make an 
                         enemy of the Klingon Empire.

                                     TOS
                         If we hadn't convinced them to let 
                         us take Klaang's corpse back to 
                         Kronos, Earth would most likely be 
                         facing a squadron of Warbirds by the 
                         end of the week.

                                     ARCHER
                         Corpse? Is he dead?

               Archer walks to the door leading to the ICU, opens it and 
               signals to one of the doctors, who approaches.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         Excuse me... is that man dead?

               PHLOX, an exotic-looking alien physician wearing hospital 
               garb, responds in a hurried voice and slight, distinctive 
               accent:

                                     PHLOX
                              (quickly)
                         His autonomic system was disrupted 
                         by the blast but his redundant
                         neural functions are still intact 
                         which --

                                     ARCHER
                         Is he going to die?

                                     PHLOX
                         Not necessarily.

               Archer turns back to the room.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Vulcans)
                         Let me get this straight... you're 
                         going to disconnect this man from 
                         life support... even though he could 
                         recover. Where's the logic in that?

                                     SOVAL
                         Klaang's culture finds honor in 
                         death. If they saw him like this 
                         he'd be disgraced.

               Archer remains puzzled.

                                     TOS
                         They're a warrior race... they 
                         dream of dying in battle. If you
                         understood the complexities of 
                         interstellar diplomacy you would --

                                     ARCHER
                              (interrupting, 
                              temper rising)
                         So your "diplomatic" solution is to 
                         do what they tell you... pull the 
                         plug?

                         Your metaphor is crude, but 
                         accurate.

                                     ARCHER
                              (back at him)
                         We may be crude, but we're not 
                         murderers.

                                     {then to Forrest)
                         You're not going to let them do 
                         this, are you'?

                         The Klingons have demanded that we 
                         return Klaang immediately.

                                     ARCHER
                              (ignoring him, to 
                              Forrest)
                         Admiral?

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                         We may need to defer to their 
                         judgement.

                                     ARCHER
                         We've been deferring to their 
                         judgement for a hundred years!

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                              (a warning)
                         Jack...

               Archer knows he's crossing the line, but he can't help 
               himself.

                                     ARCHER
                         How much longer?

               T'Pol steps toward Archer. She's a science attache with the 
               Vulcan contingent headquartered in San Francisco. Her look 
               is severe yet sensual. Although she's been living amongst 
               humans for several months, she is cautious and guarded 
               around them.

                                     T'POL
                         Until you've proven you're ready,

                                     ARCHER
                         Ready to what?

                                     T'POL
                         To look beyond your provincial 
                         attitudes and volatile nature.

                                     ARCHER
                         Volatile? You have no idea how much 
                         I'm restraining myself from knocking 
                         you on your ass.

               T'Pol raises an eyebrow at this. Archer turns to Forrest.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         These Klingons are anxious to get 
                         their man back? Fine. I can have my 
                         ship ready to go in three days.
                              (to Vulcans, pointed)
                         We'll take him home... alive.

                                     SOVAL
                         This is no time to be imposing your 
                         ethical beliefs.

               Forrest considers, turns to Admiral Leonard.

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                         Dan?

                                     ADMIRAL LEONARD
                              (to Archer)
                         What about your crew? Your Comm 
                         Officer's in Brazil... you haven't 
                         selected a Medical Officer yet...

                                     ARCHER
                         Three days, that's all I need.

               The Vulcans can't believe what they're hearing.

                                     SOVAL
                              (protesting)
                         Admiral...

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                         We've been waiting nearly a 
                         century, Ambassador... this seems as 
                         good a time as any to get started.

                                     SOVAL
                              (agitated, louder)
                         Listen to me. You're making a 
                         mistake!

                                     ARCHER
                              (calmly, chiding him)
                         When your logic doesn't work, you 
                         raise your voice? You have been on 
                         Earth too long.

               Displeased, Soval realizes the debate is over, EXITS with 
               his colleagues. Forrest turns to Archer with a slight 
               twinkle in his eye. We get the sense that he invited Archer 
               knowing that he'd provoke this very outcome.

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                         I had a feeling their approach 
                         wouldn't sit too well with you.
                              (then)
                         Don't screw this up.

               As they EXIT, Archer walks to the large window and raps on 
               the glass. Phlox and a couple of nurses turn to look. Archer 
               gestures Phlox over. Phlox looks surprised -- "me?" As he 
               moves to Archer, curious...


               TACTICAL OFFICER, LIEUTENANT MALCOLM REED and the HELMSMAN, 
               LIEUTENANT TRAVIS MAYWEATHER are standing by the transport 
               platform as a shipment of CARGO CONTAINERS MATERIALIZE.

               Reed is a buttoned-up Englishman in his 30's; Mayweather is 
               an African-American in his 20's. As the beam-in ends, they 
               step up and begin to examine the cargo. Both men are in 
               Starfleet uniform.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         I heard this platform's been 
                         approved for bio-transport.

                                     REED
                         I presume you mean fruits and 
                         vegetables.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         I mean Armory Officers and Helmsmen.

                                     REED
                         I don't think I'm quite ready to 
                         have my molecules compressed into a 
                         data stream.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         They claim it's safe.

                                     REED
                         Do they indeed? Well, I certainly 
                         hope the Captain doesn't plan on 
                         making us use it.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Don't worry, from what I'm told, he 
                         wouldn't even put his dog through 
                         this thing.

               Reed has opened a canister and breathes a sigh of 
               frustration.

                                     REED
                         This is ridiculous. I asked for 
                         plasma coils and they sent me a case 
                         of valve sealant.  There's no chance 
                         I can have the weapons on-line in 
                         three days.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         We're just taking a sick man back 
                         to his homeworld... why do we need 
                         weapons?

                                     REED
                         Didn't you read the profile report 
                         on these Klingons? Apparently, they 
                         sharpen their teeth before they go 
                         into battle.

               Mayweather gives him an uneasy half-smile,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Minutes later. Reed and Mayweather are walking along. 
               Crewmembers are putting finishing touches on the ship, 
               working at wall panels and opened deck plating.

                                     REED
                         No doubt Mister Tucker will 
                         reassure me that my equipment will 
                         be here tomorrow.
                              (imitating Charlie's 
                              Southern accent)
                         "Keep your shirt on, Lieutenant. "

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Is it me, or does the artificial 
                         gravity seem a bit heavy?

               Reed takes a few measured steps.

                                     REED
                         Feels all right... Earth sea level.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         My father always kept it at point 
                         eight G. He thought it put a little 
                         spring in his step.

                                     REED
                         After being raised on cargo ships, 
                         it must've felt like you had lead in 
                         your boots when you got to Earth.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         It did take some getting used to.

               Reed pauses at an opened wall panel, where a young female 
               CREWMAN is "tuning" a series of power conduits with a small 
               device.

                                     REED
                         You may find that if you re-balance 
                         the polarities, you'll get that done 
                         a bit faster, Crewman.

               They continue down the corridor


               Unlike the spacious, brightly-lit engine rooms of future 
               starships, this is more like the cramped, red-lit nerve 
               center of a nuclear submarine. We see crewmembers busily 
               getting the ship ready for launch.

               Charlie is in his element --he's working atop the WARP 
               CORE, which extends horizontally across the room.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (shouting down)
                         Okay, Alex, give it some juice!

               A crewman below throws a series of levers, and a pulsing 
               pillar of PLASMA courses through the warp core.

                                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                              (shouting down)
                         Beautiful! Lock it off right there!

               Charlie ducks and weaves through various outcroppings and 
               slides down an access ladder, dropping to the deck below. He 
               eyes the warp core, notices something, reaches in his 
               pocket, pulls out a handkerchief and polishes off a small 
               smudge on the casing. As he proudly inspects his work...

                                     REED (O.S.) (O.S.)
                         I believe you missed a spot.

               Charlie turns to see Reed and Mayweather standing at the 
               rail.

                                     REED (CONT'D)
                              (making the 
                              introductions)
                         Commander Tucker, Lieutenant Travis 
                         Mayweather. He just arrived.

               Charlie, ducking under the rail, extends his hand.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Our "Space Boomer."

               Mayweather shakes his hand, but can't keep his eyes off the 
               engine.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         How fast have you gotten her?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Warp four... we'll be going to 
                         four-five as soon as we clear 
                         Jupiter. Think you can handle it?

                                     MAYWEATHER
                              (in awe)
                         Four point five...

                                     REED
                              (all business)
                         Pardon me, but if I don't realign 
                         the deflector, the first grain of 
                         space-dust we come across will blow 
                         a hole through this ship the size of 
                         your fist.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Keep your shirt on, Lieutenant. 
                         Your equipment'll be here in the 
                         morning.

               Reed gives Mayweather a look.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Archer and Charlie are standing at the window, looking at a 
               section of the Spacedock.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Since when do we have Vulcan 
                         Science Officers?

                                     ARCHER
                         Since we needed starcharts to get 
                         to Kronos.

                                     CHARLIE
                         So we get a few maps... and they 
                         get to put a spy on our ship?

                                     ARCHER
                         Admiral Forrest says we should 
                         think of her more as a "chaperone."

                                     CHARLIE
                         I thought the whole point of this 
                         was to get away from the Vulcans.

                                     ARCHER
                         Four days there, four days back... 
                         then she's gone. In the meantime, 
                         we're to extend her every courtesy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know... I'd be more 
                         comfortable with Porthos on the 
                         Bridge.

               The door CHIMES.

                                     ARCHER
                         Here we go.
                              (to com)
                         Come in.

               T'Pol ENTERS from the Bridge, wearing her Vulcan uniform, 
               holding a PADD.

                                     T'POL
                              (hands Archer a PADD)
                         This confirms that I was formally 
                         transferred to your command at oh 
                         eight hundred hours. Reporting for 
                         duty.

               Archer eyes the PADD. There's an uncomfortable pause. T'Pol 
               sniffs the air and glances about --it's obvious something 
               smells unpleasant to her. She looks to one corner, where 
               PORTHOS, the Captain's DOG, lays sleeping. Archer looks up 
               from the PADD and notices her nasal distress.

                                     ARCHER
                         Is there a problem?

                                     T'POL
                         No, sir Archer realizes he's found 
                         a button to push.

                                     ARCHER
                         Oh, I forgot... Vulcan females have 
                         a heightened sense of smell.
                              (re: dog)
                         I hope Porthos isn't too offensive 
                         to you.

                                     T'POL
                              (with attitude)
                         I've been trained to tolerate 
                         offensive situations.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I took a shower this morning... how 
                         about you, Captain?

                                     ARCHER
                         I'm sorry. This is Commander 
                         Charles Tucker.
                              (to Charlie)
                         Sub-Commander T'Pol.

               CHARLIE EXTENDS HIS HAND

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm called Charlie.

                                     T'POL
                              (dry)
                         I'll try to remember that.

               Archer eyes T'Pol.

                                     ARCHER
                         While you may not share our 
                         enthusiasm about this mission, I 
                         expect you to follow our rules... 
                         what's said in this room and out on 
                         that Bridge is classified... 
                         privileged information.
                              (beat)
                         I don't want every word I say being 
                         picked apart the next day by the 
                         Vulcan High Command.

                                     T'POL
                         My reason for being here is not 
                         espionage. My superiors simply asked 
                         me to assist you.

                                     ARCHER
                         Your superiors don't think we can 
                         flush a toilet without one of you to 
                         "assist" us.

                                     T'POL
                              (cool)
                         I didn't request this assignment, 
                         Captain... and you can be certain 
                         that when the mission's over, I'll 
                         be as pleased to leave this ship as 
                         you'll be to have me go.

               She glances down at Porthos, who is sniffing at her leg.

                                     T'POL (CONT'D)
                         If there's nothing else...

               Archer waits a beat, letting Porthos sniff away.

                                     ARCHER
                         Porthos!

               The dog obediently moves back to its bed.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         That'll be all.

               As T'Pol EXITS...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:


               Admiral Forrest is addressing a large group of invited 
               guests, including various Starfleet brass, a contingent of 
               Vulcan dignitaries, and the senior staff of Enterprise: 
               Archer, Charlie, T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, and Hoshi. Part of 
               ENTERPRISE can be seen out the observation window.

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST
                         When Zefram Cochrane made his 
                         legendary warp flight ninety years 
                         ago... and drew the attention of our 
                         new friends, the Vulcans, we 
                         realized that we weren't alone in 
                         the galaxy.
                              (beat)
                         Today we're about to cross a new 
                         threshold. For nearly a century, 
                         we've waded ankle-deep in the ocean 
                         of space... now it's finally time to 
                         swim.

               The crowd applauds enthusiastically. The Vulcans observe 
               them stoically.

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST (CONT'D)
                              (continuing)
                         The warp five engine wouldn't be a 
                         reality without men like Doctor 
                         Cochrane and Henry Archer, who 
                         worked so hard to develop it. So 
                         it's only fitting that Henry's son, 
                         Jonathan Archer, will command the 
                         first starship powered by that 
                         engine.

               Forrest nods to Archer, who leads his crew toward a nearby 
               set of doors.

                                     ADMIRAL FORREST (CONT'D)
                              (continuing)
                         Rather than quoting Doctor 
                         Cochrane, I think we should listen 
                         to his own words from the ground 
                         breaking ceremony for the Warp Five 
                         Complex... thirty-two years ago...

               Forrest looks toward the large window, which also serves as 
               a VIEWSCREEN. It comes alive with ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE of an 
               elderly ZEFRAM COCHRANE giving a speech.

               Standing beside him at a construction site are a number of 
               fellow scientists, including Archer's father, Henry, who is 
               only a few years younger than when we saw him in the opening 
               scene.

                                     COCHRANE
                         On this site, a powerful engine 
                         will be built... an engine that will 
                         someday let us travel a hundred 
                         times faster than we can today.

               As the speech continues...


               Far more basic than future starship, this command center 
               lacks the "airport terminal" feel of Enterprises A through 
               E. A central Captain's chair is surrounded by various 
               stations, the floors and walls, are mostly steel, with 
               source light coming nom myriad glowing panels. No carpets on 
               the floors, no wood paneling on the walls, high-tech gauges, 
               dials.

                                     COCHRANE (O.S.) (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         Imagine it. Thousands of inhabited 
                         planets at our fingertips.

               T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather and Hoshi take their stations... 
               and Archer takes the Captain's chair...

                                     COCHRANE (O.S.) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                              (continuing)
                         And we'll be able to explore those 
                         strange new worlds... and seek out 
                         new life and new civilizations.


               Cochrane on the Viewscreen...

                                     COCHRANE (continuing)
                         This engine will let us go 
                         boldly... where no man has gone 
                         before.


               Charlie stands before the now throbbing warp core.


               Archer and his crew,as before. Archer leans forward in the 
               Captain's chair.

               FLASHBACK: CLOSE ON YOUNG ARCHER'S FACE (OPTICAL)

               as a tiny ANTI-GRAV UNIT the size of a Dixie cup floats up 
               into frame. The humming unit hovers before the transfixed 
               child.

               FLASHBACK: CLOSE ON ARCHER'S FATHER (OPTICAL)

               working a small control unit, smiles warmly at his son.

               FLASHBACK: WIDER ON YOUNG ARCHER'S FACE (OPTICAL)

               as the anti-grav unit settles back on the table. The father 
               plucks the unit out of the air and hands it to the boy, who 
               inserts it into the starship model.

                                     RESUME CAPTAIN ARCHER
                         as he reflects a beat, then:

                                     ARCHER
                         Take her out... straight and 
                         steady, Mister Mayweather.


               Archer taps a button on the arm of his chair.

                                     ARCHER
                         How are we doing, Charlie?


               Charlie working at the warp core, which is now pulsing at 
               full power.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ready when you are.

                                     ARCHER'S COM VOICE
                         Prepare for warp one.


                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Course laid in, sir.
                              (beat)
                         Request permission to get underway.

               T'Pol studies her console and turns to Archer.

                                     T'POL
                              (critical)
                         The coordinates are off by point 
                         two degrees.

               Archer won't let her spoil the moment he's waited so long 
               for.

                                     ARCHER
                         Thank you.
                              (to Mayweather)
                         Let's go.


               Dimly-lit, filled with labyrinthine technology. The room is 
               bisected by an archway that creates a rippling BARRIER of 
               ENERGY.

               This is a place where people from two different time frames 
               can briefly coexist; the Suliban come here to meet with 
               visitors from a distant century.

               Two men stand on opposite sides of the barrier. On our side 
               is a Suliban named SILIK; on the other, we can barely make 
               out the image of a HUMANOID FIGURE. Both men stand at 
               identical high-tech podiums.

               As they speak, their WORDS and IMAGES seem to PRE-ECHO in a 
               strange effect -- we can see and hear things a split-second 
               before they happen. It's a disquieting and eerie feeling of 
               two worlds slightly out of phase with each other.

               Silik, in his fifties, has the same dappled skin as the 
               Suliban we briefly saw at Broken Bow. He's a high-ranking 
               member of the Suliban Cabal. The Humanoid Figure who faces 
               him is a male of indeterminate age; we can barely make out 
               his appearance or his words. Mid-scene:

                                     HUMANOID FIGURE
                         Where's Klaang?

                                     SILIK

                         Two of my soldiers were killed.
                         One of them was a friend. Can you 
                         prevent it?

                         Our agreement doesn't provide for

                         Don't be concerned with when.

               The figure vanishes... and a moment later, so does the 
               barrier of energy. OFF Silik...


               Where Phlox (the quirky alien seen at Starfleet Medical) is 
               carefully placing various medical paraphernalia on shelves. 
               The jars and tools are definitely not Starfleet issue. In 
               the b.g., Klaang (the Klingon) is lying on a bio-bed, 
               unconscious. Archer hands Phlox the jar of pink fluid, and 
               continues to pass him other articles out of a large packing 
               case during the conversation.

                                     ARCHER
                         So what'd you think of Earth?

                                     PHLOX
                         Intriguing. I especially liked the 
                         Chinese food. Have you ever tried it?

                                     ARCHER
                         I've lived in San Francisco all my 
                         life.

                                     PHLOX
                         Anatomically, you humans are 
                         somewhat simplistic... but what you 
                         lack biologically you make up for 
                         with your charming optimism... not 
                         to mention your egg drop soup.
                              (re: his medical 
                              gear)
                         Be very careful with the blue box.

               Archer gingerly passes him a small blue box with breathing 
               holes on either side. Some unseen creature skitters within.

                                     ARCHER
                         What's in there?

                                     PHLOX
                         An Altarian marsupial... their 
                         droppings contain the greatest 
                         concentration of regenerative 
                         enzymes found anywhere.

                                     ARCHER
                              (uncomfortably)
                         Their droppings?

                                     PHLOX
                              (philosophical)
                         If you're going to try to embrace 
                         new worlds... you must try to 
                         embrace new ideas. That's why the 
                         Vulcans initiated the Interspecies 
                         Medical Exchange... there's a lot to 
                         be learned!

                                     ARCHER
                         I'm sorry I had to take you away 
                         from your program... but our doctors 
                         haven't even heard of a Klingon.

                                     PHLOX
                         Please, no apologies! What better 
                         time to study human beings than when 
                         they're under pressure? It's a rare 
                         opportunity.
                              (re: Klaang)
                         And your Klingon friend... I've 
                         never had a chance to examine a 
                         living one before.

                         Lieutenant Mayweather tells me 
                         we'll be to Kronos in about eighty 
                         hours. Any chance he'll be conscious 
                         by then?

                                     PHLOX
                         There's a chance he'll be conscious 
                         within the next ten minutes...  just 
                         not a very good one.

                                     ARCHER
                         Eighty hours, Doctor. If he doesn't 
                         walk off this ship on his own two 
                         feet, he doesn't stand much of a 
                         chance.

                                     PHLOX
                         I'll do the best I can.
                              (off his doubtful 
                              look)
                         Optimism, Captain!

               Phlox SMILES a grin of inhuman proportions (and with the 
               help of a VISUAL EFFECT, it will be like no smile we've seen 
               before). Archer realizes he's gotten all he's going to get 
               out of his new doctor.

               He walks to Klaang, stops for a beat, then heads for the 
               door...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Charlie is climbing up a ladder through a narrow 
               passageway. As he reaches the top, he stares above him. ..

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're upsidedown, lieutenant.

               CAMERA WIDENS to reveal Mayweather comfortably sitting on 
               what appears to be the CEILING.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Care to explain why?

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         When I was a kid, we called it the 
                         "sweet spot. " Every ship's got one.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (intrigued)
                         Sweet spot.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         It's usually about halfway between 
                         the grav-generator and the bow plate.

               He points to a thin conduit that crosses below him

                                     MAYWEATHER (CONT'D)
                         Grab hold of that conduit.

               Charlie reaches for the conduit.

                                     MAYWEATHER (CONT'D)
                         Now swing your legs up.

               Charlie hesitates.

                                     MAYWEATHER (CONT'D)
                         Swing your legs.

               Charlie swings his legs up, and to his amazement, they stay 
               up --

               his curled body floating in ZERO G.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Wow

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Now let go.

               Charlie releases his grip, and his entire body FLOATS in 
               mid-air.

               Charlie laughs in delight as he slowly turns. He tries to 
               control his movements, but CRASHES onto the "ceiling" where 
               Mayweather is sitting.

                                     MAYWEATHER (CONT'D)
                         Takes practice.

               As Charlie settles in next to him...

                                     MAYWEATHER (CONT'D)
                         Ever slept in zero G?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Slept?

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Like being back in the womb.

               Charlie eyes him, curious.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Captain tells me you've been to 
                         Trillius Prime.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Took the fourth, fifth and sixth 
                         grades to get there. I've also been 
                         to Draylax and both the Andorian 
                         Moons.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I've only been to one inhabited 
                         planet besides Earth... nothing 
                         there but dust-dwelling ticks.
                              (beat, curious)
                         I've heard the women on Draylax 
                         have...

                                     MAYWEATHER (nodding)
                         Three... it's true.

                                     CHARLIE (impressed)
                         You know that first-hand?

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         First-hand, second-hand, and 
                         third-hand.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I guess growing up a boomer has its 
                         advantages.

               They share a smile...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Busy. A dozen or so CREWMEMBERS are sitting at long, metal 
               tables, helping themselves at the food line, and getting 
               drinks at a row of high-tech beverage dispensers. Charlie 
               ENTERS and starts walking across the room, passes a group of 
               crewmen having dinner.

                                     CREWMAN FLETCHER
                              (to Charlie)
                         Got an empty seat here, Commander.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sorry. Dinner with the boss tonight.

               Charlie heads toward a small door at the end of the room...


               A small, nicely-appointed room with a table for four

               (six in a pinch) that is covered by a white tablecloth. The 
               room is warmly lit by two candles at the center of the 
               table. Archer and T'Pol are seated across from each other, 
               mid-conversation.

                                     ARCHER
                         The Grand Canyon?

                                     T'POL
                         No.

                                     ARCHER
                         Big Sur Aquarium?

                                     T'POL
                         Sightseeing was not one of my 
                         assignments.

                                     ARCHER
                         All work and no play...
                              (off her puzzled 
                              look)
                         Everyone should get out for a 
                         little R & R now and then.

                                     T'POL
                         All our recreational needs are 
                         provided at the Compound.

               The door CHIMES.

                                     ARCHER
                         Come in.

               Charlie ENTERS from the Mess Hall.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You should've started without me.

               Archer indicates the chair to his left.

                                     ARCHER
                         Sit down Charlie takes, aseat and 
                         reaches for a bread stick, starts 
                         chomping. T'Pol raises an eyebrow at 
                         his noisy eating habits.

               Archer extends the basket to T'Pol, who removes a bread 
               stick and places it on her plate.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                              (to Charlie)
                         T'Pol tells me she's been living at 
                         the Vulcan Compound in Sausalito.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (chomping away)
                         No kidding. I lived a few blocks 
                         from there when I was at the Academy.
                              (sarcastic)
                         Great parties at the Vulcan 
                         Compound.

               T'Pol doesn't respond to this --she's too busy trying to 
               cut the bread stick with her knife and fork. But it's too 
               crisp, and crumbles.

                                     ARCHER
                              (diplomatic)
                         It might be a little easier using 
                         your fingers.

                                     T'POL
                         Vulcans don't touch food with their 
                         hands.

               She changes her tack --holds the bread stick with her fork, 
               gently sawing it with the edge of her knife.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Can't wait to see you tackle the 
                         spare ribs.

               T'Pol glances at Archer.

                                     ARCHER
                         Don't worry. We know you're a 
                         vegetarian.

               At this point, the door leading to the kitchen opens and a 
               STEWARD enters carrying three plates of food. As he places 
               them down, we see that Archer and Charlie are being served 
               meat, while T'Pol receives a platter of grilled vegetables.

               CHARLIE Looks delicious.

                                     (to Steward)
                         Tell Chef I said thanks.

               The steward nods and EXITS. As the two men begin to eat, 
               T'Pol continues to methodically saw at the bread stick.

                                     T'POL
                         You humans claim to be enlightened, 
                         yet you still consume the flesh of 
                         animals.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (mouth full, wry)
                         Grandma taught me never to judge a 
                         species by their eating habits.

                                     ARCHER
                         "Enlightened" may be too strong a 
                         word, but if you'd been on Earth 
                         fifty years ago, I think you'd be 
                         impressed by what we've gotten done.

                                     T'POL
                         You've yet to embrace either 
                         patience or logic... you remain 
                         impulsive carnivores.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah? How about war... disease... 
                         hunger? Pretty much wiped 'em out in 
                         less than two generations. I 
                         wouldn't call that small potatoes.

                                     T'POL
                         It remains to be seen whether 
                         humanity will revert to its baser 
                         instincts.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (tweaking her)
                         We used to have cannibals on Earth. 
                         Who knows how far we'll revert? 
                         Lucky this isn't a long mission.

                                     ARCHER
                         Human instinct is pretty strong -- 
                         you can't expect us to change 
                         overnight.

               She finally saws off a section of bread stick, and 
               gracefully slides it onto her fork.

                                     T'POL
                         With proper discipline, anything's 
                         possible.

               As she places the bread into her mouth


               Archer, T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Hoshi and various 
               crewmembers at their stations. Everyone is quiet, as though 
               anticipating something. We hear the low HUM of the ship at 
               warp.

                                     ARCHER
                         Seems okay to me.
                              (to Mayweather)
                         Why don't you try four-three?

               Mayweather works the helm. There's a slight change of pitch 
               in the sound of the ship's engines.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Warp four point three, sir.

               Another quiet moment as they all listen, waiting for 
               something to happen.

                                     REED
                         Not much of a change.

                                     HOSHI
                         I don't know... does anybody else 
                         feel that?

                                     ARCHER
                         Feel what?

                                     HOSHI
                         Those... vibrations... like little 
                         tremors.

                                     T'POL
                              (cool)
                         You're imagining it.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Mayweather)
                         Bring us to four-four, Lieutenant.

               Mayweather works. A tiny SHUDDER and the deep sounds of 
               engines working as the ship accelerates. Hoshi grabs the 
               sides of her seat.

                                     HOSHI
                         There! What do you call that?

                                     T'POL
                         The warp reactor was recalibrating. 
                         It shouldn't happen again.

               A small ALARM sounds at Reed's station.

                                     HOSHI
                              (anxious)
                         Now what?

                                     REED
                         The deflector's sequencing.
                         It's perfectly normal.

                                     T'POL
                              (dry, to Hoshi)
                         Perhaps you'd like to go to your 
                         quarters and lie down?

               Hoshi doesn't like T'Pol's slightly condescending attitude.

                                     HOSHI
                              (in Vulcan, an 
                              insult)
                         Ponfo mirann.

                                     T'POL
                              (with matching 
                              attitude)
                         I was instructed to speak English 
                         during this voyage. I'd appreciate 
                         it if you'd respect that.

               Archer, who's concerned these two aren't getting along, 
               tries to change the subject.

                                     ARCHER
                              (lightly)
                         It's easy to get a little jumpy 
                         when you're travelling at thirty 
                         million kilometers a second. Should 
                         be old-hat in a week's time.

               Another TONE is heard. Hoshi tenses. Archer taps a button 
               on the arm of his chair.

                                     ARCHER (to com) (CONT'D)
                         Archer.

                                     PHLOX'S COM VOICE
                         This is Doctor Phlox, Captain. Our 
                         patient is regaining consciousness.

                                     ARCHER
                         On my way.
                              (stands)
                         Hoshi.

               Hoshi joins him and they head for the Turbolift

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     TIGHT ON KLAANG
                         seated on the bio-bed, babbling in 
                         Klingon. (See ADDENDUM for any 
                         unscripted Klaang dialog.) We will 
                         shortly learn that he's delirious 
                         and not making any sense.

                                     KLAANG (shouting)
                         Pung: g:hap HoS!

               WIDEN to see --


               Archer, Hoshi and Phlox are gathered around the bio-bed. A 
               SECURITY GUARD armed with a PLASMA RIFLE stands watch. Hoshi 
               is working a PADD.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Hoshi)
                         What's wrong?

                                     HOSHI
                         The translator's not locking onto 
                         his dialect... the syntax won't 
                         align.

                                     KLAANG
                              (shouts)
                         DujDaj Hegh!

               Hoshi hesitates, finding the words.

                                     ARCHER
                         Tell him we're taking him home.

                                     HOSHI
                              (to Klaang, in 
                              Klingon)
                         Ingan Hoch... juH.

               Klaang responds:

                                     KLAANG
                         Tujpa'qyl Dun?

                                     HOSHI
                              (to Archer)
                         He wants to know who we are

               Archer nods -- tell him.

                                     HOSHI (to Klaang) (CONT'D)
                         Ou'ghewme Enterrise. PugloD.

                         Nenta luHom.

                                     HOSHI
                         "LupHom" ..."ship" ...
                              (to Archer)
                         He's asking for his ship back.

                                     ARCHER
                         Say it was destroyed.

                                     HOSHI
                              (to Klaang)

                         Vengen Sto'vo'kor Dos!

               Hoshi frowns, puzzled.

                                     HOSHI
                         I'm not sure... but I think he's 
                         saying something about "eating the 
                         afterlife.

                                     ARCHER
                              (frustrated)
                         Try the translator again.

               Hoshi works the PADD, shakes her head.

                                     HOSHI
                         I'm going to need to run what we've 
                         got through the phonetic processor.

                                     KLAANG
                              (urgent)

                                     HOSHI
                         He says... "his wife has grown 
                         ugly."

               Archer sighs.

                                     HOSHI (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry, Captain... I'm doing the 
                         best I can.

                                     PHLOX
                         Excuse me.

               They turn to him. Phlox is checking an alien scanning 
               device.

                                     PHLOX (CONT'D)
                         His pre-frontal cortex is 
                         hyperstimulated... I doubt he has 
                         any idea what he's saying.

                                     KLAANG
                         HljolOaOqu'na!

                                     HOSHI
                         I think the Doctor's right, 
                         Captain...unless "stinky boots" has 
                         something to do with all this.

               Suddenly, the ship SHUDDERS as it drops out of warp. Hoshi 
               instinctively grabs the Captain's arm.

                                     HOSHI (CONT'D)
                         That's the warp reactor again, 
                         right?

                                     KLAANG
                         OaOgu'na!

               Concerned, Archer taps a nearby com button.

                                     ARCHER
                         Bridge, report.

                                     T'POL'S COM VOICE
                         We've dropped out of warp, sir. 
                         Main power is --

               A brief burst of static, then the com goes dead. The lights 
               start to FLICKER and the consoles begin to GO OUT one by one.


               T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather and assorted crewmembers react as 
               the lights and consoles continue to GO OUT.

                                     REED
                              (confused, re: his 
                              console)
                         I think I saw something off the 
                         starboard bow...

                                     T'POL
                         What?

                                     REED
                         I don't know... it may've just been 
                         the sensors going down...


               Darkness. A handheld BEACON lights up, following by three 
               more.

               Charlie and several crewmembers are working at the now 
               inactive warp core. Charlie leans over to a com panel and 
               taps it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Captain.
                              (taps it again)
                         Captain!

               He realizes it's dead.

                                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                              (to crewman)
                         Lock off the coolant tanks!


               PIXILATED, MONOCHROMATIC POV MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE

               corridor. We see the grainy image of another SULIBAN moving 
               ahead of us...

               INT, SICKBAY (OPTICAL)

               Darkness. Archer, Hoshi and Phlox have beacons. Klanng 
               continues to bellow over the scene (see ADDENDUM). Chirps 
               and whistles come from the various alien lifeforms the 
               doctor has brought with him.

                                     ARCHER
                         Auxiliary power should've kicked in 
                         by now...

               Another outburst from Klaang.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                              (to Hoshi)
                         Do you know how to tell him to shut 
                         up?

               Hoshi, who's growing more nervous, flashes her beacon from 
               wall to wall.

                                     HOSHI
                              (to Klaang)
                         Shut up!

               Klaang continues to shout.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Phlox)
                         Sedate him if you have to. I need 
                         to get to the Bridge.

               Archer heads for the door.

                                     HOSHI
                              (sotto, urgent)
                         Captain!

               He turns. Hoshi is moving her beacon across a wall.

                                     HOSHI (CONT'D)
                              (sotto)
                         There's someone here.

                                     ARCHER
                              (doubtful)
                         Hoshi...

                                     HOSHI
                         I'm telling you, there's someone --

               She stops as her beacon illuminates a HUMANOID FORM. Like a 
               chameleon, it has taken on the appearance of its background 
               and is barely visible. Once discovered, the figure LEAPS 
               back into the darkness.

               A glimmer of recognition falls over Klaang's face as he 
               shuts up for the first time.

                                     KLAANG (quietly)
                         Suliban.

               Archer's beacon finds a second SULIBAN perched like a 
               spider high on a WALL (he is not camouflaged like the first 
               Suliban).

                                     ARCHER
                              (to guard)
                         Crewman!

               As the guard raises his rifle, the Suliban LEAPS to the 
               ground, where we see a third SULIBAN quickly dart into the 
               shadows.

               The guard FIRES toward them! Bright red PLASMA BULLETS 
               illuminate the room in a series of quick, stroboscopic 
               FLASHES! RAPID CUTS:

                                     KLAANG
                         looks around in confusion, shouting 
                         in Klingon!

                                     HOSHI
                         is crouching low to avoid the 
                         gunfire, erratically scanning with 
                         her beacon.

                                     THE GUARD
                         senses motion behind him, turns to 
                         take aim --

               HIS POV

               Of a Suliban lunging toward him!

                                     THE GUARD (CONT'D)
                         HITS the deck hard --his weapon 
                         goes sliding across the floor!

                                     ARCHER (OPTICAL)
                         reacts quickly, LUNGES and ROLLS 
                         toward the weapon, GRABS it and 
                         whirls toward the Suliban. 
                         BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! He FIRES!

               THE SULIBAN IS HIT (OPTICAL)

               and goes flying backward!

                                     KLANNG
                         senses movement above, looks up to 
                         see --

               SULIBAN ON THE CEILING

               directly over him! The creature DROPS into CAMERA!

                                     SILENCE
                         No movement. All we can hear is the 
                         agitated clicking and chirping of 
                         the alien lifeforms.

                                     HOSHI (O.S.) (O.S.)
                              (worried)
                         Captain?

               Suddenly, we hear the SURGE of warp power coming back on- 
               line...  and the lights and consoles begin to COME ALIVE one 
               by one.

                                     ANGLE- THE ROOM
                         The Guard is lying on the floor, 
                         dazed. Phlox rushes to help him.

               Hoshi is crouching on the deck, as before. She glances 
               down, sees a DEAD SULIBAN sprawled just inches from her! 
               Disgusted, she edges away.

               Archer is staring at the bio-bed, which is now empty. 
               Klaanq and the Suliban are gone. OFF his reaction...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Archer is on his feet, pacing, agitated. T'Pol, Reed, 
               Mayweather, Charlie, Hoshi and crewmembers at their 
               stations. Mid-scene, tense:

                                     ARCHER
                              (frustrated)
                         We've got state-of-the-art 
                         sensors... why the hell didn't we 
                         detect them?

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Mister Reed thought he detected 
                         something right before we lost 
                         power...

               Archer turns to Reed, who's working his console.

                                     REED
                         The starboard sensor logs recorded 
                         a spatial disturbance.

               Charlie looks over Reed's shoulder.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks more like a glitch.

                                     HOSHI
                         Those weren't glitches in Sickbay.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Charlie)
                         I want a complete analysis of that 
                         disturbance.

               Charlie heads for the door...

                                     ARCHER (to Reed) (CONT'D)
                         Where do we stand on weapons?

                                     REED
                         I still have to tune the targeting 
                         scanners...

                                     ARCHER
                         What're you waiting for?

               Reed joins Charlie and they EXIT together. T'Pol crosses to 
               Archer.

                                     T'POL
                         Captain...

                                     ARCHER
                              (ignoring her, to 
                              Hoshi)
                         The Klingon seemed to know who they 
                         were. See if you can translate what 
                         he said.

                                     HOSHI
                         Right away.

               Hoshi turns to go.

                                     T'POL
                         Captain.

               He turns to her.

                                     T'POL (CONT'D)
                              (consoling)
                         There's no way you could have 
                         anticipated this. I'm sure 
                         Ambassador Soval will understand.

                                     ARCHER
                              (an order)
                         You're the Science Officer. Why 
                         don't you help Charlie with that 
                         analysis?

                                     T'POL
                         The astrometric computer in San 
                         Francisco will be far more effective.

                                     ARCHER
                         We're not going to San Francisco, 
                         so make-do with what we've got here.

                                     T'POL
                         You've lost the Klingon. Your 
                         mission is over.

                                     ARCHER
                         I didn't lose the Klingon... he was 
                         taken. And I'm going to find out who 
                         took him.

                                     T'POL
                         How do you plan to do that?
                              (slightly 
                              patronizing)
                         Space is very big, Captain... a 
                         shadow on your sensors won't help 
                         you find them. This is a foolish 
                         mission.

               Archer heads for his Ready Room.

                                     ARCHER
                         Come with me.

               T'Pol follows...


               As Archer and T'Pol ENTER...

                                     ARCHER
                              (continuing)
                         I'm not interested in what you 
                         think about this mission. So take 
                         your Vulcan cynicism and bury it 
                         along with your repressed emotions.

                                     T'POL
                         Your reaction to this situation is 
                         a perfect example of why your 
                         species should remain in its own 
                         star system.

                                     ARCHER
                              (heated)
                         I've been listening to you Vulcans 
                         tell us what not to do all my life. 
                         I watched my father work his ass off 
                         while your scientists held back just 
                         enough information to keep him from 
                         succeeding.
                              (beat)
                         He deserved to see that launch. You 
                         may have life spans of two hundred 
                         years... we don't.

               A tense moment. T'Pol can see she's not going to win this 
               argument.

                                     T'POL
                         You are going to be contacting 
                         Starfleet... to advise them of our 
                         situation.

                                     ARCHER
                         No, I'm not. And neither are you 
                         T'Pol raises a skeptical brow.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         Now get the hell out there and make 
                         yourself useful.

               T'Pol EXITS. Archer watches her go... then walks to the 
               window and stares out into space...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Dimly-lot, except for a single bright surgical lamp shining 
               down on the dead Suliban. Although we can't see it clearly, 
               Phlox's hands are busy inside the opened chest of the 
               Suliban. He's enthusiastically picking through the entrails. 
               Archer looks on.

                                     PHLOX
                         Mister Klaang was right about one 
                         thing... he's a Suliban. But unless 
                         I'm mistaken, he's no ordinary one.

                                     ARCHER
                         Meaning?

                                     PHLOX
                         His DNA is Suliban... but his 
                         anatomy has been altered.
                              (re: corpse)
                         Look at this lung.

               Archer peers into the open chest cavity.

                                     PHLOX (CONT'D)
                         Five bronchial lobes.

               Phlox points to a monitor at the head of the bio-bed, which 
               shows an intricately complex biological diagram.

                                     PHLOX (CONT'D)
                         You see? It should only have three.

               {BACK TO THE CORPSE)

               And look at the alveoli clusters... they've been modified 
               to process different kinds of atmospheres.

                                     ARCHER
                         Are you saying he's some kind of 
                         mutant?

                                     PHLOX
                         Yes, I suppose I am. But this was 
                         no accident, no freak of nature.
                         This man was the recipient of some 
                         very sophisticated genetic 
                         engineering.

               Phlox is like a kid in a candy store. He picks up a thin 
               instrument and activates it. A deep red light comes on. 
               Phlox shines the light on the Suliban's dappled face.

               He moves the light away, revealing that the skin has 
               CHANGED COLOR, perfectly matching the hue and intensity.

                                     PHLOX (CONT'D)
                         Watch this.

               He taps a control on the instrument, and the color of the 
               light changes to BLUE. He shines the light on the Suliban's 
               clothing, moves it away --the clothing has ADAPTED to the 
               color.

                                     PHLOX (CONT'D)
                              (re: dappled skin)
                         Subcutaneous pigment sacs.

               Archer reacts.

                                     PHLOX (CONT'D)
                              (re: clothing)
                         A bio-mimetic garment.

                                     PHLOX (CONT'D)
                         The eyes are my favorite.

               Phlox lifts an eyelid, exposing a super-dilated pupil 
               glowing with phosphorescence.

                                     PHLOX (CONT'D)
                         Compound retinas. He most likely 
                         saw things even your sensors 
                         couldn't detect.

                                     ARCHER
                         It's not in their genome?

                                     PHLOX
                         Certainly not. The Suliban are no 
                         more evolved than humans.
                              (re: corpse)
                         Very impressive work, though. I've 
                         never seen anything quite like it.

               Archer doesn't share his excitement about this discovery. 
               He's uneasy.

                                     ARCHER
                         What do you know about them? Where 
                         do they come from?

                                     PHLOX
                         They're nomadic, I believe. No home 
                         world.  I examined two of them years 
                         ago... a husband and wife... very 
                         cordial.

               As Archer considers...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Charlie and T'Pol are working at a station that displays 
               various sensor data. Charlie is upbeat, T'Pol is detached.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (points at some data)
                         How about this?

                                     T'POL
                         It's just background noise. Your 
                         sensors aren't capable of isolating 
                         plasma decay.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How can you be so damn sure what 
                         our sensors can do?

                                     T'POL
                         Vulcan children play with toys that 
                         are more sophisticated.

               As they work...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (fed up)
                         You know, some people say that you 
                         Vulcans do nothing but patronize 
                         us... but if they were here now... 
                         if they could see how far you're 
                         bending over backwards to help me, 
                         they'd eat their words.

                                     T'POL
                              (pointed)
                         Your Captain's mission was to 
                         return the Klingon to his people. He 
                         no longer has the Klingon.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I realize he's only a simple 
                         Earthling...but did it ever occur to 
                         you that he might know what he's 
                         doing?

               T'Pol is silent.

                                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                         It's no secret Starfleet hasn't 
                         been around too long... God knows 
                         you remind us of that every chance 
                         you get... but does that mean the 
                         man who's been put in charge of this 
                         mission doesn't deserve our support?
                              (pointed)
                         Then again, loyalty's an emotion, 
                         isn't it?

               T'Pol glances at him, but before she can respond, the door 
               opens and Archer ENTERS.

                                     ARCHER
                         Having any luck?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (re: T'Pol, ironic)
                         Not really.

                                     T'POL
                              (to Archer)
                         My analysis of the spatial 
                         disturbance Mister Reed saw 
                         indicates a stealth vessel with a 
                         tricyclic plasma drive.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (off that)
                         If we can figure out the decay rate 
                         of their plasma, we'll be able to 
                         find their warp trail.

                                     T'POL
                         Unfortunately, your sensors weren't 
                         designed to measure plasma decay.

               Over the above exchange, we see Hoshi ENTER the room. It's 
               obvious she hasn't been to Engineering before. She glances 
               around, intrigued, but gets a little hesitant as she 
               approaches the pulsing warp core.

                                     HOSHI
                              (re: warp core, 
                              half-joking)
                         Are you sure it's safe to stand so 
                         close to that?

                                     ARCHER
                         What've you got?

                                     HOSHI
                         I've managed to translate most of 
                         what Klaang said. But none of it 
                         makes sense.

               She hands him a PADD.

                                     ARCHER
                         Nothing about the Suliban?

                                     HOSHI
                         Nope.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to T'Pol)
                         That name ring a bell to you?

                                     T'POL
                         They're a somewhat primitive 
                         species from Sector Three Six Four 
                         One. But they've never posed a 
                         threat.

                                     ARCHER
                         Well, they have now.
                              (to Hoshi)
                         Did he say anything about Earth?

                                     HOSHI
                         The word's not even in their 
                         database.

               Archer eyes the PADD.

                                     HOSHI (CONT'D)
                         It's all there. There were only 
                         four words I couldn't translate.  
                         probably just proper nouns.

               Archer carefully pronounces the words.

                                     ARCHER
                              (off PADD)
                         "Jelik...Sarin...Rigel.,. Tholia."

               Archer looks up to T'Pol.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         Anything sound familiar?

               T'Pol hesitates. Clearly, something has rung a bell. In 
               typical fashion, she tries not to show it.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         T'Pol?

               She pauses again... glances at Charlie, who says nothing 
               but gives her a pointed look. Finally:

                                     T'POL
                              (to Archer)
                         Rigel is a planetary system... 
                         approximately fifteen light years 
                         from our present position.

                                     ARCHER
                              (sensing more)
                         Why the hesitation?

               T'Pol realizes she's about to piss Archer off.

                                     T'POL
                         According to the navigational logs 
                         salvaged from Klaang's ship...
                         Rigel Ten was the last place he 
                         stopped before crashing on your 
                         planet.

               As angry as Archer is, he's not surprised.

                                     ARCHER
                         Why do I get the feeling you 
                         weren't going to share that little 
                         piece of information?

                                     T'POL
                         I wasn't authorized to reveal the 
                         details of our findings.

               Charlie and Hoshi exchange a look --they're uncomfortable 
               with the tension.

                                     ARCHER
                              (controlled anger)
                         The next time I learn you're 
                         withholding something... you're 
                         going to spend the rest of this 
                         voyage confined to some very cramped 
                         quarters. Understood?

               T'Pol's reaction is hard to read. Archer hits a com panel.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         Archer to helm.

                         Aye, sir.

                                     ARCHER
                         Go into the Vulcan starcharts and 
                         find a system called Rigel...  then 
                         set a course for the tenth planet.

               As Archer gives T'Pol a final look


               Klaang is restrained in an elaborate chair. Two SULIBAN 
               DOCTORS monitor sinister-looking tubes and devices that are 
               connected to the Klingon's body. Source light from an 
               off-camera window bathes the scene in a steely BLUE GLOW. 
               Silik, the Suliban seen earlier, is questioning Klaang. It's 
               clear that Klaang has been drugged.

               TWO SHUTTLEPODS can be seen in the b.g. Archer, T'Pol, 
               Charlie, Reed, Mayweather and Hoshi are wearing jackets for 
               their Away Mission.  T'Pol is handing out 
               communicator/translation devices to the crew...

                                     ARCHER
                              (mid-speech, to all)
                         Once we've disembarked, we'll be 
                         descending into the trade complex. 
                         It's comprised of thirty-six 
                         levels...

                                     T'POL
                         Your translators have been 
                         programmed for Rigelian. However, 
                         there are numerous other species 
                         working on the colony. Many of them 
                         are known to be impatient with 
                         newcomers. None of them have seen a 
                         human before. You have a tendency to 
                         be... gregarious. I suggest you try 
                         to restrain that tendency.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You forgot to warn us about 
                         drinking the water.

                                     T'POL
                              (not getting it)
                         Doctor Phlox isn't concerned with 
                         the food and water. But he does 
                         caution against intimate contact.

               An amused glance between Charlie and Mayweather.

                                     ARCHER
                              (all business)
                         The Vulcans told us Klaang was a 
                         courier. If he was here to get 
                         something, then whoever gave it to 
                         him might know why he was taken.
                              (trying to be 
                              optimistic)
                         That was only a few days ago... a 
                         seven foot Klingon doesn't go 
                         unnoticed.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A dark, cavernous thoroughfare of concrete and iron. 
               Latticeworks of conduits criss-cross the damp, poorly-lit 
               concourse. A haze hangs in the air, punctuated by shafts of 
               artificial light. Aliens from myriad species go about their 
               business, moving in and out of concealed trading alcoves. 
               Some are in uniform, some aren't, many carry sidearms.

               T'Pol and Charlie are moving through the strange setting. 
               T'Pol, who has been here before, is taking everything in 
               stride. For Charlie, it's an extraordinary yet disorienting 
               experience.

               As they duck under an unusually low support beam, a large 
               ALIEN INSECT lands briefly on Charlie's shoulder. Startled, 
               his body jerks in response and the insect flies away. T'Pol 
               shoots him a look, disapproving of his childish reaction.

               As they keep walking, eerie, dissonant ALIEN TONES catch 
               Charlie's attention...

               CHARLIE'S POV

               The sounds are coming from inside a NARROW DOORWAY. We 
               can't see clearly into the room beyond, but we catch 
               glimpses of frenetic movement within.

               CHARLIE is drawn toward the doorway.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (curious)
                         What in the world...?

                                     T'POL
                         It's nothing that concerns us.

               As they keep moving...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Through large windows we can see the landing lights of 
               alien ships coming and going through the snowy air.  The 
               room is lit only by the monitors of various control 
               stations, and the occasional sweep of a landing light from 
               outside. Archer and Hoshi are talking to the DOCK MASTER, a 
               burly alien who is preoccupied monitoring the traffic.

                                     DOCK MASTER
                         Five or six days ago? Do you 
                         realize how much traffic we process 
                         in a single day?

                                     ARCHER
                         You must keep records. This was a 
                         one-man, Klingon scout ship.

                                     DOCK MASTER
                              (eyes him)
                         What species are you?

                                     ARCHER
                         Human. We're called humans.

               Beep-beep! An alarm sounds. The Dock Master speaks into a 
               microphone...

                                     DOCK MASTER

               Archer and Hoshi are frustrated by his seeming lack of 
               attention.

               The Dock Master checks a monitor.

                                     DOCK MASTER (CONT'D)

                         It was seven days ago... a K'toch 
                         Class vessel.

                                     ARCHER
                              (encouraged)
                         Does it say who he was here to see?

                                     DOCK MASTER
                              (doesn't have time 
                              for this)
                         What it says is that he arrived at 
                         docking port six... and was given a 
                         level one bio-hazard clearance.

                                     ARCHER
                         You don't seem to be very 
                         interested in what people do here

               Archer looks to Hoshi, who's adjusting the 
               communicator/translation device she has taken out of her 
               jacket pocket.

                                     HOSHI
                         It's all right. Rigelian uses a 
                         pronominal base. The translator's 
                         just reprocessing the syntax.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Dock Master)
                         Do you have any records of a 
                         Suliban vessel coming in around the 
                         same time?

               The Dock Master reacts to this, but quickly covers:

                                     DOCK MASTER
                              (evasive)
                         Suliban? I don't know that word. 
                         Your device must still be 
                         malfunctioning.

               As he goes back to work...

               Reed and Mayweather are following a furtive ALIEN MAN. This 
               section of the structure is filled with a cacophony of 
               strange sounds and deep, blue-green lighting.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Shouldn't we call the Captain?

                                     REED
                         Maybe we should wait.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                              (to Alien Man)
                         How much longer?

                                     ALIEN MAN
                         It's not very far. I promise you.

                                     REED
                         Are you sure his name was Klaang?  
                         Couldn't it have been another 
                         Klingon you saw?

                                     ALIEN MAN
                         It was Klaang. I'm certain. I'll 
                         show you exactly where he was.

               As they keep moving.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A small "rest stop" off the main thoroughfare with a few 
               benches and chairs. Charlie sits among a bizarre assortment 
               of aliens, waiting, uncomfortable.

               He glances at a nearby WINDOW, where we can see T'Pol 
               through the glass, talking to a uniformed "alien official." 
               The sound of CRYING draws Charlie's attention...

               AN ALIEN CHILD is nearby, wearing an exotic BREATHING 
               APPARATUS. The MOTHER is tweaking a small control on the 
               device, seemingly taunting the child, who is crying.

               CHARLIE is unsettled. He glances back at the window. T'Pol 
               finishes talking to the official, exits through a small 
               door, and heads toward the sitting area. She motions to 
               Charlie, who joins her.

               T'Pol removes her communicator and flips it open.

                                     T'POL
                              (to com)
                         T'Pol to Archer.

                         Go ahead.

               Charlie glances back at the alien child, who is in 
               increasing distress. He can no longer control himself.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to mother)
                         Hey...

               The woman shoots him a dirty look and ignores him

                                     T'POL
                              (to com)
                         Central Security claims to have no 
                         record of Klaang. But they told me 
                         about an enclave on Level Nineteen 
                         where Klingons have been known to 
                         go. Something about live food.

                         Where on Level Nineteen?

                                     T'POL
                         The easternmost subsection... by 
                         the geothermal shafts.

                         I'll meet you there as soon as I 
                         can. Archer out.

               The alien child is now nearly hysterical. The mother has 
               disconnected the breathing tube and the child appears to be 
               suffocating. Charlie instinctively moves to help.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (on the move)
                         What're you doing? Leave the kid 
                         alone!

               T'Pol grabs him by the arm.

                                     T'POL
                         Don't get involved.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (protesting)
                         Do you see what she's doing? He's 
                         going to suffocate!

                                     T'POL
                         They're Lorillians. Before the age 
                         of four, they can only breathe 
                         methyloxide.
                              (pointed)
                         The mother is simply weaning her 
                         son.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (beat)
                         Could've fooled me.

               He notices that the child is beginning to breathe on his 
               own. As they exit the sitting area...

                                     T'POL
                         Humans can't refrain from drawing 
                         conclusions.
                              (sharply)
                         You should learn to objectify other 
                         cultures... so you can determine 
                         when to interfere, and when not to.

               Charlie glances back at the child. He doesn't like being 
               lectured to, but realizes he's made a mistake.

               NEW ANGLE -A FIGURE

               is watching them from the shadows. The figure steps into 
               the light, revealing dappled flesh and dilated pupils... 
               Suliban.  OFF the ominous moment...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TWO BEAUTIFUL ALIEN WOMEN (OPTICAL)

               scantily clad, exotic features, swaying to an alien rhythm.

               Hanging between them is a thin, undulating lantern, 
               surrounded by dozens of flitting butterflies. The women 
               slowly move closer to the lantern... seductively, one of 
               them opens her mouth and arches her head. An eight-inch 
               TONGUE quickly darts out and snares a butterfly. The other 
               woman does the same -thwiip

               REVEAL WE'RE IN -

               NIGHT(OPTICAL)

               Reed and Mayweather are standing in a crowd of spectators, 
               watching the butterfly-women with a mixture of arousal and 
               disgust. The Alien Man seen earlier stands nearby, eyeing 
               them.

                                     ALIEN MAN
                         Would you like to meet them? I can 
                         arrange it.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Is this where you saw Klaang?

                                     ALIEN MAN
                         No, no, not here. I'II show you 
                         where. But first, you should enjoy 
                         yourselves!
                              (to Reed, re: 
                              butterfly- women)
                         Which one would you prefer?

               Reed is uncomfortable in this setting... but he's intrigued 
               by it all despite himself.

                                     REED
                         We're here to learn about the 
                         Klingon...
                              (eyes women)
                         Are those real butterflies, or some 
                         -kind of holograms?

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         We should get going, sir.

                                     REED
                         Yes, absolutely, you're right.

               They start walking through the narrow arcade filled with 
               erotic pleasures... including a topless fire-eater who we 
               only see from behind.

                                     ALIEN MAN
                              (sensing they're 
                              getting away)
                         Gentlemen, gentlemen! Perhaps you'd 
                         prefer to watch the inter-
                         species performance!

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         You don't know anything about 
                         Klaang, do you?

                                     ALIEN MAN
                         Of course I do, but there's no 
                         reason to hurry.

                                     REED
                         "Inter-species performance?"

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Lieutenant... this man has no 
                         intention of helping us.

                                     REED
                              (to Alien Man, 
                              politely)
                         Perhaps another time

               The Alien Man shakes his head, disappointed, and disappears 
               into the crowd. As the two of them move away from the 
               action...

                                     MAYWEATHER (re: Alien Man)
                         I can't believe we fell for that.

                                     REED
                              (glancing back over 
                              his shoulder)
                         We are explorers.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               In contrast to the lively "red light district", this level 
               is desolate and eerie. Deep grinding noises from the power 
               generators below can be heard echoing through the damp 
               floors. Archer and Hoshi are moving cautiously past rows of 
               GEOTHERMAL DUCTS which are violently venting STEAM

                                     HOSHI
                         Isn't an enclave supposed to have 
                         people?

                                     ARCHER
                         "Enclave" could mean a lot of 
                         things.

               They keep walking. Hoshi is getting a little spooked.

                                     HOSHI
                         T' Pol said something about "live" 
                         food. I don't see any restaurants...

               Archer's senses are at full alert. He sees something.

               In the distance, two KLINGONS are quickly moving through 
               the shadows away from them.

                                     ARCHER
                              (calls out)
                         Hello... excuse me!

               The Klingons don't respond, but continue to move away with 
               urgency. Archer doesn't like what he's seeing.

                                     HOSHI
                              (calls out, in 
                              Klingon)
                         Ha'quj jeg!

               Silence. They're gone.

                                     HOSHI (CONT'D)
                         They looked Klingon to me.

               Odd scratching sounds cause them both to look about. 
               Something isn't right here. Archer flips open his 
               communicator.

                                     ARCHER (to com)
                         Archer to T'Pol.
                              (beat)
                         T'Pol, come in.

               No response. A noise above causes them both to look up.

                                     HOSHI
                              (anxiety rising)
                         Maybe we should get back to where 
                         there are more people.

               Archer draws his pistol.

                                     ARCHER
                         There are plenty of people right 
                         here.
                              (quietly)
                         Stay behind me.

               Archer and Hoshi move through the shadows. The pounding 
               machinery below seems accentuated. They pass by an erupting 
               geothermal duct... steam billowing around them... when 
               suddenly:

               A SULIBAN emerges from the steam and grabs Hoshi, who 
               screams!  

               Archer whirls to take aim, but TWO more SULIBAN quickly 
               rush at him from different directions!  Archer's pistol is 
               KNOCKED from his hand. He swings and gets off a couple of 
               good PUNCHES at one of the attackers, but the Suliban is 
               unfazed and they quickly immobilize him.

               As Archer and Hoshi are pulled into the darkness...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               (OPTICAL)

               A steamy maze of vertical, diagonal and horizontal conduits.

               Archer and Hoshi are led in by the three Suliban, who now 
               hold the plasma pistol. They're brought into a small open 
               area, where T'Pol and Charlie are being held. One of the 
               Suliban works a hand-held device, and we see an ENERGY FIELD 
               flash OFF. Hoshi is led into the energy field. The guard 
               exits and we see the field flash ON again. (NOTE: These 
               Suliban are dressed differently than the ones we saw on 
               Enterprise.

               Our people have now begun to sweat from the intense heat. 
               The Suliban are unaffected by the temperature.

               As Archer is led away by two of the Suliban, T'Pol's look 
               toward him says "I told you so" in no uncertain terms.

               NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

               Archer is led into an area with beds, tables and chairs, as 
               well as a few high-tech computers. This underground level 
               serves as the base of operations for a small group of 
               Suliban dissidents.

               The two Suliban EXIT the area, leaving Archer alone in the 
               peculiar setting. After a beat, a quiet female VOICE is 
               heard:

                                     SARIN
                              (O.C.)
                         You're looking for Klaang... why?

                                     ARCHER
                              (glancing around)
                         Who the hell are you?

               SARIN steps out of the shadows. She's strikingly beautiful 
               and appears to be human.

                                     SARIN
                         My name is Sarin.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me about the people who took 
                         Klaang off your ship.

                                     ARCHER
                         I was hoping you could tell me... 
                         they looked a lot like your friends 
                         outside.

               Sarin steps toward him...

                                     SARIN
                         Where were you taking him?

                                     ARCHER
                         How come you don't look like your 
                         friends?

               She's uncomfortably close now...

                                     SARIN
                         Would you prefer I did?

                                     ARCHER
                         What I'd prefer is that you give me 
                         Klaang back.

                                     SARIN
                         So you could take him where?

                                     ARCHER
                         Home... we were just taking him 
                         home.

               Sarin is now inches away... she seems to be gauging him...

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                              (wry)
                         You'd better be careful. I'm a lot 
                         bigger than you are.

               Sarin moves her face close to his...

                                     SARIN
                         If you're thinking about harming 
                         me, I'd advise against it.

               She runs the back of her hand along his jaw line.,,

                                     ARCHER
                         What are you doing?

                                     SARIN
                         Why were you taking Klaang home?

               She moves her fingers across his face...

                                     ARCHER
                         You know, under different 
                         circumstances, I might be flattered 
                         by this, but...

               She kisses him on the mouth. After a couple of seconds, she 
               steps a few feet back... and her face and arms TRANSFORM 
               into the dappled, creepy appearance of a SULIBAN. Archer 
               reacts.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         That's never happened before.

                                     SARIN
                         I've been given the ability to... 
                         measure trust... but it requires 
                         close contact.

                                     ARCHER
                         You're Suliban...

                                     SARIN
                         I'm a member of the Cabal... but 
                         not any longer. The price of 
                         evolution was too high.

                                     ARCHER
                         Evolution?

                                     SARIN
                              (carefully)
                         Some of my people are so anxious to 
                         "improve" themselves that they've 
                         lost perspective.

               Archer, baffled by what she's saying, gets to the point.

                                     ARCHER
                         So you know I'm not lying to you... 
                         now what?

                                     SARIN
                         Klaang was carrying a message to 
                         his people...

                                     ARCHER
                         How do you know that?

                                     SARIN
                         I gave it to him.

                                     ARCHER
                         What kind of message?

                                     SARIN
                         The Suliban have been staging 
                         attacks within the Klingon Empire... 
                         making it appear that one faction is 
                         attacking another.
                              (beat)
                         Klaang was bringing proof of this 
                         to his High Council. Without that 
                         proof, the Empire could be thrown 
                         into chaos.

                                     ARCHER
                         Why would the Suliban want that?

                                     SARIN
                         The Cabal doesn't make decisions on 
                         its own. They're simply soldiers... 
                         fighting a Temporal Cold War.

                                     ARCHER
                         Temporal? You've lost me.

                                     SARIN
                         They're taking orders from the 
                         distant future.

                                     ARCHER
                         (baffled} What?

               Over the following, we SEE one of Silik's Suliban skitter 
               across the ceiling in the b.g. He goes unnoticed and slips 
               into shadow.

                                     SARIN
                              (changing subject)
                         We can help you find Klaang... but 
                         we don't have a starship.
                         You'll have to take us with you.

               Suddenly, there's a blinding FLASH of blue light as a 
               Suliban weapons DISCHARGE strikes the nearby computer 
               station, blowing it apart! They react, startled.

               Another weapons BLAST hits closer to them. Sarin and Archer 
               rush out of the area just as two SULIBAN ATTACKERS move into 
               view and start FIRING toward them!

               NEW ANGLE -GEOTHERMAL ACCESS LEVEL -ON THE AWAY TEAM 104 
               (OPTICAL)

               All hell is breaking loose. T'Pol, Charlie and Hoshi are 
               trapped within the energy field as a BATTLE RAGES nearby 
               --Suliban versus Suliban! In the b.g., we can hear weapons 
               fire and people yelling.

               One of Sarin's Suliban lies dead nearby... while another is 
               exchanging weapons FIRE with two Suliban Attackers.  Sarin's 
               Suliban BLASTS one attacker, who falls to the ground... but 
               he is KILLED by the second!

               The Suliban Attacker then turns on the Away Team. He starts 
               FIRING at the energy field, trying to disrupt it!  The field 
               flashes and fritzes, terrifying!

               Sarin steps into view. She takes aim and FIRES at the 
               Attacker, who's blown off his feet. She rushes to a control 
               panel and works it. The field FLASHES OFF. Sarin opens a 
               nearby locker and starts handing the crew their 
               phase-pistols.

                                     SARIN (CONT'D)
                              (to Archer)
                         Where's your vessel?

                         On the roof... Docking Port three.

               Hoshi glances up to see --

               TWO SULIBAN (OPTICAL)

               One is chasing the other along the underside of a diagonal 
               conduit high above the ground. Both appear to defy gravity, 
               rapidly crawling along the pipe.

               HOSHI reacts.

                                     SARIN
                         This way.

               As Sarin leads them off... a SULIBAN ATTACKER drops into 
               CLOSE UP, threatening!

               TWO OF SARIN'S SULIBAN (OPTICAL)

               are ducking and weaving through the maze of conduits with 
               heightened agility, firing at off-camera assailants. One is 
               struck down by a weapons blast!

               HIGH ANGLE -ARCHER AND SARIN (OPTICAL)

               In the distance, we can see FLASHES of WEAPONS -- the 
               battle rages on. We BOOM DOWN to find Archer and Sarin on 
               the movie with T'Pol, Charlie and Hoshi. Tension as they 
               navigate the jungle of pipes, weapons fire in the b.g.

               Sarin reaches a massive VERTICAL CONDUIT, hits a control, 
               which opens a HATCH leading into the large pipe. Inside we 
               see a circular PLATFORM a couple of feet above the deck.

               Sarin goes to a control mechanism and stands by as Archer 
               helps Hoshi climb onto the platform... followed by T'Pol...

               Distant weapons fire STREAKS by! Everyone tenses. Charlie 
               jumps up onto the platform, followed by Archer.

               Sarin pulls a series of LEVERS, and we HEAR the rushing 
               sound of thermal energy... and the platform begins to 
               TREMBLE slightly.

               Sarin moves toward the platform when WHAM! she's hit in the 
               back

               by a weapons blast! REVEAL --

               SILIK (OPTICAL) who has just fired the shot from across the 
               room, weapon trained on Sarin. He FIRES again!

               SARIN (OPTICAL)

               falls! The points of impact glow and sizzle as they BURN 
               their way into Sarin's writhing body.

               ARCHER AND CHARLIE (OPTICAL)

               jump off the platform! As Archer moves to Sarin... Charlie 
               takes aim and starts FIRING his pistol at the (off-camera) 
               attacker.

               SILIK (OPTICAL)

               takes cover behind an outcropping of pipes

               ARCHER (OPTICAL)

               kneels down to help Sarin, who is dying

                         Find Klaang.

               Sarin starts to lose consciousness. Archer realizes there's 
               nothing he can do and stands.

                                     ARCHER
                              (calls out)
                         Charlie!

               Archer jumps back onto the trembling platform, quickly 
               followed by Charlie. A weapons blast strikes nearby!

               Archer slides the hatch SHUT, and the moment he does --


               Archer and his team react as the platform BLASTS UPWARD 
               through the shaft, shooting PAST at rapid speed, propelled 
               by a roiling pillar of steam!

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Reed and Mayweather are warm and dry, as the snow storm 
               rages outside the window. The shuttle is parked on the 
               landing deck.

               Reed is working the com. Archer's unintelligible voice is

               Reed and Mayweather, as before. There's a muted FLASH of 
               LIGHT outside the window. They react.

                                     REED
                         I've never seen lightning in a

               There's a slight THUMP from outside. Reed turns for an 
               instant, but returns to his work.

                         I found her.

               Reed looks over. Both men quickly move to an EMERGENCY 
               HATCH on the side of the ship and fire the release 
               mechanism.  The door pops out a few inches and slowly begins 
               to lower, a gush of cold air blowing into the shuttle...


               Charlie and Hoshi are now on board. Mayweather's at the 
               helm, preparing for launch. Reed reaches out of the open 
               hatch and pulls T'Pol inside to safety.

               ROOFTOP DOCKING PORT (OPTICAL)

               Archer is getting closer to the shuttle, firing shot after 
               shot...

               SILIK AND HIS MAN

               have now separated, forcing Archer to choose a target.

               ARCHER (OPTICAL)

               has almost reached the shuttle.  He aims slightly left and 
               is HIT in the LEG by a blast from Silik's weapon! He falls 
               and grimaces as the point of impact BURNS its way into his 
               flesh. Another SHOT hits nearby, barely missing him!

               Charlie and Reed jump onto the deck. Reed OPENS FIRE as 
               Charlie pulls Archer through the hatch!


               Mayweather working the helm. We HEAR the hatch CLOSE and

                         Ignore it. Take us up.

               Mayweather works. Hoshi kneels by Archer, who is badly 
               wounded, lying on the floor, barely conscious. The shuttle 
               JOLTS slightly... then again! Hoshi grabs hold of a bulkhead.


               Mid-flight, trembling from the storm, lights flickering.

               Mayweather at the helm. T'Pol, Charlie and Reed are seated, 
               Hoshi beside Archer on the floor.

                         he slowly loses consciousness...

               Billowy clouds and trees swaying in the stiff breeze.

               Young Archer stands working a small control unit, while his 
               father sits in the sand beside him.

                                     FATHER
                         Your pitch is too low. Bring up the

               is buffeted by the wind, hits the branches of a tree and 
               crashes into the sand.

                         looks frustrated.

                                     FATHER
                         It's okay, you almost got it. Try 
                         again.

               Young Archer works the controls...

                                     THE MODEL (OPTICAL)
                         is airborne again, but wavers as it

                         works the device, frustrated.

                         I can't do it!

                                     FATHER
                         Yes, you can. Take her up... 
                         straight and steady.

                         Damn Young Archer kneels at the 
                         slightly bruised model, his father 
                         beside him.

                                     FATHER
                         You can't be afraid of the wind... 
                         learn to trust it.

               THE BOY HEARS SOMETHING AND TURNS HIS HEAD,

               HIS POV - T'POL (OPTICAL)

               is standing silently against the bright sky, watching them.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               A long beat, then within the darkness, a small METAL SLAT 
               slides open. Doctor Phlox peers in through a window, his 
               voice amplified over the com:

                                     PHLOX
                         It shouldn't take more than a few 
                         moments.

               REVEAL we're in --


               Charlie and T'Pol are standing in the small room, dimly-lit 
               by ultraviolet light. Their uniforms are still wet from the 
               blowing snow.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (impatient)
                         Is this really necessary?

                                     PHLOX
                         The others scanned negative. You 
                         two, unfortunately, were exposed to 
                         a protocystian spore. I've loaded 
                         the appropriate decon-gel into 
                         compartment-B.

               Resigned, Charlie and T'Pol begin to undress...

                                     T'POL
                              (to Phlox)
                         Tell Mister Mayweather to prepare 
                         to leave orbit.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How's the Captain?

                                     PHLOX
                         I'm treating his wound

                                     CHARLIE
                         Will he be all right?

                                     PHLOX
                         Eventually The metal slat slides 
                         SHUT. Charlie and T'Pol open small 
                         LOCKERS.

               T'Pol places her uniform on a hook, while Charlie simply 
               tosses his in. Charlie strips down to his shorts; T'Pol, to 
               a pair of underwear and a short-cropped tee-shirt. They open 
               a compartment labeled "B" and remove two small CANNISTERS 
               containing a deep blue gelatinous compound.

               Over the following scene, they begin applying the gel to 
               their bodies. It's obvious that this is a part of their 
               training...  modesty is not a question. The phosphorescent 
               gel glistens on their skin in the ultraviolet light.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't 
                         you just kind of an "observer" on 
                         this mission? I don't remember 
                         anyone telling me you were a member 
                         of Starfleet.

                                     T'POL
                         My Vulcan rank supersedes yours.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Apples and oranges. This is an 
                         Earth vessel. You're in no position 
                         to take command.

                                     T'POL
                         As soon as we're through here, I'll 
                         contact Ambassador Soval.
                         He'll speak to your superiors and 
                         I'm certain they'll support my 
                         authority in this situation.

               Charlie knows that if she makes that call, the mission is 
               over.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You must really be proud of 
                         yourself. You can put an end to this 
                         mission while the Captain's still 
                         unconscious in Sickbay. You won't 
                         even have to look him in the eye.

               They continue rubbing their bodies with the glowing gel.

                                     T'POL
                         Your precious "cargo" was stolen... 
                         three Suliban, perhaps more, were 
                         killed... and Captain Archer has 
                         been seriously wounded. It seems to 
                         me this "mission" has put an end to 
                         itself.
                              (beat)
                         Turn around.

               Charlie turns and T'Pol begins to smear the gel on his 
               back, rhythmically rubbing it slowly down to the waistband 
               of his shorts. As sensual as this might seem, they continue 
               talking as though it's business as usual.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let's say you're right... let's say 
                         we screwed up just like you always 
                         knew we would.
                              (beat)
                         It's still a pretty good bet that 
                         whoever blew that hole in the 
                         Captain's leg is connected somehow 
                         to the people who took Klaang.

                                     T'POL
                         I fail to see your point.

               She finishes with the back of his thighs, stands and turns. 
               As Charlie begins to rub decon-gel on her back, she raises 
               the tee-shirt up to her shoulders.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Captain Archer deserves a chance to 
                         see this through. If you knew him, 
                         you'd realize that's what he's 
                         about. He needs to finish what he 
                         starts.
                              (pointed)
                         His daddy was the same way.

                                     T'POL
                         You obviously share your Captain's 
                         belief that my people were 
                         responsible for impeding Henry 
                         Archer's accomplishments.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He only wanted to see his engine 
                         fly... they never even gave him a 
                         chance to fail. (beat)
                         And here you are, thirty years 
                         later, proving just how consistent 
                         you Vulcans can be.

               T'Pol takes this in, affected by his words but revealing 
               nothing...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE ON CAPTAIN ARCHER

               as he opens his eyes, regaining consciousness. He's lying 
               on a bio-bed. He grimaces in pain, looks down toward his 
               legs. REVEAL

               we're in --


               Archer is partially reclined on the bio-bed. Doctor Phlox 
               is working on Archer's left thigh, carefully removing a 
               saucer-sized, leech-like ALIEN CREATURE from the now-healing 
               wound.

                                     PHLOX
                              (sees he's awake)
                         Very nice, very nice... your 
                         myofibers are fusing beautifully.

               Phlox places the creature into a jar of liquid.

                                     ARCHER
                         How long have I been...?

                                     PHLOX
                         Less than six hours. I thought it 
                         best to keep you sedated while the 
                         osmotic eel cauterized your wound.

               Archer looks at the creature swimming in the liquid.

                                     ARCHER
                         Thanks.

               T'Pol and Charlie ENTER and move to the bio-bed.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How are you doing, Captain?

                         That depends. What's been going on 
                         for the last six hours?

               Charlie glances at T'Pol.

                                     T'POL
                         As your highest ranking officer, I 
                         assumed command while you were 
                         incapacitated.

               Archer senses that the ship is moving.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Charlie)
                         Are we underway?

               Charlie nods.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                              (to T'Pol)
                         You didn't waste much time, did you?

                                     T'POL
                              (to Phlox)
                         Is he fit to resume command?

                                     PHLOX
                         As long as he returns for more eel 
                         therapy tomorrow.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Charlie)
                         How long before we get back to 
                         Earth?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Earth, sir?

                                     T'POL
                         We're currently tracking the 
                         Suliban vessel that left Rigel 
                         shortly after you were injured.

               Archer is surprised and a little skeptical.

                                     ARCHER
                         You got their... plasma decay rate?

                                     T'POL
                         With Mister Tucker's assistance, I 
                         modified the sensors.  You now have 
                         the resolution to detect their warp 
                         trail.

               Archer is bolstered by this, tries to sit up, wincing a 
               little.

                                     ARCHER
                         What happened to "this is a foolish 
                         mission?"

                                     T'POL
                         It is a foolish mission. The 
                         Suliban are clearly a hostile race 
                         with technology far superior to 
                         yours.

                         But as Acting Captain, I was 
                         obligated to anticipate your wishes.

                                     ARCHER
                         As Acting Captain, you could've 
                         done whatever the hell you wanted to 
                         do.

               T'Po1 doesn't respond. After a beat:

                                     T'POL
                         I should return to the Bridge.

                                     ARCHER
                              (still skeptical)
                         Dismissed.

               T'Pol turns and EXITS.

                         Modifying the sensors was her idea, 
                         sir.

               OFF Archer's puzzled look...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I never had to worry about

               Suddenly, the "pings" take on a different sound.

                         It's okay, Travis. I'll keep an eye 
                         on the engine.

               Mayweather works. As the "pinging" returns to normal...


               Archer is sitting in a chair with his injured leg up on a 
               pillow.

               He's wearing a dark tee-shirt and pair of pants. WARP STARS 
               streak by outside the window.

               The computer beeps. Archer glances at someone off-camera.

                         doesn't sound very Vulcan.

               The off-camera person is silent.

                                     ARCHER

                         Suliban woman was telling the truth, 
                         it's crucial that we try to find him.

                         Computer, pause.

               Archer stands, thoughtful, tries out his foot, which seems 
               to be fine, moves across the room.

                         "Temporal Cold War." My instincts 
                         tell me not to trust her.

               A beat, then Archer senses something. He glances out the 
               window to see the ship is dropping OUT OF WARP.

                         through its outer- radiation belt.

               Mayweather works. Archer paces as the orange planet grows 
               LARGER.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)

                         fragments.

               Archer turns to T'Pol.

                         You finished helping us?

               T'Pol walks to Reed's station and hits a control. The 
               Viewscreen shows a new GRAPHIC of the GAS GIANT --above it 
               we can see a FRAGMENTED ION TRAIL, like a contrail that's 
               been broken up by winds.

                                     T'POL

                         Run a spectral analysis of the 
                         fragments.

               Reed hits a series of controls. On the graphic, a sequence 
               of NUMBERS appears by each fragment; the sequences are all 
               different.

                                     REED
                         (re: graphic, discouraged) There's

               T'Pol reacts to this, realizing something... she steps 
               toward the Viewscreen.

                                     T'POL

                         Calculate the trajectory of each 
                         fragment.

               Reep looks a bit confused, looks to the Captain. Archer, 
               catching on, steps forward next to T'Pol.

                                     ARCHER
                              (to Reed)
                         You heard her.

               Reed works --he doesn't have a clue what they're looking 
               for.

               Archer and T'Pol exchange a look: despite their mistrust of 
               each other, they're both thinking alike for the first time. 
               The Viewscreen graphic now displays TELEMETRY for each of 
               the fragments.  Archer nods to T'Pol, who moves to a nearby 
               station and starts working. Over this:

                         Recalibrate the sensor array -- 
                         narrow-band, short-to-mid-range.

                         Aye.

                              (to Mayweather)
                         Measure the particle density of the 
                         thermosphere.

                         (to all, re: graphic} Those 
                         "fragments" weren't from one Suliban 
                         ship...

                                     T'POL
                              (off console)
                         ...they were from fourteen... and 
                         all within the last six hours.  I 
                         believe we've found what we're 
                         looking for.

               Archer takes a beat, then makes a difficult decision:

                                     ARCHER (to Reed)
                         How are your targeting scanners?

                         polarize the hull plating.

               Reactions all around. No one expected an armed conflict 
               during during this journey. As they brace themselves...

               As seen earlier. Dimly-lit, cylindrical, bisected by a 
               barrier of energy. Silik is reporting to the murky Humanoid 
               Figure. As they speak, their words and images PRE-ECHO in 
               the strange, time-shifting effect:

                         them before they locate the Helix.

                                     HUMANOID FIGURE
                         We didn't plan to involve the 
                         humans or the Vulcans... not yet .

                         Sarin's message cannot reach 
                         Kronos. If the humans have it, you 
                         must stop them.

               As Silik takes this in...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Archer in command, others at their stations. The Viewscreen 
               shows the gaseous layer rushing past. Everyone's tense:

                                     HOSHI
                         Sensor resolution's falling off at 
                         about twelve kilometers...

                              (concerned)
                         Travis?

                              (intensely working 
                              helm)
                         I'm okay, Captain...

               T'Pol is busy at her console.

                                     T'POL
                         Our situation should improve. We're 
                         about to break through the 
                         cyclohexane layer.

               All eyes on the Viewscreen as the orange layer of gas gives 
               way to an even DENSER LAYER of ROILING BLUE LIQUID. The ship 
               instantly begins to TREMBLE violently.

                                     ARCHER
                              (holding on)
                         I wouldn't exactly call this an 
                         improvement.

               T'Pol, calm and fascinated, activates a small viewer at her 
               station and peers into its eyepiece.

                                     T'POL
                         Liquid phosphorous. I wouldn't have 
                         expected that beneath a layer of 
                         cyclohexane.

               The ship continues to buffet. Hoshi's doing her best to 
               cover her white-knuckle anxiety.

                                     HOSHI
                              (to Archer)
                         You might think about recommending 
                         seat belts when we get home.

                                     ARCHER
                         It's just a little bad weather.

               A few more seconds of intense shaking... and then: PERFECT 
               CALM as Enterprise descends into a CLEAR LAYER. On the 
               Viewscreen, we see roiling gasses above. Beep-beep-beep!

                                     HOSHI
                         We've got sensors!

                         I'm detecting two vessels... 
                         bearing one-one-nine mark seven.

                                     ARCHER (to Hoshi)
                         Put it up.

               Hoshi works, and the Viewscreen changes to show TWO SULIBAN 
               CELL SHIPS moving away in the distance. The unique vessels 
               are quite small, about twice the size of one of our 
               shuttlepods.

                         What kind of weapons?

                                     REED
                         We're too far away.

                         Sir, I'm picking up something at 
                         three-forty-two mark twelve...  it's 
                         a lot bigger.

               Hoshi works the Viewscreen, which now shows the SULIBAN 
               HELIX.

                                     ARCHER

               T'Pol works, rapidly gathering data on the Helix.

                         Go tighter.

               Hoshi taps a control, and we get a CLOSER VIEW of the 
               HELIX. It's comprised of hundreds of smaller, modular 
               Suliban ships which are interlocked to form a massive, 
               spiral-shaped space station. A few individual CELL SHIPS are 
               seen engaging and disengaging from the Helix.

                         isolate a Klingon, if there is one.

               A sudden JOLT!

               Mid-emergency, trembling. A couple of conduits are spewing 
               GAS.

               Charlie has his hands wrapped around a pressure VALVE 
               that's HISSING ominously.

                         Take us up.


               Trembling. Archer's crossing to T'Pol, who is now working a 
               monitor near Hoshi.

                                     ARCHER
                         What've you got?

               The monitor displays an IMAGE of the Suliban HELIX from 
               directly above.  T'Pol taps the controls, and the image 
               SHIFTS so we can see it from the side.

                                     T'POL
                              (off monitor)
                         It appears to be an aggregate 
                         structure... comprised of hundreds 
                         of vessels. They're held in place by 
                         an interlocking system of magnetic 
                         seals.

               Hoshi's been busy working, as well. On the monitor, a 
               column of bio-data appears next to a small section of the 
               Helix.

                                     HOSHI
                         There, right there! (re: monitor)
                         These bio-readings are not Suliban.

                                     T'POL (eyes them)
                         We can't be certain they're Klingon.

               Hoshi shoots her an irritated look.

                         Evidently, theirs were.

               WHAM! A hard SHAKE causes a console to SPARK near Hoshi, 
               who leaps back, startled.

                                     ARCHER
                         (to Mayweather) Hold your 
                         position...

                                     REED
                         The lead ship's closing... seven 
                         thousand meters... six thousand...

               WHAM! The hardest HIT yet!

                                     T'POL
                         We should ascend!

                                     ARCHER
                         Hold your position!

                                     REED
                         One thousand meters...

               Another JOLT!

                                     REED (CONT'D)
                         Forward plating's off-line!

                                     ARCHER
                         Now, Mister Reed!


               Mild trembling begins as we re-enter the turbulent layer. 
               Reed eyes his station.

                                     REED
                              (a little cocky)
                         Hello!
                              (turns to Archer)
                         Their ship's in the Launch Bay.

               Archer nods to him -- good work. OFF Reed, pleased.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A tactical center off the Main Bridge, filled with various 
               read-outs and a large TABLE GRAPHIC. Archer, Charlie and 
               Mayweather are huddled around the table, which shows 
               numerous graphics of the CELL SHIP -- different angles of 
               the exterior, engine schematics, flight controls, etc. Mild 
               trembling.

                                     MAYWEATHER (points to graphic)
                         All right, what's this?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (smiles with 
                              confidence)
                         The pitch control.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                              (pointing to another 
                              spot)
                         No, that's the pitch control. This 
                         is the guidance system.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Pitch control... guidance system. 
                         ..got it.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                              (to Archer)
                         The docking interface.
                         How do you deploy it?

                                     ARCHER
                              (using graphic)
                         Release the inertial clamps here, 
                         here, and here... then initialize 
                         the coaxial ports.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         Good.
                              (to Charlie)
                         Where's the auxiliary throttle?

               Charlie hesitates.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (points)
                         Hmm. It's not this one...

                                     MAYWEATHER
                              (to Archer)
                         With all due respect to Commander 
                         Tucker... I'm pretty sure I could 
                         fly this thing, sir.

                                     ARCHER
                         I don't doubt it, but I need you 
                         here...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (points)
                         There... that's it... the auxiliary 
                         throttle.

               The scene is interrupted by a low-frequency booom... which 
               grows louder and then WHAM! The ship is JOLTED!

                                     T'POL (O.S.) (O.S.)
                         Captain.

               They turn to see --

               NEW ANGLE -INCLUDING THE MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

               T'Pol is at her station, looking to Archer with concern.

                                     T'POL (CONT'D)
                         That charge contained a proximity 
                         sweep. If we remain here, they're 
                         going to locate us.

               Archer nods, turns to Mayweather.

                                     ARCHER
                         You're gonna have to speed this up 
                         a little, Travis.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How complicated can it be? Up, 
                         down, forward, reverse... we'll 
                         figure it out.

               Archer's look tells us he doesn't share Charlie's 
               confidence...


               Two low-frequency booms are heard, followed by two JOLTS 
               more quickly than before. Over this, Archer is giving T'Pol 
               final instructions. There's a sense of urgency:

                                     ARCHER
                         We'll be back before you know it. 
                         Have Mayweather plot a course for 
                         Kronos.

                                     T'POL
                         There's a Vulcan ship less than two 
                         days away. It's illogical to attempt 
                         this alone.

                                     ARCHER
                         I was beginning to think you 
                         understood why we have to do this 
                         alone.

                                     T'POL
                         You'll have other opportunities to 
                         demonstrate your... independence.

                                     ARCHER
                         Never put off 'til tomorrow...

                                     T'POL
                         You both could be killed.

                                     ARCHER
                         Am I sensing concern? Last time I 
                         checked, that was considered an 
                         emotion.

                                     T'POL
                              (covering)
                         If anything happens to either of 
                         you, the Vulcan High Command will 
                         hold me responsible.

               Archer smiles. The door CHIMES.

                                     ARCHER
                         Come in.

               Reed ENTERS, carrying two silver equipment cases.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                              (to Reed)
                         You're finished?

               As Reed sets the cases on the desk, and flips the lid on 
               one of them to reveal a RECTANGULAR DEVICE.

                                     REED
                              (re: device)
                         It should reverse the polarity of 
                         any maglock within a hundred meters.
                              (indicating the 
                              controls)
                         Once you've set the sequence, 
                         you'll have five seconds.

               Archer nods, studying it.

                                     REED (CONT'D)
                         One more thing.

               He flips open the other equipment case, and pulls out two 
               Starfleet HAND PHASERS with pistol-grips. He gives them to 
               Archer.

                                     ARCHER
                         Ah. Our new weapons.

                                     REED
                         They're called phase-pistols. They 
                         have two settings: stun and

               kill. It would be best not to confuse them.

               Another low boom... then a startling JOLT!

                                     ARCHER
                              (to T'Pol)
                         The ship is yours.

               He turns for the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Cramped, trembling. Archer and Charlie are sharing the 
               single cockpit bench; surrounded by alien technology. Their 
               visibility through the blue gas is non-existent.

               A light on a side panel begins to blink, and an ALARM is 
               heard.

                                     ARCHER
                         What's that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Travis said not to worry about that 
                         panel.

                                     ARCHER
                         That's reassuring.

               The ship is buffeted by a sudden pocket of turbulence, and 
               the two men are knocked together. Charlie, holding an alien 
               steering mechanism with both hands, overcompensates, and the 
               ship weaves for a moment before it stabilizes. Archer looks 
               a bit queasy.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         They sure didn't build these things 
                         for comfort.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Wait 'til we get the Klingon in 
                         here with us.
                              (off panel)
                         If I'm reading this right, we 
                         should be about twenty kilometers 
                         from Enterprise.

                                     ARCHER
                         Drop the pitch thirty degrees.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               We hear the low-frequency boom of a depth charge...

                                     REED
                              (to all)
                         Hold on.

               Everyone braces as the ship JOLTS.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         That one was a lot closer...

                                     REED
                         If we change our position, they'll 
                         have to start from scratch.

                                     T'POL
                         If we change our position, the 
                         Captain will have no way of finding 
                         us.

               OFF the tension...


               Trembling, as before...

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think we're there.

                                     ARCHER
                         Bring the docking interface on-line.

               Charlie goes to press a button, thinks better of it, then 
               presses another one. The interface HUMS to life.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         Coaxial ports.

               Charlie hits another control. We hear a brief HISSING sound.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Open.

               Archer takes a deep breath.

                                     ARCHER
                         Let's go.

               Charlie takes the steering mechanism in both hands, and 
               gently begins to ease the ship downward. Through the 
               windows, we see the blue phosphorous clouds begin to thin 
               out... and we abruptly BREAK THROUGH into CLEAR SPACE. The 
               trembling stops.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (looking around, 
                              confused)
                         Where is it? It was right here.

               Archer studies an alien graphic.

                                     ARCHER
                         Bank starboard, ninety degrees.

               Charlie moves the steering controller, and the ship BANKS 
               SHARPLY, dizzily revealing the huge SULIBAN HELIX directly 
               below them.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (jazzed)
                         There you are!

                                     ARCHER
                              (indicating)
                         That's the upper-support radius. 
                         Drop down right below it.. .and 
                         start a counter-clockwise sweep.

               Archer removes a hand-held scanner from his belt and starts 
               working it.


               Charlie slows their descent, and begins maneuvering the 
               ship horizontally, the hull of the HELIX moving past the 
               windows.

                                     ARCHER
                         {still working his scanner)
                         A little more... more...

               Scrr-r-aape! The ship abruptly BUMPS into the Helix and 
               both men are again thrown together. Archer shoots Charlie a 
               look, recalling their moment on the inspection pod.

                                     ARCHER (off scanner) (CONT'D)
                         Right here.

               The ship STOPS. Through the window, we see a circular 
               AIRLOCK protruding from the Helix. They exchange a look, 
               then Archer nods.

               Both men begin to carefully manipulate the alien controls, 
               as the ship edges SIDEWAYS toward the airlock.

               CHA-CHUNK! The ship jolts slightly and we hear a series of 
               whirring mechanical sounds as the docking ports lock into 
               place.

               A beat, then the HATCH OPENS to reveal a darkly-lit 
               CORRIDOR. As both men react...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Archer and Charlie on the move, phase-pistols drawn. 
               Charlie carries the silver equipment case; Archer eyes his 
               scanner. They round a corner...

               ANGLE -A SULIBAN (OPTICAL)

               is caught by surprise. He draws his sidearm, but Archer 
               FIRES first and the Suliban is knocked to the ground, 
               unconscious.

                                     ARCHER
                              (re: weapon)
                         Stun seems to work.

               They keep moving.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Everyone's tense, waiting for Archer's return. Hoshi 
               presses a small, hand-held EARPIECE to her left ear.

                                     T'POL
                              (to Hoshi)
                         Anything?

                                     HOSHI
                         (listening, shakes her head} The 
                         phosphorous is distorting all the EM 
                         bands...

               Suddenly, something causes Hoshi to jerk the earpiece away.

                                     HOSHI (CONT'D)
                              (to all)
                         Grab on to something --

               Two rapid booms are followed almost instantly by two 
               powerful JOLTS! Bulkheads BLOWOUT and consoles GO DOWN. 
               DEBRIS and streams of spewing GAS envelop the Bridge. A beat 
               as everyone recovers.

               Reed, Mayweather, Hoshi and two crewmembers start working 
               their stations... the spewing gas subsides and consoles 
               flicker back to life.

                                     REED
                         This is ridiculous! If we don't 
                         move the ship, Captain Archer won't 
                         have anything to look for when he 
                         gets back.

               T'Pol hesitates, realizing he's right.

                                     T'POL
                              (to Hoshi)
                         We're going to need that ear of 
                         yours.

               Hoshi presses the device to her ear.

                                     T'POL (CONT'D)
                              (to Mayweather)
                         Move us away, five kilometers.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                         In what direction?

                                     T'POL
                         Any direction.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Klaang is alone, restrained in the elaborate chair seen 
               earlier; tubes and devices are still connected to his body. 
               He's semi-conscious. Steely blue light from the phosphorous 
               layer above pours in through a window.

               THE DOOR

               slides open. Archer and Charlie rush in, pistols drawn. 
               They both seem surprised and relieved that there's no one 
               here but Klaang.

               Archer stands guard at the door, while Charlie moves to the 
               chair and begins to unstrap Klaang. The Klingon stares at 
               him.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Archer, low)
                         This is gonna be easier than I 
                         thought.
                              (to Klaang)
                         It's okay. We're getting you off 
                         this thing.

               As Charlie releases the third and final restraint, Klaang 
               swings his arm up and KNOCKS Charlie across the room!

               Klaang gets to his feet, savagely pulling the tubes and 
               wires from his body. Archer locks his stance and takes aim 
               at Klaang with both hands.

                                     ARCHER
                         (to Klaang} I really don't want to 
                         have to carry you out of here.

               Klaang eyes Archer, hesitant.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                              (to Charlie)
                         I think he gets the idea. Give him 
                         a hand.

               Charlie pauses, not too anxious to get close to the Klingon 
               again, but steels himself and helps Klaang follow Archer out 
               the door...


               Archer, pistol at-the-ready, is leading the way. Charlie 
               follows, bearing part of the weight of the enormous Klingon, 
               who again begins to bellow.

                                     KLAANG
                         Qu'taw bob

                                     ARCHER
                         Be quiet.

                                     KLAANG
                         Muh tok!

               They keep moving... until a Suliban weapons BLAST tears 
               away a large chunk of the wall! The three men DIVE for cover!

                                     KLAANG (CONT'D)
                              (screaming 
                              obscenities at the 
                              Suliban)
                         Dajvo tag:h! Borat!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You tell him, big guy.

                                     ARCHER (to Charlie)
                         Give me the box.

               Charlie takes the silver case off his shoulder and hands it 
               to him. Just then, a SULIBAN ATTACKER rushes into view from 
               an adjoining corridor, catching them by surprise! As the 
               Suliban takes aim at Archer and Charlie.

               WHAM! Klaang STRIKES the creature with Klingon force, 
               knocking him into a bulkhead! He grabs the Suliban and 
               POUNDS him with a couple of powerful blows, knocking him 
               unconscious! A beat, then he turns to Archer and Charlie 
               with a triumphant smile.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Thanks.

               Another Suliban weapons BLAST whizzes by!

                                     ARCHER
                         Get to the ship. I'll be right 
                         behind you.

               As Charlie and Klaang take off down an adjoining corridor, 
               Archer opens the case and removes the RECTANGULAR DEVICE 
               seen before. He activates it and attaches it to the wall. He 
               works a series of controls, and goes to his knees, covering 
               his head. We hear a low- pitched whine... and then the 
               device emits a BLINDING ENERGY PULSE that RADIATES in all 
               directions!

               As the light recedes, Archer gets to his feet. The corridor 
               begins to TREMBLE, and we hear the sounds of docking ports 
               UNLOCKING. He

               looks down to see --

                                     THE FLOOR (OPTICAL)
                         is SEPARATING before him!

               THE ENTIRE CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

               SPLITS APART! FORCEFIELDS flash on as the interlocking 
               elements making up this section of the Helix lose their 
               cohesion.

               ARCHER (OPTICAL)

               realizes he's been cut off from Charlie and Klaang. A 
               Suliban weapons BLAST strikes nearby. He has no choice but 
               to turn and run.


               Trembling. Charlie and Klaang are cramped into the tiny 
               cockpit.

               Charlie talks into his communicator:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Captain?

                                     ARCHER'S COM VOICE
                         It worked.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Where are you?

                                     ARCHER'S COM VOICE
                         I'm still on the central core. Get 
                         Klaang back to Enterprise.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What about you, sir?

                                     ARCHER'S COM VOICE
                         Get him to the ship. You can come 
                         back for me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's going to be hard to isolate 
                         your bio-signs... so stay as far 
                         away from the Suliban as you can.

                                     ARCHER'S COM VOICE
                         Believe me, I'll try.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Archer is cautiously moving along, rounds a corner... stops 
               when he sees two SULIBAN moving down the adjoining hall, 
               their backs turned to him. He quickly pulls back... waits a 
               beat... then pulls out a hand-held SCANNER. He activates it, 
               then starts moving in the opposite direction...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Charlie at the controls, Klaang cramped in next to him. 
               Klaang, still somewhat delirious, bellows at Charlie. 
               Neither man understands a word the other says:

                                     KLAANG
                         RaQo jadICH!

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't particularly like the way 
                         you smell, either.

               Klaang bangs the bulkhead with his fist

                                     KLAANG
                         MajQa!

               Charlie checks a reading.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't get it, this is right where 
                         they're supposed to be...

               OFF Klaang's growing agitation...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A low-frequency boom... followed a few seconds later by a 
               moderate

               JOLT.

                         The charges are getting closer

                              (to Mayweather)
                         Another five kilometers, Lieutenant.

                                     MAYWEATHER (working}
                         At this rate, the Captain'll never 
                         find us.

                                     HOSHI
                         Wait a minute... I think I've got 
                         something...

               Everyone turns to her. She's holding the earpiece tightly 
               to her left ear.

                                     T'POL
                         Amplify it.

               Hoshi taps a control, and we hear a CACOPHONY of radio 
               signals, background noise, and distortion.

                                     HOSHI
                              (listening)
                         It's Commander Tucker

                                     REED
                         All I hear is noise

                                     HOSHI
                         Sshh... listen... it's just a 
                         narrow notch in the mid-range...

                         He says he's about to ignite his 
                         thruster exhaust...

               T'Pol quickly moves to her viewing device and peers inside. 
               A long, tense beat.

                                     T'POL

               She turns to Hoshi, guardingly appreciative

                                     T'POL (CONT'D)

               It's the first time T'Pol has acknowledged Hoshi's 
               abilities.

               Hoshi offers a slight smile.

                                     HOSHI
                         You're welcome.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Two armed Suliban are searching for Archer. As they move 
               down the hall and out of view...

               CLOSE ANGLE -SCANNER (OPTICAL

               Two BLIPS representing the Suliban are moving away from a 
               central indicator.

               ARCHER

               is watching the scanner. He's squatting on a metal BEAM 
               eight feet off the floor. He JUMPS to the deck, holds up his 
               scanner...

               ON THE SCANNER -(OPTICAL)

               Archer hits a button, which gives a WIDER VIEW of the 
               vicinity.

               Other BLIPS representing other Suliban can be seen. There 
               is a large area with no bio-signs.

               ARCHER

               takes this in, figures out which way to go to find the 
               empty area, then heads down the corridor...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         One Klingon... one human.

               OFF T'Pol's impenetrable look...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A narrow passageway that looks completely different than 
               the corridors we've seen so far. It ends at a single DOOR. 
               Archer reaches the entrance to this strange hallway... 
               glances at his scanner, which is now heavily DISTORTED. This 
               piques his interest... and he cautiously approaches the 
               door, which OPENS automatically. As he tentatively moves 
               inside...


               A small vestibule. As soon as the door LOCKS and SEALS, a 
               TEMPORAL COMPRESSION sequence begins: reverberating sound 
               echoes through the room, and the lights begin to flash. 
               Archer's movements are SLOWED DOWN as time shifts and 
               equalizes... he can barely move...  it's like being 
               underwater.

               As the sequence gradually ENDS, Archer's movements return 
               to normal. Another door OPENS leading to a dimly- lit 
               chamber. Archer steps through...


               The dark, labyrinthine room seen earlier, but the energy 
               barrier is inactive. Archer takes a few steps inside, until 
               he notices something odd.  As he walks, his arms BLUR in a 
               PRE-ECHO EFFECT, swinging upward a split- second before the 
               real arm does the same.

               He looks down at his feet, and realizes that the sounds of 
               his footsteps precede the actual step. Puzzled, he stops and 
               gently claps his hands together --again, the sound precedes 
               the action.

               Unnerved, Archer slowly begins to explore the room. The 
               architecture is unlike anything he's seen before... the 
               futuristic alien technology is undecipherable...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Everyone looks on as Charlie reports to T'Pol, mid- 
               conflict, urgent:

                                     T'POL
                         Our mission is to return the 
                         Klingon to his homeworld.  Another 
                         rescue attempt could jeopardize that 
                         mission.

                                     CHARLIE
                         The Captain specifically told us to 
                         come back for him.

                                     T'POL
                         As Commanding Officer, it's my job 
                         to interpret the Captain's orders...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (passionate)
                         I just told you his orders! What's 
                         there to interpret?

                                     T'POL
                         Captain Archer may very well have 
                         told you to return for him later 
                         because he knew how stubborn you can 
                         be.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell is that supposed to 
                         mean?

                                     T'POL
                         You might've risked Klaang's life 
                         in a foolish attempt to swing back 
                         and rescue the Captain.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I can't believe this!

               Over the above, a low boom... then JOLT! Tension rising:

                                     T'POL
                         The situation must be analyzed 
                         logically.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't remember the Captain 
                         "analyzing" anything when he went 
                         back for you on that roof.

                                     T'POL
                         That's a specious analogy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is it?

               OFF T'Pol's unreadable expression...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Archer is inspecting the podium that we saw Silik standing 
               at earlier. The opposing podium is not present. He eyes the 
               metallic archway overhead...

               Suddenly, we hear the low, reverberating sound of the 
               tirne-lock.

               Archer draws his weapon and turns for the door, which is 
               OPENING.

               The dark vestibule beyond appears empty as the door closes 
               and seals.

               Archer slowly backs away, silently listening, senses 
               heightened.

               After a long beat, he hears a very quiet pre-echoing 
               effect, followed by another... and another... he realizes 
               they're the footsteps of an unseen assailant.

               Archer ducks behind one of the sides of the archway. We 
               hear Silik's VOICE pre-echoing:

                                     SILIK'S VOICE
                         You're wasting your time. Klanng 
                         knows nothing.

               The eerie sounds of Silik's footsteps can again be heard. 
               Archer tries to track the sound with his raised pistol.

                                     SILIK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         It would be unwise to discharge 
                         that weapon in this room.

                                     ARCHER
                         What is this room? What goes on in 
                         here?

                                     SILIK'S VOICE
                         You're very curious, Jack. May I 
                         call you Jack?

               The footsteps continue, Archer trying to follow them with 
               his weapon...

                                     ARCHER
                         Am I supposed to be impressed that 
                         you know my name?

                                     SILIK'S VOICE
                         I've learned a great deal about 
                         you... even more than you know.

                                     ARCHER
                         Well, I guess you have me at a 
                         disadvantage. So why don't you drop 
                         the invisible man routine and let me 
                         see who I'm talking to?

               Silence. OFF the tension...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         option.


               Archer searching the darkness for signs of movement, pistol 
               raised...

                                     SILIK'S VOICE
                         You wouldn't have come looking for

                         That means you're no threat to me, 
                         Jack... but I QQ need you to leave 
                         this room.

               The time-lock door hisses OPEN.

                                     SILIK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         Now.

               Archer hears the footsteps again, but this time he sees 
               something

               A SLIGHT DISTORTION AGAINST THE FAR WALL. HE QUICKLY FIRES!

               blurred PRE-ECHO of the shot precedes the blast itself.

               Both miss Silik, and STRIKE the far wall. A jagged WAVE of 
               temporal energy emanates from the point of impact and sweeps 
               across the room. Archer is knocked against a bulkhead, where 
               he holds his head in pain until the wave dissipates.

                                     SILIK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                         I warned you not to fire the weapon.

               Archer again sees the slight distortion as Silik moves 
               across the room...

                                     ARCHER
                         This chameleon thing... pretty 
                         fancy.
                              (pointed)
                         Was it payment for pitting the 
                         Klingons against each other? A 
                         trophy from your Temporal Cold War?

               Suddenly, a BLUR of PRE-ECHO MOTION rushes at Archer, 
               immediately followed by Silik, who becomes VISIBLE and 
               SMASHES into him!

               Archer is knocked hard to the ground, his pistol slides 
               away...

               Archer quickly gets to his feet. Silik trains the pistol on 
               him.

                                     SILIK
                         I was going to let you go, Jack.

                                     ARCHER
                              (slowly backing away)
                         Really? Then you obviously don't 
                         know as much about me as you thought 
                         you did.

                                     SILIK
                         On the contrary. I could've told 
                         you what day you were going to 
                         die... but I suppose that's about to 
                         change.

               Silik FIRES the pistol! The PRE-ECHO HITS Archer square in 
               the chest, but before the real beam can reach him, Archer 
               DARTS to his left and the blast MISSES him by inches!

               As Archer LEAPS behind a large bank of alien consoles, the 
               SHOCK WAVE of temporal energy sweeps across the room, 
               knocking Silik to the ground!

               Archer glances around the room, trying to figure out how to 
               get to the open time-lock.

                                     ARCHER
                         What's the matter? No genetic 
                         tricks to keep you from getting 
                         knocked on your butt?

               As Silik gets into position to make his next move...

                                     SILIK
                         What "you call tricks we call 
                         progress.
                              (beat)
                         Are you aware that your genome is 
                         almost identical to that of an ape? 
                         The Suliban don't share humanity's 
                         patience with natural selection.

                                     ARCHER
                         So to speed things up a little, you 
                         struck a deal with the devil?

               During the above speech, Archer has positioned himself 
               between Silik and the open time-lock.  Still hidden behind 
               the consoles, he's removed the communicator from his belt. 
               Carefully calculating the next trajectory of the temporal 
               wave, he THROWS the communicator against a monitor on the 
               far wall!

               QUICK ACTION:

               THE PRE-ECHO EFFECT OF THE COMMUNICATOR FLYING THROUGH THE 
               AIR

               draws Silik's attention!

               -- On impact, the monitor SPARKS! Silik whirls and FIRES 
               the pistol!

               The SHOCK WAVE emanates outward! Silik braces himself 
               against the wave of temporal energy, and manages to remain 
               standing!

               ARCHER, HOWEVER, HAS SITUATED HIMSELF IN THE PERFECT SPOT 
               TO BE

               THROWN into the open time-lock! The door begins to CLOSE...


               An instant before the door shuts, Silik slips inside! The 
               door LOCKS and SEALS and the temporal decompression sequence 
               begins.

               Archer and Silik are momentarily disoriented, their 
               movement SLOWED by the forces in the room. Each man is 
               desperately trying to be the first to regain control of his 
               body...

               Slowly, Silik is raising the weapon.

               Archer, using every ounce of strength, manages to push 
               against the wall behind him and SMASHES into Silik in eerie 
               SLOW-MOTION. The pistol is jarred out of Silik's hand and 
               tumbles toward the floor...

               The SOUND of it hitting the deck signals that time is 
               gradually returning to normal.

               The-two men begin to struggle...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Continuous SHAKES and JOLTS from the attack outside.

                                     REED
                         We have four more coming up off 
                         starboard!

                                     T'POL
                              (to Mayweather)
                         Can we dock, Lieutenant?

               A huge SHAKE !

                                     MAYWEATHER
                              (urgently working 
                              helm)
                         These aren't ideal conditions!

                                     T'POL
                              (taps corn button)
                         Mister Tucker... we're going to 
                         Plan B.


               Archer and Silik on the floor, locked in combat. Time has 
               returned to normal. As the sound of the temporal 
               decompression comes to an end, the outer-door begins to 
               OPEN...

               The men struggle for the nearby pistol. Archer gets the 
               upper-hand and forces Silik to the floor, pinning his 
               upturned wrists. A tense beat, then Silik begins to 
               DISLOCATE his wrist in a grotesque rotation, allowing him to 
               reach the gun!

               Archer realizes he's no match for this... PUNCHES Silik 
               hard in the face, which gives him the opportunity to leap 
               off him and BOLT

               out the door! As Silik grabs the pistol and heads after him 
               --


               Archer on the' run, coming directly toward us! In the b.g., 
               we see Silik coming out of the time-lock...


               Shaking!

                                     T'POL
                              (an order)
                         Now


               Archer, running right at us, begins to DEMATERIALIZE in 
               MID-STRIDE! Silik takes aim and FIRES!  But the blast passes 
               harmlessly through the Transporter effect and whizzes past 
               camera!


               Archer MATERIALIZES on the Transporter pad. He stumbles 
               forward, stopping his forward motion, glances around, 
               startled... slowly realizing what's just happened. Charlie 
               approaches from the Transporter control station.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to com)
                         Bridge, we've got him!
                              (to Archer)
                         Sorry, Captain. We had no other 
                         choice.

               There's a strong SHAKE from the attack outside. Archer is 
               oblivious to it, as he pats down his body, checking that 
               he's in one piece.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               The ancient room is constructed of stone and wood beams; 
               huge torches create eerie shadows. Four KLINGON COUNCIL 
               MEMBERS sit on raised thrones above the chamber floor. They 
               wear ceremonial regalia adorned with primitive weapons. 
               Twenty or so other Klingons stand below them, including 
               numerous armed guards. The Council Members are in the middle 
               of a heated debate, yelling at each other in Klingon (see 
               ADDENDUM) .We get the feeling that there is great strife 
               among them.

               There's a knock at a large wooden door. One of the members, 
               the CHANCELLOR, stands and calls an order to the guards 
               below.

                                     CHANCELLOR
                         Malja'gor!

               Three of the guards move to the door; one works a huge 
               latch, while the other two pull it open.  FOUR FIGURES stand 
               silhouetted against the outer-chamber. One of them steps 
               forward... shakily...

               It's Klaang. He walks toward the dais and stops. We reveal 
               that his silhouetted colleagues are Archer, T'Pol and Hoshi. 
               Archer and Hoshi are taking in the scene with fascination 
               and awe --it's the most alien environment they've seen yet. 
               T'Pol, however, is unfazed.

               Klaang tries to muster as much strength and dignity as he 
               can.

                                     KLAANG
                              (to Chancellor)
                         Wo'mig:h Oag:h!  Q'a12la 

               Hoshi leans in to Archer:

                                     HOSHI (sotto)
                         Something about disgracing the 
                         Empire... he says he's ready to die.

               The Chancellor stands and slowly walks down the great stone 
               steps, pulling a jagged DAGGER from its sheath. Klaang 
               tenses as the Chancellor stops before him and raises the 
               knife...

               Archer, T'Pol and Hoshi look on, fearing the worst...

               The Chancellor grabs Klaang's wrist and draws the blade 
               across his palm. Klaang looks puzzled. The Chancellor calls 
               to a nearby aide:

                                     CHANCELLOR
                         Pog!

               The aide approaches with a small VIAL. He holds it up, as 
               the Chancellor turns Klaang's hand, allowing a few drops of 
               BLOOD to fall into it.

               The aide carries the vial to a large APPARATUS, which seems 
               far more high-tech than anything else in the chamber. He 
               pours a drop of blood onto a sensor pad, and inserts it into 
               the apparatus. A large SCREEN illuminates, displaying highly 
               magnified KLINGON BLOOD CELLS. As the aide works the 
               controls, the image continues to MAGNIFY.

               The Council Members mutter guttural sounds of approval.

               The enlarging image now shows spirals of DNA, which 
               continue to magnify... until we can see a new, distinctive 
               PATTERN taking form within the MOLECULES themselves.

               The High Council continues to mutter in anticipation. 
               Archer, T'Pol and Hoshi watch silently.

               The aid keeps working the controls, and each piece of the 
               molecular pattern begins to ROTATE, revealing hidden SULIBAN 
               DATA: coordinates, maps, text, schedules, etc.

               The chamber ERUPTS with shouts of gruff approval! The room 
               quiets as the Chancellor turns and walks toward our team.  
               He lifts the dagger to Archer's throat.

                                     CHANCELLOR (CONT'D)
                              (to Archer)
                         ChugDah heg:h... volcha va.

               With that, the Klingon lowers the blade and walks away.

                                     ARCHER
                              (sotto, to Hoshi)
                         I'll take that as a thank you.

                                     HOSHI
                         I don't think they have a word for 
                         thank you.

                                     ARCHER
                         What'd he say?

                                     HOSHI
                              (unnerved)
                         You don't want to know.

               As Archer takes this in...

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Porthos is lying on his back, his four legs in the air, 
               while Archer scratches his belly. The door chimes.

                                     ARCHER
                              (standing)
                         Come in.

               T'Pol and Charlie ENTER, having been summoned.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         I've just gotten a response to the 
                         message I sent to Admiral Forrest. 
                         He enjoyed telling the Vulcan High 
                         Command about the Suliban we ran 
                         into.
                              (tweaking T'Pol)
                         It's not every day he gets to be 
                         the one dispensing information.

               T'Pol raises an eyebrow.

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         I wanted you both to hear 
                         Starfleet's orders before I inform 
                         the crew.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Orders?

                                     ARCHER
                              (to T'Pol)
                         Your people are sending a transport 
                         to pick you up.

                                     T'POL
                         I was under the impression that 
                         Enterprise would be taking me back 
                         to Earth.

                                     ARCHER
                         It would be a little out of our way.
                              (to Charlie)
                         Admiral Forrest sees no reason why 
                         we shouldn't keep going.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (enthused)
                         Son of a bitch!

                                     ARCHER
                         I have a feeling Doctor Phlox won't 
                         mind staying around for a while. 
                         He's developing a fondness for the 
                         human endocrine system.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll get double shifts on the 
                         repair work.

                                     ARCHER
                         I think the outer-hull's going to 
                         need a little patching up. Let's 
                         hope that's the last time somebody 
                         takes a shot at us.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let's hope Charlie and T'Pol turn 
                         for the door.

                                     ARCHER
                         T'Pol... would you stick around for 
                         a minute?

               She stays behind as Charlie EXITS. Archer takes a moment...

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         Ever since I can remember, I've 
                         seen Vulcans as an obstacle...  
                         always keeping us from standing on 
                         our own two feet.

                                     T'POL
                         I understand.

                                     ARCHER
                         No, I don't think you do.
                              (beat)
                         If I'm going to pull this off, 
                         there are a few things I have to 
                         leave behind. Things like 
                         preconceptions. holding grudges...  
                         mistrust...
                              (pointed)
                         This mission would've failed 
                         without your help.

                                     T'POL
                         I won't dispute that 

               Archer resists the temptation to retort... he's getting 
               used to her dry humor.

                                     ARCHER
                         I was thinking a Vulcan Science 
                         Officer could come in handy, but if 
                         I asked you to stay, it might look 
                         like I wasn't ready to do this on my 
                         own.

                                     T'POL
                         Perhaps you should add pride to 
                         your list.

                                     ARCHER
                         Perhaps I should.

               T'Pol considers, then:

                                     T'Pol
                              (letting him off the 
                              hook)
                         It might be best if I were to 
                         contact my superiors and make the 
                         request myself... with your 
                         permission.

                                     ARCHER
                         Permission granted.

               OFF the moment between them...


               Archer and T'Pol ENTER from the Ready Room. Reed, 
               Mayweather, Hoshi, crewmembers at their stations.

                                     ARCHER
                         I hope nobody's in a big hurry to 
                         get home.
                              (to all)
                         Starfleet seems to think we're 
                         ready to begin our mission.

               EXCITED REACTIONS

                                     ARCHER (CONT'D)
                         I understand there's an inhabited 
                         planet a few light years from here.

                                     REED
                              (checks station)
                         Sensors show a nitrogen-sulfide 
                         atmosphere.

                                     HOSHI
                         Probably not humanoids

                                     ARCHER
                         That's what we're here to find out.
                              (to Mayweather)
                         Prepare to break orbit and lay in a 
                         course.

               As Mayweather works, Archer takes his chair.

                                     MAYWEATHER
                              (off station)
                         I'm reading an ion storm on that 
                         trajectory, sir... should I go 
                         around it?

               As we PUSH IN on Archer.

                                     ARCHER
                         We can't be afraid of the wind, 
                         Lieutenant.
                              (beat)
                         Take us to warp four.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FLASHBACK: THE MODEL STARSHIP (OPTICAL)

               flies across the morning sky! Young Archer and his Father 
               are running along a sand dune, trying to keep up with the 
               tiny ship.

               Young Archer holds the control unit.

               As the starship sails gracefully into the distance father 
               and son chasing their dream...

               FADE TO BLACK.

               THE END
