...where cattails sway in the sepia-toned heat. A small scrap
of fabric is snagged in the nettles, fluttering languidly...
COLOR BLEEDS SLOWLY IN as mosquitoes swarm and dragonflies
skitter, showing the fabric scrap to be pale yellow...
Suddenly, a MAN WITH A SHOTGUN comes crashing through the
cattails, wiping through frame and exiting...
...then ANOTHER MAN...and ANOTHER...armed with rifles,
plowing through the brush, exiting frame...
...and now comes KLAUS DETTERICK, a farmer one step above
shirt-tail poor, a double-barrel shotgun in the crook of his
arm. He pauses, horrified, seeing the scrap of cloth. He
pulls it loose, turns back, screaming something in anguish...
...and still more men come crashing into view, flooding by us
with dreamlike, slow-motion grace. ONE MAN is leading a team
of DOGS, trying to untangle the leads. DEPUTY ROB McGEE is
shouting for everybody to stay together...
...and under it all, we hear a sibilant, frightening whisper:
WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
You love your sister? You make any
noise, know what happens?
And off that horrible voice, we
CUT TO:
Nestled in a valley of wooded hills, a drizzly mist rolling
over the treetops.
Paul appears f.g., coming up the ridge in his borrowed
poncho. He looks back at the valley below, inhales deeply--
this is a man who loves his walks.
He pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to
nibble as he presses up on the ridge...
Low angle: nursing home and ridge beyond
...and we see Paul from a distance, just a speck trudging up
toward the treeline. A PICKUP TRUCK rumbles into frame and
parks, a bumper sticker looming large: "I Have Seen God and
His Name Is Newt Gingrich".
BRAD DOLAN gets out, an orderly in his late 20's/early 30's,
arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt. He gazes
up toward the ridge, scowling and muttering softly:
BRAD
Old fuck.
He slams the door and heads for the nursing home...
...as CAMERA BOOMS DOWN through the trees to find Paul
wandering a wooded path, munching a tidbit of toast, looking
for all the world like Red Riding Hood in his plastic poncho.
It's silent here, like a church. The only sounds we hear are
the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the
woodpecker.
A RUSTLING SOUND makes Paul freeze. He turns, becomes
transfixed. Softly:
PAUL
Oh, my...
Reverse angle
reveals a magnificent BUCK, not twenty feet away, misty
breath punching the cold morning air. They watch each other
for an endless moment, both standing stock still...
...and then the animal bounds away, vanishing into the
foliage. Paul lets out a breath, shakes his head in wonder.
He takes another bite of toast, moves on...
...and WE PAN WITH HIM to reveal a pair of old wooden storage
shacks along the path up ahead.
Paul approaches the back door, returning from his walk. He
reaches for the knob...and a figure in white lunges from
behind the dumpster to grab his wrist. He whirls, gasping in
fright--it's Brad Dolan, wearing his orderly's uniform.
BRAD
Out for a little stroll, Paulie?
PAUL
Let go...
Paul tries to pull away, but Dolan's got him tight.
BRAD
What's with this poncho you got
on, huh? This isn't yours.
PAUL
I got it off the wall there.
There's a whole row of them.
BRAD
But not for you, Paulie, that's
the thing. Those are for the staff.
PAUL
I just borrowed it. Don't see what
harm it does.
BRAD
It's not about harm, it's about
rules. You probably don't think an
old fart like you has to mind
rules anymore, but that's just not
true.
Brad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing
the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.
PAUL
I'm sorry if I broke the rules.
BRAD
You got no business up in those
woods anyway, especially in the
rain. What if you fall and bust a
hip, huh? Who you think's gonna
have to hoss your sorry old bacon
back down here? Me, that's who.
PAUL
You're hurting me!
BRAD
What do you do up there, anyway?
You're too old to go jerk off, so
what do you do?
PAUL
Nothing. I just walk, that's all,
I like to walk!
Brad lashes out and grabs Paul's other hand, which he's been
holding tightly clenched shut.
BRAD
Come on. Open up. Let Poppa see.
Paul uncurls his fingers, revealing the crushed remnants of
a bit of toast, his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear.
ELAINE (O.S.)
Paul?
They turn. Elaine stands just inside the screen door with a
cup of tea. Brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much
she's seen. Elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing:
ELAINE
I saw you coming back, thought
you'd like some tea.
(beat)
Are you coming in?
PAUL
Mr. Dolan and I were...chatting.
About the weather. I think we're
through now.
Brad lets Paul loose, leans close:
BRAD
Paulie? You tell anyone I squeezed
your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em
you're having senile delusions.
Who you think they'll believe?
Brad walks off. Paul turns, watches him go. The screen door
opens and Elaine steps out, her face pale. Paul gives her a
strained, though grateful, smile as we
CUT TO:
HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS work the fields, pickaxes rising and
falling in waves, a prison song being sung in cadence with
the work. GUARDS patrol on horseback, rifles aimed at the sky.
A late 20's Ford PRISON TRUCK comes chugging into view along
the road, kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat. It
seems to be riding unusually low on its rear suspension.
A Depression-era prison in the south. The prison truck sways
down the rutted dirt road toward the main gate...
A small are reserved for inmates of the Mile, fenced-off from
the main prison yard. Arlen Bitterbuck walks the perimeter
under the watchful eyes of guard BILL DODGE.
We find Paul sitting by himself on the bleachers with
Coffey's file on his knees, thoughtfully unwrapping his brown-
bagged sandwich. PUSH SLOWLY IN as he begins to read...
...and we see Klaus Detterick walk from his house to the barn
with a milking pail, a solitary figure against a brightening
horizon. He disappears into the barn...
...and we hold for a long moment, the house silent
b.g.,chickens clucking and scratching in the front yard...
...until a WOMAN'S SCREAM shatters the silence. Klaus
reappears, dropping the pail, running toward the house...
PAUL ON BLEACHERS
...as Paul turns the page, keeps reading...
---and we see CARS AND TRUCKS pulling up, MEN jumping out
with rifles, pouring down the incline toward the field where
Klaus is hollering and waving his arms. Deputy McGee comes
sliding down from the road, taking charge at the top of his
lungs--
McGEE
I WANT ALL THE WEAPONS UNLOADED,
Y'HEAR? TAKE OUT YOUR SHELLS, I
WON'T HAVE A MAN SHOT BY ACCIDENT
TODAY! BOBO, WHERE THEM DOGS?
--and the dogs come bounding out of the back of a truck,
howling down the incline to lead the chase...
VARIOUS ANGLES
...which takes us through the cattails and bulrushes...to the
spot where Klaus finds the little scrap of pale yellow
fabric, turns and screams...
KLAUS
Oh, Lord, this belongs to my
Katie...
...and they keep going, stopping abruptly as they find: A
blood-drenched area of tramped grass. A little girl's bloody
nightgown hangs in the low branches of a tree. Some of these
strong men look like they might throw up or faint at the
sight of it. Their blood freezes in their veins as an INHUMAN
HOWLING commences up ahead. It's like nothing they've ever
heard before, raising the hackles of men and dogs alike.
PAUL ON BLEACHERS
...as Paul quietly turns another page, shaking his head...
PAUL
Jesus.
The men reload their weapons. Everybody's terrified. McGee
starts off, the other following his lead toward--
THE RIVER
--where they emerge from the treeline, drawing ever closer to
the source of that INHUMAN HOWLING...
...and they stop, gazing in horror:
John Coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls, his
huge feet splayed out before him. He's making that inhuman
howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing
occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air.
Curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of
Detterick's 9 year-old twin girls, their once-blonde hair now
matted to their heads with blood.
A tableau. The men staring. John Coffey howling. A train
puffing smoke across the landscape.
Klaus Detterick breaks the moment, lunging down the riverbank
in a headlong rush. The others try to grab him, but he shrugs
them off and throws himself on Coffey with a scream of
inarticulate rage, kicking and punching, fists flying. Coffey
barely seems to notice.
The others catch up with Klaus, drag him off. He falls to his
knees on the riverbank, sobbing into his hands. Howie runs to
him, throws himself into his father's arm. They hug each
other tightly, overwhelmed with grief.
A semblance of quiet descends, except for Coffey's
heartbroken wailing. A ring of rifle toting men forms around
him, though he hardly seems aware of it. McGee steps forward,
uncertain:
McGEE
Mister.
Coffey goes quiet at once, eyes still streaming tears.
McGEE
Mister? Can you hear me?
(Coffey nods)
You have a name?
COFFEY
John Coffey. Like the drink, only
not spelt the same.
McGee hunkers carefully down, watching for any sudden moves.
McGEE
What happened here, John Coffey?
You want to tell me that?
COFFEY
I couldn't help it. I tried to
take it back, but it was too late.
McGEE
(pause)
Boy, you are under arrest for
murder.
McGee spits in Coffey's face...
PAUL ON BLEACHERS
...as Paul looks up with a slight start, jarred from his
reading to find WARDEN HAL MOORES standing before him.
HAL
I interrupt?
PAUL
I'm just about done.
Paul stows the file as Hal settles onto the bleachers.
PAUL
How's that pretty gal of yours?
HAL
Melinda's not so well, Paul. Not
so well at all. Got laid up with
another headache yesterday. Worst
one yet. She's also developed this
weakness in her right hand.
PAUL
Doctor still think it's migraines?
Hal gives a slight shake of his head.
HAL
I'll be taking her up to Indianola
next day or so for some tests. Had
X-rays and the like. She is scared
to death. Truth to tell, so am I.
PAUL
If it's something they can see
with an X-ray, maybe it's
something they can fix.
HAL
Maybe.
He pulls a letter, hands it to Paul.
HAL
This just came in. D.O.E. on
Bitterbuck.
Paul glances toward Bitterbuck, scans the letter, nods.
PAUL
You didn't come all the way down
here just to hand me a D.O.E.
HAL
No. I had an angry call from the
state capital about twenty minutes
ago. Is it true you ordered Percy
Wetmore off the block.
PAUL
It is.
HAL
I'm sure you had reason, but like
it or not, the wife of the
governor of this state has only
one nephew, and his name happens
to be Percy Wetmore. I need to
tell you how this lays out?
PAUL
Little Percy called his aunt and
squealed like a schoolroom sissy.
(Hal nods)
He also mention he assaulted a
prisoner this morning out of sheer
petulance? Broke three fingers on
Eduard Delacroix's left hand.
HAL
I didn't hear that part. I'm sure
she didn't either.
PAUL
The man is mean, careless, and
stupid. Bad combination in a place
like this. Sooner or later, he's
gonna get somebody hurt. Or worse.
HAL
You and Brutus Howell will make
sure that doesn't happen.
PAUL
Easy enough to say. We can't watch
him every minute, Hal.
HAL
Stick with it. May not be much
longer. I have it on good
authority that Percy has an
application in at Briar Ridge.
PAUL
The mental hospital?
HAL
(nods)
Administration job. Better pay.
PAUL
Then why's he still here? He could
get that application pushed
through...hell, with his
connections, he could have any
state job he wants.
Hal has no answer. Paul look off toward Bitterbuck.
PAUL
Tell you what I think. I think he
just wants to see one cook up
close.
Hal follows Paul's gaze, takes his meaning.
HAL
Well, he'll get his chance then,
won't he? Maybe then he'll be
satisfied and move on. In the
meantime, you'll keep the peace.
PAUL
Of course.
HAL
Thank you, Paul.
Hal rises, slapping yard dust off his trousers.
PAUL
You give Melinda my love, okay? I
bet that X-ray turns out to be
nothing at all.
Hal walks off looking like he's got the weight of the world
on his shoulders. Paul looks at the letter again...
TIGHT ON LETTER
...which is head: Date Of Execution."
DISSOLVE TO:
...and he's moving even faster as he exits the kitchen,
racing for the outhouse. He realizes he's not going to make
it, stops to piss near the woodpile at the corner of the
house...
...and as he does, he's hit with the most stunning pain of
his life. He buckles to his knees--it's only his flailing
hand against the woodpile that prevents him from going face-
first into his own piss. He crams his other hand to his mouth
in an enormous effort not to scream and wake his wife.
He manages to ride it out until his bladder empties. He falls
onto his side, rolls over on the grass, and stares up at the
sky with both hands pressed to his groin.
PAUL
...oh God...oh God...
FADE TO BLACK
IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:
"Coffey's Hands"
CUT TO:
The prison truck appears, swaying along the rutted road...
IN THE TRUCK
...while Billy Wharton stares at nothing, drool dripping from
his slack mouth in long strings.
...as their moans go drifting into the night...
FADE TO:
SAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - DAWN
...and they're still moaning up there as the sun creeps up.
Paul's model T comes putt-putting up the road past a sign:
"Trapingus County Welcomes You."
BURT HAMMERSMITH, public defender for Trapingus County, sits
with a cold soda and a magazine, watching his TWO CHILDREN
playing on a swing at the far end of the backyard. The screen
door opens and CYNTHIA HAMMERSMITH ushers Paul out.
CYNTHIA
I offer you a cold drink?
PAUL
Yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be
fine. Thank you.
She goes back inside. Burt rises.
PAUL
Mr. Hammersmith. Your office said
I'd find you at home today. I hope
I'm not troubling you.
BURT
That depends, Mr.--?
PAUL
Paul Edgecomb. I'm the E Block
superintendant at Cold Mountain.
BURT
The Green Mile. I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.
PAUL
That's why I'm here. I'd like to
ask you about one of them.
Burt settles back down, motions "please sit".
BURT
Which client? Now you got my
curiosity aroused.
PAUL
John Coffey.
BURT
Ah, Coffey. He causing you
problems?
PAUL
No, can't say he is. He doesn't
like the dark. He cries on
occasion. Other than that...
BURT
Cries, does he? Well, he's got a
lot to cry about, I'd say. You
know what he did.
PAUL
(nods)
I read the court transcripts.
Cynthia reappears, hands Paul a cold root beer.
PAUL
Thank you, Missus.
CYNTHIA
My pleasure. Kids! Lunch is about
ready! Y'all come on up!
She goes back inside, but the kids aren't quite able to tear
themselves away from their play.
BURT
What exactly are you trying to
find out? Satisfy my curiosity,
I'll see if I can satisfy yours.
PAUL
I've wondered if he ever did
anything like that before.
BURT
Why? Has he said anything?
PAUL
No. But a man who does a thing
like that has often developed a
taste for it over time. Occurred
to me it might be easy enough to
follow his backtrail and find out.
A man his size, and colored to
boot, can't be that hard to trace.
BURT
You'd think so, but you'd be
wrong. Believe me, we tried. It's
like he dropped out of the sky.
PAUL
How do you explain that?
BURT
We're in a Depression. A third of
the country's out of work.
People are drifting by the
thousands, looking for work,
looking for that greener grass.
Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't
get noticed everywhere he goes...
not until he kills a couple of
little girls.
PAUL
He's...strange, I admit. But there
doesn't seem to be any real
violence in him. I know violent
men, Mr. Hammersmith. I deal with
'em day in and day out.
Burt smiles, realizing:
BURT
You didn't come up here to ask me
whether he might have killed
before. You came up here to see if
I think he did it at all. That's
it, isn't it?
PAUL
Do you?
BURT
One seldom sees a less ambiguous
case. He was found with the
victims in his arms. Blurted out
a confession right then and there.
PAUL
Yet you defended him.
BURT
Everyone is entitled to a defense.
Cynthia hollers from an open window:
CYNTHIA
Kids! Lunch!
BURT
Y'all listen to your Momma, now!
The kids start this way. Burt turns back to Paul.
BURT
Tell you something. You listen
close, too, because it might be
something you need to know.
PAUL
I'm listening.
BURT
We had us a dog. No particular
breed, but gentle. Ready to lick
your hand or fetch a stick. Just
a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.
(Paul nods)
In many way, a good mongrel dog is
like you negro. You get to know
it, and often you get to love it.
It is of no particular use, but
you keep it around because you
think it loves you. If you're
lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never
have to find out any different. My
wife and I were not so lucky.
Caleb. Come here for a second.
The little boy comes to him, staring at his feet. Burt tires
to raise the boy's chin. The boy resists for a moment...
BURT
Please, son.
...and then his face comes around. He's horribly scarred on
that side, the eye missing.
BURT
He has the one eye. I suppose he's
lucky not to be blind. We get down
on our knees and thank God for
that much at least. Right Caleb?
(the boy nods shyly)
Okay, go on in now.
The boy races inside after his sister. Paul follows Burt's
gaze off toward the rear of the property, where an unoccupied
doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds.
BURT
That dog attacked my boy for no
reason. Just got it into his mind
one day. Same with John Coffey. He
was sorry afterwards, of that I
have no doubt...but those little
girls stayed raped and murdered
nonetheless. Maybe he's never done
it before--my dog never bit
before, but I didn't concern
myself with that. I went out there
with my rifle and grabbed his
collar and blew his brains out.
PAUL
I'm sorry for your trouble.
Burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod.
BURT
I'm as enlightened as the next
man, Mr. Edgecomb. I would not
bring back slavery for all the tea
in China. I believe we have to be
humane and generous in our efforts
to solve the race problem. But we
have to remember that the negro
will bite if he gets the chance,
just like a mongrel dog will bite
if it crosses its mind to do so.
(beat)
Is Coffey guilty? Yes, he is.
Don't you doubt it, and don't you
turn your back on him. You might
get away with it once or even a
hundred times...but in the end...
He raises his hand, making biting motions with his fingers.
BURT
You understand?
Paul says nothing. Burt gazes out again. Softly:
BURT
I'm gonna have to tear that old
doghouse down one of these days.
CUT TO:
Paul and Brutal unlock the restraint room. Billy looks up
from the corner, pale and drained. Softly:
BILLY
I learnt my lesson. I'll be good.
CUT TO:
Paul's Model T comes sputtering up the road. He and Jan are
taking a drive, still in their Sunday best...
Paul and Jan wait at the front door. Jan holds a baking dish.
PAUL
I hate this.
JAN
I know.
The door opens. Hal, looking tired, ushers them inside...
...and they walk outside to find MELINDA MOORES sitting in
the sun, frail and wasted, a blanket on her knees. She'd be
beautiful if not for the cancer killing her.
Paul is shocked at her appearance, hides it as best as he
can. Jan covers this for him--she drops to Melinda's side
with a warm smile and a kiss, takes the woman's frail hands
in hers.
Paul catches Jan's eye. The look he gives her says it all--I
don't know what I'd do without you...
DISSOLVE:
...and we find Paul and Hal talking quietly over beers while
the women visit b.g.:
HAL
She's having one of her good days.
I thank God for that.
PAUL
What a bad day?
HAL
(beat)
Sometimes she's...not herself
anymore. She swears.
PAUL
Swears.
HAL
It just pops out, the most awful
language you can imagine. She
doesn't even know she's doing it.
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that...and to hear her
say them in her sweet voice...
(gazes off)
I'm glad she's having a good day,
Paul. I'm glad for you and Jan.
DISSOLVE TO:
A massive iron door SQUEALS open onto a little-used fenced
enclosure. Paul and the others bring Coffey up from the
tunnel below, emerging into the night. Coffey's breath
catches as he gazes wondrously up at the stars, pointing:
COFFEY
Look, boss! It's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair!
PAUL
Shhh. John, you have to be quiet
now.
COFFEY
(whispering)
You see her? You see the lady?
BRUTAL
We see her, John.
Harry goes first, hugging the shadows as he pulls his keys to
unlock the gate...
WIDE SHOT OF PRISON
...while TOWER GUARDS huddle in their enclosure atop the
walls. An occasional SPOTLIGHT cuts the darkness. FIREFLIES
dance in the fields and trees as far as the eye can see.
Four dark figures detach from the shadows, hurrying across
the lonely country road into the fields on the far side...
Coffey's hand scoops up some fallen leaves. TILT UP to his
face as he crunches them under his nose, inhaling their smell.
He see the guards throwing him anxious looks. He misreads
this, holds out his hand so they can smell too. They do it,
just to make him happy.
PAUL
C'mon, big boy, keep moving.
A FEW FIREFLIES come winking through frame as the group
presses on...
ANOTHER AREA/WOODS
The trees are growing sparser, opening onto fields. MORE
FIREFLIES are flitting into view, trailing in their wake...
BRUTAL
How far is it?
HARRY
Just up ahead...
Harry brings them to a thicket of trees. They start removing
branches and boughs, uncovering a battered old FARMALL TRUCK
hidden in the brush.
The men pause. Even more fireflies are swirling around them,
growing in number. It's getting downright weird.
Coffey laughs softly, drawing their attention. A childlike
smile has utterly transformed his face. He raises his hand,
letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his fingers.
COFFEY
Hey there, little firefly. Where's
Mrs. Firefly this evening?
Another firefly joins the first, both now dancing and
blinking around his fingers. Coffey laughs again.
COFFEY
Oh, there you is. You come out to
play too?
The men stand gaping. The fireflies are flitting to Coffey as
if to a beacon. He waves his hands slowly, fireflies blinking
and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust.
They begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny glowing
planet orbiting a sun, their light kicking a mellow sheen off
his ebony skin. Coffey's eyes meet Paul's.
PAUL
They seem...drawn to you.
COFFEY
I love 'em, is why. They don't
think no hurtful thoughts. They's
just happy to be. Happy little
lightning bugs...
The men don't know whether to be enchanted or terrified.
Harry gives Paul a look--can we go? Please?
PAUL
C'mon, big boy. Upsy-daisy.
Coffey clambers up on the stakebed. Paul and Brutal join him.
Harry gets in behind the wheel, jabs the starter button...
ON THE STAKEBED
...while Coffey sits with his back to the cab.
PAUL
John? Do you know where we're
taking you?
COFFEY
Help a lady?
PAUL
That's right. Help a lady. But how
did you know?
COFFEY
Dunno. Tell the truth, boss, I
don't know much'a anything. Never
have.
The truck pulls out. Coffey waves as the fireflies get left
behind, dwindling away like stars.
COFFEY
Bye, fireflies. Bye.
WIDE ANGLE OF COUNTRYSIDE
The truck rumbles from the fields onto a dirt road, countless
fireflies swirling in its wake...
DISSOLVE TO:
Headlights come over the rise. The truck appears, rumbling
down toward the house. The world is isolated and still.
IN THE TRUCK CAB
Harry stops and cuts the engine, leaving the headlights on.
Silence now, save for the trilling of crickets.
IN THE STAKEBED
Paul and Brutal both look terrified now that they're actually
here. An urgent whisper:
BRUTAL
We can still turn back.
Paul hesitates, wanting to do just that, but:
COFFEY
Boss, look. Someone's up.
Lights are coming on inside the house. Coffey rises and steps
down from the truck, pulling Paul along. Brutal follows them.
BRUTAL
This is a mistake. Christ, Paul,
what were we thinking?
PAUL
Too late now. Harry, keep John
here until we call you.
Paul and Brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside
the house keep clicking on. The last one finally comes on
over the stoop, the front door opens a crack...and the twin
barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night.
HAL
Who the hell goes there at two-
thirty in the goddamn morning?
PAUL
Hal, it's us! It's Paul and
Brutal--it's us!
The door swings wider, revealing Hal's face gaunt and haggard
in the yellow porch light, stunned to see them:
HAL
Paul, what are you doing here at
this hour? Jesus, it's not a
lockdown, is it? Or a riot?
PAUL
Hal, God's sakes, take your finger
off the trigger...
Hal doesn't, aiming past them at the truck in the yard.
HAL
Are you hostages? Who's out there?
Who's by that truck?
Coffey steps into the glare of headlights with Harry tugging
on his arm, trying to hold him back. Hal cocks both hammers.
HAL
John Coffey! Halt! Halt right
there or I shoot!
His aim wavers as a woman's voice comes from upstairs:
MELINDA (O.S.)
Hal? Who are you talking to, you
fucking cocksucker?
A frozen moment. Hal mortified. Paul gives him a look--is
that Melinda?
Hal's shotgun shifts back to Coffey--but Paul steps in front
of the muzzle.
PAUL
No one's hurt. We're here to help.
HAL
Help what? I don't understand. Is
this a prison break?
PAUL
I can't explain what it is. You
just have to trust me.
Coffey comes up the steps, brushes Paul aside, stops before
the warden. Hal blinks, his thoughts suddenly fuzzy--it's
that benign hypnotic effect Coffey has.
HAL
What do you...want?
MELINDA
Hal! Make them go away! No
salesmen in the middle of the
night! No Fuller brushes! No
French knickers with come in the
crotch! Tell them to take a flying
fuck in a rolling d...d...
We hear the sound of GLASS BREAKING, then she begins to sob.
COFFEY
(a whisper)
Just to help. Just to help, boss,
that's all.
HAL
You can't. No one can.
Coffey pulls the shotgun gently from Hal's grasp, hands it to
Paul. Coffey moves past Hal into the house...
Paul and the men hustle Coffey out the front door toward the
truck, helping him as best they can. He's weak as a baby,
knees threatening to give out at any moment.
PAUL
C'mon, John, stay on your feet.
HARRY
Christ, he goes down, we'll need
three mules and a crane to pick
him up again...
They get Coffey to the truck and throw their backs into it,
helping him crawl up onto the stakebed. He rolls over on his
back. Harry hops up, covers him with an old blanket. Brutal
pulls aside, speaking low:
BRUTAL
He'll never sit in Old Sparky. You
know that, don't you?
(off Paul's look)
He swallowed that stuff for a
reason. I give him a few days. One
of us'll be doing a cell check and
there he'll be. Dead on his bunk.
PAUL
If that's his choice, he's earned
it.
(beat)
Let's get him back on the Mile.
FADE TO BLACK
IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:
"Coffey on the Mile"
CUT TO:
...and we WIDEN SLOWLY from Percy at the window to reveal his
last stop in life. It's emblazoned on the gate: BRIAR RIDGE
MENTAL HOSPITAL. He finally got that transfer.
CUT TO:
TIGHT ON PAUL as softly:
PAUL
It makes sense. I read the file.
Hal even said it himself. Wharton
rambled all over the state last
few years, causing trouble. Hell,
longer than that. Been at it since
he was ten. Vandalism. Petty
theft. Setting fires.
ANGLE SHIFTS to include Jan, Brutal, Harry and Dean. They're
in the brambly patch that borders the woods behind the house.
The sun is setting, turning the horizon fiery.
JAN
You saw him. You actually saw this
Wild Bill person take those girls.
PAUL
Their father hired him on for a
few days last spring, help repair
the barn. Cheap labor, just
another drifter...
BRUTAL
Only not.
PAUL
Sick bastard came back a month
later, just before dawn. Took the
girls...did what he did. Coffey
found them afterwards and tried to
help. It was too late.
JAN
(absorbs this)
Then you can stop it. The
execution, I mean. Get Coffey a
new trial.
PAUL
Based on what, honey? Some kind of
magical vision I had?
JAN
Show this farmer--what's his name,
Detterick?--show him a picture of
Wild Bill.
(off their looks)
Why not? If Wharton was there...if
the farmer can identify his
picture and they know he was
there...
BRUTAL
Him being there in May doesn't
mean he came back and killed those
girls in June. Even if he was
committing other crimes.
PAUL
They got their killer as far as
they're concerned.
Hell, Coffey's own lawyer would
come throw the switch if we let
him.
JAN
Then lie.
PAUL
Lie? About what?
JAN
Tell them Wharton confessed to the
crime. Brutus, you can back him
up, say you heard it too. You can
say that's what set Percy off. He
shot Wharton because he couldn't
stand thinking of what happened to
those two little girls, it snapped
his mind...
(seeing their looks)
...what? What now?
DEAN
We never reported anything like
that. We would've, too, everybody
knows it. It's part of our job.
BRUTAL
Besides, confessing don't make it
so. Slugs like Wild Bill lie about
everything. Crimes they committed,
women they had, even the weather.
JAN
But he was there! He painted their
barn! He ate dinner with them!
PAUL
All the more reason he might take
credit for the crime. He's gonna
fry anyway, so why not boast?
Jan stands thinking for a moment, then:
JAN
All right. Then you've got to get
John Coffey out on your own.
HARRY
Ma'am?
JAN
You did it once, didn't you? Only
this time, don't bring him back.
Dean blinks, stunned by this notion. Gently:
DEAN
Ma'am, your son's grown up and
moved away. My kids are just
starting kindergarten. Will you be
the one to explain to them why
their daddy's in prison?
JAN
Work out a plan. Make it look like
a real escape.
HARRY
Better be a plan an imbecile could
dream up. Nobody'd believe it
otherwise.
BRUTAL
Even if we did think of something,
it wouldn't do any good.
JAN
Why not? Just why the hell not?
PAUL
Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch
baldheaded black man with barely
enough brains to feed himself. How
long you think it'd be before he
was recaptured? Two hours? Six?
Jan swipes a tear away with the heel of her hand. Softly:
JAN
Do you mean to kill him, you
cowards? Do you?
Paul tries to take her hand. She wrenches away, furious.
JAN
Don't touch me! Next week this
time you'll be a murderer, no
better than that man Wharton, so
don't touch me!
She runs off toward the house, starting to sob as we
DISSOLVE TO:
INT
PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours, at his regular
place, sipping his beer. Irving Berlin's "Remember" PLAYS
SOFTLY on the radio. Jan comes down, looking miserable and
exhausted.
JAN
I'm so sorry I called you a
coward. I feel worse about that
than anything I've ever said to
you in our whole marriage.
PAUL
Even that time we went camping and
you called me Old Stinky Sam?
She can't help smiling at that. He returns the smile, offers
her a sip of beer. She takes it, sits.
JAN
Does Hal know? That Coffey's
innocent, I mean?
(Paul shakes his head)
Can he help? Does he have the
influence to do something about
this?
PAUL
No.
JAN
Then don't tell him. If he can't
help, don't tell him. Ever.
PAUL
I won't.
JAN
(beat)
There's no way out of this for
you, is there?
PAUL
No. I've been thinking about it,
too, believe me.
(beat)
Tell you the truth, honey. I've
done some things in my life I'm
not proud of, but this is the
first time I've ever felt in real
danger of hell.
JAN
Hell? Oh Paul...
(touches his face)
Talk to him. Talk to John. Find
out what he wants.
CUT TO:
Paul pulls in, cuts the engine. He sits for a moment, then
gets out and heads for the house.
The door opens. Jan steps out in her nightgown and robe to
meet him on the stairs. She takes him in her arms.
Paul can't hold it back anymore. He breaks down sobbing
against her as we
DISSOLVE TO:
The rain has mostly stopped. Brad Dolan, back in street
clothes, gets in his pickup truck and drives away...
This time, we see two red specks trudging slowly up the ridge
toward the treeline.
CUT TO:
Paul brings Elaine along the wooded path into view of the
storage shacks. They're both wearing ponchos.
PAUL
There. It's in there.
ELAINE
Paul? This thing you want to show
me. Is it scary?
PAUL
Scary? No. Not really.
He gives her a smile, offers his hand. She takes it.
Paul stands at the graveside as the casket is lowered.
PAUL (V.O.)
I'll die eventually, I imagine. I
have no illusions of immortality.
But I will have wished for death
long before death finds me.
He turns and walks away.
PAUL (V.O.)
In truth, I wish for it already.
