      ALEXANDRE D ARTAGNAN picks up the same lamp and closes the 
      shutters. He is a well-built man in his 50s. 


                                                                                          1                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      A group of men sit around the dining table. They include 
      BROUSSARD a burly farmer, and FOURNIER an aristocrat. 

                                    ALEXANDRE
                    The King s taxes are a burden on 
                    every honest man in Gascony. While 
                    he spends our money on foreign 
                    wars, we watch our children starve. 

                                    FOURNIER
                    But what can we do about it?

      Alexandre looks around with a troubled expression.

                                    ALEXANDRE
                    His father was a man of the people. 
                    For his sake, the young King must 
                    give us justice. 

                                    BROUSSARD
                    He s not the man his father was. 
                    He s weak and foolish and the 
                      country s going to hell. 

                                    ALEXANDRE
                    It s too soon to lose faith. Give 
                    him time.

                                    FOURNIER
                    He doesn t care about any of us. 
                      Gascony should break with Paris. We 
                      should take our future in our 
                      hands... 

                                    ALEXANDRE
                      Independence isn t the answer. Our 
                    cause is justice not rebellion...

      Before he can continue, the door crashes open and FOUR MASKED 
      MUSKETEERS burst in. Their uniforms are identical to those we 
      saw on the men on the road. We can still see the dust and 
      dirt on them. The soldiers  leader steps forward. We assume 
      it is Cornet. (It is actually GAUDET - for the sake of the 
      drama both actors should be of similar look and build).

                                    GAUDET
                    Where is Alexandre d Artagnan? 

                                    ALEXANDRE
                    I am d Artagnan. What do you want 
                    here?

                                    GAUDET
                      Didn t you write to the King, 
                      calling his ministers criminals and 
                    his tax collectors parasites? 




                                                                                          2                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    ALEXANDRE
                      I did. And I would say it again to 
                    his face. 

                                    GAUDET
                    No need. Here is the King s answer.

      He plunges his sword into Alexandre s stomach. The older man 
      gasps and sinks to his knees. There are cries of fear from 
      the others as the masked men raise their pistols. A beat, 
      then the leader looks at them and nods.

      The sound of shots is thunderous in the shuttered room. 
      Glasses shatter and chunks of splintered wood fly from the 
      walls. As the smoke clears bodies litter the floor. Gaudet 
      steps over the dying Alexandre and raises his pistol in the 
      direction of the only survivor, the terrified Fournier. 

                                    GAUDET
                    Tell your friends what happened 
                    here. Tell them I, Athos of the 
                      Musketeers, will do the same to 
                      anyone who defies the King. 

      Fournier looks around in horror. Alexandre D Artagnan stares 
      back at him, eyes fixed and unmoving in death. 



      TITLES: THE MUSKETEERS



      Tense silence. Two men sit opposite each other, a pack of 
      playing cards scattered in front of them. A nervous crowd 
      stand at the bar. It is like something from a western. One of 
      the men at the table is PORTHOS. In his early 30s, he is a 
      brutal street fighter with raw good looks. He is of mixed 
      race, calm and composed but intensely aware of any movement 
      around him. His angry opponent DUJON wears the distinctive 
      uniform of the Red Guards. ATHOS hurries in and pauses. 

                                    ATHOS
                      What s going on?

                                    PORTHOS
                    Dujon and I are having a discussion 
                    about personal integrity.


                                                                                          3                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    DUJON
                    He s a cheat. He had the Ace of 
                      Hearts up his sleeve. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      That s a very hurtful accusation. I 
                    could sue.

      Dujon brings the pistol he s been hiding under the table out 
      into plain view. Athos looks at him calmly.

                                    ATHOS
                    Easy now. Shoot him and it s 
                      murder. 

                                    DUJON
                    One less Musketeer. Who cares? 

                                    ATHOS
                      There s only one way to resolve 
                    this. A duel between gentlemen, 
                      supervised according to the strict 
                    code of honour and chivalry.

      Dujon reluctantly eases down the hammer of his pistol. 

                                    DUJON
                    Very well. Porthos might be one of 
                    the greatest swordsmen in France, 
                    but I m better.

                                    ATHOS
                      Confidence. I like that in a man. 

      Dujon kicks his chair back, draws his sword and adopts the 
      classic duelling position, his rapier extended. Porthos 
      responds in kind. The two men circle each other. It looks 
      like we re in for a really classic duel... 

      ... And then Athos simply picks up a chair and crashes it 
      over Dujon s head. He collapses like a demolished chimney 
      stack. There is a startled silence. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    What happened to the strict code of 
                      honour and chivalry?

                                    ATHOS
                    Who has time? Treville wants to see 
                    us.

      Porthos grins. As he grabs his money from the table the Ace 
      of Hearts slips out of his sleeve. ATHOS looks at him wryly. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      I need to work on that. 




                                                                                          4                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    ATHOS
                      Where s Aramis? 

      Porthos looks at him awkwardly. Athos can t believe it.

                                    ATHOS
                    Tell me he s not that stupid.

      Porthos s expression gives him his answer. As they hurry out 
      we CHANGE ANGLE to a man standing at the bar. He is in his 
      20s, attractive, with an athletic build. He finishes his 
      drink then turns quietly to follow the Musketeers. His name 
      is D ARTAGNAN.

                                                                              CUT TO:



        A luxuriously appointed sitting room. ARAMIS and the lovely 
      ADELE BESSETTE lie in each other s arms on a chaise longue. 
      Aramis s sword and belt, with his beautifully decorated 
      pistol, hang over the back of a chair. Aramis is in his late 
      20s. All our key Musketeers are attractive but Aramis is the 
      one who makes women - and men, probably - stop in their 
      tracks. Frankly, he s sexy and he knows it.  

                                    ARAMIS
                    We could go to your bedroom. 

                                    ADELE
                      Armand will be here in an hour. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    He doesn t love you as I do.

                                    ADELE
                    But he pays for all this. 

      She smiles and they kiss... and then there is a sudden 
      banging on the door. 

                                    ADELE
                    My God! He s early. He can t find 
                    you here. 

      ARAMIS hurls himself off the chaise longue and hurries to the 
      window. He looks out but it is a sheer drop to the ground.

                                    ARAMIS
                    Is there another way out?

                                    ADELE
                      There s no time. I ll say you were 
                    an intruder.

                                    ARAMIS
                    He ll never believe that.


                                                                                          5                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      She looks down at her dress, thinking quickly. 

                                    ADELE
                    Rip my bodice. 

      He understands and grabs the dress over her breasts,  
      struggling with it briefly. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    This is very good material.

                                    ADELE
                    It should be. It cost a fortune. 

      The dress finally gives with a tearing sound as it is ripped 
      in two, exposing a generous amount of her lovely bosom. 

                                    ADELE
                    Now slap me. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    What? 

                                    ADELE
                    We have to make it look convincing.

      He draws back his hand but falters. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      I can t strike a woman. Not even to 
                    save my life. 

                                    ADELE
                    It s mine I m worried about. 

      But she kisses him anyway. He gives her one last look, then 
      ties his handkerchief around his face and dashes to the door. 

                                    ADELE
                            (Screams)
                    You brute! You animal! Don t touch 
                    me!

      Aramis grabs his belt and sword but as he goes his ornate 
      pistol falls unnoticed to the carpet under a chair.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      As ARAMIS dashes out two RED GUARDS are climbing up the 
      stairs. He crashes past, sending them tumbling.

                                                                              CUT TO:




                                                                                          6                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12



      ARAMIS leans back against the seat, breathing heavily as he 
      removes his disguise. ATHOS gives him a sceptical look. 

                                    ATHOS
                    Adele Bessette? Really? 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Why not Adele?

                                    ATHOS
                    Oh, I don t know, let s think. 
                      Because she s the mistress of the 
                    most powerful man in France?

                                    ARAMIS
                      I love her. 

                                    ATHOS
                    You love her? Or you love stealing 
                    what belongs to the Cardinal?

      Aramis considers this, then grins. A little of both.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      As the CARDINAL comes in, ADELE sits on the chaise longue in 
        a convincing attitude of distress. She looks up tearfully.

                                    CARDINAL
                    My poor darling. Are you hurt?

                                    ADELE
                    He startled me... he might have 
                    done worse if you hadn t arrived...

                                    CARDINAL
                    What sort of man was he? 

                                    ADELE
                    Some thief or beggar from the 
                      street... I don t suppose we ll 
                    ever catch him...

                                    CARDINAL
                      Strange. I m certain he wore the 
                      clothes of a gentleman. 

      She buries her head in his chest and sobs. She really is a 
      very good actress. He raises her face to kiss her tenderly. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    Don t worry, my love. We ll find 
                    him. And when we do he will most 
                      bitterly regret the day he ever 
                    laid a finger on you. 

      Adele smiles, a glimmer of unease in her tearful eyes. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      As ATHOS, PORTHOS and ARAMIS enter the regiment s 
        headquarters they walk past their fellow Musketeers, bare-
      chested, shirts open, hair flying, fencing in mock duels or 
      tangling in rowdy bare-knuckle boxing matches. It is an 
      intensely masculine world, dripping with sweat and 
        testosterone. Athos looks up at a shout from the stairs. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    You three. My office. Now. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      TREVILLE stands behind his cluttered desk as ATHOS, PORTHOS 
      and ARAMIS wait. 



                                                                                          8                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      Captain of the Musketeers, Treville is a battle-scarred 
      veteran of countless campaigns, and also a self-taught 
      thinker and philosopher. His room is covered in books, maps 
      and scientific instruments. Now in his 50s, his strength and 
      charisma remain undimmed. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    I ve had complaints. Allegations 
                      you ve been duelling with the 
                      Cardinal s Red Guards. For money. 
                    Is it true? 

                                    ATHOS
                    That would be illegal.

      His expression is deadpan. The others look equally bland. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    Two of his men were wounded. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      Wounded? We barely scratched them. 

      The others sigh. He grimaces. Treville gives them a dry look.

                                    TREVILLE
                    Be careful, boys. The Cardinal is 
                      threatening to hang anyone 
                      convicted of duelling.

                                    ARAMIS
                    He wouldn t dare touch a King s 
                      Musketeer. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    Go ahead. Stake your life on that.

      Aramis looks chastened. Treville glances at them, then looks 
      uneasily at Athos. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    Have you heard from Cornet and his 
                    men? He should be back by now.

                                    ATHOS
                    It s a long journey. They re 
                      probably just delayed on the road.

                                    TREVILLE
                    His cargo was valuable.

                                    ATHOS
                      Cornet s not a thief, if that s 
                    what you re thinking.

      Treville considers this, then looks at him.




                                                                                          9                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    TREVILLE
                    Make enquiries. Be discreet. 

      He tosses a pile of papers from his chair and sits down. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    These duels you didn t fight. How 
                    much money didn t you make?

                                    ATHOS
                    Not 20 livres.

      Treville holds out his hand. Athos digs into his pocket, 
      finds a gold coin and puts it in Treville s hand. He clicks 
      his fingers and Athos resignedly adds two more.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      A dirty, down at heel place. D ARTAGNAN talks to the 
      LANDLADY, an old woman of sour disposition. 

                                    LANDLADY
                    Five Sous for the bed, three if you 
                      share. Any lice or crabs?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Are you asking or offering? 

      She looks at him. A cockroach wanders across the counter and 
      she splatters it with her fist. 

                                    LANDLADY
                    This is a very clean house. Dinner, 
                    bath and hot water are all extra. 
                    Use of the communal towel is free. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Good to know. Soap?

                                    LANDLADY
                      Extra. 

      She picks up a quill pen and opens the dusty register. 

                                    LANDLADY
                    Name?



                                                                                          10                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      That s my business.

                                    LANDLADY
                    No name, no bed. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                          (Beat)
                      Athos. Of the King s Musketeers.

      He tosses a handful of coins on the counter. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D Artagnan glances up as a man and woman come in. RENARD is 
      about 40, with beautiful clothes and a haughty look; his 
      female companion is simply ravishing, with a regal beauty 
      that quickens the pulse and numbs the senses. This is MILADY. 
      She locks eyes briefly with d Artagnan and we see a flicker 
      of interest. RENARD summons the now fawning LANDLADY. 

                                    RENARD
                    We ll have your best room. And if 
                    the bed has fleas you ll be 
                      whipped.

      Milady flicks her an imperious glance. 

                                    MILADY
                    Draw me a bath. Be sure the water s 
                      clean. I don t want to bathe in 
                      someone else s scum.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                            (Smiles)
                    Clean water is extra, Madame. And 
                    don t even ask about the towel.

      RENARD turns to him in contemptuous surprise. 

                                    RENARD
                    Are you addressing me, sir? 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Not unless your name is  Madame .

      Milady laughs. Humiliated, Renard reaches for his sword, but 
      d Artagnan instantly has a pistol aimed at his head. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Put it back or I ll blow your head 
                    off.  

                                    RENARD
                    You are not a gentleman.


                                                                                          11                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Ouch. That really stings.

      There are smirks amongst the other guests. Renard is red-
      faced with anger. Milady intervenes softly.

                                    MILADY
                    He s just some drunken thug, Paul. 
                    Put your sword away before he kills 
                    you. 

      The blustering Renard is glad of the excuse to back down. 

                                    RENARD
                    We ll settle this at breakfast.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    I ll be in the courtyard at eight. 
                    You bring the coffee. 

      Milady glances at d Artagnan. The chemistry between them is 
      instant. D Artagnan looks up at the furious Landlady.

                                    LANDLADY
                    You get any blood on the floor, you 
                    mop it up yourself. 

      She bangs down a plate on the table. He examines the 
      congealed mess of unidentifiable slop with disgust. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    This looks like a badger s 
                      intestines. 

                                    LANDLADY
                      Speciality of the house. Enjoy.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D Artagnan makes his way to his room. A door opens and MILADY 
      appears like a ghost. She kisses him. His surprise quickly 
      gives way to passion. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D ARTAGNAN and MILADY tumble into his room, tearing at each 
      other s clothes. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    What of your companion?




                                                                                          12                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    MILADY
                    Trust me. He won t wake up.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The candle throws flickering shadows on the wall. D ARTAGNAN 
      and MILADY lie naked under the sheet, except in her case for 
      a simple ribboned choker around her neck. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Is that pompous idiot your husband?

                                    MILADY
                    Do you see a ring on my finger?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                            (Smiles)
                    If you re trying to make him 
                      jealous a little light flirtation 
                    would have sufficed. 

                                    MILADY
                      I take what I want. And I want you. 

      He grasps her wrists and pins her down fiercely on her back.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    I m not here to be taken. 

      She gazes at him, submissive yet cool and confident. He 
      relaxes his grip and she folds him in her arms, rolling on 
      top of him. He reaches up and touches the lace choker, moving 
      it to see a pink scar running around her neck. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    What happened?

                                    MILADY
                    A man I loved tried to strangle me. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Say the word and I ll kill him for 
                    you. 

                                    MILADY
                      I might hold you to that one day.

      She leans down to kiss him, slowly but with growing passion.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      D ARTAGNAN wakes, aware of shouting somewhere. He turns to 
      look for Milady, then starts in shock. A dagger lies in a 
      pool of dark blood on the sheet. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INN. HALL. DAY.2121

      A crowd has gathered by Milady s room. D Artagnan looks 
      inside. RENARD lies across the bed, his beautiful white shirt 
      covered in blood. He is dead. The LANDLADY turns white with 
      horror as she sees the bloody dagger in d Artagnan s hand. 

                                    LANDLADY
                    You! You murdered him. Stabbed him 
                    in his sleep like a coward. Hold 
                    him someone!

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D ARTAGNAN dashes into his room, slams the door and blocks 
      the handle with a chair. There is only one way out - the 
      window. He opens it, vaults over the sill and leaps out - 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ATHOS sits at his table, an empty bottle of wine at his 
      elbow. His rooms are large but austere. A bed, a dresser, a 
      globe and shelves full of books. It is more like the room of 
      an impoverished academic than a man of action. There is no 
      personal history here, no sense of his past. He gazes out of 
      his window at a white nightdress flapping on a washing line. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ATHOS gazes at the white dress flapping on the line. Anguish 
      is etched into his expression.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      A group of LOCALS drinking at the bar. Suddenly the MASKED 
      MUSKETEERS smash their way in, pistols raised. 

                                    GAUDET
                    Empty the till!

                                    WINE SHOP OWNER
                      Please. I m a poor man... 

                                    GAUDET
                    Who isn t?

      He pushes him aside and grabs the money. The owner reaches 
      for a hidden pistol, but Gaudet grabs his hand and impales it 
      on the counter with a brutal thrust of his dagger. As the man 
      screams in agony -

      D ARTAGNAN slowly comes to his senses, hearing urgent 
      whispering over his head. 

                                    BONACIEUX
                    Why did you bring him here?

                                    CONSTANCE
                      I couldn t just leave him in the 
                      gutter. Where is your Christian 
                      charity, Bonacieux?

                                    BONACIEUX
                      Charity begins at home. 

      CONSTANCE is on one side of the bed and BONACIEUX on the 
      other. He is 20 years older than her, not handsome but 
      dignified and rather stiff. He is also jealously in love with 
      his much younger wife. He sees that d Artagnan is awake. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Where am I?

                                    BONACIEUX
                    In my house. My wife had you 
                      carried here in the mistaken belief 
                    it is a hospital. (Pause) Jacques-
                      Michel Bonacieux at your service. 
                      Merchant in high quality ladies 
                        undergarments. Perhaps you ve heard 
                    of me?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    I m afraid not. 

      Bonacieux looks mildly offended. 

                                    BONACIEUX
                    How did you come by these injuries, 
                      Monsieur?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      I fell off my horse. Or he fell on 
                    me. I forget which. 

      Changing the subject quickly he smiles at Constance. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Might I enquire the name of my 
                      saviour?

                                    CONSTANCE
                      Constance. Constance Bonacieux. 
                    Rest now and I ll bring you some 
                    soup later. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


                                                                                          19                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12



      BONACIEUX follows CONSTANCE into the comfortable room with a 
      look of intense disapproval. 

                                    BONACIEUX
                    Soup? What next? Dinner and a fine 
                    new set of clothes? Why not set him 
                    up in his own house with servants 
                    and a carriage? (Pause) We know 
                      nothing about him. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Look at his clothes. He s obviously 
                      a gentleman. 

                                    BONACIEUX
                    And a very handsome one, which of 
                      course had no bearing on your 
                      decision to bring him here!

                                    CONSTANCE
                    I am your faithful wife. You have 
                    no cause to attack my honour. 

      Bonacieux stares at her angrily then abruptly his mood 
      changes and he sighs in apology. 

                                    BONACIEUX
                      You re right my love. Forgive me. I 
                    am a foolish and jealous man.

      He kisses her briefly on the forehead. 

                                    BONACIEUX
                    It s just I can t stand the thought 
                    of another man touching you. You 
                      understand? 

      He smiles. We see Constance s very mixed reactions to his 
      mildly threatening possessiveness.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      LOUIS sits with his queen, ANNE OF AUSTRIA. Anne is in her 
      20s, an attractive, serious woman of strong character with a 
      faint air of sadness. LOUIS is in a dark mood as he listens 
      to the Cardinal. TREVILLE is also present. 

                                    CARDINAL
                      Reports are coming in with 
                      disturbing frequency. A group of 
                      Musketeers on the rampage, robbing, 
                      looting and abusing the good 
                      citizens of Paris. 


                                                                                          20                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    TREVILLE
                    My men are not thieves and bandits.

                                    CARDINAL
                    You can vouch for them all? There 
                    have been no recent desertions, no 
                      absences, no one unaccounted for?

      Treville looks deeply uncomfortable. Queen Anne intervenes.

                                    ANNE
                      I know the loyalty of Captain 
                      Treville s men. I don t believe a 
                    word of this. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    The Queen is as wise as she is 
                      beautiful. But the people are 
                      unhappy and the king must be seen 
                    to act.

      He turns back to Louis, who wriggles uncomfortably. 

                                    LOUIS
                            (Finally)
                    Very well. We shall hear the 
                      evidence in the morning. 

      Anne gives him the Cardinal a cool look. He bows as she goes 
      out. Louis dismisses Treville with a wave and he follows her. 
      Louis and the Cardinal are left alone. 

                                    LOUIS
                    Is this inquiry really necessary? 

                                    CARDINAL
                      A great king must be seen to be 
                    fair. He cannot have favourites.

      Louis looks at him a little helplessly. 

                                    LOUIS
                      People have no idea how difficult 
                    it is being king. Decisions, 
                      decisions all day long. It s very 
                    hard to get them all right.

                                    CARDINAL
                    Your Majesty s judgement is 
                      infallible. It is those who serve 
                    you who make mistakes. 

                                    LOUIS
                    True. But being King Louis is very 
                      lonely sometimes. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    I am always by your side. 


                                                                                          21                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    LOUIS
                    Oh, yes. Every since I was a little 
                    boy, there you were, guiding me, 
                      telling me what to do, steering the 
                    great ship of State while I lounged 
                    on the deck. 

      He looks resentful but the Cardinal only smiles politely. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    Is there anything Your Majesty 
                      wishes to discuss?

                                    LOUIS
                    No, why?

                                    CARDINAL
                    No affair of state you might wish 
                    to share with your First Minister?

                                    LOUIS
                            (Awkward)
                      I leave all that to you, Armand. 

      The Cardinal bows his head in humble gratitude. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    I am deeply honoured. (Pause) Will 
                    Your Majesty be attending on the 
                    Queen tonight?

                                    LOUIS
                            (Furious)
                    Good God, are you coming into the 
                      bedroom with me now? Some things 
                    are private, even to you. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    The succession is not a private 
                      matter. France needs an heir. 

                                    LOUIS
                    All right! I ll sleep with her. 
                    Come and watch if you like!

                                    CARDINAL
                    That won t be necessary. 

      Louis looks at him and sighs, out-manoeuvred on all fronts.

                                    LOUIS
                      I don t like her, Armand. She 
                      scolds me about duty all the time. 
                    She s just like mother. And who 
                    wants to be reminded of their 
                      mother in bed?

                                                                              CUT TO:

      The CARDINAL, less guarded in private, sits opposite his 
      mistress ADELE, who looks very pretty in the candlelight. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    The Musketeers are a mob of 
                      hooligans who think of nothing but 
                      honour and glory. An ungovernable 
                      faction at the heart of the state. 

                                    ADELE
                    Is that why you hate them? Because 
                    they are beyond your control?

                                    CARDINAL
                      Nothingis beyond my control.

      Adele is about to answer, when something suddenly catches her 
      eye. Beneath the Cardinal s chair, almost touching his foot, 
      is Aramis s pistol. She pales, then, thinking fast, goes to 
      sit at his knees.

                                    ADELE
                    My poor Armand. You look so tired. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    I m not in the least tired.

      But he strokes her hair affectionately. At the same time she 
      nudges the pistol further under his chair.

                                    ADELE
                    Let s go to bed.

                                    CARDINAL
                      I have work to do.

      Taking advantage of his distracted mood, Adele shoves the 
      pistol out of sight. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      As ADELE makes her way up the stairs, the CARDINAL suddenly 
      appears in the doorway behind her. 

                                    CARDINAL
                      Adele? I m glad to see you so 
                      recovered from your ordeal. Your 
                      courage does you credit. 

      She nods her thanks then goes up the stairs. The Cardinal 
      watches her. He is smiling, but his eyes are sharp and alert. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

      As CONSTANCE comes in, D ARTAGNAN is already dressed and 
      putting on his sword. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Where are you going?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      I have business to attend to.

                                    CONSTANCE
                      You re in no shape to fight, if 
                      that s what you have in mind.

      He looks at her in surprise. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                      I have three older brothers. I know 
                    the look in a man s eye when he has 
                      a score to settle. 

      She takes his hand and checks the bandage around his wound.

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Next time, ask before you kiss a 
                      woman. 

      He smiles. There is a moment of awkward intimacy between 
      them. She looks up at him tentatively.

                                    CONSTANCE
                    This business of yours. You re 
                    going to kill someone, aren t you?   

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    With respect, that s none of your 
                      concern.

                                    CONSTANCE
                    You made yourself my concern when 
                    you fell at my feet. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      You re a beautiful woman. I m sure 
                      you re used to it. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                    I m serious. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    So am I.

      He leans forward and kisses her, softly this time. She is too 
      surprised to resist or perhaps she simply doesn t want to; 
      finally she pushes him away gently. He smiles.




                                                                                          24                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Our relationship is improving. You 
                      didn t stab me this time. 

      He goes to the door. She doesn t move. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    At least if I die I ll take the 
                      memory of your lips to the grave.

      He leaves. Constance looks confused. She touches her lips 
      with her fingers. She hears the front door slam and dashes to 
      the window. She sees d Artagnan going down the street (off-
      screen) and, on an impulse, suddenly rushes out of the door.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ATHOS, ARAMIS and PORTHOS walk through the garrison together. 

                                    ATHOS
                    We leave for Gascony immediately. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    You think Cornet has deserted?

                                    ATHOS
                      Deserted, robbed. I don t know. But 
                    he s my responsibility. I should 
                    have seen him safely to Bayonne.  

      Before his friends can reply a loud challenge echoes through 
      the hotel. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      Athos!

      D ARTAGNAN stands in the doorway, his pistol levelled. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Give me one good reason why I 
                      shouldn t shoot you where you 
                      stand. 

                                    ATHOS
                          (Beat)
                      Because I have no idea who you are?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    My name is d Artagnan. You murdered 
                    my father. I ve come to kill you. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    You have to admit, that s a 
                      terrific introduction.



                                                                                          25                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      D Artagnan puts up his pistol and draws his sword.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      Unlike you I don t kill people in 
                    cold blood. Draw your sword. 

                                    ATHOS
                      You ve made a mistake. I m not the 
                    man you re looking for.

      D Artagnan makes a run at him and ATHOS only just draws his 
      sword in time to defend himself. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Do you deny you killed Alexandre 
                      d Artagnan, of Meung in Gascony?

                                    PORTHOS
                      Gascony? Why s everything happening 
                    in Gascony all of a sudden?

                                    ARAMIS
                    I ve beento Gascony. Nothing ever
                      happens.

      Athos circles d Artagnan warily.

                                    ATHOS
                      I usually remember the men I kill. 
                    And that name doesn t ring a bell.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Then you re a liar as well as a 
                      murderer.

      As D Artagnan attacks him Athos realiseshe is in a battle 
      for his life. The fight rages over the lower floor of the 
      garrison, sending chairs and tables flying. D Artagnan gets 
      through Athos s defence, nicking his arm. 

      Porthos and Aramis watch with an air of impartiality.

                                    PORTHOS
                    He s pretty good. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      Considering he s from Gascony. 

      The contest is intensely physical; both men are quickly 
      soaked in sweat, their hair flying, their breath rasping. 
      D Artagnan is forced back and jumps up on a table. The effort 
      costs him - he holds his damaged ribs in pain - but he hurls 
      himself into a counter-attack.

                                    ARAMIS
                      Incredible. Athos is losing. 




                                                                                          26                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    PORTHOS
                      Rubbish. He just doesn t want to 
                    hurt the lunatic. 

      D Artagnan is caught off-balance; for a second he is at 
      Athos s mercy but he grabs a stool and throws it in his face. 
      Neither man is above using fists and anything else that comes 
      to hand to gain an advantage.

                                    ATHOS
                    Don t make me kill you over a 
                      mistake. 

      D Artagnan ducks away from a thrust, and Athos trips and 
      loses his balance. His sword is swept out of his hand. 
      D Artagnan raises his own sword - but Aramis beats it away. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      Enough. 

      There is a pause. D Artagnan calmly picks up Athos s sword 
      and tosses it back to him. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Very well. I ll fight both of you. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    Three of us. Now for God s sake, 
                    put up your sword. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      You ll have to kill me for it. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      You re a stubborn little bugger, 
                      aren t you?

      D Artagnan fends off their attacks in an exhilarating 
      contest. But it can end only one way. Finally he is cornered. 
      Three swords converge on him. It looks like the end. Then -

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Stop fighting! All of you! 

      They turn. CONSTANCE stands in the doorway, looking 
      ferocious. She walks protectively in front of d Artagnan.

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Is three against one fair?

                                    ATHOS
                    We weren t going to kill him. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      Weren t we? Next time, let me know. 

      D Artagnan looks at Constance incredulously.



                                                                                          27                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      Madame Bonacieux. What are you 
                    doing here?

                                    CONSTANCE
                      I followed you because I knew you 
                    were going to do something stupid.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      I don t need a woman to protect me. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Don t say another word. If only men 
                    would think instead of fight, there 
                    might be more good ones left.

      Aramis looks at Constance appreciatively. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Him, I m not sure about. Her, I 
                    like. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    Is she going to fight us as well?

                                    ARAMIS
                    Who knows? It s that kind of day.

                                    TREVILLE
                          (Off)
                      What s going on here?

      TREVILLE looks around in disbelief at the wreckage of the 
      garrison. But before anyone can reply he holds up his hand.

                                    TREVILLE
                      Later. You re to attend on the King 
                    now. All of you.  

                                    ATHOS
                    Why?

                                    TREVILLE
                      You ll find out soon enough.

      Athos turns to the frustrated and confused d Artagnan. 

                                    ATHOS
                    I m sorry. I m not the man you re 
                      looking for. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Then who is? And why did he use 
                    your name?

      Athos has no answer. He turns to leave with the others. 
      D Artagnan watches them go in bitter frustration. Constance 
      regards him in sceptical silence.


                                                                                          28                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    CONSTANCE
                      Aren t you going to thank me?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    I was well on top. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                          (Sighs)
                    Why is it the handsome ones are 
                      always stupid? (Pause) How are your 
                    ribs?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Fine.

      She pokes him hard and he doubles over in agony. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                      Obviously. (Pause) You re coming 
                    home with me. My husband has a room 
                    to let. You can have it.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    What if I don t want it?

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Well, if you have somewhere else to 
                    go..?

      He looks at her. He doesn t. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ADELE hurries over to the chair, hurling herself to her knees 
      to retrieve the pistol. It isn t there. She feels around 
        desperately. But the reality is unavoidable. It has gone. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The sumptuous state room is packed with COURTIERS and 
        MUSKETEERS. RED GUARDS line the walls. ATHOS, ARAMIS and 
      PORTHOS stand behind TREVILLE while LOUIS sits with QUEEN 
      ANNE at his side as the Cardinal addresses them.  

                                    CARDINAL
                    These Musketeers think they are 
                    above the law. Captain Treville has 
                    lost control. While he looks the 
                    other way his men riot in the 
                      streets.

      Treville rejects the allegation with terse contempt.


                                                                                          29                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    TREVILLE
                    The charges are false. 

      The Cardinal looks at him with silky charm.

                                    CARDINAL
                    Do you deny their involvement in 
                    the pernicious and illegal practice 
                    of duelling?

                                    TREVILLE
                    There might have been one or two 
                      trivial incidents. 

      Aramis leans over to whisper to Porthos. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      I don t like where this is going. 

                                    CARDINAL
                          (Hard)
                    There is nothing trivial about 
                      duelling. It is gang violence by 
                      another name, street warfare that 
                      leaves too many of our best young 
                    men dead or wounded every year. 

                                    TREVILLE
                      I will remind my men of their 
                        responsibilities. 

      Louis, thinking the formalities are over, looks relieved. 

                                    LOUIS
                    If that s everything, Cardinal..?

                                    CARDINAL
                    Not quite, Your Majesty. (Pause) 
                      Captain Gaudet?

      GAUDET emerges from the crowd. He is a captain in the Red 
      Guards, a handsome man with a dashing manner. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    Tell His Majesty of the report you 
                      received from Gascony this morning. 

      Athos looks up sharply. Gascony?

                                    GAUDET
                    Your Majesty s servant Alexandre 
                      D Artagnan has been murdered.

                                    LOUIS
                      D Artagnan? The name is familiar.




                                                                                          30                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    CARDINAL
                      A prominent local landowner. 
                      Slaughtered in his own house by the 
                      Musketeer named Athos. 

      There is a stir of shock. Athos reacts with bewilderment. 

                                    ATHOS
                    It s a lie! 

                                    CARDINAL
                    Call Fournier! 

      FOURNIER, the only survivor of the farmhouse murders, is 
      escorted into the room. He looks haggard. The Cardinal 
      indicates that he should speak.

                                    FOURNIER
                    The Musketeers arrived just after 
                      dinner. They stabbed Alexandre in 
                    cold blood, then turned their 
                      pistols on us. The one called Athos 
                    said it was a warning to anyone who 
                      defied the King. 

      Athos listens in disbelief. Louis points at him.   

                                    LOUIS
                    Is this the man?

                                    FOURNIER
                    He was masked. But he is the same 
                      height and build... 

                                    CARDINAL
                          (To Athos)
                    Where were you on this day one week 
                    ago?

                                    ATHOS
                          (Pause)
                    In Gascony. 

      There are cries of shock and a buzz of conversation. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    What were you doing there?

      Athos looks at Treville, who shakes his head minutely.

                                    ATHOS
                    I m not at liberty to say. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    You refuse to answer? 

                                    ATHOS
                      I cannot.


                                                                                          31                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      Louis fidgets nervously, sliding anxious looks between the 
      Cardinal and Treville.

                                    CARDINAL
                    Athos must be confined to the 
                      Bastille until his guilt or 
                      innocence can be established.

      Treville looks at Louis, hoping for his support, but the King 
      is trapped and doesn t like it at all. After a nervous moment 
      he gestures sharply. 

                                    LOUIS
                    Yes, arrest him. And if he s guilty 
                    he ll be hanged. 

      The Red Guards grab hold of Athos and he is marched out in 
      stunned silence. As the doors close Louis jerks his head to 
      Treville who comes to his side. Lowering his voice so that no 
      one else can hear Louis hisses at him.

                                    LOUIS
                    Your man must say nothing of his 
                    true purpose in Gascony. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    But how can he defend himself?

                                    LOUIS
                    King Louis s good name is at stake! 
                    If Athos must die to preserve it, 
                    then so be it.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      TREVILLE finds the bewildered ARAMIS and PORTHOS. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    Go to Gascony. Find Cornet. Only he 
                    has the answer to this riddle.

                                    ARAMIS
                    What if he s back in Paris? He 
                      wouldn t be the first soldier to 
                    turn bandit. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    Leave Paris to me. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    Why can t Athos just say what he 
                    was doing?




                                                                                          32                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    TREVILLE
                            (Hesitates)
                    He is bound to secrecy by a sacred 
                    oath. And so am I. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    How do you expects us to solve the 
                      puzzle if you won t give us all the 
                      pieces?

      Treville looks at them, badly torn.

                                    TREVILLE
                          (Beat)
                    If you want to save Athos find out 
                    what happened to Cornet. Fast. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D ARTAGNAN sits by the fire, stripped to the waist. His chest 
      and side are purple with bruising. CONSTANCE wraps a fresh 
      bandage around him, an unavoidably intimate act. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    I was away selling livestock at 
                      market. If I d been home I might 
                    have saved my father s life. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Or died with him.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    He was a good man. A soldier. In a 
                    fair fight he was a match for 
                      anyone.  

      He pauses, overcome by emotion. Constance is touched.

                                    CONSTANCE
                    You loved him. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                          (Beat)
                      I came to Paris to kill this Athos 
                    who boasted of murdering him. But 
                    all I ve found are more questions. 
                      I have nothing.

      Constance winds the bandage tightly around his chest, both of 
      them conscious of her hands grazing his skin. They look into 
      each other s eyes, their faces a few inches apart.

                                    CONSTANCE
                      You re alive. That s something.



                                                                                          33                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      I can t rest. Not until I know the 
                      truth. 

                                    ARAMIS
                          (Off)
                      That s lucky, because rest is off 
                    the agenda. You re coming to 
                      Gascony with us.

      They look up to see PORTHOS and ARAMIS in the doorway. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Athos is in prison charged with 
                    your father s murder. He didn t do 
                    it. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    But another Musketeer went missing 
                    at the same time, in the same 
                      place. There must be a connection. 
                    If you want to know what it is, 
                      saddle up. We re leaving now.

      D Artagnan leaps to his feet, instantly unravelling all 
        Constance s intricate bandage work. He grabs his sword and 
      puts on his shirt. She looks at him in disbelief.

                                    CONSTANCE
                    This morning they tried to kill you 
                    and now you re best friends?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      I have to trust them. I have no 
                      choice. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Well, don t come crying to me if 
                    you wind up dead!

      He smiles, then hurries out. She sighs in exasperation and 
      tosses the ball of bandages into the fire. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ATHOS languishes deep within the bowels of the fearsome 
      Bastille prison, pacing the dingy room like a caged tiger. 

                                                                              CUT TO:







                                                                                          34                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12



      The CARDINAL gazes calmly from his window. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    Athos is held in the highest regard 
                    by his fellow Musketeers. His 
                      ignominious death will strike a 
                      deadly blow to their morale. You 
                    made an excellent choice.

      He turns from the window. MILADY sits at his desk, her limpid 
      beauty and serenity as seductive as they are deceptive.

                                    CARDINAL
                    But why him?

                                    MILADY
                      I have my reasons.

      She smiles but says nothing more. He shrugs. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    It s not important. He will be 
                      hanged as soon as the King can be 
                      persuaded it is in his own best 
                      interest.  

      Milady lays a packet of letters on his desk. 

                                    MILADY
                      Cornet s precious cargo with the 
                      King s own seal. 

      The Cardinal picks up the packet and gazes at it 
        thoughtfully. 

                                    CARDINAL
                      I have been the King s trusted 
                      advisor since he was barely more 
                    than a child. Now he wants to try 
                      politics for himself, free of my 
                      influence.

      He pauses and looks up at her.

                                    CARDINAL
                    It seems I have to remind him that 
                    all government is about compromise. 
                    He will be King and I will rule. 


                                                                                          35                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      He allows himself a smile then returns briskly to business.  

                                    CARDINAL
                    What of the Spanish spy, Renard?

                                    MILADY
                    When Cornet missed their rendezvous 
                    he rushed back to Paris with me. 
                    Sadly he met an unhappy end in a 
                      depressing little coaching inn. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    He would have been more useful 
                      alive. 

                                    MILADY
                    He was a bad lover and a terrible 
                    bore. He deserved to die for that 
                      alone. 

      The Cardinal gazes at her appreciatively. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    The more cruel you are, the more 
                      attractive I find you. What does 
                    that say about me, I wonder?

                                    MILADY
                    We are better friends than we would 
                    be lovers, Cardinal. Let s not 
                      confuse the issue. 

                                    CARDINAL
                      I could make you the most powerful 
                    woman in France. 

                                    MILADY
                      I have all the power I need.

                    Power I could remove in an instant. 

      She looks at him steadily. There is a heat between them, a 
      moment infused with sexuality, threat and tension. He opens a 
      drawer and takes out the pistol Aramis left at Adele s. He 
      points it at Milady and we see a flicker of doubt in her 
      eyes. But after a moment he puts the gun up and laughs, 
      placing it on the desk in front of her. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    Find out who owns this pistol. 
                      Return it to me when you have the 
                    name.  

      She picks up the gun as he glances at her mildly.

                    Don t forget who created you, 
                      Milady. After all, what were you 
                    when I found you?

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ARAMIS, PORTHOS and D ARTAGNAN stand with the INN KEEPER, a 
      rough and taciturn figure in his 40s. A few half-cut locals 
      stand watching the visitors from the bar. 

                                  INN KEEPER
                    The Musketeer Cornet? Yes he was 
                    here. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      You re sure?

                                  INN KEEPER
                      I never forget a man who runs out 
                    on his bill.

                                    ARAMIS
                    He didn t pay? Why not?

                                  INN KEEPER
                      Because of the fight. One minute 
                    he s talking quietly to his friend, 
                    the next they re at each other s 
                      throats. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    What happened then?

                                  INN KEEPER
                      I told them to take it outside.

                                    PORTHOS
                    Was this other man a Musketeer as 
                    well? 

                                  INN KEEPER
                          (Shakes his head)
                      Different uniform. Red markings.

                                    PORTHOS
                    You didn t catch his name? 

                                  INN KEEPER
                      I heard Cornet shouting at him. 
                    Began with a  D . Dejean, 
                      Dajarnatte, something like that. 

      Porthos looks up in sudden shock. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      Dujon?

                                  INN KEEPER
                      That s it. Dujon.

                          (To Porthos)
                    Do you know him?

      A dark look comes across Porthos s face. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    We ve played cards together once or 
                      twice. Bad loser. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ATHOS lies on the narrow wooden bed in the corner of his 
      filthy cell. His eyes are open and faraway. We GO IN CLOSE on 
      his face and -

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ATHOS lies on his straw pallet, lost in the torture of his 
      memories. Perhaps he is also thinking that the same fate now 
      lies in store for him...

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The CARDINAL looks up mildly as LOUIS crashes into his 
      apartments and dismisses the SERVANTS with a petulant wave. 
      There is a silence. Louis is deeply uncomfortable but the 
      Cardinal is content to wait, letting him make the first move. 

                                    LOUIS
                            (Finally)
                      I wrote some letters to my cousin.

                                    CARDINAL
                    Your Majesty has so many cousins...

                                    LOUIS
                    The King of Spain. 

      The Cardinal looks convincingly surprised.

                                    LOUIS
                      I proposed a peace treaty to him. 
                    It was to be our secret, for now. 
                    The trouble is the letters have 
                    gone missing. If they fell into the 
                    wrong hands... it could be 
                      embarrassing. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    How so?

                                    LOUIS
                      I proposed that France and Spain 
                      should form an alliance against the 
                    Holy Roman Emperor. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    The same Holy Roman Emperor who is 
                      currently our staunchest ally?


                                                                                          42                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    LOUIS
                    Is there another one?

      He smiles hopefully but the Cardinal only looks back gravely.

                                    CARDINAL
                    These proposals could engulf all 
                      Europe in a new war. (Pause) If 
                    Your Majesty isn t satisfied with 
                    my advice, I shall have to resign. 

                                    LOUIS
                            (Horrified)
                    Let s not be hasty...

                                    CARDINAL
                    This undermines years of careful 
                      foreign policy... my position has 
                    been fatally damaged... I can t 
                      possibly remain in office...

                                    LOUIS
                          (Panic)
                    I ll give you anything you want. 
                    Just get me out of this mess. 

      The Cardinal looks at him doubtfully. Louis struggles with a 
      mixture of pride, anger and humiliation.

                                    LOUIS
                      I need you. France needs you. Just 
                    tell me what to do to make you 
                    stay. 

                                    CARDINAL
                          (Long pause)
                    The Musketeer Athos...

                                    LOUIS
                    Gone. I ll have him hanged in the 
                      morning. I ll disband the whole 
                    damn regiment if that s what it 
                      takes. 

                                    CARDINAL
                      Well... in due course perhaps. 

      Louis looks startled at this but can t exactly take it back. 

                                    LOUIS
                    Then you ll stay? No more talk of 
                      resigning?

                                    CARDINAL
                          (Beat)
                    I am Your Majesty s humble servant. 

      Louis s relief is intense.


                                                                                          43                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    LOUIS
                    You won t regret it. I ll never do 
                      anything again without talking to 
                    you first.

      His humiliation is total but the Cardinal is too smart to 
      gloat. Instead he simply bows humbly. Louis goes out with a 
      spring in his step. As his door closes, the Cardinal opens a 
      drawer of his vast desk. He takes out the king s bundle of 
      letters, allowing himself a smile of satisfaction.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      A few hardened DRINKERS sit around the room. It is a rough 
      dive with a low counter and shelves full of dusty bottles. As 
      PORTHOS walks in, the room falls silent. He looks around. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      I hate it when that happens.

      He walks slowly to the counter. The hostility is tangible. 
      The OWNER gazes at him, stone-faced. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    Nice crowd. Very chatty. 

                                    OWNER
                    We don t get many of your type in 
                    here. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      Musketeers, you mean? 

      He doesn t. He means black, and Porthos knows it.

                                    PORTHOS
                      A glass of your best wine. 

      The OWNER reaches for a dirty glass, spits in it, wipes it 
      with a rag, then bangs it down and fills it with nearly black 
      liquid. Porthos sniffs the wine delicately.

                                    PORTHOS
                    I ve smelled vinegars with a softer 
                      bouquet.

      He takes a swig and winces, but then finishes the glass.

                                    PORTHOS
                      Utterly repulsive but there s 
                      something about it I like. (Pause) 
                    I m looking for Dujon. 

                                    OWNER
                    Never heard of him. 


                                                                                          44                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      CHANGE ANGLE to a seat on the other side of the room. Hidden 
      from view is the Red Guard DUJON, Porthos s old opponent. He 
      draws his sword and gets up silently. PORTHOS has his back to 
      him and seems oblivious to the threat. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    I was told he drinks here. 

                                    OWNER
                    You were told wrong. 

      Dujon creeps up behind Porthos until he is almost on him - 
      and then, in one fluent, brutal motion PORTHOS rams back his 
      elbow into his face and crashes his head against the bar, 
      knocking him cold. As he slides to the floor, Porthos looks 
      down at the unconscious body. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    Would you believe it? Here he is. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The Musketeers enter an old warehouse. DUJON walks ahead of 
      them. We expect an ambush at every step but as they turn the 
      corner into the main chamber, there is no one there. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    Where is he, then?

      Dujon points to a room at the end of the hall. D Artagnan and 
      Porthos advance cautiously while Aramis keeps a dagger at 
      Dujon s throat. They glance at each other then take up a 
      position at each side of the door. Porthos nods silently, 
      then kicks open the door and rushes in, his pistol raised. 
        Immediately he stops, reeling back. 



                                                                                          45                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      We catch a glimpse of a body on the floor in blood-stained 
        underclothes. Dujon sneers at them.

                                    DUJON
                    You said you wanted to see him. 

      Aramis pushes his dagger into Dujon s throat, drawing blood. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    What happened? 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      CORNET and DUJON sit at a corner table, their conversation 
      animated and volatile. 

                                    DUJON
                          (Over)
                    We bribed Cornet to betray his 
                      mission and sell out his men. He 
                    left them and rode on ahead and we 
                    just sat and waited for them to 
                    ride past. They weren t expecting a 
                      thing. It was easy. 

      Cornet hands over the pouches containing the vital letters. 
      Dujon takes them out to check, then throws a purse in 
      Cornet s direction. We see Cornet ask a question and then 
      look up in shock at Dujon s answer. 

                                    DUJON
                    We told him his men wouldn t be 
                      harmed. Maybe he actually believed 
                    that. I don t know. Either way, 
                    when we told him his men were dead, 
                    he took it badly. 

      Cornet hurls himself across the table, dragging Dujon to the 
      floor. As the two men roll and punch at each other the INN 
      KEEPER hurries across to separate them -

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:



      ARAMIS, D ARTAGNAN and PORTHOS listen as DUJON finishes. 

                                    DUJON
                    He could have crossed the border to 
                    Spain and disappeared with his 
                    blood money. But he couldn t live 
                    with what he d done. He wanted to 
                    go to Treville. So I brought him 
                    back to Paris and held him here. 


                                                                                          46                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    PORTHOS
                    And then murdered him. 

                                    DUJON
                    I was just following orders.

                                    PORTHOS
                    Whose orders? 

      Dujon only looks at him contemptuously. Porthos grabs him 
      savagely and crashes him back against the wall. 

                                    PORTHOS
                    You murdering bastard. I ll see you 
                    hang for this. 

      Dujon grins, cocky and defiant. 

                                    DUJON
                    Go on, then. Arrest me. It ll never 
                    even get to trial. The Cardinal 
                    looks after his own.  

                                    PORTHOS
                    Who said anything about a trial?

      A flicker of doubt registers in Dujon s eyes as Aramis sees a 
      rope lying on a crate, picks it up and throws it over a beam. 

                                    DUJON
                    You can t... that s murder...

                                    PORTHOS
                      I won t tell if you won t.

      He manhandles the now terrified Dujon towards the rope where 
      Aramis is briskly tying a noose. They force his head into it 
      and tighten the knot. Porthos goes to the other end of the 
      rope and grabs it with both hands.

                                    DUJON
                    No... wait...

      Even D Artagnan is shocked. He looks at Aramis and Porthos 
      but their faces are hard and determined. Porthos yanks on the 
      rope and Dujon s feet lift onto tip-toe. He screams in 
      terror. 

                                    DUJON
                      Wait... wait... I ll tell you 
                      everything... 

      Porthos pauses and looks at Aramis, who nods. Porthos relaxes 
      the rope minutely as Dujon babbles out his confession. 

                                    DUJON
                    My orders came from Captain Gaudet. 



                                                                                          47                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      Porthos yanks on the rope so that Dujon s toes are scrabbling 
      at the floor again as the noose tightens around his neck.

                                    ARAMIS
                    What else do you know? 

                                    DUJON
                            (Screams)
                    The Queen intends to visit her 
                      cousin tonight. Gaudet will kidnap 
                    and rob her. The King s fury at the 
                      insult to his wife will ensure the 
                      Musketeer regiment is disbanded.

      His breath comes in rasping sobs. Porthos finally lets go of 
      the rope and he falls to his knees, all his arrogance utterly 
      gone. D Artagnan kneels at his side. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Did you kill Alexandre D Artagnan? 

                                    DUJON
                          (Pause)
                      I wasn t there. It was Gaudet.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Why did he die? 

                                    DUJON
                    They said he was a traitor. That s 
                    all I know.

      D Artagnan shoves him aside as Porthos grabs his hands 
      roughly and binds them behind him. 

      D Artagnan moves to one side with Aramis, looking at him 
      dubiously.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Were you really going to hang him?

                                    ARAMIS
                    You think we re savages?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      I don t know yet.

                                    ARAMIS
                    He thought we were. That s what 
                      matters.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      That s not what I asked.

      Aramis looks at him, considering the question carefully. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Who knows?


                                                                                          48                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      We feel he is not even sure himself. Charming and urbane as 
      he may be, we see the potential for brutality in him - as it 
      is, perhaps, in all of them.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      PORTHOS, D ARTAGNAN and ARAMIS talk urgently with TREVILLE. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    We must warn the Queen. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      Saving her won t get Athos out of 
                      prison. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Then we ll make Gaudet confess. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    It s his word against Dujon s. 
                      Without his confession we have no 
                      proof.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                          (Pause)
                    Can you arrange a private audience 
                    with the Queen? I have a plan. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    What plan? 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    One that ends either in triumph or 
                    with our heads on the block. 

      The others all look at each other. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      I like his style. 

                                    TREVILLE
                      I like my head. He s not even a 
                      Musketeer. All right. What is this 
                      wonderful plan?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    We let the attack on the Queen go 
                      ahead.

                                    TREVILLE
                          (Dry)
                      Hopefully it gets better as it goes 
                      along.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      The QUEEN gazes at PORTHOS, ARAMIS and TREVILLE. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    This is a conspiracy against the 
                      honour of the Musketeers. A threat 
                    to the regiment s very existence. 
                    But we can t prove it without Your 
                      Majesty s help. If you truly 
                      believe me to be the King s loyal 
                      servant, I beg you to help us.

      ANNE looks at them, her decision hanging in the balance...

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ADELE BESSETTE is with ARAMIS. She looks at him in panic. 

                                    ADELE
                      I can t do it. I daren t.

                                    ARAMIS
                      Adele, we need you. Ineed you. 
                    Don t worry. You ll be quite safe. 

                                    ADELE
                    You don t understand. The Cardinal 
                    knows about us. (Pause) Your 
                      pistol. You dropped it when you 
                    left. If he found it, he knows. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Has he said anything?

      She shakes her head. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Then probably one of the servants 
                    took it and sold it.  

                                    ADELE
                    He knows everything, Aramis. He 
                    sees into my heart. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    The Cardinal s not God, Adele, 
                      whatever he might think. 

      ADELE looks at him, her resolve weakening. He smiles in 
        reassurance.

                                    ARAMIS
                      I love you. I ll never let anything 
                      happen to you.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      An excited court has assembled to hear GAUDET S testimony. 
      LOUIS sits with ANNE at his side. A bewildered ATHOS, still 
      under guard, stands nearby. TREVILLE, ARAMIS, PORTHOS and 
      D ARTAGNAN are amongst the crowd. 

                                    LOUIS
                          (To Gaudet)
                    There is some deep conspiracy here. 
                    Speak the truth and you might yet 
                    save yourself. Who ordered you to 
                      commit these heinous crimes?

      GAUDET glances at the CARDINAL, whose manner is superbly 
      calm. 

                                    GAUDET
                            (Finally)
                      I acted on my own initiative. The 
                      Musketeers humiliated my men and 
                      received no punishment for it. I 
                      thought I could discredit them in 
                    Your Majesty s eyes. 

                                    LOUIS
                    Why did you impersonate Athos? 

                                    GAUDET
                    If a great man like him was thought 
                    to be a criminal, the Musketeers  
                      disgrace would be that much 
                      greater. 

      ANNE leans forward, clearly not convinced.





                                                                                          53                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    ANNE
                      I think you are lying, Captain. I 
                      believe you were acting under 
                      instruction.  

                                    GAUDET
                    I am facing death. I have no more 
                      reason to lie. My actions were for 
                    the good of France. 

      LOUIS leaps to his feet in fury. 

                                    LOUIS
                      I amFrance! How dare you tell me 
                    what is good for me! 

                                    ANNE
                          (Beat)
                    Why did you murder Alexandre 
                      d Artagnan?

      In the crowd D Artagnan leans forward in anticipation.

                                    GAUDET
                      I heard the Cardinal call him a 
                      traitor. I thought it was my duty 
                    to kill him.

                                    LOUIS
                    Yet you still say the Cardinal knew 
                      nothing of any of this?

      Gaudet pauses, then shakes his head. In the crowd d Artagnan
      is white with anger. The Cardinal, impassive up to now, 
      suddenly stands up in a convincing fury.

                                    CARDINAL
                    Take him away immediately and break 
                    every bone in his body. Let all 
                    Paris watch his execution.

      Gaudet pales but marches away proudly under guard. Louis 
      gestures to Athos to come forward. 

                                    LOUIS
                    You are a free man, Athos. 
                      Personally I always thought you 
                    were innocent.

      Louis turns to Treville with a friendly smile. 

                                    LOUIS
                    Good work, Treville. Your men have 
                    done France an invaluable service. 
                      (Pause) Haven t they, Cardinal?

      The Cardinal forces a smile. 



                                                                                          54                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    CARDINAL
                      Invaluable. 

      Louis claps Treville on the back and walks out, followed by 
      the court. The Musketeers rush to greet their friend. He 
      shakes hands with all of them, and Treville in particular. 

                                    ATHOS
                    I owe you my life. 

                                    TREVILLE
                      D Artagnan deserves the credit. 

      Athos smiles at d Artagnan.

                                    ATHOS
                    You come to Paris to kill me and 
                    end up saving my life. After a few 
                      drinks I m sure I ll appreciate the 
                      irony.

      D Artagnan smiles but stares bitterly at the Cardinal. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Does anyone seriously believe 
                      Gaudet would act without his 
                      master s blessing?

                                    TREVILLE
                    Let it go, d Artagnan. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    The Cardinal killed my father. He 
                      deserves to die. 

                                    TREVILLE
                    You have no proof. And even if you 
                    did, a strike against the Cardinal 
                    is a strike against the King. 
                      There s nothing you can do.

      While this is taking place we see a sudden glimpse of MILADY. 
      She watches ATHOS with a bitter intensity so fierce it burns. 
      He senses her gaze on him and looks up but in the same moment 
      she melts into the crowd and he thinks nothing of it.  

                                                                              CUT TO:



      As the CARDINAL walks away he finds himself confronted by a 
      gleeful LOUIS, who has ANNE at his side. 

                                    LOUIS
                    It seems you can t even control 
                    your own men, Cardinal. 



                                                                                          55                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      The Cardinal only smiles stiffly in response. 

                                    LOUIS
                    You must be careful. Any more 
                      incidents like this and I might 
                    think I can manage without you 
                    after all.

      He laughs and the Cardinal is forced to enjoy the  joke . But 
      as the King turns away we see the fury in his eyes. The 
      balance of power is even again, at least for now.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      GAUDET sits in his cell - the same one previously occupied by 
      Athos. He looks up as the CARDINAL comes in.

                                    CARDINAL
                    I m grateful for your loyalty. 

                                    GAUDET
                    I am just a soldier. There are many 
                    more like me. But none like 
                      Cardinal Richelieu. France needs 
                    you. The King needs you. 

      The Cardinal inclines his head in thanks.

                                    GAUDET
                    If I had revealed it was you who 
                    stole the King s letters, your hand 
                      behind the whole plot, the country 
                    would have been plunged into chaos. 
                      Better I should die than you should 
                    fall. (Pause, hopefully) Unless 
                      perhaps, you can still save me?

                                    CARDINAL
                    Sadly not. But I ll see your family 
                    well provided for. 

      GAUDET swallows hard but tries to take the news calmly.

                                    GAUDET
                    To be broken on the wheel. Every 
                    limb smashed to pieces. It s an 
                      agonising death. 

      The Cardinal looks at him thoughtfully.

                                    CARDINAL
                    Why did you kill Alexandre 
                      D Artagnan? That wasn t part of 
                    your orders. 



                                                                                          56                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    GAUDET
                      I heard you curse him when you read 
                    his letters. I thought you d be 
                      pleased if I disposed of him for 
                    you. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    He was an irritation, not a 
                      traitor. But I appreciate the 
                      sentiment. 

      He reaches into his pocket and brings out a small bottle. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    A few drops of this and you will be 
                    dead within seconds. I m told the 
                      process is relatively painless. 

      He places the bottle on the table then offers his hand for 
      Gaudet to kiss. Gaudet sinks to his knees.

                                    GAUDET
                    Long live the King!

                                    CARDINAL
                      Indeed.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      TREVILLE stands behind his desk with ATHOS, PORTHOS and 
      ARAMIS. He looks at d Artagnan.

                                    TREVILLE
                    What will you do now?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Go home. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      You re not a farmer. You re a 
                      soldier. Anyone can see that.

                                    ATHOS
                    And face it. There s nothing there 
                    for you anymore.

                                    ARAMIS
                    So why not stay with us?

                                    TREVILLE
                      Report for duty tomorrow and we ll 
                    take a look at you.

      D ARTAGNAN thinks about it, then offers TREVILLE his hand. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D ARTAGNAN walks out with ATHOS, PORTHOS and ARAMIS.

                                    ATHOS
                    Join us for dinner tomorrow. My 
                    rooms at eight. Do you need 
                      somewhere to stay? 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      I have a place. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    In the arms of Madame Bonacieux. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    She s a married woman. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    You really are from Gascony, aren t 
                    you?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    And besides, there s someone else.

                                    PORTHOS
                      A sweetheart?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Not exactly. A woman I ve only met 
                    once. The most beautiful I ve ever 
                    seen. We have unfinished business.

                                    ATHOS
                    She sounds lively.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    You have no idea.

      He grins and holds out his hand to them all. One by one they 
      add their hands until they are all intertwined.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    All for one...

      They all stare back at him blankly. He shrugs. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    I m still trying to decide how the 
                    rest of it goes.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      The CARDINAL sits inside with ADELE opposite him. She smiles. 

                                    ADELE
                    Where are we going? Is it a 
                      surprise?

                                    CARDINAL
                      I would imagine so. 

                                    ADELE
                      A picnic?

      He smiles knowingly. ADELE laughs and kisses him. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The carriage door opens and ADELE gets out but the CARDINAL 
      remains behind. Instead of a picnic, there are two RED GUARDS 
      waiting for her. ADELE looks at their grim expressions and a 
      sudden dread falls over her. She looks back at the CARDINAL. 

                                    ADELE
                      What s this? 

                                    CARDINAL
                    Your surprise, my love. 

      One of the Guards draws a gun from his belt. Adele sees it is 
      Aramis s pistol. She turns back to the Cardinal in terror. 

                                    ADELE
                    My God. You re going to kill me. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    An ugly necessity. You re a traitor 
                    and a spy and I can t trust you. 
                    You give me no option.  

      She runs to him desperately but the GUARD holds her back. 

                                    ADELE
                    Have you no mercy?

                                    CARDINAL
                    Mercy belongs to God, not man. 


                                                                                          59                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    ADELE
                    You pious hypocrite! You ll burn in 
                    hell. 

                                    CARDINAL
                      Perhaps. But I have work to do here 
                      first. The Devil may have his share 
                    of me later. 

      He nods to the Guard, who drags Adele away. She shouts back 
      at him, terrified but defiant. 

                                    ADELE
                      I love Aramis. I ll love him with 
                    my last breath. 

      We see anger ripple across the Cardinal s studiously benign 
        expression. He nods sharply to the Guard, then closes the 
      door of the carriage. He picks up some papers and begins to 
      study them.

      We hear a scuffle and a scream. A second later there is the 
      loud explosion of the pistol, followed by a terrible silence. 

      A beat, then there is a knock on the carriage door. The 
      Cardinal opens it and the Guard offers him the pistol. The 
      barrel is still warm and smoking. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ATHOS sits on his bed. He stares at a cameo brooch in his 
      hand. He opens it and inside are two matching miniature 
      portraits. One is of himself, smiling and dignified, dressed 
      in fine clothes. The other is of MILADY. She too smiles. 
      ATHOS stares at the pictures, lost in his thoughts.

                                                                              CUT TO:
