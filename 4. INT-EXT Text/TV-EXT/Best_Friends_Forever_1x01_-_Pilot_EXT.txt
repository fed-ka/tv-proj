                    Bye, babe! Be back in an hour.

      Jess and Len leave the apartment and shut the door.

                                  LENNON (CONT D)
                    You re sure Lazy Sunday s not gonna 
                    be too much for you?

                                    JESSICA
                    No, it ll be good for me to have 
                    something to focus on other than 
                    the shattered pieces of my life.

                                  LENNON
                    Oh shit, I forgot the recipe...

                                    JESSICA
                    It s on the counter. I ll get it.

                                  JOE
                    AHHH!

      He freezes and covers his junk with his hands. Jess walks 
      awkwardly past him.

                                    JESSICA
                    We were gone five seconds.

                    I m sorry, should I be partaking in 
                    the Steel Magnolias marathon? I m 
                    not interested in watching Sally 
                    Field deliver a bunch of jokes.

                                  RAV
                    It s not a comedy, man! It s about 
                    the fragility of life and the bonds 
                    that hold us all together.

                                  JOE

      Jess and Rav sit on a bench outside.

                                    JESSICA
                    Well, I always said that Joe was a 
                    ticking time bomb.

                                  RAV
                    Who did you say that to?

                                    JESSICA
                    Myself. Nobody listens to me.

                                  RAV
                    What are you doing? He s obviously 
                    right for her.

                                    JESSICA
                    He may well be right for her, but 
                    it s just not the right time!

                                  RAV
                    Why? Because on top of everything 
                    you ve lost, you re afraid you re 
                    gonna lose your best friend too?

                                    JESSICA
                    No!

      (A beat. And Jess bursts into tears)

                                  RAV
                    Okay, there we go.
                          (rubbing her back)
                    You guys are way too far up each 
                    other s butts for that to happen. 
                    And you have other people here for 
                    you besides Len, you know.

                                    JESSICA
                    Like who?

                                  RAV
                    Get off my bench.

                                    JESSICA
                    I have you, I get it.

      Len is crafting homemade Scoops out of a batter, Jess is 
      blowing up the Jets chair and Queenetta is boiling wieners.

                                  LENNON
                    Q, pick up the pace on the wieners. 
                    Jess, ETA on the Jets chair?

      Jess can t answer, she s out of breath. Joe walks in.

                                  JOE
                    Are you guys making my Monster 
                    chili? And are these Scoops?

      He picks up one from the muffin tin and it falls apart.

                    Joe, I m sorry. I just got carried 
                    away with taking care of Jess and I 
                    forgot all about our stuff.

                                  JOE
                    I don t want you to stop taking 
                    care of people. That s what you do 
                    best. I just have to get used to 
                    it, cause I don t have anyone like 
                    that. Except you.

      From the corner, Jess wheezes. She s finished the chair.

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    You know we have a pump for that.
