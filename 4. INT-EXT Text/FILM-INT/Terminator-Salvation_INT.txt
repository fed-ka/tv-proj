DEATH ROW/CELL - DAWN
START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man,
20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a
resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST:
PRIEST
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear
no evil: for thou art beside me; thy
rod and thy staff they comfort me...
CAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot,
staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This
OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding
chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING
MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand.
MARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of
SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks
and shuts his bible.
One of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for--
DR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant,
attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head.
She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her
some privacy with Marcus.
SERENA
Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm
with Project Angel. You consented to
donate your body to science...
(CONTINUED)
2.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS
Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.
SERENA
You've been chosen for our research.
MARCUS
Chosen?
Lucky me.
SERENA
We just need a couple of signatures...
Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he
notes that her hands are SHAKING.
MARCUS
You don't need to be scared.
SERENA
I'm not.
It's nerve degeneration.
MARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering
her sparse hair.
MARCUS
Cancer?
SERENA
(NODS)
You're not the only one with a
death sentence.
MARCUS meets her eyes.
She studies him a beat.
SERENA (cont'd)
What you're doing is important,
Marcus. Our work is still highly
experimental... but you may be
helping people in ways you can't
begin to imagine.
MARCUS
I'm a regular hero.
With that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the
words "PROJECT ANGEL" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form.
SERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise.
She touches his
hand for a moment.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED: (2)
SERENA
Thank you.
And... I'm sorry.
MARCUS
No one lives forever.
THE GUARD sees SERENA out.
DEATH ROW/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
LOW ANGLE - MARCUS' CHAINED ANKLES clank as the GUARDS lead
him down the corridor, past PRISONERS in their cells; some
avert their eyes, others give a nod or raise a fist.
PRIEST (V.O.)
Marcus, this is your last
opportunity to make a confession...
MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths,
struggling not to succumb to fear.
PRIEST (V.O.) (cont'd)
Is there nothing you would say to
Officer Martinez' family?
DEATH ROW/EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT
CLOSE - BUCKLES TIGHTEN... AN ALCOHOL SWAB on MARCUS'
FOREARM... A NEEDLE punctures his skin.
MARCUS (V.O.)
What can I say. I was seventeen, I
was angry, I was stupid.
FINGERS turn the VALVE to release the LETHAL CHEMICALS.
CLOSE ON MARCUS' EYES, looking up toward--
THE DEADLY I.V., running into his arm.
From this, he looks toward--
HIS REFLECTION in a one-way mirror, the dim shapes of
WITNESSES beyond.
(CONTINUED)
4.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
Yeah... I'm sorry about it. I'm
sorry about everything. The whole
goddamn world...
As the lethal injection takes hold, his POV moves to BRIGHT
LIGHTS overhead, losing FOCUS and BLEACHING TO WHITE...
From the WHITE SCREEN, a FACE emerges, backlit, blurred--
it's SERENA. She's in focus for just a moment, leaning INTO
CAMERA-- then moves OUT OF FRAME.
CUT TO BLACK.
SUPER ON BLACK:
SOUTH-CENTRAL SECTOR, NORTH AMERICA, 2018
A-10 COCKPIT - DUSK
A COMPUTER TARGETING SCREEN - the FIGURES are HIGHLIGHTED in
this tactical display, as is an OCTAGONAL HATCH into the
ground beneath the corn.
UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
COLLAPSED CEILINGS, FLAMES, a high-tech installation in
ruins; RED LIGHTING, distinctive of Skynet environments.
SOLDIERS flick on HELMET LAMPS and make their way carefully
inside-- pretty deserted. They kick aside rubble to enter--
UNDERGROUND FACILITY/ROBOTIC ROOM - NIGHT
HELMET BEAMS play over BANKS OF ELECTRONICS and--
--a dozen fixed, INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS-- not remotely HUMANOID--
engaged in mysterious tasks, mechanical arms at work.
THE SOLDIERS rake the room with GUNFIRE-- MACHINERY
collapses, SPARKS from EXPLODING CIRCUITRY.
UNDERGROUND FACILITY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Deeper into the complex, A HEAVY DOOR BLOWS off its hinges.

CONTINUED:
TEAM LEADER
Clear!
SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES run into DOZENS OF GLASS
CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK LIQUID. The SOLDIERS
make their way in, alert-- but nothing's moving in here.
THE TEAM LEADER peers into a cylinder, aims his HEADLAMP at--
--A small MASS OF TISSUE floating inside, connected to a
dense network of FIBER-OPTIC CABLES... it's a HUMAN BRAIN.
TEAM LEADER
Oh God.
THE TEAM LEADER recoils-- but before he can say more, the
ROOM SHAKES with a DEAFENING ROAR.
UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
THE TEAM LEADER speaks into his headset. The OTHER SOLDIERS
inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.
TEAM LEADER
You will not believe the shit we
found down here--
As he speaks, CAMERA FINDS a GREEN LED on the ceiling-- which
suddenly FLASHES RED and BLINKS RAPIDLY--
CHOPPER - NIGHT
A PANICKED PILOT on the radio:
PILOT
--repeat, that was not us! A ship
escaped, they musta blown the place
themselves! Jesus, a lot of our
guys were still down there...
RUINED CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and
rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled
on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for
illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a
RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good.
RUINED BAR - NIGHT
Partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken
stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now,
again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the
broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with--
A DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY.
MARCUS
Hallelujah.
He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the
floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES,
instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.
CUT TO BLACK.
MEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs,
blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR.
--WEBS of TUBES and FIBER-OPTICS FILLS THE FRAME.
--GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA.
--DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves
INTO FRAME, a look of concentration on her face as she peers
through the LIQUID, INTO CAMERA. She starts to smile.
DISSOLVE TO:
FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY
--drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a
taco place, remnants of Mexican decor.
THROUGH A DIRTY WINDOW, they see the AEROSTAT buzz past,
flying its pattern. It moves on without spotting them, then
takes off in a new direction.
KYLE and STAR set to searching the place, something they've
done many times. They go through trash cans, check behind
the counters and in the kitchen. MARCUS gets up, still
looking out the windows.
MARCUS
That flying grapefruit, what was it?
KYLE
Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes.
They patrol places like this,
looking for survivors.
STAR
Yes!
She's come up with some UNOPENED PACKETS OF CONDIMENTS from a
bag of TRASH. KYLE trots over.
KYLE
Any red ones?
She nods excitedly, hands him a packet.
He tears it open,
sucks down the contents eagerly.
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
KYLE (cont'd)
Mm.
Ketchup.
STAR discards one packet, sucks at another-- and immediately
makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside.
STAR
Yuk!
MARCUS picks up the packet, looks at it.
MARCUS
Jalapeo sauce.
STAR and KYLE pause in their eating, stare at him.
STAR
You can read.
MARCUS shrugs modestly.
KYLE
So can I.
(off Star's look)
Well, sort of... a little.
With obvious reluctance, STAR holds a packet of mustard
toward Marcus.
STAR
Want some?
Marcus gallantly waves it away.
MARCUS
No thanks.
Not hungry.
KYLE
Never heard anyone say that before.
CUT TO:
ABANDONED MOTEL ROOM - DAY
ANGLE IN MIRROR - MARCUS stares at his own reflection in a
cracked MIRROR.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS
I look the same.
STAR closes tattered curtains, plops on the bare bed, ready
for sleep. The room's a mess, GRAFFITI here and there, trash
scattered about; they're not the first squatters who've been
here. THE GUNS and STAR'S WATCH lie on a dresser.
KYLE sits before the TV-- he's scratching STICK FIGURES onto
the screen with a rusted POCKETKNIFE. One is clearly meant
to be him; the smaller one, wearing a baseball cap, is Star.
KYLE
You ever watch television?
MARCUS
Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had
to look forward to in the joint.
STAR
(YAWNING)
What's a joint?
MARCUS
(BLINKS)
Prison. Spent half my life there.
KYLE
I remember TV a little.
Cartoons.
It was great.
KYLE plops on the bed next to STAR, who's already out.
MARCUS studies them.
MARCUS
She your sister?
KYLE
Dunno. Been together since we was
little. Bunch of us kids was at
the day-care center when the bombs
fell... she and me are the only
ones still around.
MARCUS
(disturbed; gestures around)
So this is it? Your life?
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED: (2)
KYLE
We're gonna find the Resistance, fight
for John Connor against Skynet. You
oughta join us, you're pretty cool.
MARCUS
You don't know me.
KYLE
You're strong, you can read... you
didn't kill us. Good enough for me...
MARCUS
Skynet runs the machines...?
So
who's this John Connor?
KYLE
He's... I don't know. The best.
Everybody talks about him. He's
the one who's gonna save us.
MARCUS
Yeah, right. Him and Jesus.
KYLE
Who's Jesus?
MARCUS
You're asking the wrong guy.
KYLE
(closing his eyes)
So why were you in prison?
MARCUS
(a long beat)
I killed a cop.
KYLE
Were cops like terminators?
MARCUS
Well... Nah, some of `em were all right.
(SIGHS)
My little brother Max, pretty wild
kid, not much older than you-- he
stole a car, just joy-riding,
y'know, showing off.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED: (3)
MARCUS (cont'd)
Cop chased him right into our front
yard, pulled him outta the car...
and started whaling on him, kicking
the shit out of him. No reason for
it, Max was already in cuffs. I ran
out of the house, guy tried to pull
his gun on me-- guess I just went
off on him. Don't even remember it
really... they say I broke his neck.
(BEAT)
Max must be dead too, now... like
everybody else.
MARCUS notices now that Kyle is asleep-- it's as if he's
lulled him with a bedtime story. Marcus is oddly touched,
pulls a cover over both the kids. KYLE starts, half-asleep--
KYLE
You gonna be here when I wake up?
MARCUS
Sure.
KYLE
Good.
Stay away from the windows.
So saying, KYLE falls back asleep. MARCUS sighs, moves
through the room, quietly opens a drawer or two and finds--
A BIBLE.
MOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
AFTERNOON LIGHT, MARCUS sits on the floor by a room door,
shotgun leaned on the wall at his side. He has the bible
open in his lap, head bowed over it. CLOSER-- his eyes are
closed, he's asleep.
THE DOOR OPENS behind him, STAR peers out-- and looks
relieved to see Marcus is still with them. As she takes a
step toward him, he starts awake.
STAR
Just me.
MARCUS relaxes, she sits down beside him.
(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:
STAR (cont'd)
Whatcha reading?
MARCUS
The bible. My grandma always tried
to get me into it, but-- it always
put me to sleep.
(BEAT)
Still does.
STAR
Would you read something to me?
MARCUS shrugs and nods, flips to a random page, squints at
the text.
MARCUS
"...of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat
the son of Hori. Of the tribe of
Judah, Caleb the son Jephunneh--"
STAR
There's a book inside with pictures.
She's already on her feet.
CLOSE - A PHONEBOOK, minutes later.
We hear MARCUS reading:
MARCUS
"Guaranteed lowest prices... open
seven days..."
STAR sits at his side, looking over his shoulder as he turns
pages. She points to something:
STAR
What's that?
MARCUS
It's a flower. A rose.
STAR
(full of wonder)
So... all those numbers... you
could call them and get, like,
flowers, or someone to come over
and fix stuff, or bring you food...
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED: (2)
MARCUS
(nods, touched)
Guess people had it pretty good.
(FLIPS)
What else we got... movers,
mufflers, music--
STAR
Music?
MARCUS
You know, pianos, guitars...
STAR
I don't remember music.
MARCUS
Come on. You must...
(approximating the tune)
"I can't get no... satisfaction..."
(off her blank look)
"We are family... I got all my sisters
with me..." No, huh. How about...
"Twinkle twinkle little star..."
Star's face lights up, she nods eagerly, sings along:
MARCUS & STAR
"How I wonder what you are... up
above the world so high, like a
diamond in the sky..."
STAR is dizzy with emotion, wipes an eye, turning away.
MARCUS
You OK?
STAR
(shakes her head)
Somebody used to sing that to me.
MARCUS puts the phonebook aside, puts a hand on her arm; and
she leans into him for a hug, tears forming in her eyes.
STAR (cont'd)
Stay with us, Marcus. Please.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED: (3)
MARCUS looks down at her, affected.
DISSOLVE TO:
SERVICE STATION - DAWN
KYLE and STAR slither under a partially open GARAGE DOOR.
The space is dark, SMOKE-FILLED... STRIPS OF DRIED MEAT hang
from the hydraulic lift. The two youths look amazed and
delighted. Kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to
the closest strip and PEELS OFF A PIECE, takes a tentative
bite, then gnaws ravenously. Star leans the shotgun against
the wall and follows suit.
MARCUS lifts the garage door and enters, DAWN LIGHT streaming
in behind him.
MARCUS
What is this?
KYLE
(mouth full)
Who cares?
Marcus squints at something in the darkness.
He takes a step
forward, then grabs Star's arm.
MARCUS
Spit it out!
STAR
(CHEWING)
It's good!
Now KYLE reacts to what Marcus saw, GAGS and SPITS out meat.
He's staring at--
--a dried, severed HUMAN HAND, resting on a GRILLE in the
sunken SERVICE PIT, where a CHARCOAL FIRE smolders.
Star sees it too, turns and RETCHES, just as--
--three animal-like CANNIBALS emerge from the back of the
garage-- two burly, ugly, unshaven MEN and a wild-eyed,
unhealthy-looking WOMAN with matted hair. We'll call them
PIG, BULL and COW. PIG grabs the SHOTGUN, BULL grabs KYLE
and yanks the HANDGUN from his waistband.
COW grabs STAR, shoves her into the center of the garage,
beside Kyle and Bull. Bull tosses the handgun to COW who
keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up.
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:
COW
Not much meat on `em.
PIG eyes Marcus, points the shotgun in his face.
PIG
This one's fi-i-ine--
MARCUS raises two fingers like a peace sign-- then shoves
them into the barrels of the shotgun. PIG snorts and PULLS
THE TRIGGER-- CLICK.
MARCUS
Oops.
MARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS
Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose.
COW points the unloaded HANDGUN at Marcus-- CLICK CLICK.
KYLE and STAR get free of BULL and dash for the exit, they're
out of there in a flash.
BULL CHARGES MARCUS, who dodges him, grabs the man and--
--HURLS HIM HEAD FIRST into the CHARCOAL PIT-- his BODY
SIZZLES against the coals, he SCREAMS and WRITHES.
COW picks up an AXE with two hands and SWINGS it at MARCUS
who GRABS the HANDLE with one hand and YANKS it away.
COW knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out
the way Kyle and Star went.
MARCUS advances on PIG and BULL, brandishing the AXE. Pig
squirms back across the floor, wiping BLOOD from his face.
PIG
We didn't kill `em! I swear to
God, they was dead already, we
wasn't gonna let `em rot--
BULL has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much
pain to rise.
BULL
Go `head, take as much as you want,
we're on the same side here--
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED: (2)
Marcus looks ready to finish them off-- but reacts to CRIES
from outside, a loud MECHANICAL RUMBLE.
TRANSPORT - NIGHT
DARKNESS. We just make out KYLE and STAR among the other
PRISONERS, most of whom are awake now in the steel container.
Star still wears her baseball cap. The prisoners are JOSTLED
as the transport touches down.
KYLE
We've landed.
TRANSPORT - NIGHT
--A SMALL PANEL SLIDES OPEN
at the front of the transport,
and a half-dozen PROCESSING
AEROSTATS buzz inside from the
cab. These are larger than
the spy drones, with attached
PINCERS that can encircle a
person's arm.
PRISONERS duck, try to dodge these things. But they quickly
buzz from captive to captive, latching onto their arms-- we
hear SCREAMS, see FLASHES OF LIGHT from the aerostats.
KYLE tries to bat away an AEROSTAT, but its PINCERS latch
onto his forearm. A SIZZLING SOUND-- Kyle CRIES OUT with the
pain, a flash of RED LIGHT-- then the aerostat DETACHES and
moves to its next victim.
STAR gets the same treatment from a different AEROSTAT.
She
moves to Kyle's side, tears in her eyes, sucking on her
burned wrist to ease the pain.
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:
STAR
What's going to happen to us?
KYLE
I don't know...
KYLE looks grimly down at--
--a fresh BAR CODE seared into his arm.
OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY
DARK. We hear BABIES CRYING from nearby, FUMBLING in the
dark, muttered CURSES-- then a MATCH lights a CANDLE.
BARNES, 20-ish, good-looking and cocky, yawns and sneers,
annoyed at being awakened. TWO WOMEN share his mattress.
BARNES
Somebody feed those things!
MORRISON
Start up the generator, Barnes.
MORRISON is bearded, long-haired, bleary-eyed, a middle-aged
man in charge here. He sits up in bed, also beside A COUPLE
OF WOMEN. This place has become an underground crash pad,
communal living for about a dozen people-- Morrison and
Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few
CHILDREN of varying age.
BARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY
OUT in protest. He wraps it around himself, carries the
candle as he steps around other SLEEPING FIGURES, makes his
way toward a METAL STAIRCASE winding downward. Moments
later, we hear a GAS ENGINE start up-- LIGHTS flicker on.
The place is pretty grimy and run-down, but it was once a
military environment. There's a BANK OF TV MONITORS against
one wall, which COME TO LIFE. A couple of the WOMEN move
toward the adjacent NURSERY AREA to tend to the babies-- one
of them, LISA, moves to the TV MONITORS. She squints at one.
LISA
We got company!
(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:
ON A SCREEN
MARCUS and BLAIR in the exact positions we last saw them,
looking exhausted. They CRY OUT, unheard.
OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - DAY
Frantic action-- the unconscious MARCUS is carried down a
corridor from the open trap door by BARNES, MORRISON and a
couple of women, NANCY and LISA. BLAIR, bleeding from
shrapnel injuries, assists. She yells at BARNES:
BLAIR
You goddamn idiot!
BARNES
He was takin' bigger steps!
MORRISON
Son of a bitch is heavy.
OUTPOST/INFIRMARY - DAY
MARCUS is deposited gingerly on a METAL TABLE in this crude
MEDICAL AREA. Numerous INFANTS and TODDLERS about.
JANE, a doctor, moves toward MARCUS with scissors and other
medical tools, cuts away a tattered pants leg, the shreds of
his sneaker. She stops and stares, palpates a BLACKENED LEG
briefly. She looks up in alarm.
JANE
He stepped on a Claymore? This guy
oughta be in a hundred pieces...
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
She takes a scalpel, pulls it across the CHARRED, HEAT-
DEFORMED SKIN. It doesn't even leave an incision.
BLAIR
What are you doing?
JANE
Does he have a prosthetic limb?
BLAIR
I don't think so.
JANE opens Marcus' shrapnel-torn shirt, takes the scalpel and
gingerly pulls it across the flesh of his chest. No effect.
JANE
This is not skin... oh Jesus-- oh God--
JANE looks at MORRISON, backing away from Marcus.
JANE (cont'd)
He's a terminator.
CUT TO BLACK.
MEMORY MONTAGE: QUICK SHOTS-- altered, impressionistic, as
before. SFX of STATIC, high-pitched, complex DIGITAL NOISE.
--a detached, fleshless metal framework for a ROBOTIC HAND is
suspended by wires-- it FLEXES, forming a FIST.
--CAMERA CIRCLES a muscular MALE TORSO, without arms, legs or
head. METALLIC ATTACHMENT POINTS await these missing parts.
--the inside of MARCUS' FACE, a thin membrane of artificial
skin with eye, nose and mouth holes, is lowered through an
AQUEOUS environment TOWARD CAMERA.
THROUGH AN EYEHOLE we see SERENA, face distorted by the
LIQUID. She looks worried. We hear her MUFFLED VOICE:
SERENA
Why isn't he conscious?
Something's wrong, he should be
coming out of it by now...
CUT TO:
49.
OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - DAY
START TIGHT ON MARCUS as he opens his eyes, a beam of bright
SUNLIGHT in his face. CAMERA PULLS BACK and ROTATES to
reveal that he is suspended UPSIDE-DOWN from a winch by a two-
inch thick STEEL CABLE.
MARCUS thrashes, trying to free himself, then looks up and
sees that--
--the CABLES are strung through HEAVY STEEL BOLTS which have
been DRILLED THROUGH HIS CALVES, locking them together. His
FOREARMS have been immobilized in the same grotesque fashion.
From above, the BEAM OF SUNLIGHT shines through the narrow
crack between an enormous pair of SLIDING STEEL PANELS.
MARCUS twists his neck to look downward--
MARCUS' POV-- a circular pit below, the dark bottom invisible
to him-- he's hanging near the top of an empty MISSILE SILO,
its ICBM launched years ago.
At one edge of the silo pit, near scaffolding and tool carts,
SMALL CHILDREN have gathered to stare. Also there is BARNES--
he leans back, eyes closed, in a folding chair, with an RPG
in his lap. One of the KIDS taps Barnes' leg and he jerks
upright. He immediately trains his weapon on MARCUS, clearly
nervous now that the terminator is conscious.
MARCUS stares at Barnes, deadpan, for a beat.
MARCUS
Boo!
OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY
CLOSE ON X-RAYs of MARCUS' TORSO and LIMBS-- clearly
mechanical gears, steel plating, hydraulics, etc.
JANE
Thermoplastic skin, some larger
hydraulics, but mostly titanium
microgears... This looks like some sort
of aeration and hydration system,
function unclear at this point. Valves
and what looks like an access panel
below the ribcage...

WIDER, JANE holds up an X-ray of his SKULL, which shows
almost nothing.
JANE (cont'd)
Eyes are polymer optics, very lifelike.
Lead shielding all around the skull,
presumably to protect the CPU.
MATTRESSES have been piled to one side, we now see framed,
cracked and yellowing POSTERS of MILITARY EQUIPMENT-- AIR
FORCE JETS, ATLAS ROCKETS, etc. These are interspersed with
crude CHILDREN'S DRAWINGS on the walls.
BLAIR sits at a battered dining table, surrounded by angry
outpost RESIDENTS, including JANE and MORRISON.
BLAIR
Whatever he is-- he's on our side--
MORRISON
How can he be?
BLAIR
He saved my life!
MORRISON
Winning your trust would aid his
infiltration.
At the communications area by the TVs, LISA wears a HEADSET,
speaking into a SHORTWAVE RADIO. She calls to the others:
LISA
Regional doesn't know what to do.
They're gonna patch us through to
Command Los Angeles.
NANCY, an overwrought older WOMAN, gets in Blair's face,
pointing at the X-rays.
NANCY
How could you bring this monster here?!
This is our home! Our children--
BLAIR
What do you want from me-- I didn't know!
A KID runs into the room.

KID
It's awake!
OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - DAY
BLAIR is first to reach the edge of the silo, horrified at
the sight of the dangling MARCUS. BARNES keeps the RPG
trained on him, they shout over each other.
MARCUS
Get me the hell down from here!
BARNES
Shut up!
I told you to shut up!
BLAIR
Leave him alone!
(turning away from him)
Marcus, I'm so sorry...
MORRISON and the OTHERS join them, eyes fixed on Marcus.
BARNES
It keeps talkin' at me. God this
thing gives me the creeps.
MARCUS
Why are you doing this?
What is
this place?
MORRISON
We're trying to--
NANCY
(over him)
Don't say anything!
It's probably
uplinked to Skynet.
Morrison puts a hand on her arm.
MORRISON
Then it's already too late.
(to Marcus)
This used to be an ICBM silo, we're
just trying to stay alive here.
Your turn-- where'd you come from?
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS
Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.
Or
it was.
BARNES
(AMAZED)
It sounds completely human... it
really could pass.
JANE
Didn't John Connor say they'd start
building things like this?
MORRISON
Not yet-- not for years.
(to Marcus)
So, you're programmed with false
memories, a human history--
MARCUS
What are you talking about?
MORRISON
You can skip the act, we know what
you are.
NANCY
Why are you even speaking to it?!
BARNES
She's right, let's just waste the
damn thing--
NANCY
It'll kill us all if we give it a
CHANCE--
During the above, other KIDS and ADULTS IN BG AD LIB-- "Kill
it," "Goddamn robot," etc.-- increasing mob anger, until--
MARCUS
I'm a man!
His impassioned CRY silences the onlookers.
He speaks more
quietly, desperately:
MARCUS (cont'd)
Even if I never been treated like
one.

MARCUS (cont'd)
Year after year after year on death
row, I just wanted it to end! I
cut my own wrists. But they nursed
me back to health, `cause that
wouldn't be fair, they needed to
kill me themselves. For Chrissake,
you all want me dead so bad-- just
do it.
(a scream)
Do it!
His CRY ECHOES through the silo. The CHILDREN cower behind
the adults. BLAIR is genuinely moved by his plight.
BARNES hefts the RPG, looks toward MORRISON-- "should I?"
Morrison seems torn, about to give the order--
LISA rushes in from the communications area, breathless,
amazed by her own news:
LISA
Regional got through to CLA-- they
want us to rig a video feed.
(gesturing at Marcus)
He wants to see him.
MORRISON
Who does?
LISA
John Connor.
They all seem astonished-- this has gone right to the top.
CUT TO:
OUTPOST/COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY
MARCUS sits impatiently in a wooden chair, facing a VIDEO
CAMERA and a MICROPHONE. BARNES trains an RPG at his head
while MORRISON finishes PADLOCKING HEAVY CHAINS to the BOLTS
in Marcus' arms and legs-- these attach to a nearby STEEL
POST. BLAIR stands nearby. LISA fumbles nervously with the
TRANSMITTER, plugging in wires.
MARCUS
So this guy is what, like king of
the world, or what's left of it?
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
MORRISON
John Connor founded the Resistance.
When the war began, no one even
knew who the enemy was-- Connor
taught us how to fight back. He
saved humanity.
MARCUS
Yeah, well, humanity's never done
all that much for me. Why can't I
see him?
MORRISON
Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be
allowed to discover his location,
even his appearance is kept secret.
LISA makes a connection, we hear CONNOR'S VOICE, the same one
we heard on the car radio.
CONNOR'S VOICE
--hello-- standing by--
LISA
Sir, we can hear you, sir, working
on a visual, sir...
COMMAND CENTER/CONFERENCE AREA - DAY
MARCUS' FACE pops to life on a VIDEO MONITOR. We're in a
Spartan, windowless space, it feels like it's underground.
CONNOR
Not what I expected...
JOHN CONNOR leans INTO FRAME, studies the screen. He wears a
dark sweater, nothing like a uniform. Connor is 40ish now,
but looks older, prematurely grey, years of war have taken a
toll. There's an ever-present sadness in his eyes.
INTERCUT WITH:
OUTPOST/COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY
MARCUS listens to the disembodied VOICE, unimpressed.
The
OTHERS almost stand at attention.
(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:
CONNOR'S VOICE
It does seem lifelike-- is the face
able to mimic emotions--?
MARCUS rolls his eyes, makes an angry FACE at the CAMERA.
MARCUS
This shit is ridiculous. What the
hell do you want from me?
CONNOR
(STUNNED)
I-- I need to know what you are.
MARCUS
So do I! I don't know what I am, what
I'm doing here, I don't know shit--
maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it!
Just blow my head off or let me go.
CONNOR
This isn't right. I can't be
having a conversation with a
terminator, Skynet isn't that
sophisticated yet. Unless... were
you sent here from the future?
MARCUS
(very confused)
What?
CONNOR
Skynet's developing a time
displacement field, we've decrypted
recent data transmissions.
(SADLY)
I know for a fact that soon machines
will be travelling back decades. To
try and stop us from winning this war
before it begins...
Marcus takes this in for a sober moment.
MARCUS
You're out of your mind, aren't you?
This earns outraged glares from the others, but Blair stifles
a smile. Barnes moves to strike him, Morrison stops him.
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED: (2)
CONNOR'S VOICE
Jesus... I've seen enough. Stand
by for further instructions.
The CONNECTION goes dead.
COMMAND CENTER/CONFERENCE AREA - DAY
Densely marked MAPS on a CONFERENCE TABLE. CONNOR is now
flanked by a couple of SENIOR ADVISORS, older military men--
along with KATE BREWSTER, late 30s, now his wife-- and
visibly PREGNANT. She's poring over FAXES of the X-RAY
IMAGES. (Like Connor, all military personnel here favor
casual dress, at most pins or patches to indicate rank.)
KATE
He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no
human tissue over the endoskeleton.
CONNOR
Besides, the first T-800s won't be
manufactured until `26.
ADVISOR #1
Maybe he's a one-off, an experiment.
ADVISOR #2
Let's hope. If there are more out there
like him, we're in serious trouble.
Christ, a terminator with attitude...
KATE
Where did they find him?
ADVISOR #1
East-central Texas, near an area of
heavy Skynet concentration. The
outpost where they're holding him is
reasonably secure, but it's not much
more than a commune.
CONNOR
I want him extracted.
ADVISOR #1
Done.
What then?
CONNOR picks up the FAXES, disturbed by them.
(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:
CONNOR
Get him to our best people for
disassembly, find out what makes him
tick. We need to get into that metal
skull, crack his CPU at all costs.
THE ADVISORS nod, pick up their papers and exit. As soon as
they're gone, Connor sits wearily in a chair, tosses the X-
rays and papers onto the table, his authoritative mask
slipping. Kate touches his arm. He leans his head against
her pregnant belly.
CONNOR (cont'd)
Kate, why did I become leader of
the Resistance?
KATE
Because people trust you... you
give them faith--
CONNOR
No. Because I knew I would be, I
was told. I know when and where the
major battles are going to take
place. I know I'm going to send my
own father back through time to save
my mother-- even though I haven't
met him yet. Christ, I even know
the year I'm going to die...
KATE
JOHN--
CONNOR
So how could I not know about this?!
He BANGS HIS FIST on the table atop the PAPERS.
CUT TO:
OUTPOST/CORRIDOR & LAUNCH TUBE - DAY
MARCUS is marched down the corridor to the launch tube,
Frankenstein-like, MORRISON holding the chains, keeping a
safe distance from him, while BARNES keeps the RPG trained at
Marcus' head.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
Marcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles.
It's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening.
MARCUS
Feels like I been here before...
what are you gonna do to me?
MORRISON
Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a
chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.
They reach the edge of the SILO PIT-- a long drop, smooth
walls, a long METAL LADDER leading down into darkness.
MARCUS pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms
questioningly-- "now what?"
At a look from Morrison, he and Barnes BODY-CHECK MARCUS at
once, sending him flying over the edge--
MARCUS FALLS the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete
FLOOR of the launch tube with a sickening THUD, the CHAINS
clattering down around him.
MARCUS is stunned, barely conscious as the LADDER is PULLED
UPWARD. It's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in
diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor BLACKENED from a
rocket blast.
ANGLE UP - his captors look down at him for a moment, then
move out of view.
CUT TO:
TRANSPORT - NIGHT
CAMERA MOVES past the PRISONERS, a couple dozen total... An
HISPANIC COUPLE huddle against one wall, whispering to each
other IN SPANISH... COW rocks in despair, head in her hands,
BULL and PIG mutter to each other nearby... an OLDER WOMAN
prays, going through rosary beads... FIND STAR and KYLE.
She's watching as KYLE uses his pocket knife to CARVE an
image in the wall of the transport. He looks up.
KYLE
We're stopping.
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
The BACK PANEL rolls upward. CONTROL ROBOTS-- reminiscent of
the treaded T-1s but without the heavy weaponry-- flank a
path from the rear of the transport towards BRIGHT LIGHT up a
RAMP a short distance away.
THE PRISONERS instinctively move away from the robots, moving
to the front of the container... until ZZZAP! BLUE ENERGY
crackles across the floor. THE PRISONERS CRY OUT in pain at
the electrified surface, and dash toward the opening at the
rear, leaping out of the container.
LOW ANGLE, as the prisoners run by, we hold a moment on
Kyle's graffiti-- it's the STICK FIGURE IMAGES of KYLE and
STAR we saw before, they both hold hands with a LARGER STICK
FIGURE who stands between them, meant to be MARCUS.
UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
THE CONTAINER has stopped in a large subterranean space.
There are numerous FUTURISTIC VEHICLES here-- hydrogen CARS,
three-wheeled ATVs, electric BUSES. CONTROL `BOTS closest to
the container start to close in on the huddling PRISONERS.
A ROBOT BUMPS into BULL, sending another JOLT OF ELECTRICITY
through his body, like a cattle prod. Everyone gets the
picture, starts hurrying down the line, the ROBOTS closing
around them.
COW looks around nervously, clearly freaking out.
Spotting a
gap between the robots, she bolts--
--a ROBOT SWIVELS and CUTS HER DOWN with an ENERGY BLAST.
She lies still, SMOKE rising from her body.
The other PRISONERS pick up the pace.
STAR
I'm scared.
KYLE
(hugging her)
Whatever happens, we stick together.
The LIGHT emanates from FROSTED WINDOWS at the top of the
RAMP, through which we make out the SILHOUETTES of human
figures.
(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:
GLASS DOORS part ahead of the prisoners-- a stark white,
sterile environment beyond. THE ROBOTS stop here. THE
PRISONERS disappear inside... and the DOORS CLOSE.
CUT TO:
OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
BARNES remains on guard duty with the RPG, propped up on some
cushions, a LANTERN by his side-- it's pretty late, the
generator's shut down. He's reading an old, yellowed COMIC
BOOK, he has a small stack at his side.
MARCUS' VOICE echoes up from below, startling him.
MARCUS
Hello? Anyone there?
(BEAT)
I'm thirsty.
BARNES
(SNICKERING)
Want some motor oil?
MARCUS
I need water.
BARNES
Bullshit.
Machines don't drink.
MARCUS
Please, I'm--
BARNES
Shut up, robot!
BARNES returns to his reading. He reacts to FOOTSTEPS from
the long corridor into the living area behind him.
BLAIR approaches with a FLASHLIGHT, her manner conciliatory.
BLAIR
How's it going, Barnes? Thought
you might like a late-night snack.
She pulls a crumpled plastic PACKAGE out of a pocket of her
flight suit-- ancient Hostess snack cakes. BARNES' eyes
light up as he puts the RPG aside and grabs it.
(CONTINUED)
61.
CONTINUED:
BARNES
Where in hell'd you get these?
BLAIR
We got a stash back at the base.
BARNES tears open the package hungrily, takes a bite.
He
grins, but as he chews, his expression darkens.
BARNES
Kinda stale.
BLAIR
You need something to wash it down.
From another pocket, she produces a plastic water bottle
filled with a murky gray liquid.
BARNES
I'm on duty, you know.
So saying, he takes the bottle, unscrews the cap and takes a
long pull. It's powerful hootch, he gasps for air, passes
her the bottle as she sits beside him. She doesn't drink.
BARNES (cont'd)
Twinkies and moonshine. You trying
to seduce me again?
BLAIR
You know I always liked you, Barnes.
I
just didn't want to join the harem.
BARNES
What can I say? It's our duty to
repopulate the planet.
BLAIR
Noble of you to make the sacrifice.
BARNES
C'mere.
He pulls her close to him for a kiss. After a moment, she
pulls away and moves to the corridor entrance. There's a
large SLIDING STEEL DOOR here.
BLAIR
I prefer a little privacy.
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED: (2)
With some effort, she pulls the door CLOSED. BARNES rises
with a grin, undoing his shirt, coming close to her. He's
already unsteady on his feet.
BARNES
You're so twentieth century...
He puts his arms around her for a full body embrace--
BARNES (cont'd)
Admit it, I'm the best you ever had...
His words are slurring. He slides to the floor, slowly
losing his grip. He rolls onto his back with a drugged-out
expression of bliss on his unconscious face.
BLAIR
Men.
You're all talk.
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT
MARCUS leans against the wall in the dark, rolls out of the
way as the LADDER drops. BLAIR descends quickly, the
FLASHLIGHT in her belt, a battery BLADE SAW in one hand. She
sets the flashlight on the ground and moves to his side--
BLAIR (cont'd)
I used up the last of my Valium for
you... Hold out your arms.
He does, she fires up the SAW, moves it carefully to the bolt
joining his forearms. SPARKS fly from the BUZZING BLADE as
it digs into the metal-- it's going to take some time.
MARCUS
Why are you doing this?
BLAIR
I don't believe you're a terminator.
MARCUS
So what am I...?
BLAIR
Whatever you are-- I owe you one.
Once you're free, I'll lie down
next to Barnes-- they'll assume you
escaped while we were passed out--
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED: (3)
MARCUS
You think they'll buy that?
BLAIR
Worth a shot.
(looking at him)
Marcus, Command wants to take you
apart, cut open your head. One
thing I know, you're alive-- and
you've got a right to live.
THE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to:
OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
THE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his
arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they
hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead.
BLAIR
They're already here for you--
MARCUS slides the BOLTS out of his legs, freeing himself from
the chains.
BLAIR (cont'd)
Hide in the forest, then aim west
for open country--
MARCUS
I'm heading across the river.
BLAIR
No human being can survive there--
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS
I'm not human, remember?
BLAIR
You're gonna try and save those kids.
MARCUS
It's the only thing I can think of
that makes any sense...
BLAIR
Marcus, for all you know, they're
dead already--
MARCUS
For all I know, they're the reason
I'm back from the dead.
BLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she
admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following.
BARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the
platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door--
BLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES
and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again.
BLAIR
Damn it, we're too late--
MARCUS
Where's that go?
MARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL
GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit.
It's not running, but there's no way to get through it.
BLAIR
Should lead out, but there's no way
past the fan--
MARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it
backwards, has no idea how to shoot it--
BLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself,
takes aim and FIRES--
KABOOM!
The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN.
65.
OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT
MORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed
with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to
the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run,
the soldiers readying their weapons.
OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT
MARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the
far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks
of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the
size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus.
BLAIR
Here. My ELT-- emergency locator
transmitter. If you find the camp,
activate it like this. It could
really help the Resistance.
She indicates a button.
MARCUS takes the device--
--then grabs her, KISSES HER hard on the mouth-- she's
startled-- it felt very human.
MARCUS
Thank you.
MARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from
the hole and pulls himself upward as--
THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS--
BLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the
CONCRETE--
--SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the
ventilation shaft--
VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT
MARCUS has a CHUNK OF REBAR lodged in his left SHOULDER, but
he doesn't even notice this yet. He picks himself up and
moves quickly in the darkness, crouching in this cramped
tube. There's a TURN up ahead, he just makes it as--
An EXPLOSIVE SHELL rockets through the shaft behind him--
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
BOOM! THE BLAST TEARS through the metal tube, DIRT POURS IN,
blocking the tunnel from his pursuers.
TERMINATOR FACTORY - DAY
This TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled
clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS.
ELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place.
STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE
PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS.
Partially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY
STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS,
elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like
the ones in present-day factories.
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
SYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in
precise amounts, building up to create human features... this
is a T-400.
An INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE
CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked
rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts
this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into
the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole.
THE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the
TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes
a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past--
--the dumbfounded MARCUS.
THE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a
treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER.
There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment.
COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY
JOHN CONNOR moves grimly down a narrow, steel passageway,
FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. He reaches the MP, outside the door.
CONNOR
I need to talk to the prisoner.
The MP looks a little surprised, but says nothing.
He undoes
the LATCH on the door and opens it for Connor.
COMMAND CENTER/INTERROGATION CELL - DAY
A bare, windowless space with only a cot, a metal chair and a
bedpan. BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared.
CONNOR gestures for the MP to close the door behind him.
CONNOR
Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry
about the way you've been treated,
but we're forced to take every
precaution. I'm John Connor.
Blair's mighty impressed, in spite of the circumstances.
She
leaps to her feet, stands at attention and salutes.
BLAIR
Sir.
CONNOR
At ease.
Please, sit.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
CONNOR pulls up the chair, close to Blair, who sits on the
bed. His tone is careful, controlled.
CONNOR (cont'd)
I've gone over your record,
lieutenant. You're a good soldier,
flown a lot of missions...
(BEAT)
Why in God's name would you help a
terminator escape?
BLAIR
Sir-- he isn't a terminator.
He's
human.
CONNOR
We know he's crossed into Skynet
territory, why would he do that if
he isn't--
BLAIR
He's trying to find his friends.
CONNOR
What friends?
BLAIR
A couple of kids. They were taken
in a Skynet transport, probably to
some kind of prison camp-- he said
their names were Star and Kyle.
Connor blinks at this, alert.
CONNOR
Kyle.
Blair picks up on his interest, but doesn't understand it.
BLAIR
Mm... Kyle something.
With an `R.'
CONNOR
Reese.
BLAIR
That's it.
How did you...?
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED: (2)
CONNOR is already on his feet, BANGING on the door-- the MP
unlatches it to let him out--
COMMAND CENTER/CORRIDOR - DAY
Partway down the hallway, CONNOR encounters KATE, who walks
with him, takes in his expression.
KATE
What is it, John?
CONNOR
I always knew I'd have to find him
someday. I just didn't know how.
KATE
What?
Find who?
CONNOR
My father.
CUT TO:
LABORATORY - DAY
START CLOSE on KYLE'S HAND, clutching STAR'S tightly.
We
hear them SINGING faintly, together:
KYLE AND STAR
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
WIDER, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto SLIDING
TRAYS, a long row of these hold OTHER PRISONERS as well.
Kyle and Star must reach across a gap between the trays to
hold hands. (It's the first time we've seen her hatless.)
The trays are all poised before panel-covered SEMI-CIRCULAR
OPENINGS built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital-like
environment. Above each opening is a MONITOR SCREEN. An
ominous HUM is building.
IN AN ADJACENT OPERATING THEATER, visible through GLASS
WALLS, MEDICAL LASERS mounted on ROBOTIC ARMS work on
anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details).
BEHIND STAR and KYLE, the PANELS OPEN, the trays slowly SLIDE
into the OPENINGS. SCREAMS and SOBS from other prisoners.
(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:
STAR
Oh no, oh no...
KYLE
Shh, keep singing.
Kyle and Star hold hands for as long as possible, then
release their grip as their bodies enter the chambers and the
panels slide shut.
STAR'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY
Immobilized in this small, tubular chamber, like an MRI, STAR
closes her eyes as she's bathed in BRIGHT LIGHT, LASER GRIDS
projecting over her skull. The HUMMING is LOUDER.
STAR
Up above the world so high, like a
diamond in the sky...
KYLE'S TESTING CHAMBER - DAY
The same thing is happening to Kyle.
He's no longer singing.
KYLE
Stop it stop it STOP IT!
CUT TO:
LABORATORY - NIGHT
ON THE MONITORS above the long row of chambers-- colorful 3-D
IMAGES of the prisoner's BRAINS are being constructed, like
PET scans. DENSE DIGITAL READ-OUTS BELOW, as data is
analyzed. (Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside
these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the
chamber, the subjects looking frightened.
IN THE OPERATING THEATER, the LASERS are still now, their
grisly work done for the moment, awaiting the next batch.
An ENGINEER, a nice-looking, well-built young man in loose
black clothing, moves down the row of chambers, studying
results. He speaks into a subtle HEAD-SET:
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
ENGINEER
32578 - acceptable. 32579 - no,
insufficient neural capacity.
32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have
even been brought here...
As he speaks, the BARCODES on the monitors in question turn
either RED or GREEN in response to his judgments.
He reaches KYLE'S CHAMBER, we see Kyle's anguished FACE on
the monitor photograph.
ENGINEER (cont'd)
32581 looks good...
Kyle gets a GREEN BARCODE, the engineer is on to Star, he
strokes his chin.
ENGINEER (cont'd)
32582... hm, borderline. May not
be emotionally compatible. Pass.
On STAR'S MONITOR-- RED BARCODE.
The engineer KICKS something on the floor, bends down to pick
it up-- STAR'S BASEBALL CAP. He flings it expertly into--
--a nearby TRASH RECEPTACLE.

SLEEPING CABIN - NIGHT
DARKNESS, then a KNOCK and a DOOR FLIES OPEN.
JOHN CONNOR sits up in bed.
KATE blinks beside him.

AIDE
Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you, but you
said you wanted to know immediately--
CONNOR
What is it?
AIDE
We found our terminator.
COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
CONNOR and KATE, hastily dressed, cross through the command
center we've seen before, and step through a HATCHWAY into--
SUBMARINE/BRIDGE - NIGHT
--a MASSIVE CONTROL AREA for a HUGE SUBMARINE. SONAR and
RADAR stations, a CREW of NAVAL PERSONNEL, most do not wear
uniforms. This sub is where Connor has been the whole time.
THE AIDE leads CONNOR to a GPS TRACKING TERMINAL, where NAVAL
and AIR FORCE OFFICERS hover.
AIR FORCE OFFICER
The signal's coming from near what used
to be Galveston, right on the coast.
NAVAL OFFICER
There can't be any prisoners there.
The whole area's a nuclear
wasteland-- only machines can
survive the radiation levels for
any length of time.
CONNOR
Mobilize a combined air and naval
assault, all available resources.
We're sending in a rescue team ASAP.
The OFFICERS raise AD LIB objections ("but sir--"). CONNOR
raises a hand to silence them and moves a few steps away,
beside KATE. They speak in hushed tones:
KATE
All to find one teenage boy...?
John, you really think this can work?
(CONTINUED)
86.

CONNOR
I'm standing here, I exist-- so it
must have worked. We will find him.
He turns back to the OTHERS, holding their gaze.
CONNOR (cont'd)
Call it an act of faith.
REPAIR LAB - DAY
START ON MARCUS' DAMAGED LEG. It has been DETACHED from his
body, halfway down the thigh. Elaborate CIRCUITS are
exposed, as SURGICAL MACHINES perform repairs with LASERS,
MECHANICAL ARMS replacing damaged parts.
NEARBY, MARCUS opens his eyes, coming to. He's CLAMPED onto
an elaborate, mobile SURGICAL TABLE, the stump exposed. His
body and head are secured within its framework. MORE
MACHINES swiftly repair the damage to his chest and shoulder.
MARCUS twitches, freaking out, struggling in his bonds--
THE DETACHED LEG twitches as well.
SERENA
Calm down, Marcus.
It's all right.
SERENA is on the other side of a GLASS PANEL, operating
computer controls. This is an automated surgical
environment, the work on Marcus carried out by various
MACHINES and MICROTOOLS-- busy HYDRAULIC ARMS, LASERS, etc.
MARCUS
Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being
your guinea pig, what are you doing
to me now?!
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
SERENA
Repairing you.
MARCUS
You all work for Skynet!
SERENA
Please. Skynet works for us. It's only
a program-- a tool, a means to an end.
MARCUS
The end of the world.
SERENA
Its sole purpose is to protect humanity.
MARCUS lets out a horrified, bitter laugh.
SERENA (cont'd)
Listen to me. Skynet was designed to
detect threats, make projections and
implement solutions. As soon as it
came on line, it factored in war,
disease, environmental destruction--
and calculated a high probability of
total human extinction within two
hundred years. The human race was
doomed... unless we were transformed.
THE SURGICAL TABLE swivels, bringing MARCUS into alignment
with the repaired leg. In moments it's reattached, the
plastic skin thermosealed at the joint.
MARCUS
Into-- this? A brain in a box?
SERENA
Skynet had access to the entire
defense web-- including Project
Angel. It determined hybrids were
the only path to salvation.
MARCUS
Destroying the human race in order
to save it.
THE LASER TOOLS and HYDRAULIC ARMS now move on their ceiling
racks, coming close to MARCUS' FACE. The TABLE INVERTS,
exposing the back of his head.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED: (2)
MARCUS (cont'd)
What are you doing?
SERENA
When the resistance attacked our
installation, we were forced to
self-destruct. We would have taken
you with us, but we thought you
were in a permanent coma...
THE LASERS start cutting into the back of Marcus' head,
BURNING through the plastic SKIN. MARCUS lets out a CRY of
rage, strains at his bonds.
SERENA (cont'd)
Your interface was never installed.
CLOSE as the HYDRAULIC ARM attaches to the back of Marcus'
head and removes a section of STEEL SKULL...
REVEALING THE SURFACE of a HUMAN BRAIN, gray matter enmeshed
in WIRES and CIRCUITRY beneath a clear PLASTIC CASING, in a
bath of pale reddish LIQUID. Tiny NEURAL SPARKS fire.
MARCUS
No, stop... I don't want it!
You're dead inside, all of you!
SERENA
We're immortal. No sane person
would choose to live in pain,
forever. Soon you'll understand.
CLOSE as an elaborate ELECTRONIC INTERFACE MODULE is fixed at
the base of Marcus' exposed brain.
ON MARCUS' FACE - his expression of agony vanishes, his
features become peaceful.
DISSOLVE TO:
CORRIDOR - NIGHT
CAMERA TRACKS past GLASS WINDOWS, we glimpse ARTIFICIAL SKIN
growing on a steel terminator skeleton... a prototype T-800,
perhaps with a strong resemblance to Arnold.
Elsewhere ENGINEERS observe a SHIMMERING COLUMN of LIQUID
METAL, twisting and assuming different shapes within a sealed
GLASS CONTAINER.
WITH MARCUS and SERENA, moving past these observation areas.
SERENA
Nanotechnology, polymimetic metals...
working with Skynet, we're making
amazing breakthroughs, well beyond
anything possible before Judgment Day.
TIME DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT
START on a glowing TIME SPHERE, just a vague, translucent
blue ball right now, dwarfed by the MACHINERY which sustains
it. The sphere is set into a dome-shaped depression in the
floor. There's a distinctive, loud HUM.
A PHYSICIST here at a TERMINAL.
He nods toward--
--SERENA and MARCUS as they enter.
SERENA
We've already freed ourselves from
biological limits... soon we'll
transcend the laws of physics.
SERENA gestures at a large DIGITAL DISPLAY of a 24-hour
CLOCK: the date, 10.16.18, 00:25, SECONDS FLASHING PAST.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
SERENA (cont'd)
Right now, we can only go back a
few days at most...
MARCUS
A time machine... Connor was right.
SERENA
(sudden interest)
The Resistance leader?
You know him?
MARCUS
...I've just heard him speak.
SERENA
He's a dangerous man. Delusional.
He thinks he's a savior, but all he's
really fighting for is... death.
They move to an exit, Marcus looking back over his shoulder
at the glowing blue sphere.
NEURAL NET CHAMBER - NIGHT
CAMERA MOVES over TUBES and FIBER-OPTIC CABLES, which run
into multiple GLASS CYLINDERS filled with translucent PINK
LIQUID. These contain HUMAN BRAINS... there are hundreds of
them hooked up in here.
SERENA
A boy and a girl-- in the last day
or two?
MARCUS
Yes... what is this place?
SERENA
Part of the neural net-- human minds
linked directly with artificial
intelligence. The processing power
of the human brain is still beyond
anything Skynet can manufacture.
SERENA has moved to a COMPUTER TERMINAL, one of a few here.
SERENA (cont'd)
Display recent arrivals for processing.
IMAGES begin to appear on the screen-- small inset PHOTOS,
each with a BARCODE. They quickly fill the screen. MARCUS
leans forward, squinting.
ON SCREEN - dozens of FACES, PHOTOS taken inside the TUBES,
mostly looking terrified.
MARCUS shakes his head.
SERENA (cont'd)
Next page...
ON SCREEN - a new SET OF FACES appears one by one on the
screen. This time, STAR and KYLE are among them, next to
each other.
MARCUS
That's them.
MARCUS touches the screen, two fingers, one on each of the
kid's faces. THEIR IMAGES expand to fill the screen, side by
side, KYLE on the left.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
KYLE'S IMAGE, the date 10.16.18... the time, 22:19:23.
The
word, in green: PROCESSED.
SERENA smiles.
SERENA
Good news. He'll soon be part of
the network-- you'll be able to
connect with him.
Move to STAR'S IMAGE.
10.15.18... 22:20:49... and the word,
in red: TERMINATED.
SERENA (cont'd)
I'm sorry about the girl, Marcus.
She didn't suffer.
Marcus takes this in, his face shows pain. Then SERENA
grasps his hand-- in moments, he's smiling.
MARCUS
Of course.
I... I understand.
Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant
EXPLOSION. SERENA releases MARCUS, listens in her earpiece.
MARCUS (cont'd)
What is it?
SERENA
I don't know-- I have to go.
Will
you be all right?
(off his smile and nod)
Of course you will.
She touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone
here. We'll hear other far off EXPLOSIONS from time to time
during the following. MARCUS stares at--
HIS FRIENDS' FACES, which slowly FADE TO BLACK, replaced by
his own REFLECTION. Seeing his own face, his smile vanishes.
MARCUS is going through a terrible internal struggle, the
interface fighting his own natural emotions. He backs away
from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives
destroyed.
Hurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base
of his skull... with an ANGRY CRY--
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED: (2)
--his FINGERS dig into the plastic skin at the back of his
HEAD--
MARCUS grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but--
--he RIPS THE INTERFACE MODULE from his skull-- CONNECTIONS
SPARK, we glimpse STEEL SKULL and the encased BRAIN beneath.
MARCUS hurls the DEVICE to the floor, its elaborate CIRCUITRY
SHATTERS. He reels with momentary anguish at what he's just
given up-- then he moves out of there with determination.
TIME DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT
THE PHYSICIST is SLAMMED against a wall. He never loses his
unperturbed expression as MARCUS manhandles him. THE CLOCK
reads 01:05.
MARCUS
I need to go back!
PHYSICIST
The wormholing fluctuates, right
now it's oscillating between three
and six hours--
MARCUS
What do I do?
PHYSICIST
Just breach the sphere. But you
could materialize anywhere in a
mile radius--
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS tosses the man aside, regards the GLOWING, CRACKLING
TIME SPHERE-- it doesn't look too inviting.
THE DOOR bursts open. SKELETAL TERMINATORS storm in,
wielding PLASMA RIFLES-- they mean business--
THE PHYSICIST finally looks alarmed, getting in front of
MARCUS as he yells--
PHYSICIST (cont'd)
No, don't shoot in here--!
A TERMINATOR FIRES anyway, BLOWING A HUGE HOLE through the
center of the Physicist's chest and throwing him backward to
the floor-- the man looks down and shakes his head at the
damage to his plastinated body.
PHYSICIST (cont'd)
Idiots.
A SECOND TERMINATOR spins his weapon on--
--MARCUS, who LEAPS into the center of the sphere just as THE
ROBOT FIRES and HITS nearby MACHINERY which EXPLODES--
ENERGY ERUPTS around MARCUS, the CRACKLING BLUE LIGHT of the
time sphere surrounds him. We experience this from--
--INSIDE THE SPHERE. Marcus instinctively crouches in a
FETAL POSITION. An instant later, his CLOTHING BURNS OFF HIS
FLESH. The HIGH TECH ENVIRONMENT around him TRANSFORMS into--
UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
MARCUS moves stealthily through the space where the prisoners
were off-loaded, keeping out of sight behind parked vehicles.
He starts at the sight of--
THE CONTROL ROBOTS, hooked to CHARGING POSTS along one wall.
MARCUS makes his way to the GLASS DOORS.
Using all his
strength, he manages to PRY THEM OPEN.
LABORATORY - NIGHT
The ENGINEER as we saw him before, consulting the MONITORS
above the CHAMBERS.
ENGINEER
32581 looks good... 32582... hm,
borderline. May not be emotionally
compatible. Pass.
The engineer picks up STAR'S BASEBALL CAP and flings it into
the TRASH...
Just then he hears SHATTERING GLASS behind him.
He spins--
MARCUS trains a ripped-off ROBOTIC LASER ARM at him like a
weapon. The arm trails heavy CABLES and CIRCUITS, linking it
to the operating theater we saw earlier. (These also
artfully conceal Marcus' nakedness.)
MARCUS
Let them go.
ENGINEER
What?
Who are you?
MARCUS takes a step closer.
MARCUS
I said, let them go!
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
THE ENGINEER moves to a RED ALARM BUTTON on a COMMUNICATION
PANEL mounted in the wall, extending a hand--
MARCUS connects two wires to FIRE UP the LASER and--
A RED BEAM neatly SEVERS the ENGINEER'S HAND at his WRIST.
THE ENGINEER studies the metal STUMP of his severed hand with
a blank expression.
ENGINEER
You can't hurt me.
The ENGINEER smirks and WHACKS the ALARM BUTTON with his
other hand. An ELECTRONIC KLAXON sounds.
MARCUS
Now you're pissing me off.
MARCUS FIRES OFF THE LASER again--
--THE ENGINEER stares at him-- we see a flaming STRIP in the
wall behind his head. He takes a step toward Marcus and--
--his HEAD TUMBLES OFF, bounces on the ground, and rolls to
MARCUS' FEET. (There's no blood, just laser-severed
electronic connections).
MARCUS picks up the ENGINEER'S HEAD by the hair.
The man's
brain is unharmed.
MARCUS (cont'd)
How'd that feel?
THE MAN'S MOUTH twists and grimaces, making ELECTRONIC STATIC
from the FRIED VOICEBOX. MARCUS is taken by surprise when--
--THE DECAPITATED BODY lunges at him, knocks the LASER from
his grasp. After a brief STRUGGLE, MARCUS spins the
engineer's HEAD to face his body. He grabs the INTERFACE at
the base of his neck.
MARCUS (cont'd)
I pull this off and you'll be in a
world of pain!
THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES.
(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED: (2)
MARCUS (cont'd)
Last chance. Let them out.
AT A CONTROL TERMINAL, the one-handed, headless BODY taps
keys and controls. MARCUS holds the Engineer's HEAD so that
he can see over his own shoulder. Moments later--
--the MACHINE HUM winds down. THE MONITORS flash the word
"ABORT," the PANELS begin to OPEN.
MARCUS addresses the HEAD in his hand.
MARCUS (cont'd)
I'm gonna need your clothes.
THE HEADLESS BODY begins to unbutton its shirt.
MOMENTS LATER - CLOSE as KYLE'S TRAY slides out of his
CHAMBER. The RESTRAINTS retract automatically. He sits up,
looking toward--
--STAR, on the next tray.
She hasn't moved, her eyes closed.
KYLE
No!
He climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms.
She starts
awake.
STAR
What?
Around them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their
feet, surprised at their sudden freedom.
MARCUS approaches KYLE, buttoning his new shirt.
KYLE
Marcus!
The two kids hurry to him, Marcus hands Star her BASEBALL
CAP, rescued from the trash. As she puts it on:
STAR
I knew you'd come.
THE PRISONERS are already on the move, frantically dashing
out of the lab ahead of our heros.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED: (3)
MARCUS
We've gotta get out of here.
He leads the kids out the way he came, passing...
THE ENGINEER, in underwear, sitting in a corner, cradling his
head in his lap. His remaining hand strokes his interface,
his eyes closed in a blissful expression.
UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
THE PRISONERS smash the GLASS DOORS off their hinges, and
charge past--
THE CONTROL ROBOTS, which are now coming to life. ELECTRIC
BURSTS drop a couple of slow-moving ESCAPEES as they dash
into the garage and make for--
--ANY AVAILABLE VEHICLE. Former PRISONERS hijack BUSES,
HYDROGEN CARS. Pure chaos, it feels like a prison riot.
MARCUS, STAR and KYLE weave amidst the robots and humans.
MARCUS
Stay down!
KYLE and STAR take cover behind a concrete post just as--
--PLASMA BURSTS explode around them.
SKELETAL TERMINATORS armed with PLASMA RIFLES are pouring in
through the OPENING GARAGE GATE.
A STOLEN BUS heads for the exit, KNOCKING a couple of
TERMINATORS aside and SMASHING through the rising GATE,
clearing a path for others to follow.
A SKELETAL TERMINATOR sets its sights on a MOVING HYDROGEN
CAR, which follows the bus--
TERMINATOR POV - RED FILTER, HIGHLIGHTING BULL, the DRIVER.
"TARGET ACQUIRED - TERMINATE."
THE TERMINATOR SHOOTS HIS RIFLE through the car's windshield--
it EXPLODES, close to KYLE and STAR, the building SHAKES.
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
KYLE and STAR flee the flames, THE TERMINATOR'S HEAD swivels
quickly, taking them in. It starts to pursue, but MARCUS
gets in front of it. Before it can fire--
MARCUS (cont'd)
It's OK, I'm not human!
The Terminator pauses, looks him over.
TERMINATOR POV - MARCUS is quickly scanned, comes up "NON-
ORGANIC - DO NOT TERMINATE."
THE
TERMINATOR starts to move past Marcus, who LEAPS on it
and
WRENCHES THE RIFLE from its grasp. As the robot spins on
him
he BLOWS ITS HEAD OFF, then looks around frantically for
the
kids. A moment later--
--KYLE ROARS up at the controls of a futuristic ATV, STAR
clinging to him.
MARCUS (cont'd)
You can't drive!
KYLE
Watch me!
No time to argue, MARCUS leaps into the back beside STAR and
KYLE GUNS IT out of there, careening off walls and other
vehicles, he's still not much of a driver. MARCUS meanwhile
PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.
LUXURY HOME - NIGHT
A handsome HYBRID COUPLE, in pajamas in front of a BIG SCREEN
TV. They turn and react as the ATV skitters through the room
and down a hallway. The ATV is followed a moment later by--
--THE TANK, which TAKES OUT THE ENTIRE WALL, BARRELLING
through the living room and BURYING the HYBRIDS in RUBBLE.
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS takes the ATV UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
THE TANK keeps SMASHING through the house, as its TURRET
SWIVELS upward and BLASTS AWAY.
UPSTAIRS - THE PLASMA BLAST COMES THROUGH the FLOOR, just
missing the ATV as it rockets through a MASTER BEDROOM,
toward a BALCONY.
DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK tears through an upscale RECREATION
ROOM, splintering a POOL TABLE, smashing through PINBALL
MACHINES.
UPSTAIRS - MARCUS takes the ATV straight out onto the
BALCONY, THROUGH THE RAILING and INTO THE AIR.
DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK BLASTS THROUGH a KITCHEN and BATHROOM
on its way out the other side of the house.
LUXURY HOME - NIGHT
THE RUBBLE in the living room shifts and the HYBRID COUPLE
extract themselves, taking in their destroyed home with
placid expressions.
A-10 COCKPIT - DAWN
BLAIR at the controls, helmeted with her face exposed, lets
out a VICTORY WHOOP as she looks out her canopy at the
huddled humans below.
SUBMARINE/HATCH AREA - DAY
Near the ENGINE ROOM, a couple dozen RESCUED PRISONERS are
being treated by unarmed MEDICAL PERSONNEL, others huddle
under blankets with food and drink. KATE is among those
helping the former prisoners.
KYLE and STAR eat ravenously, he finishes one MRE and grabs
up another. A few feet away, MARCUS leans against a wall,
plasma RIFLE at his side. A DOCTOR examines him warily,
prodding his injured face.
DOCTOR
Does this hurt?
MARCUS
I don't feel a thing.
Help
somebody else.
The doctor moves on as a couple of HAZ-MAT SUITED FIGURES
come down the ladder from the hatch, FACE-MASKS removed.
Among them is CONNOR. KATE moves to his side as more dazed
HUMANS come down. She speaks quietly, eying KYLE nearby.
KATE
Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid.
Connor can't deal with that at the moment, speaks loudly.
CONNOR
The last boatload is right behind
me. Skynet's pouring in
reinforcements, we can't hold this
place. And the people in the
houses, they won't leave--
MARCUS
They're not people anymore...
He trails off, reacting to the sight of--
A FAMILIAR FIGURE descending the ladder, in a long coat, head
down. She looks up to make eye contact... SERENA.
MARCUS (cont'd)
No!
SLO-MO:
seeing Marcus, Serena reaches into her coat--
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS moves at the same time, to grab his PLASMA RIFLE--
SERENA leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful PLASMA
WEAPON.
SERENA fires first--
BLAM! THE PLASMA BLAST catches MARCUS in the shoulder and
BLOWS his GUN ARM clean off. His PLASMA RIFLE discharges,
BLOWING a HOLE in the side of the sub, near the floor-- WATER
gushes in like a FIREHOSE.
LEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS
lands on his back, SPARKS and SEVERED CABLES protruding from
his damaged shoulder. An ALARM KLAXON SOUNDS.
PRISONERS and DOCTORS SCREAM and scramble for cover--
CONNOR steps in front of KATE to shield her, they back away
through the WATER BLAST, CONNOR FIRING at SERENA--
SERENA takes numerous HITS from the EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, which
take off PIECES of her, but she keeps coming, FIRES again--
--HITTING CONNOR in the lower abdomen. He's thrown backward,
KATE cries out and throws herself on top of him. His gun has
gone flying.
SERENA turns her attention to MARCUS, standing over him,
plasma weapon aimed point-blank at his head.
SERENA
Why, Marcus? You were immortal...
MARCUS manages a smile as he shakes his head.
MARCUS
No one lives forever.
BLAM! MULTIPLE PLASMA BLASTS from behind RIDDLE SERENA'S
TORSO, the BLUE PULSES burning right through her-- her HEAD
takes a hit, the STEEL is RUPTURED.
THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES.
TIGHT ON HER FACE, as she turns to see who got her--
There's no one there.
But ON THE FLOOR lies--
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED: (2)
--MARCUS' SEVERED ARM, still holding his PLASMA RIFLE.
The
hand RELEASES the weapon.
SERENA'S HEAD tilts, her eyes go blank-- she's dead.
MEDICAL PERSONNEL are doing what they can to help CONNOR,
blood at his lips, KATE and KYLE at his side.
CONNOR
This... this can't happen...
DISSOLVE TO:
UNDERWATER - DAY
THE SUBMARINE "LOS ANGELES" moves TOWARD CAMERA as it slowly
SINKS deeper beneath the water's surface. We see a makeshift
STEEL PATCH welded near the hatch.
DISSOLVE TO:
SUBMARINE/CORRIDOR - DAY
MARCUS waits outside the entrance to the SICKBAY. He's
cleaned up a bit, wears fresh clothes (one sleeve pinned up).
He seems weary, wrung out, his systems damaged. He'll move
stiffly through the following scene, like a stroke victim.
STAR sits beside him, a hand on his arm.
BLAIR approaches
from down the corridor.
BLAIR
Marcus... I need to head back to my
unit.
MARCUS nods, keeps his head bowed.
BLAIR (cont'd)
What about you?
His voice is still WEAK.
MARCUS
I have no idea. I should be dead...
STAR
But you're alive.
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS
(a half-smile)
So to speak.
BLAIR
We've been ordered not to talk
about it-- the hybrids, everything
about that place is top secret...
MARCUS
Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus
machine.
Star gingerly reaches up to touch the torn plastic at the
back of Marcus' head, where the interface was.
STAR
(BEAT)
What did it feel like?
To be...
one of them?
MARCUS
(thoughtful beat)
Better than anything. Everything made
sense. For the first time in my life,
I felt... right. It was heaven.
BLAIR
How could you give that up?
He turns to her, exposing his mangled face, one eye gone.
MARCUS
I never really believed in heaven.
BLAIR takes this in, fishes in a pocket.
BLAIR
Here.
You need these more than I do.
She holds out a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.
MARCUS, a bit amused,
slips them on.
THE DOOR opens nearby and an ashen-faced KATE emerges.
KATE
He wants to see you.
BLAIR gives MARCUS a farewell hug.
111.
SUBMARINE SICKBAY - DAY
CONNOR has a PRIVATE MEDICAL AREA set aside. He's not
looking good-- pale, weak, only semi-conscious. I.V.s and
MONITORS, other LIFE-SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. KYLE is with Connor,
staring at a small POLAROID PHOTO in his hand. CONNOR can
barely speak above a whisper.
CONNOR
Her name was Sarah... she was...
amazing...
KYLE
I don't remember my mother.
KYLE starts to hand the photo back, CONNOR waves it away.
CONNOR
Keep it.
KYLE is a bit puzzled, but obediently keeps the snapshot.
KATE enters with MARCUS, touches the boy's shoulder.
KATE
Kyle, could you give us a minute?
KYLE reluctantly leaves, still looking at the photo, with a
nod to MARCUS on the way out. He joins STAR in the doorway,
they go off together.
KATE, CONNOR and MARCUS are alone now. Throughout scene,
Kate fights to maintain a steely control-- but she's clearly
not far from tears.
KATE (cont'd)
Marcus... you're going to need to
be rebuilt. Your face, your body,
your voice...
(off his shrug)
We have people who can do it.
She pulls some MEDICAL DIAGRAMS out of a drawer, lays them
before Marcus. He examines--
--a SCANNED IMAGE of his FACE, various elements HIGHLIGHTED.
KATE (cont'd)
But you won't be the same...
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features
TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN
CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.
KATE (cont'd)
The scar will help hide the change.
Marcus lowers the papers, absorbing this.
MARCUS
You're asking me to become...
(gesturing at Connor)
Him?
Connor can barely speak above a whisper:
CONNOR
You must.
KATE
(QUIETLY)
We can't keep him alive much longer.
(shakes her head, swallows)
Very few people know what John
actually looks like. Only the
technicians and our closest advisors
need ever know the truth.
MARCUS
Why me?
KATE
Who else? Only you know the enemy
from the inside. You liberated a
Skynet camp... you're a hero.
Connor gestures for Marcus to move closer, he speaks with
great effort:
CONNOR
I never knew how I was supposed to
win this war. But I finally
understand: the idea of John Connor
is more important than the person.
(sinks back, spent)
I can die. He cannot.
Kate leans toward Marcus, who's lost in thought.
(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED: (2)
KATE
Please.
We need you.
MARCUS bows his head for a long beat, as if seeking an answer
from within. Then he looks up again with resolve.
He lifts his hand-- the SKIN TATTERED, METAL exposed at
finger joints-- and moves to take CONNOR'S TREMBLING HAND.
CUT TO:
