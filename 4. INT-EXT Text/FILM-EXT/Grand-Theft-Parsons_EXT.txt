A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the
night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly,
its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels
sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver
fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and
he's in a hurry.
The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show
desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering
neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.
The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the
driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in
one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped
'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.
The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking
quickly through the room.
As he searches, we hear:
WOMAN'S VOICE
Oh my God please help me! I
found your number in his pocket
and I don't know... I don't know
what to do.
PHIL'S VOICE
Ah, what... who are you?
WOMAN'S VOICE
He's dead... he's dead... and
I'm... just... I don't know what
to do.
The man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers.
PHIL'S VOICE
Hold on.
Tell me who's dead.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met
in a bar and we had a lot to
drink and he just...
PHIL'S VOICE
Are you sure he's dead?
He looks under the beds.
3.
CON TINUE D:
WOMAN'S VOICE
Yeah. He's really dead.
He
just...
PHIL'S VOICE
Listen. Call an ambulance.
Where are you?
WOMAN'S VOICE
Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree Inn.
Room eight.
He checks on top of the wardrobe.
PHIL'S VOICE
Have you got a car?
WOMAN'S VOICE
Yes.
PHIL'S VOICE
Call an ambulance. Then get out
of there. Okay? Okay?
WOMAN'S VOICE
Yeah, okay. I'm goin'...
He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and
glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and
for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face.
The Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital.
There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a
reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background.
Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks
to the entrance.
Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction.
To
the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the
left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it
skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying
across the road.
NB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through
the desert, set to music.
The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two
enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant
Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six
foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets
out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his
pocket.
7.
A suburban street of small, neat bungalows. We move down
the street, past house and identical house, until we rest
outside another that is identical to the rest. The front
door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small
overnight bag. He carefully locks the door and walks down
the path to where a cab waits. We can clearly see 'New
Orleans Taxi' marked on the door.
MAN
Airport, please.
This is STANLEY PARSONS, Gram's father.
Phil is lying down in the back of Susie's station wagon,
his feet sticking out of the back. Susie comes out of the
house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where she
watches him. After a minute:
SUSIE
What are you doing?
PHIL
These things aren't that big.
SUSIE
Okay.
Is that a problem?
PHIL
Not really.
Susie is confused.
17.
CON TINUE D:
SUSIE
Well, that's good.
No answer.
Phil continues to check out the inside of her
car.
SUSIE (CONT'D)
So what are you up to?
PHIL
It's best you don't know.
Without a word, Susie gets up and walks into the house.
Phil lies still. After a moment, she reappears with her
bag. She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car
door. Phil gets out of the back.
SUSIE
I don't know what this madness
is, but I'm not getting involved.
PHIL
Well, that's the point.
SUSIE
I mean, I don't know what it is
you're planning, but I'm not
bailing you out again.
PHIL
Right.
SUSIE
I'm going.
PHIL
Again.
She gets into the car and slams the door. She starts the
engine, and Phil stands back, but the car doesn't move.
After a moment the window winds down.
SUSIE
This time, I'm not coming back.
She gives him a 'so there' smile.
SUSIE (CONT'D)
I'm going to find a man who buys
his ties in bulk.
She drives away.
Phil arrives on his trike outside a small house.
18.
The garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into
the sun. It is bright yellow and covered in painted
flowers. One of the side windows is broken and a headlight
hangs out. Phil's jaw drops open. Larry gets out of the
driving seat and pats the roof, proudly.
LARRY
Meet Bernice.
PHIL
Bernice?
LARRY
Bernice is a Cadillac Superior
Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral
Coach. We've got a Seven gallon
V8 engine offering three hundred
and forty bhp at four thousand
six hundred revolutions per
minute. You're looking at a
twenty one feet beauty with a one
hundred and fifty six inch
wheelbase containing a four
barrel Rochester Quadrajet
carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic
transmission. Bernice weighs
over six thousand pounds.
There is a very long silence.
PHIL
It's yellow.
LARRY
Yes, it's yellow.
Bernice comes
in yellow.
PHIL
It's supposed to be black.
LARRY
But they're all black.
22.
CON TINUE D:
PHIL
That might be my point.
LARRY
So how is a yellow hearse covered
with flowers less of a surprise
than a black hearse?
PHIL
I paid you two hundred dollars
for a black hearse.
LARRY
(patiently)
No, you paid me a hundred and
eighty dollars for a hearse, and
a hearse is what you've got. If
you take a long, hard look at
Bernice, you'll see that she's
one of a kind. She's big, she's
fast, she's comfortable, and
she's beautiful. But she's not
black.
They stare at each other for a moment.
Then Phil sighs
deeply.
PHIL
Okay.
Where are the keys?
LARRY
Why?
PHIL
I gotta go.
Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again.
LARRY
Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere
without me.
Phil thinks this over.
PHIL
Okay.
Well, let's boogie.
Larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps
and band equipment that now sits in the garage. Phil puts
the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car.
One backfire, and Bernice is ready. The hearse weaves
erratically across the road and then disappears in a cloud
of exhaust smoke.
The hearse drives under a huge sign which reads 'Welcome to
Los Angeles Airport' and peels off the main road past some
offices and cargo stores. Bernice drives into a giant
hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office.
The hearse disappears into the gloom as the light fades and
night falls.
A door swings open, and Barbara appears. She is looking
quite stunning, with a tight black suit doing equal justice
to her womanly curves and her duties as a mourner. She
strides down the sidewalk, and as a group of schoolchildren
appears around the corner Barbara scatters left and right.
26.
CON TINUE D:
Then she cuts across the road, and a delivery van skids to
a halt inches away, horn blaring. The driver leans out of
the window, furious.
DRIVER
Hey, lady!
Barbara stops and whips round, her hair cascading across
her shoulders, her blue eyes flashing. The man simply
stares at her, enchanted by her beauty.
BARBARA
Yes?
He continues to stare, and is only shaken back to his
senses by a burst of abuse from further back in the road.
DRIVER
You... should be careful.
Barbara smiles.
BARBARA
Why, thank you...
A man unlocks the shutters with a clatter and goes inside.
Phil walks over to the door and walks inside the mortuary.
Larry is jumping up and down nervously outside the window.
The policeman appears at his shoulder.
COP
Excuse me, sir.
Is that your
hearse?
Larry turns slowly.
LARRY
Hearse?
The cop points at Bernice.
COP
That hearse.
Larry has started to sweat profusely.
LARRY
That hearse?
The cop looks at him carefully.
COP
Are you okay, sir?
LARRY
Okay?
Sure...
He leans against the window for support.
33.
Larry is standing by the hearse.
The cop is reading his
license.
COP
So, whatcha doin' here?
LARRY
Doing?
Here?
The cop is wandering around the hearse.
Larry trails
behind him, disconsolately.
COP
I don't like the look of you.
LARRY
(miserably)
No. Fair enough.
COP
Wherever there's a hippie there's
a crime, even if it hasn't
happened yet. That's what I
always say.
LARRY
Right.
Good saying.
He prods at the broken light with his baton.
COP
So whatcha doing here?
LARRY
We're meeting someone off a
flight.
COP
You're meeting someone off a
flight?
LARRY
Yes.
COP
In a hearse?
LARRY
Yes.
It's a... surprise.
COP
Which parts the surprise: The
fact that you're in a bright
yellow hearse, the fact that
you're dressed like something out
of a horror film, or the fact
that you're half a mile from the
terminal and they're gonna have
to walk across two runways to
reach you?
Larry is looking increasingly desperate.
38.
CON TINUE D:
LARRY
Well... the first part.
The cop nods and repeats it to himself.
COP
The first part.
They stare at each other.
COP (CONT'D)
Okay, now why don't you tell me
what the hell's going on?
LARRY
Going on?
They stare at each other. The cop shifts position and
purses his lips. Larry stares at the ground looking for
some kind of inspiration. Just when the silence moves
beyond uncomfortable, the door of the mortuary opens and
Phil clatters out with the casket.
PHIL
Well, I don't care if it is first
thing in the morning - but I sure
need a coffee. I tell you, I've
never seen so many darned bits of
paper to sign! It's paperwork
which is slowing this great
country down. We're drowning in
triplicate!
He's busying himself at the back of the hearse, and appears
to notice the cop for the first time.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Good morning officer.
The cop peers at him suspiciously.
COP
Mornin'.
PHIL
I was just saying how people with
work to do - people like
yourself, officer - are just
getting engulfed by paper. Grab
the end, will you? Doesn't that
just drive you plain crazy?
The cop hesitates and then takes the end of the casket and
helps load it into the hearse.
39.
CON TINUE D: (2)
COP
I guess it does.
Phil gestures at Larry to get into the car, which he does.
PHIL
One casket, six sheets to sign.
Six! That can't be right. Does
that sound right to you?
He closes the back doors and gets into the passenger seat.
COP
Nope.
Sure don't.
PHIL
And the very last thing I want to
do is to hold you up further with
my chatter. Thank you for your
help, officer. You have a good
day, now.
It looks like they've got away with it.
But:
COP
Just a moment, boys.
Phil smiles up at him.
PHIL
Yessir?
COP
Your sidekick here has just
finished telling me that you're
gonna pick someone up from the
terminal. A surprise, he said.
And here you are loading a coffin
into your vehicle...
Phil doesn't miss a beat.
PHIL
And there you have it, officer.
You see the gentleman we're
meeting from the plane doesn't
yet know about the sad passing of
his... aunt.
COP
And you're gonna meet him off his
flight with her coffin?
He raises an eyebrow.
40.
CON TINUE D: (3)
COP (CONT'D)
That's a real nice touch.
PHIL
Yeah. We're doing it this way
for the avoidance of doubt.
He gestures at Larry to start the car. Larry pulls out the
screwdriver and starts to jig it about in the ignition.
The cop watches. As the engine refuses to catch, Larry
starts to panic.
LARRY
Ignition's a bit temperamental.
COP
Right.
More fiddling.
No ignition.
LARRY
Have to use a screwdriver.
COP
I see that.
The car starts.
PHIL
Thanks for everything, officer.
We'd best be off...
He looks meaningfully at the cop, who grudgingly moves
back. As they move off, Stanley hurries round the corner
with his overnight bag in his hand.
We pull back to reveal the enormous opening that Larry has
missed.
An attendant is filling Bernice.
He looks Phil over.
ATTENDANT
You an undertaker?
PHIL
Sure am.
50.
CON TINUE D:
ATTENDANT
Ain't yer surposed to be in
black?
PHIL
Nope. We're special rock 'n roll
undertakers. Musical morticians.
The tank is full, and the attendant screws the cap back on.
Phil reaches into the back and pulls out his jerry can. He
passes it to the guy.
PHIL
High test.
ATTENDANT
This car runs on regular.
Phil raises an eyebrow, glances across at the casket, and
winks.
PHIL
Who says it's for the car?
The man gapes at him. Larry walks over to the car and Phil
gets into the passenger seat. He passes some money to the
attendant and takes the can.
ATTENDANT
Ain't fer the car?
PHIL
Nope.
Larry jiggles the screwdriver, slips Bernice into gear, and
they're gone. The attendant watches them go.
Bernice cruises along the freeway then takes an exit for
Joshua tree.
The hearse is parked by the side of the road, near a
rickety stall where an old lady sits, selling melons.
Larry sits inside and Phil walks to a phone by the side of
the road. He dials.
Phil is holding the phone.
PHIL
Hello baby, it's the love
machine. How are ya?
Phil looks surprised.
PHIL
Hello Barbara. How nice to hear
from you again. And so soon...
Suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and Larry runs
out. Phil holds the phone away from his ear as Barbara's
shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver. He
watches as Larry just makes it to a cactus and is violently
sick. He glances across to where the old melon woman
watches, expressionless, from her stall. After a moment,
Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Sorry Barb, gotta go.
He goes to replace the receiver, and then pops in a last
comment.
PHIL (CONT'D)
It's been real, though.
He puts the phone down, cutting off Barbara's squawk and
watches Larry get into the hearse. He frowns.
56.
The old woman watches them go.
START TIME
LAPSE:
We stay on the old woman and her melon stall as the light
rapidly changes, cars and pedestrians whizz by, and an hour
passes in moments.
END TIME LAPSE.
As we slow to normal speed, a car drives past, stops, and
reverses back to park by the stall.
Stanley gets out of the Avis/Budget hire car.
STANLEY
Good afternoon.
OLD WOMAN
Hello.
He points at a melon.
STANLEY
I'll take that one, please.
OLD WOMAN
Fifty cents.
58.
CON TINUE D:
STANLEY
I was wondering... Have you seen
a hearse pass this way in the
last couple of hours?
OLD WOMAN
What's it look like?
The question throws Stanley.
STANLEY
Well... It... It's a big car. A
big yellow car. Two guys inside.
OLD WOMAN
Was one of 'em sick in them
bushes?
STANLEY
Well... I don't know.
Maybe.
The old woman nods.
OLD WOMAN
Yup.
I seen it.
Bernice has driven into a road sign set into a concrete
pillar. In fact, the sign that Bernice has driven into is
the only thing anywhere near the road for miles in any
direction.
They jump out of the car and shuffle sideways, until they
are standing in front of the actual point of collision.
LARRY
What now?
PHIL
Pretend we're having a
conversation.
The buckled sign hangs dangerously above them as they both
grin at the approaching policeman in a friendly manner.
LARRY
Okay.
What about?
PHIL
I don't know what about! Ever
since I met you, you've talked.
Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking
minute. Religion, your
supersonic, supercharged car, the
darkside. Now you need to talk,
and you can't think of anything
to say.
The cop slows down but drives past.
Phil waves at him.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Whatever your damn fool religion
is called, I think it works.
LARRY
Well... it's more a philosophy
than a religion.
The cop does a U-turn and motors towards them.
PHIL
Oh, well done. Good work.
He shoots a vicious look at Larry.
The cop parks his bike
and removes his helmet.
61.
CON TINUE D:
As he opens his mouth to speak, a headlight falls off the
car and rolls off the road. They all watch it go.
MOTORCYCLE COP
Afternoon.
PHIL
Afternoon, officer.
How's it
going today?
The sign gives an ominous creak.
Larry takes a sideways
step, out of danger.
MOTORCYCLE COP
Oh, it's going fine, thank you.
How are things with you?
PHIL
Fine, fine. We just... stopped
to take a look at...
He waves his arm at the desert.
PHIL (CONT'D)
...the fine view you folks have
got around here.
The cop takes his sunglasses off and takes a look around,
as if it's the first time he's seen it.
MOTORCYCLE COP
Well, it is mighty nice around
these parts. If you like desert.
They all look appreciatively at the desert, and the cop
glances down at the keys in Larry's hand.
MOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D)
(to Larry)
And how are things with you
today, sir?
Larry looks flustered.
LARRY
Ooooh, I'm well. Really well,
actually. Thank you.
The cop doesn't respond, just keeps looking at Larry with a
pleasant half-smile on his face.
MOTORCYCLE COP
The reason I ask, is that you
appear to have driven into one of
our road signs.
62.
CON TINUE D: (2)
Larry turns and appears to see the huge buckled pole for
the first time.
LARRY
Oh.
MOTORCYCLE COP
I'm surprised that you hadn't
noticed earlier, as it does
appear to be impeding your
forward progress.
Phil starts to laugh.
PHIL
That's a great line...
The cop turns to Phil.
He is still smiling.
MOTORCYCLE COP
Thank you.
A long pause.
Then:
MOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D)
I wonder if you gentlemen can
help me?
PHIL
Anything.
MOTORCYCLE COP
I'm looking for some fellows who
stole a body back there at the
airport.
Larry wobbles with shock.
LARRY
A body?
Stole a body?
MOTORCYCLE COP
A body. Rather like the one in
the back of your car.
LARRY
That's an empty coffin, officer.
The cop ignores him.
Phil lights his cigar.
63.
CON TINUE D: (3)
MOTORCYCLE COP
I know it sounds strange. But
these guys - there are two of
them - they stole a body, loaded
it into the back of an old yellow
hearse painted with flowers, and
they're supposed to be driving
out this way.
Larry thinks hard.
LARRY
Hearse.
Flowers.
He looks to Phil for support.
Phil raises an eyebrow.
PHIL
I think he's onto us, Larry.
He's just having a little fun at
our expense.
The cop is no longer smiling.
MOTORCYCLE COP
In the car, please.
Phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into
the road. They get into the car and the cop cuffs them
together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys.
Then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into
the radio.
They do another circuit. The exhausted cop stops,
breathing heavily, and then watches in astonishment as the
hearse turns and heads back towards him.
The hearse roars away and the cop watches it go.
The hearse pulls up around the back of the building, and
parks in a place that is hidden from the road. Phil gets
out and stretches. He is joined by Larry, and they both
peer round the side of the building to check that they have
not been observed. Then they walk towards the entrance.
A Police Car with siren blaring and lights flashing speeds
past on the road.
Phil propels Larry outside.
75.
CON TINUE D:
LARRY
Gram Parsons? Is Gram Parsons
dead?
PHIL
Better get going.
LARRY
He said someone took Gram
Parson's body. Two people...
PHIL
Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth.
In fact, I thought he was never
gonna stop talking. Anyway,
although that's real interesting,
we've gotta keep to the schedule.
LARRY
Schedule? What schedule?
There
is no schedule...
PHIL
Well, I think we should just make
our delivery as soon as possible,
don't you? Get our package to
Palm Springs. Remember?
Larry looks horrified.
LARRY
Package?
We've stolen that man's
son.
PHIL
Stolen... his son? That's
outrageous! I'm appalled that
you could even think we'd do such
a thing.
They move round the back of the Polyonax Place, where
Bernice is hidden behind an outhouse.
LARRY
I don't know what you take me
for. I want to see in that box.
Larry walks round to the back of the car.
PHIL
We've really got to go.
Larry swings open the back window and pulls at the casket.
LARRY
It's heavy.
76.
CON TINUE D: (2)
Phil glances at his watch.
PHIL
Okay, then. Well, if you're
satisfied, let's go.
LARRY
I said it's heavy.
PHIL
Heavy, yes. Well, it is made of
wood. Wood is heavy. Actually.
LARRY
Yeah, I remember.
Finest poplar.
Larry slides the top of the casket off and looks inside.
He recoils.
LARRY (CONT'D)
Jesusjesusjesus...
He drops the lid and looks at Phil, horrified.
Phil walks
over and looks inside.
PHIL
Gosh, they must have given us a
full one. We'll have to sort
that all out when we get to Palm
Springs and...
Larry is staring at him with horror.
LARRY
Oh my God.
You stole Gram
Parsons.
Phil gives up.
PHIL
Well, technically, we stole Gram
Parsons.
LARRY
I stole a coffin, I didn't know
there was a body in it.
PHIL
I'd save that line for court.
As the enormity of the news starts to sink in, Larry hops
up and down in panic. Phil watches him.
PHIL (CONT'D)
What are you doing now?
77.
CON TINUE D: (3)
Larry is losing control.
LARRY
I don't know! What am I doing?
I mean... What-am-I-doing? Why
am I here? Why am I with you?
WHAT IS GOING ON?
PHIL
Calm down.
LARRY
I thought it was bad enough when
I ran over the cop's bike, but
now I'm a fucking body snatcher.
PHIL
Well, when you've quite finished,
we should go.
Larry goggles at him.
His voice takes on a level of
hysteria.
LARRY
Go? You go. I tell you what I'm
going to do. I'm going inside
and I'm going to give that man
his son back. I'm going to do
the right thing, I'm going to
follow my conscience, I'm going
to...
Larry walks towards the bar, then quick walks, then runs.
Phil tackles him around the legs and they both fall.
Larry's head hits the ground hard and he lies there
unconscious.
PHIL
Shit!
Phil picks him up, slings him into the passenger seat, and
slides behind the wheel. The hearse moves off.
The hearse picks up speed and powers down the highway out
into the desert.
78.
The hearse powers through along the desert highway. They
pass a sign which reads 'If You're Looking for the Joshua
Tree National Monument, You're Getting Close. If You're
not, You're Getting Lost...'
Bernice fishtails across the road as Larry struggles to
retain control. It eventually slides to a halt. Larry
gets out and runs round to the drivers' door.
The hearse executes a wide U-turn before gently rejoining
the highway and heading back towards town. A moment after
completing the turn, the one remaining headlight stutters
and goes out. Bernice pulls off the road.
Bernice rejoins the road and drives slowly off into the
darkness after Stanley.
Bernice glides to a stop in the bay next to Stanley's car.
Larry gets out and looks around. After a moment, he walks
over to the door of room eight and knocks.
A tired-looking Stanley opens the door.
STANLEY
Yeah?
LARRY
Hi.
STANLEY
Hello.
They stare at each other.
LARRY
Um. I'm one of the guys that
took your son.
After a moment, Stanley steps back and opens the door.
STANLEY
You'd better come in.
A car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and skids
across the road. It reverses and pulls in, parking next to
the hearse. Barbara and Susie get out and look around.
Then Susie walks over to the hearse's passenger window and
raps on the glass, and Barbara marches to the back of the
hearse and attempts to open it. She can't.
BARBARA
Where's the catch on this piece
of shit?
Susie notices Phil, slumped in the seat.
SUSIE
Phil?
Phil!
83.
Phil stands in front of Susie.
SUSIE
What happened to your head?
He touches his head and looks at the blood on his fingers.
His handcuff hangs from his wrist and Susie stares at it.
PHIL
A hippie hit it.
I thought you'd
gone.
SUSIE
Hold that thought.
PHIL
What the hell does that mean?
SUSIE
I need to know what it is you're
doing.
Barbara shouts from the back of the car.
BARBARA
I told you what he's doing! He's
going to set fire to my Gram in
some freaky ceremony with witches
and black magic and... dolls.
PHIL
Dolls?
SUSIE
Dolls to stick pins in.
PHIL
What the hell are you talking
about?
BARBARA
(shouts)
I want my man back!
PHIL
Enough of this shit.
84.
CON TINUE D:
Phil walks over to the door of room 8.
PHIL (CONT'D)
They've gotta be in here.
It's
fate.
He opens the door and walks in.
Phil is waiting by the car.
89.
CON TINUE D:
PHIL
(to Larry)
Nice work. Let's go.
Larry gives Phil the screwdriver.
LARRY
I can't do this.
This isn't
right.
Larry walks away leaving Phil with Susie.
He looks at her.
SUSIE
Just do whatever feels right to
you.
PHIL
God damn!
After a moment, Phil walks back into room eight.
Phil, Larry and Susie leave room eight. They look around
with surprise, but there is no sign of Stanley. Phil opens
the back of the hearse and takes a quick peek inside the
casket.
PHIL
Just checking.
LARRY
Yeah, he took the body and
stuffed it in the trunk of his
car before escaping into the
night.
Larry is already behind the wheel.
Phil opens the car door
and looks at Susie.
PHIL
Are you coming?
She smiles at him.
SUSIE
I reckon I am.
She gets in. There is a final, almighty 'crash' from
inside room eight. The three of them look at each other,
and then Bernice is gone into the darkness. A moment later
Barbara runs outside. She leaps into her car and screeches
after them. In the distance a blue flashing police light
suddenly materializes.
Phil opens the back of the hearse and slides the casket out
of the car. He notices that Larry has made no move to
help. Susie sits on a rock and watches.
PHIL
You wanna give me a hand here?
Larry walks over and grabs the other end of the casket.
They walk it away from the car and lay it down. As they
lower it, the coffin slips out of Phil's hands and bangs
down in the sand.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Sorry, Gram.
They stand and stare at the casket.
Susie walks over with
the guitar and takes Phil's hand.
LARRY
What now?
PHIL
Now we... do it.
He gets the gasoline can from the car and stands over the
casket.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Take the top off.
LARRY
Why?
PHIL
Flesh burns easier than wood.
LARRY
I can't believe you just said
that. I'm not taking the top
off.
He walks off. Phil puts the can down and removes the top
of the casket. He peers inside.
95.
CON TINUE D:
PHIL
(to Gram)
Hey, man. Looking a little
peaky...
SUSIE
Some decorum would be nice.
PHIL
Right.
He pours some gasoline into the casket.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Do you think that's enough?
Against his better judgment, Larry walks over and peers
inside.
LARRY
Well, I don't know.
Maybe a
little more.
Phil pours a little more fuel in.
He looks over at Susie.
PHIL
Enough?
SUSIE
I'm not having a conversation
with you about how much gasoline
you need to burn a body.
She backs off.
LARRY
I think that'll do it.
Phil stops pouring and shakes the can.
PHIL
Only a little left.
He pours the rest of the can into the casket. Susie walks
over to stand next to Phil. He looks down at Gram.
PHIL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you
when it mattered, but I was there
before, and I've been there ever
since. Gram, good luck to you,
wherever you are.
They all stare at the casket. Phil wipes a tear away and
tucks a can of beer into the coffin.
96.
CON TINUE D: (2)
PHIL (CONT'D)
That's my last one, man.
He rests Gram's guitar against the casket, takes big puffs
on his cigar to get the flame up, then tosses it into the
coffin. They wait. Nothing happens. Phil edges nearer
and looks inside. Then the coffin explodes into flames.
All three of them are thrown backwards by the blast.
The traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a
ball of flame in the distance. Barbara just scowls.
TRAFFIC COP
Jesus!
What the hell's that?
BARBARA
That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire.
TRAFFIC COP
Get in the car, ma'am.
Now.
Phil, Larry and Susie pick themselves up. They stare at
the pyre. Phil is close to tears, and Susie puts her arm
around him. For a moment, Phil thinks he sees the flames
morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin.
The image disappears when Larry speaks.
LARRY
Maybe too much fuel.
PHIL
Nah, I just didn't factor in the
booze inside of him. Gram
always...
He breaks off as a flashing police light appears in the
darkness, followed by a siren.
PHIL (CONT'D)
I think our work here is done.
Larry and Susie run to the car. Phil lingers a moment,
looking down at the flames. Then he follows the others.
The police car arrives at the scene.
Barbara and the cop
get out. He peers into the flames.
TRAFFIC COP
How do you know it's your
boyfriend?
BARBARA
(sarcastically)
I recognize that birthmark on his
shoulder. Look, can I make an
observation?
TRAFFIC COP
Be my guest.
BARBARA
We're in the desert. It is dark.
If you want to catch someone in
the dark, it's best not to turn
on big flashing lights and make a
loud noise with a siren.
TRAFFIC COP
Do you want to know what I think,
ma'am?
BARBARA
No. But I'm really, really keen
to find out.
The traffic cop stares into the fire.
TRAFFIC COP
I think it was suicide. He just
wanted to get away from you.
We hear Gram's: 'Return Of The Grievous Angel' or some
similar music.
We follow Bernice as she drives through the desert, and
into Los Angeles. We follow her through the city streets,
and we stay with her as she parks.
Fade down music.
Phil turns to Susie.
PHIL
Where d'you think you might be
when I'm done?
101.
CON TINUE D:
SUSIE
I'll be waiting.
PHIL
Yeah, but where?
There is a small moment of tension, before Phil grins at
her. They kiss.
SUSIE
Get out of here.
Finish it.
Phil pats Bernice's battered wing as he walks away and over
to where Larry is waiting. They cross the road and walk
into a building through heavy wooden doors. Pull back to
reveal a sign: 'Los Angeles Police Department'.
FADE UP ON SUPER: Phil Kaufman and Larry Osterberg
appeared in West L.A. Municipal Court on November 5, 1973 -
Gram Parsons's 27th birthday. Since a corpse has no
intrinsic value, the two were charged with misdemeanor
theft for stealing the coffin and given a token punishment:
$708 in damages for the coffin, and a $300 fine for each of
the bodysnatchers.
