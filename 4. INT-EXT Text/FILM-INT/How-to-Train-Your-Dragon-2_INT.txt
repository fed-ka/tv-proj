Stoick rushes down a circular stone staircase into the vast,
bustling cave that houses the dragon stables.
STOICK
GROUND ALL DRAGONS!
HICCUP
What? Why?!
Hiccup, Astrid, Gobber, and Toothless chase after Stoick.
STOICK
SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM
DOORS!
HICCUP
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is
happening?
GOBBER
You heard the man! Lock it down!
Behind him, the massive storm doors rattle as they're
lowered.
STOICK
No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off
this island until I give the word!
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24.
HICCUP
Because some guy you knew is
stirring up trouble in some faraway
land?
Stoick turns to Hiccup, gravely serious.
STOICK
Because Drago Bludvist is a madman.
Without conscience or mercy. And if
he's built a dragon army... gods
help us all.
Stoick continues on shouting orders, leaving Hiccup stewing.
STOICK (CONT'D)
Get them into their pens! Quickly!
Hiccup chases around to confront Stoick.
HICCUP
Then let's ride back out there.
We'll follow those trappers to
Drago and talk some sense into him.
STOICK
No. We fortify the island.
HICCUP
It's our duty to keep the peace!
STOICK
Peace is over, Hiccup. I must
prepare you for war.
HICCUP
War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our
dragons, we can't wait around for
him to get here. Let's go find him
and change his mind.
STOICK
Some minds won't be changed,
Hiccup. Berk is what you need to
worry about.
(BEAT)
A chief protects his own.
Stoick heads off, calling out more orders...
STOICK (CONT'D)
SECURE THE STABLES! LATCH EVERY
STALL!
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 25.
... leaving Hiccup eyeing Toothless as the storm doors close.
Astrid approaches him, seeing the determination on his face.
ASTRID
Hiccup, don't.
HICCUP
I have to.
He gives her a quick peck on the cheek.
STOICK
THIS WAY! QUICKLY!
Hiccup and Toothless BLAST PAST, heading for the exit.
STOICK (CONT'D)
HICCUP!
They try to fly through one door, but it seals shut.
HICCUP
Come on!
Toothless spins around and DIVES through the gap in the
second lowering storm door.
STOICK
Hiccup!
Astrid and Stormfly blow past Stoick and slip through the
storm door before it shuts, leaving Stoick fuming.
FLASHBACK
A hulking, cloaked figure strides confidently into fire-lit
hall, interrupting a council meeting of Viking chieftains.
His face is masked in silhouette.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 32.
STOICK (V.O.)
Into our midst came a stranger from
a strange land, covered in scars
and draped in a cloak of dragon
skin. He carried no weapon and
spoke softly, saying that he, Drago
Bludvist, was a man of the people,
devoted to freeing mankind from the
tyranny of dragons.
ON STOICK, some twenty years younger, seated in a throne,
studying the impudent stranger with suspicion.
STOICK (V.O.)
He claimed that he alone could
control the dragons and that he
alone could keep us safe, if we
chose to bow down and follow him.
The Viking council erupts in mocking laughter.
BACK TO PRESENT
Snotlout, Fishlegs, and the Twins snicker.
RUFFNUT
Stupid.
TUFFNUT
Good one.
STOICK
Aye. We laughed, too...
BACK TO FLASHBACK
STOICK (CONT'D)
Until he wrapped himself in his
cloak and cried out, "Then see how
well you do without me!"
Drago Bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and
marches toward the door. Above, dragon fire rips through the
ceiling, bringing down flaming timbers, followed by dragons
covered in heavy metallic armor. They BLAST FIRE as panic
ensues.
STOICK (V.O.)
The rooftop suddenly burst into
flames, and from it, armored
dragons descended, burning the hall
to the ground.
BACK TO PRESENT
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 33.
STOICK
(STINGING REGRET)
I... was to only one to escape.
The Twins, Snotlout, and Fishlegs exchange spooked glances.
STOICK (CONT'D)
(TO HICCUP)
Men who kill without reason cannot
be reasoned with.
HICCUP
Maybe.
Hiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless, determined. Eret
watches intently.
STOICK
Hiccup...
HICCUP
I'm still going to try.
Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
This is what I'm good at. And if I
could change your mind... I can
change his, too.
(TO TOOTHLESS)
Come on.
Toothless and Hiccup TAKE TO THE AIR, leaving everyone
stirring in awkward silence.
Astrid mounts Stormfly, about to go after him.
ASTRID
Let's go.
STOICK
NO! Lead the others back to Berk.
I've had enough mutiny for one day.
Astrid stirs, conflicted, as Stoick stomps toward
Skullcrusher, fuming. He passes Ruffnut, who's busily
fondling Eret's biceps as he lays crushed under Grump.
RUFFNUT
Ooh, I like that.
STOICK
Ruffnut!
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 34.
RUFFNUT
(PETULANT)
Ugh! Okay!
The WILD RIDE suddenly gives way to a MULTILEVEL, CAVERNOUS
CHAMBER made of ice and columns of basalt rock. It's heavily
populated with dragons of all kinds, looming in the shadows.
Hiccup is dropped in the center. He scrambles to his feet,
calling out into the darkness.
HICCUP
We have to head back for my dragon!
A HISSING dragon CLOSES IN, sniffing, leering, aggressive.
Hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade,
waving a swirl of fire around himself. The dragon pauses,
intrigued, and then watches hypnotically as Hiccup pacifies
him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade.
The warrior watches keenly from the shadows.
Several aggressive dragons close in behind Hiccup. Hearing
their hisses, he quickly stows the blade, replaces a
cartridge in its hilt, then flips it around and sprays a
perimeter of Zippleback gas around himself. He clicks the
lighter, igniting a flash ring. The testy dragons recoil.
He then reaches through the smoke, offering his open hand.
The dragons re-approach, sniffing him with calmed curiosity.
ON THE WARRIOR
... tilting his masked head, curious. He dismounts his dragon
and approaches Hiccup.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Who are you? The Dragon Thief?
Drago Bludvist?
The warrior circles Hiccup in silence, taking in his gear,
his dragon blade, his face.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Do you even understand what I'm
saying?
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 37.
The warrior whirls and HAMMERS his staff. In response, a
large dragon ASCENDS from the depths, carrying...
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Toothless!
Toothless is dumped on the ground next to Hiccup, sopping
wet. Hiccup rushes to him, petting him reassuringly.
Toothless coos in relief.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
It's okay. I'm glad to see you,
too, bud. You really had me worried
there.
The warrior rattles his staff at a nearby dragon. In
response, it and the surrounding dragons produce firelight
from their throats, spotlighting Hiccup and Toothless.
The warrior sets down his staff and shield, then approaches
Hiccup, cautiously and animal-like.
Toothless SNARLS and circles Hiccup defensively, but then
instantly yields to the stranger's outstretched hand. With a
quick, disarming gesture, the warrior lays Toothless down in
a state of bliss. Hiccup is astounded.
The warrior's hand continues toward Hiccup's face. He
recoils, but the warrior persists, finding the faint scar on
Hiccup's chin, glinting in the firelight.
The warrior GASPS and retreats a few steps.
WARRIOR
(whispered, shaken)
Hiccup?
(BEAT)
Could it be? After all these years?
How is this possible?
The voice is surprisingly female.
HICCUP
Uh, should I... should I know you?
WARRIOR
No. You were only a babe...
The warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA,
40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast.
VALKA
... but a mother never forgets.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38.
Hiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast.
VALKA (CONT'D)
Come...
(Scene 1400 - A New Family)
CLOSE ON Hiccup, flustered, winded, chasing VALKA through
tightly winding corridors.
HICCUP
Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come
back here!
VALKA
This way. Come.
HICCUP
You can't just say something like
that and run off! You're my
mother?! I mean, what the -- do you
grasp how INSANE it sounds?!
(BEAT)
I have questions!
VALKA
Come. Quickly!
Hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to
clamber over a tall rock, unsuccessfully.
HICCUP
Where have you been all this time?
Toothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
What've you been doing?! They said
you were dead! Everyone thinks you
were eaten by...
Hiccup trails off as he enters...
... a stadium-sized chamber teeming with ferns, waterfalls,
hot springs and THOUSANDS of new DRAGONS.
Hiccup wanders in, basking in the in the amazing sight: a
dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate,
filled with dragons of every shape and kind.
He spots Valka clinging to a basalt overhang, watching him.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 40.
HICCUP
This is where you've been for
twenty years?
She nods from her perch.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
You've been rescuing them.
She nods again, this time with a smile.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
Unbelievable.
VALKA
You're not upset?
HICCUP
What? No. I don't know. It's a bit
much to get my head around, to be
frank. It's not every day you find
out your mother is some kind of
crazy, feral, vigilante dragon
lady.
Valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself
to the ground like a skilled acrobat.
VALKA
At least I'm not boring... right?
HICCUP
I suppose there is that...
(feeble, trailing off)
... one... specific... thing...
Excited dragons rush up to greet Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup
pets a few, marveling at the vast dragon utopia before him.
VALKA
Do you like it?
HICCUP
I don't have the words.
Toothless SNARLS in annoyance as the curious, smothering
dragons SNIFF every part of him.
VALKA
Can I... ? He's beautiful!
She reaches out to stroke Toothless, who PURRS at her touch.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 41.
VALKA (CONT'D)
Incredible. He might very well be
the last of his kind.
She inspects his talons as Toothless rolls onto his back,
nuzzling her.
VALKA (CONT'D)
And look, he's your age! No wonder
you get along so well.
Hiccup smiles, astounded by Toothless' affection for Valka.
She checks his teeth. They recede into the gums at her touch.
VALKA (CONT'D)
And retractable teeth? Ah!
How did you manage to--
HICCUP
--I found him in the woods. He was
shot down and wounded.
She winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to
caress a few of her own rescued dragons.
VALKA
This Snafflefang lost his leg to
one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.
This Raincutter had her wing sliced
by razor netting. And this poor
Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree
snare... then left to die alone and
scared.
(re: Toothless' tail)
And what of this? Did Drago or his
trappers do this, too?
HICCUP
Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm
actually the one who shot him down.
She glares, confused.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
It's okay though. He got me back.
(playfully, to Toothless)
Right, bud? You couldn't save all
of me, could you? You just had to
make it even. So... peg leg!
Hiccup rattles his prosthetic leg with a smirk. Valka
observes their playful rapport with curiosity.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 42.
VALKA
What did your father think of your
Night Fury friend?
HICCUP
He didn't take it all that well.
She mutters in agreement.
HICCUP (CONT'D)
But then... he changed. They all
did. Pretty soon everyone back home
had dragons of their own.
She smiles at Toothless, dismissive.
VALKA
If only it were possible.
HICCUP
No, really, I --
VALKA
-- Believe me, I tried, as well.
But people are not capable of
change, Hiccup. Some of us... were
just born different.
FLASHBACK CONTINUED
Cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof,
sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner.
Valka rushes in, panicked.
VALKA (V.O.)
One night, a dragon broke into our
house, finding you in the cradle.
Valka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only
to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY
HICCUP innocently plays with one of its talons.
VALKA (V.O.)
I rushed to protect you, but what I
saw... was proof of everything I
believed.
Valka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak.
Spooked, Cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally
SCRATCHING baby Hiccup's chin.
Their eyes meet. Valka lowers her sword, transfixed.
VALKA (V.O.)
This wasn't a vicious beast, but an
intelligent, gentle creature, whose
soul reflected my own.
Stoick's AXE spins through the air between them, barely
missing Cloudjumper and planting into a pillar.
STOICK
Valka, run!
Alarmed, Cloudjumper WHIRLS around at Stoick and BLASTS!
Stoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the
wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze.
The dragon moves toward Stoick, but Valka grabs hold.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 44.
VALKA
Don't!
It turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated.
STOICK
Hold on!
Stoick dashes through the fire toward Hiccup and pulls him
out of the cradle. He pulls his axe from the pillar...
VALKA (O.S.)
No! Stoick!
... but in a WHOOSH of smoke and embers, the dragon and Valka
are GONE.
STOICK
VALKA!
VALKA
(DISTANT)
Stoick!
Stoick and baby Hiccup watch helplessly as the dragon spirits
Valka away into the night sky.
STOICK
Valka...
ON BABY HICCUP'S FACE, with the fresh nick on his chin...
MATCH CUT TO:
PRESENT DAY
HICCUP'S FACE, with the matching scar.
VALKA
You and your father nearly died
that night, all because I couldn't
kill a dragon.
HICCUP
Yeah, it runs in the family.
VALKA
It broke my heart to stay away, but
I believed you'd be safer if I did.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45.
Hiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing
the sting of remorse.
HICCUP
How did you survive?
VALKA
Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm
me. He must've thought I belonged
here...
She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace,
overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring
waterfalls. Half-submerged in the warm lake below, a massive
white dragon with pronounced, mammoth-like tusks rests
benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that
of a lion surrounded by his pride.
VALKA (CONT'D)
In the home of the great
Bewilderbeast. The alpha species.
One of very few that still exist.
(BEAT)
Every nest has its queen, but this
is king of all dragons.
Dragons land and bow reverentially to the Bewilderbeast.
Valka gestures to the spiked ice ceiling that acts as a
sweating greenhouse.
VALKA (CONT'D)
With his icy breath, this graceful
giant built our nest. A safe haven
for dragons everywhere.
On HICCUP, putting it together.
HICCUP
Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's
responsible for all that
destruction?
VALKA
He protects us. We all live under
his care. And his command.
They pass an eggshell-littered NURSERY. HATCHLINGS dart out
of it, greeting them excitedly and inciting chaos. Toothless
is overwhelmed by their manic picking and scratching.
Cloudjumper balks and sends them scattering.
VALKA (CONT'D)
All but the babies, of course...
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 46.
The hatchlings clamber on top of the Bewilderbeast and play
on his massive tusks, despite his authority. Valka laughs.
VALKA (CONT'D)
... who listen to no one.
The Bewilderbeast lets out a frosty SNORT, sending off the
youngsters to spread more mischief.
Now awakened, The Bewilderbeast raises his gargantuan head to
take a closer look at Hiccup, coming eye to massive eye.
Valka bows in his presence. As does Toothless.
VALKA (CONT'D)
I've lived among them for twenty
years, Hiccup, learning their ways,
discovering their secrets...
He acknowledges Hiccup with another icy snort, slicking back
Hiccup's hair in a frosty veneer. Valka laughs.
VALKA (CONT'D)
He likes you.
HICCUP
Wow.
She chuckles, delighting in his awe.
VALKA
You must be hungry.
HICCUP
Uh, yeah. I could eat.
VALKA
Good. It's feeding time.
Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, trying to
befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He
grimaces and follows Valka out.
(Scene 1800 - Family Reunion)
Hiccup reattaches his flight suit while standing on a ledge
overlooking the utopian nest, teeming with dragons. Several
babies race in to hassle Toothless as he naps.
HICCUP
(DETERMINED)
Well, bud, we can't wait around for
Drago to attack this place. We've
gotta find him first. Let's go.
Suddenly, a thick hand clamps down over Hiccup's face --
muffling his scream!
Toothless whirls around to find STOICK, towering over Hiccup.
He calms Toothless with a touch and releases Hiccup.
STOICK
Easy now.
HICCUP
Are you kidding me? How'd you get
in here?
STOICK
The same way we're getting you out.
HICCUP
We?
Gobber appears in the arch of a tunnel.
GOBBER
All clear!
STOICK
Toothless. Come.
They hurry back into the winding corridor.
HICCUP
Dad! There's something you need to
know!
STOICK
Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.
HICCUP
This isn't an on-the-way kind of
update, actually...
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 60.
STOICK
I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.
HICCUP
... more of the earth-shattering
development variety.
STOICK
Yeah, just add it to the pile.
HICCUP
Dad, unlike most surprises I spring
on you, this is one you'll like. I
promise! You just have to handle it
delicately, so...
They round a tight bend in the corridor to find Gobber
staring blankly at something unseen in the next chamber. He
shuffles past Stoick and Hiccup, dazed.
GOBBER
Uh, you might want to take this
one. Oh, boy.
Stoick draws his SWORD, then braves into the chamber ahead.
HICCUP
Dad, can you put the sword away...
please?
Stoick GASPS as if seeing a ghost... and drops his sword with
a clatter.
Valka stands some twenty paces ahead of him, blocking the
path. She lets out an audible SHUDDER upon seeing him.
He removes his helmet slowly as Hiccup, Gobber, and Toothless
appear at Stoick's side.
VALKA
(RATTLED)
I know what you're going to say,
Stoick. How could I have done this?
Stayed away all of these years. And
why didn't I come back to you? To
our son.
Stoick steps towards her, wide-eyed and speechless. Dragons
emerge from the recesses behind Valka, hissing protectively.
VALKA (CONT'D)
Well, what sign did I have that you
could change, Stoick? That anyone
on Berk could?
(MORE)
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 61.
VALKA (CONT'D)
I pleaded so many times to stop the
fighting, to find another answer,
but did any of you listen?
GOBBER
This is why I never married.
(BEAT)
This and one other reason.
Stoick continues to close the gap, mesmerized. With every
step, Valka becomes increasingly flustered. She backs into an
ice wall, with nowhere to go, and Stoick just a few paces
away.
VALKA
(TEARFUL)
I know that I left you to raise
Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd
be better off without me. And I was
wrong, I see that now, but...
Stoick gently reaches a hand toward her face.
VALKA (CONT'D)
Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go
on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!
STOICK
You're as beautiful as the day I
lost you.
His words snuff her retort, rendering her speechless. She
softens despite herself, yielding her cheek to his palm. He
caresses her skin as a reluctant tear runs through his
fingers. He PULLS her into a KISS. She resists briefly, then
gives in. The surrounding dragons softly RETREAT in kind.
Hiccup gapes, warmed by the sight of his parents reunited.
AFTERNOON
(Scene 1850 - The Last Dance)
As Toothless and Cloudjumper hover for scraps, Stoick and
Valka prepare skewers of fish. She's overwhelmed, lost in her
thoughts, and covering it up poorly.
HICCUP
Mom, you'd never recognize it!
Where we used to make weapons, we
now build saddles, wing slings --
we even fix dragon teeth! You
wouldn't believe how much
everything's changed!
Valka offers a skittish half-smile and hands him a plate.
STOICK
Our son's changed Berk for the
better. I think we did well with
this one, Val.
HICCUP
Thanks, Dad.
Stoick places his hands on Valka's shoulders. She flinches,
dropping the plate.
Cloudjumper steals the fish before Toothless can get to it.
Toothless whimpers, and as a sign of acceptance, Cloudjumper
regurgitates the fish so Toothless can have some.
VALKA
I'm... a little out of practice.
STOICK
(SWEETLY)
Well, y'know... I didn't marry you
for your cooking.
GOBBER
(to Hiccup and Grump)
I hope not. Her meatballs could
kill more beasts than a battle axe.
(MORE)
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 65.
GOBBER (CONT'D)
I've still got a few knocking
around in here. Ha ha!
Gobber takes a bite, gags, and dump the entire plate of fish
skewers into Grump's mouth like a trash can.
HICCUP
And once you move back in, with all
of your dragons, Drago won't even
stand a chance. Everything will be
okay!
Stoick can see that Valka is overwhelmed. He lays a hand upon
Hiccup's shoulder, calming him.
STOICK
Slow down, son. It's a lot to take
in.
HICCUP
Oh. Gotcha.
Valka crosses the room to fill a flask with water, back
turned to the group, as Stoick eyes her sympathetically. He
decides on a different approach... and whistles a familiar
tune.
ON VALKA, as her eyes widen, stirred, recognizing the melody.
She turns away from Stoick, as the water overflows from the
flask.
GOBBER
Oh, I love this one!
Stoick approaches her delicately.
STOICK
(WHISPERED)
Remember our song, Val?
Hiccup watches him, curious, as Stoick FUMBLES THROUGH THE
FIRST VERSE of an old Viking courting song:
STOICK (CONT'D)
(SINGING SOFTLY)
I'll swim and sail on savage seas,
with ne'er a fear of drowning. And
gladly ride the waves of life, if
you will marry me.
Valka avoids his gaze, wallowing in a mess of emotions.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 66.
STOICK (CONT'D)
(SINGING)
No scorching sun, nor freezing cold
WILL --
GOBBER
(SINGING)
-- will stop me on my journey!
(catching himself,
EMBARRASSED)
Sorry.
Stoick scowls at him, then returns his attention to Valka.
STOICK
(SINGING)
If you will promise me your
heart...
Stoick pauses, setting Valka up for her part of the duet.
STOICK (CONT'D)
And love...
Stoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but Valka closes
her eyes, rejecting his invitation. He lets out a heavy-
hearted sigh. But nostalgia gets the better of Valka. She
softly SINGS HER PART:
VALKA
(SINGING)
And love me for eternity.
Stoick beams. She brushes past him, setting into the center
of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation.
Stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a
beautiful dance to accompany the song.
VALKA (CONT'D)
(SINGING)
My dearest one, my darling dear,
you mighty words astound me. But
I've no need of mighty deeds, when
I feel your arms around me.
The dance is full of charming missteps as Stoick and Valka
recreate a moment from their past, before Hiccup's wonder-
struck eyes.
STOICK
(SINGING)
But I would bring you rings of
gold. I'd even sing you poetry.
(MORE)
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 67.
STOICK (CONT'D)
And I would keep you from all harm,
if you'd stay here beside me.
VALKA
(SINGING)
I have no use for rings of gold. I
care not for your poetry. I only
want your hand to hold. I only want
you near me.
Gobber can't help himself. He drags Hiccup onto his feet so
that he can join in the dancing, too.
GOBBER
C'mon, Hiccup!
VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER
(SINGING)
To love and kiss, to sweetly hold.
For the dancing and the dreaming.
Through all life's sorrows and
delights, I'll keep your love
inside me.
Hiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning
and laughing in each others' arms, reunited.
VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER (CONT'D)
(SINGING)
I'll swim and sail through savage
seas, with ne'er a fear of
drowning. And gladly ride the waves
of life, if you will marry me!
Gobber carries the last note...
GOBBER
(SINGING)
I'm still going...
Hiccup taps him.
HICCUP
Gobber!
GOBBER
I'm done.
Valka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING.
STOICK
Ah... I thought I'd have to die
before we'd have that dance again.
HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 68.
VALKA
No need for drastic measures.
STOICK
For you, my dear... anything.
She smiles sweetly. Stoick's eyes well with tears. He goes
down on one knee, proposing to her anew.
STOICK (CONT'D)
Will you come home, Val? Will you
be my wife once again?
Toothless nudges Valka closer to Stoick. They laugh as Hiccup
joins them. Stoick throws his arm around him.
STOICK (CONT'D)
We can be a family! What do you
say?
Valka, between tears and laughter, turns to Hiccup.
VALKA
Yes!
Gobber pops his head in.
GOBBER
Great! I'll do the cooking!
They laugh.
STOICK
Thank Odin you didn't listen to me,
son. We never would have found each
other.
Suddenly, Toothless and Cloudjumper suddenly perk up, sensing

HICCUP

and Gothi, who was sleeping under the dragons. Their pupils

The Gronckle's eyes suddenly turn to slits and it, too, takes
wing, knocking over a chair and table as it heads for the
door.
HOARK (CONT'D)
Watch the furniture! Where are you
going?
It barrels out of the hut and into the night sky as the
Viking rushes to the doorway, spotting the same arresting
sight with a gasp.
