      Clark, Owen and Arroyo exit the precinct where a PHOTOGRAPHER 
      and REPORTER spot Clark and move in --   

                                  PHOTOGRAPHER
                    Detective Clark, quick shot for the 
                    Post?

                                  REPORTER
                    Day one Detective, how does it 
                    feel?

                                  CLARK
                    Just getting settled.  Sorry to be 
                    short but we got to run.

      Arroyo and Owen take in the press, wondering where the fuck 
      they came from.  Clark notes their palpable disdain.   

                                  REPORTER
                    Something jump off?  

                                  CLARK
                    You know I can t talk about it.  We 
                    got to go.

      Clark moves to Owen s car where Owen has the passenger door 
      open for him.  

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  Been like this all month.  

                                  OWEN
                    Yeah, I get it.  

      Before Clark can get in, Owen slams the door --

                                  OWEN (CONT D)
                    What am I, your chauffeur?  Open 
                    your own damn door.  

      Cute.  Clark realizes just how it s going to be with his new 
      partner: shitty.  He gets in the car.  They re off.

                                        ACT ONE


      An Upper West Side nightclub, cordoned off by police tape 
      guarded by Uniforms.  Owen and Clark arrive and approach --

                                  OWEN (CONT D)
                    You know what to do when we get 
                    inside?  

                                  CLARK
                    H.I.C. hand book says we secure --

                                  OWEN
                    Nothing.  You do nothing.  Watch 
                    and listen.  

      Clark takes a deep breath, nods.  They enter --


      Clark pounds down the fire escape as Gaez gets to the bottom 
      level and DROPS ten feet to the ground.  Clark follows fast, 
      DROPS to the alley.  But where the fuck is Gaez?!  Diaco and 
      Dart are rushing up from the mouth of the alley --

                                  DART
                    Behind you!

      Clark turns and A BRICK IS SMASHED INTO HIS FACE.  Clark 
      stumbles but, eyes ice cold, he grabs Gaez, SLUGS HIM one-
      two, one-two and down goes Gaez.    

      Diaco and Dart converge and pounce on Gaez.  Owen and 
      McKenzie arrive.  Clark is panting, blood running down his 
      face.  He s a disaster but smiles big, hamming it up -- 

                                  CLARK 
                    Where s the cameras?  I m ready for 
                    my close-up.  

      Diaco chuckles, then the others, all regarding Clark with a 
      new respect.  Clark sees Owen looking up to 

      ON TOP OF THE FIRE ESCAPE: Arroyo looks down, his face 
      serious, maybe even... disappointed?  Did he hope Clark would 
      get blasted in the apartment?  Off Clark, radar up.  


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    40.


                                      ACT THREE


      Clark and Owen haul Gaez to the Station House where 
      Lieutenant Kang is waiting.  Diaco, Dart, Arroyo and McKenzie 
      arrive and approach.  Kang indicates Gaez --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG 
                    Get him upstairs.

      He stops Owen and Clark.  Arroyo takes note, expression cold. 
      Kang checks the thin cut across Clark s nose --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG (CONT D)
                    That needs a stitch.

                                  CLARK
                    I don t need to sit in an ER when I 
                    could be interrogating Gaez. 

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    Who said that was happening?

      The Lieutenant looks to Owen for an evaluation --

                                  OWEN
                    He duked it out good with Gaez.  
                    And he wasn t bad with Deaundre.  
                    Maybe worth a shot.

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG
                    I thought Deaundre  just gave it up 
                    in the car ?

      Oops.  The Lieutenant takes a moment.  Then, to Owen --

                                  LIEUTENANT KANG (CONT D)
                    You run the interview.

      Lieutenant Kang moves off.  Clark is thrilled, heads inside --

                                  OWEN
                    We got to talk first.


      Clark drags Jackson to his car and opens the back door to 
      stow him, but before Jackson gets in --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    She came when I was bartending and 
                    saw me talking to a old girlfriend.  
                    Talking.  But Agnes flipped and 
                    threw down like a jealous psycho.  
                    My ex got in a shot before I could 
                    break it up.    

      Clark faces Jackson.  This could have some validity --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    You think locking me up s going to 
                    solve her problems?  She s no 
                    angel.  

      Clark throws Jackson in the car and slams the door.  He goes 
      to the trunk and retrieves an evidence baggie for the two 
      HEROIN BINDLES.  He studies them a moment, a plan forming --                                                                                      50.



      Clark stands outside the precinct, thinking.  He takes out 
      the evidence baggie of heroin.  He thinks a moment, then...  
      he grabs his cell and dials.  After a beat --

                                  CLARK (TO THE PHONE)
                    Gemma, it s Walter Clark.  About 
                    that offer? 


      A huge line outside.  Clark, decked out in a slick new suit, 
      walks to the velvet rope and flashes his gold shield.  The 
      BOUNCER checks it out, checks Clark s face, recognizes him -- 

                                    BOUNCER
                    Yo, open a lane, hero coming 
                    through!

      Clark enters past a gauntlet of jealous MEN and fine WOMEN, 
      the word  hero  rolling around in their brains. 


      Clark is standing on the corner, staring up at a fancy upper 
      west side building.  He nervously jingles the keys --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                          (mutters)
                    He s using all his little tricks to 
                    get away with murder...    


      Owen, carrying a travel mug, exits his house and heads to his 
      car, fumbling with his keys.  He looks up and jumps.  Clark 
      is by Owen s car, holding a bakery box --

                                  OWEN
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  CLARK
                    We got to take a ride.  Danish?


      A rundown North Jersey gun store in a strip mall.  Nearby the 
      turnpike roars. 


      Clark s like a guy who s struck gold --

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Why would he buy ammo unless he 
                    planned to shoot someone?  No way 
                    Esten could even call it an 
                    accident.  He cabbed it out to 
                    Jersey to buy ammo then went to the 
                    club to kill Trevonn Clay.   
                    Straight up murder.

      Owen hears in, processes the information --

                                  OWEN
                    That s about as good a piece of 
                      circumstantial evidence as we re 
                    going to get.                                                                                     57.


      Clark has a massive smile --

                                  CLARK
                    Who gets a homicide collar their 
                    second day in the unit?  Tell me 
                    that s not...
                          (Owen is cold)
                    What?

                                  OWEN
                    How d you wind up here?  Give me 
                    the links of the chain.

      A beat --

                                  CLARK
                    I told you, I figured he bought 
                    ammo so I canvassed gun stores --

                                  OWEN 
                    Way the hell out in North Jersey?  
                    And you said he  cabbed it out 
                    here ?  How d you come to that?
                          (Clark is pensive)
                    Don t make me interrogate you, 
                    junior.

                                  CLARK
                    I got information that Esten took a 
                    two hundred and fifty dollar cab 
                    ride two days ago.  I checked with 
                    the cab company and they gave me 
                    this place.

                                  OWEN
                    Who told you this information and 
                    how d you know what cab company?  

                                  CLARK
                    It was on the receipt.

                                  OWEN
                    Which you got from where?

      A beat --

                                  CLARK
                    Esten s apartment.

                                  OWEN
                    You broke in?!                                                                                        58.


                                  CLARK
                    I evened the score.  That rich 
                    prick is using every trick to dodge 
                    a murder, so I used a little trick 
                    of my own. 

      Owen is reeling --

                                  OWEN
                    All this information, useless.  If 
                    it gets out he walks.  And you 
                    dragged me into it.
                          (seething)
                    Two more damn years and I m done.  
                    You will not screw that up for me.  
                    You made it to the unit on luck but 
                    maturity and patience is what gets 
                    you to belong.  You got neither.  
                    Learn or get out, junior.
                          (beat)
                    You go home and don t say a word 
                    about any of this.  

      Off Clark, head spinning --


      Clark (33) is looking out at the view of New York --

                                  DALY
                    That s how you got the scar?  From 
                    the brick?
                          (off Clark s nod)
                    At that point was there any hint of 
                    how bad things would get with 
                    Arroyo and Owen?  Or that murder 
                    suicide, or the precinct shoot out? 

      Clark shakes his head, introspective, a little sad --

                                  CLARK
                    I had no idea what was coming.  But 
                    like I said, it was a long road.  
                    Next question?

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK


                                        THE END
