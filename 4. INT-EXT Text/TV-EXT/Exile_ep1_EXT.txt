      jumping into the driver s seat.  Engine sparks.



      That same car speeding towards and past camera.  As it does 
    so, we spin the shot to reveal a motorway sign.

    THE NORTH 



      Summer storm. 

      Rain hammering down, biblical, making a Northern SERVICE 
      STATION look even more bleak than usual.



    TOM exits the service station and pulls up his collar 
      against the driving rain.  The weather matching his mood. 
    He trots back to his car, and dives inside.  

    He sits for a moment, lost, then stabs the key into the 
      ignition and starts the car.

    The WINDSCREEN WIPERS swish into action and we

    TOM driving along A roads.  Eyes just focused straight 
      ahead, almost trance-like, as if he is scared of where he 
    is going, what lies ahead of him...

      ...as we watch the landscape changing slightly.  We move 
      away from the densely urban and start to witness 
      countryside, greenery, small towns.

    TOM clocks a sign for BACUP.



      Bacup.

      TOM s car slides through the piss-wet streets.  As he 
      crawls slowly through the town centre he peers out of the 
    car window, trying to recognise the town he left behind all 
      those years ago.  He passes various shops, pubs, a park.  
      Plus a LARGE PROUD TOWN HALL BUILDING. 

    And his conclusion?

                                  TOM
                    Shithole.



      TOM s car pulls up across the road from a large Victorian 
      House, probably worth a few bob.  But slightly tatty round 
    the edges these days.  Needs some TLC.

      Rain lashes down.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      5.

    TOM stares, from the car window, at the house. And as we

      FLASHBACK

    To a bright summer s day, early 90s, the day when a younger 
      TOM, rucksack over his shoulder, facial bruising and 
      healing cuts, slams out of the house, flicking Vsign. A *
      young woman,NANCY, comes to the door - upset.*

                                  NANCY*
                    Tom, Tom, not like this, please, 
                    don t leave like this -

    TOM doesn t break his stride.

                                  TOM
                    It s not you, it s him.

                                  NANCY*
                    He didn t mean it, please, talk 
                    to him.

                                  TOM 
                    I ll call you.

                                  NANCY*
                    Tom, Tom. 

    She watches him leave, her brother.  Distraught.*

    End flashback.

    And back to TOM, watching that old house, through the piss 
      rain.  He takes a deep breath.  Doesn t want to be here.  
    But the time has somehow come...



    TOM ringing on the doorbell.  Long and insistent.  Until 
      eventually... it opens and there stands

      NANCY RONSTADT.  His older sister.  Think Clare Rushbrook, 
    but with a face that frowns more than it smiles. 

      Who, upon setting eyes on him, laughs.

                                  NANCY
                    Jesus, you must be in the shit.



    TOM pads the stairs, nervously.  He walks along the 
      landing, where - ahead of him - he sees the door to the 
      study slightly open, he walks towards it.  Then stops.

    And we flashback, for the briefest moment to:

    THE MOST TERRIBLE BEATING.  GROWN MAN laying in with fists 
    as a TEENAGER huddles protectively on the floor.

    End flashback.

    TOM edges forward.  Very carefully, very quietly.   He 
      peers inside.

    The study is packed with FILES and BOOKS and BINDERS.

      SAMUEL RONSTADT - late 60s, a once large man now somewhat 
      reduced in physical presence, stands with his back to us, *
      rifling - in a flurry of activity - through various 
      BOXFILES and PADS and BINDERS.

    He mutters to himself, a stream of sentences which seem to 
      have a purpose but which don t go anywhere.  

    TOM watches from the doorway.  Hold on his face.  

                                  SAMUEL
                    ...where isit? Wendy? I m 
                    looking for the Sanderson! Why 
                    haven t... For heaven s sake, why 
                    can t we have a decent filing 
                    system in here.  Wendy? WENDY!   

    He turns around - as if looking for Wendy and comes face to 
      face with TOM.  SAMUEL stops dead in his tracks.

                                  SAMUEL (CONT'D)
                    Where s Wendy?

    TOM stares at his father - who is in the grip of 
      Alzheimer s - he looks physicallyokay but there s an 
      intensity to his facial expression.  

    TOM doesn t know what to say.

                                  TOM
                    She s gone.

                    Gone?  Gone where? Where s she *
                    gone?

    TOM is suddenly lost for words.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      10.

                    Well, get her back.

      SAMUEL turns and starts faffing through the files again, 
      repeating exactlywhat he was doing before.

    TOM stares for a long time, then, croaks.

                                  TOM
                    Dad.

      SAMUEL ignores him.

                          (louder)

      Still nothing.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Dad, it s Tom. Your son, Tom.

      Suddenly SAMUEL stops, turns and smiles.

                                  SAMUEL
                    Tom?  Tom?TOM!

    And bizarrely, SAMUEL bounds over to him and throws his 
      arms around him.  Hugs him tightly.

                                  SAMUEL (CONT'D)
                    Good to see you, greatto see you

                          (confused)
                    Fine, yeh, no problem.

      They come out of the hug.

      NANCY standing in the doorway, they lock eyes.

      Deserted service station. TOM exits with a coffee and 
      paper.  He dodges a late night wagon -

                    Tom? The days where he doesn t

                    where he spits his tablets down

                    them out by hand. Or how about

    TOM walks up the path to Samuel s house.  NANCY opens the 
      door.  Neither say anything, they don t need to.

    TOM heads inside.



    TOM exits to find SAMUEL just standing there, chisel in 
      hand, looking bewildered at the garden.

    He realises his father is shaking.  As he reaches him, TOM 
      sees the total confusion on his father s face.

                    Where s it gone?

      More confusion.  SAMUEL looks at the chisel in his hand and 
      suddenly throws it full tilt at the imaginary conservatory.  
    It SMASHES through the back window.

    TOM exhales, startled by the violence of this outburst.



    TOM exits the house, closes the door and heads off down the 
      street, escapingagain. 

    But this time, by foot, locally.



    TOM walks the streets of the town he grew up in.  It s no 
      longer a place he recognises.  The place - which once had 
    an elegance - is now shuttered down, grey and lifeless.  
    The only signs of life are chippies and pubs. Youths hang 
      around in clusters, all white, all aimless. 

      TOM, couldn t care less, he walks through the middle of a 
      small group of testosterone filled lads.  

                                  TOM

                    Oy!  Reprobates. 

      They all stare at him, eyes that could kill.

                    Don t know who sells decent coke 
                    round here, do you?



      Seedy transaction.

    TOM digging a TWENTY out of his wallet  He offers the money 
    to the DEALER YOUTH, who hands him a bag of coke.

    But as TOM goes to take it, DEALER YOUTH punches him in the 
      stomach and legs it with the coke andthe cash.

    TOM bent double in pain, yells -

                                  TOM
                    What s this - rehab!



    The Friendship pub.  TOM still in pain, enters.  As he does 
    so, he encounters TWO MEN YELLING INTO EACH OTHER S FACES.  
      They re seconds from extreme violence. 

    TOM sidesteps them, with a wry look.  He enters.

    TOM heads to the bar.   He looks round the place.  It s 
      clearly changed a lot since he was last here.

    But it s still a dump.

      It s the antithesis of the kind of London drinkerys TOM has 
    got used to. A few locals cast him vague  recognition  
      looks, but none really care that much. 

    TOM eyes the arse of the thirtysomething ginger barmaid, 
      MANDY, as she refills the bottle coolers. She s seen better 
      days but she is still in good shape.

    As she rises, she clocks him looking.

                                  TOM 
                    Pint of lager, whisky chaser.  
                    Actually, make it a double. 
                          (offers conciliatory 
                          smile)
                    And whatever you re having.

    She gives him a tight smile.  Starts pulling the pint.  TOM 
      looks around, and by way of conversation...

    As TOM delves in his wallet for a note, she eyes him 
      carefully, as if mentally assessing something.

    TOM feeding coins into the jukebox.  He flips through the 
      various albums as the BARMAID sweeps past collecting 
      glasses.  She stares at him, until he turns to face her.

                    I ll take that as a yes. 

    TOM smiles.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    What about United winning the 
                    treble?

      SAMUEL turns to him, blank.

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Dementia s not all bad then.

      NANCY starts heading over with ice creams.  TOM tries one 
      more question -

                                  TOM (CONT'D)
                    Do you remember mum? You remember 
                    Edith, before she died?

                                  SAMUEL
                          (turns in panic)
                    Edith s died?  

                                  TOM
                          (calming tone)
                    It s okay, she died years ago.

                                  SAMUEL
                    Edith s died?  

                                  TOM
                    Dad, she was ill, you looked 
                    after her - 

                                  SAMUEL
                    Edith s died.

      NANCY arrives back to see the scene before her.

                                  SAMUEL (CONT'D)
                    Edith. Edith! Edith!


                                                                            (CONTINUED)              Exile  - episode one by Danny Brocklehurst      51.

                    It s okay, it s alright.

      SAMUEL starts sobbing with upset.  NANCY embraces him and
