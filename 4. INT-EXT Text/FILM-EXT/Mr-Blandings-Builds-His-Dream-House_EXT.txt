As CAMERA MOVES UP it and TOWARD a window:
BILL'S VOICE
For fourteen years Jim and Muriel
had been living in their apartment
over on East Seventy-fourth Street.
It was just another of those wonderful
crisp September mornings and the
Blandings were still asleep. Just
like millions of other people in
good old Manhattan -- New York City --
U.S.A.
The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:
DISSOLVE
Jim and Muriel precede Smith as they exit from the house. As
Jim and Muriel carry on a sotto voce conversation, Smith
looks off with some concern in the direction of the road.
MURIEL
It's wonderful, Jim! That master
bedroom with those two closets!
JIM
Shh!
MURIEL
Funkhauser could do wonders with
this --
JIM
(firmly)
Funkhauser will have nothing to do
with this house! Shh!
Smith's face suddenly brightens as a weatherbeaten old car
appears, turns up the driveway, stops.
HACKETT
(calling)
Hi, George!
SMITH
Hi, Eph!
(to the Blandings;
feigned surprise)
What do you know, it's Eph Hackett,
owner of the place!
JIM
(pleased)
Well, you don't say.
Eph Hackett gets out of the car, saunters over. Hackett is a
middle-aged, rural-looking, taciturn New Englander
SMITH
Eph, this is Mr. and Mrs. Blandings --
from New York City.
HACKETT
Howdy.
THE BLANDINGS
How do you do?
MURIEL
You certainly have a lovely place
here, Mr. Hackett.
HACKETT
(briefly)
Ye-ap.
JIM
(pleasantly)
Mr. Hackett, we've just been talking
to Smith here about -- uh -- taking
the old place off your hands.
Hackett exchanges the briefest of looks with Smith who almost
imperceptibly shakes his head "no."
HACKETT
(firmly)
Ain't for sale!
As the Blandings react with dismay:
SMITH
(smoothly)
Why don't you folks just go out in
back and take a look at the orchard?
He gives them a wink which says, "Just leave it to me." The
Blandings exchange a look, turn and walk off.
HACKETT
How'm I doin', George?
SMITH
Nice timin', Eph. Think we got
something here.
HACKETT
They the same people you showed it
to in nineteen-thirty-eight?
SMITH
They were lookers -- this is the
real thing.
HACKETT
If they got five thousand dollars on
'em. don't let 'em get away.
SMITH
They already offered ten.
HACKETT
(mildly)
Y'don't say... What's my asking price?
SMITH
Fifteen...
HACKETT
A mite stiff...
SMITH
I've got 'em measured.
(mellower)
They're gonna take the place for --
(turns, looks back at
house)
eleven thousand.
HACKETT
Make it eleven thousand five hundred
fifty.
SMITH
Odd kind of figure.
HACKETT
Might as well take the commission
out of them instead of me.
As Smith raises a knowing eyebrow:
DISSOLVE
Comprehensive Shot showing village green of a small, typical,
quaint New England town.
DISSOLVE
LONG SHOT - The Blandings' car. The Blandings and Bill Cole
driving along. They approach a fork in the road which leads
to a very old covered New England bridge. On the bridge is a
sign which reads:
SHRUNK MILLS
2 Mi.
They pause, turn, go through the bridge.
There is another fork in the road. Muriel points to the road
to the right. Jim shakes his head, points to the road to the
left. Muriel points to the right. Jim emphatically shakes
his head, puts the car in gear, drives off on the road to
the left.
LONG SHOT - THE CAR
LONG SHOT - the car. It goes up to the top of a hill, stops,
starts up, disappears.
DISSOLVE
As the car approaches, the CAMERA discloses it is back at
the same covered bridge. The car stops.
Jim backs up and, over Muriel's protestation that they go
right, turns the car left.
DISSOLVE
LONG SHOT - THE CAR
LONG SHOT - the car. It drives up an empty road, disappears.
DISSOLVE
As the car approaches, the CAMERA reveals it is again back
at the old covered bridge. The sign still reads: "SHRUNK
MILLS - 2 Mi."
Jim, Muriel and Bill stand a little distance from the house,
looking at it. A vast lilac spreads across it. The Blandings
are in quiet rapture, and it is Bill who speaks first.
BILL
(frank and open)
Well, I must admit it's a very
beautiful thing.
MURIEL
(misty)
The house and the lilac are just the
same age, Bill; if the lilac can
live and be so old, so can the house.
It just needs someone to love it,
that's all.
Three shingles slide from the roof. As Jim and Muriel react:
BILL
It's a good thing there are two of
you -- one to love it and one to
hold it up.
As Jim gives him a look:
BILL
What'd your engineer say when he
checked over the foundation and that
roof?
JIM
Who needs engineers? This isn't a
train, you know.
BILL
I just saw it move.
JIM
This house has been standing since
the second year of the Continental
Congress. You take one look at it
and shingles start to fall off!
As if on cue, a few more shingles slide off the roof, nearly
hitting Jim.
BILL
(solicitously)
Look -- let me do you a favor. I've
got a client, crackerjack structural
engineer, Joe Apollonio; he
practically built the George
Washington Bridge single-handed.
JIM
Thanks a lot, but we're not building
a bridge.
BILL
He's the follow who advised the
Government not to raise the Normandie --
they didn't listen to him, cost them
five million dollars.
JIM
You have my word, if I were raising
the Normandie, I wouldn't make a
move without Apollonio.
(indicates door)
Now would you like to come inside
and look around?
BILL
(a skeptical look at
the roof)
No thanks, I'll just stay out in the
car and listen to "Life Can Be
Beautiful."
As Jim opens the door and disappears, there is a crash,
followed by a series of other crashes. Muriel looks in, turns
back to Bill.
MURIEL
I think you'd better contact Mr.
Apollonio.
DISSOLVE
Near the front entrance. After a moment, the door opens, and
the Blandings and Mr. Apollonio emerge. Jim, limping, is
aided and abetted by a cane. Apollonio is a stolid, New York
construction man, replete with derby, blue serge suit, and
cigar. A short rule sticks out of a back pocket. As they
emerge, the Blandings are hopefully enthusiastic; Apollonio
is thoughtfully noncommittal.
MURIEL
It has charm, hasn't it, Mr.
Apollonio?
APOLLONIO
(through his cigar)
Uh-huh.
JIM
Of course, any small changes would
have to conform with the character
of the countryside.
APOLLONIO
(through his cigar)
Mm-hmm.
MURIEL
And yet still be functional.
Apollonio casually walks over to the corner of the house,
kicks an exposed beam. It crumbles, apparently rotted by
termites. Two shingles fall off. The Blandings watch him
anxiously.
APOLLONIO
(gazing upward;
oblivious)
Uh-huh.
As he thoughtfully rubs his chin, Jim, followed by Muriel,
limps his way over to him.
JIM
Well, uh, what's your professional
opinion?
Apollonio looks at the Blandings, at the house, then back at
the Blandings. He takes the cigar from his mouth.
APOLLONIO
Tear it down.
JIM
(appalled)
Tear it down??!
APOLLONIO
If your chimney was shot and your
sills was okay, I'd say go ahead,
fix her up. If your sills was shot
and your chimney was okay, again I'd
say go ahead, fix her up. But your
sills are shot and your chimney is
shot.
During this speech Apollonio picks up a wooden frame, squares
it with a pocket square, levels it on a fence, and looks
through it at the house.
APOLLONIO
(beckoning)
Take a look at the way she sags.
The Blandings step over, look through the frame.
WHAT THEY SEE.
What they see. Outlined against the frame, the house slants,
sagging perceptibly.
THREE SHOT AS THE BLANDINGS REACT WITH SOME DISMAY
THREE SHOT as the Blandings react with some dismay.
APOLLONIO
So I say don't throw good money after
bad -- tear it down.
JIM
(coolly)
Thanks a lot.
APOLLONIO
It's okay.
He tips his hat, walks out of scene.
JIM
(bitterly)
Bill Cole and his experts!
MURIEL
(bitterly)
Darling, we'll get our own experts.
DISSOLVE
The Blandings have just finished surveying the house with
Mr. Simpson, another expert.
BILL'S VOICE
And so they got their own experts.
Mr. Simpson said --
SIMPSON
Tear it down.
The Blandings look at each other.
FAST DISSOLVE
The Blandings have just finished examining the house with
Mr. Murphy, another expert.
BILL'S VOICE
On the other hand, Mr. Murphy said --
MURPHY
I think you'd better tear it down.
The Blandings smile feebly.
FAST DISSOLVE
The Blandings and Jones, another expert.
BILL'S VOICE
And then just to be a wee bit
different, Mr. Jones said --
JONES
(firmly; deep bass
voiced)
Tear it down!
The Blandings are now considerably shaken.
DISSOLVE
A SHINGLE.
A shingle. It reads in neat, conservative lettering:
HENRY L. SIMMS
ARCHITECT
BILL'S VOICE
And that's how our friend, Mr. Simms,
came into it.
DISSOLVE
MATTE SHOT)
Old Hackett house matted to show winter sky, bare trees. In
the f.g. bare ground with patches of snow.
Eph Hackett is standing with one of the wreckers. In the
b.g. we see the frame of the old house, firmly intact, the
chimney still standing within it. There are mountains of
shingles, splintered boards and other rubbish, piled about.
The piles are reasonably neat and sorted.
HACKETT
Them beams is worth money. You payin'
him, or he payin' you?
WRECKER
He's payin' me.
HACKETT
How much?
WRECKER
(hesitating)
A thousand.
HACKETT
A thousand!
WRECKER
He squawked, but he paid.
HACKETT
(drily)
Hmm. I guess maybe I got a little
somethin' comin' too.
As he starts out of scene:
VOICE
Okay, boys, let her go!
Tractors attached to chains and cables start to pull.
MINIATURE SHOT
MINIATURE SHOT - What is left of the house collapses.
MATTE OR MINIATURE SHOT
Jim and Muriel are standing there, having watched the
demolition. As the dust settles:
JIM
(sigh)
Well, so far it's cost us thirteen
thousand, three hundred and twenty-
nine dollars and forty-five cents.
MURIEL
But we've got the nicest vacant lot
in the state of Connecticut.
They exchange a look of mixed emotions.
DISSOLVE
SIMMS' NEW PRELIMINARY PLANS
INSERT SIMMS' NEW PRELIMINARY PLANS - Fresh and workmanlike,
a few small sections crossed out where cuts have been
indicated.
SIMMS' VOICE
(wearily)
Something will have to give somewhere,
that I know.
The CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose:
Tesander, a stolid New England well-digger, the soul of
industry and candor, attacks the earth. Jim, followed by
Muriel and Bill, walks into scene, stands by, watching him.
After a moment:
JIM
Oh -- Mr. Tesander --
The motor is making too much noise.
JIM
(louder)
Mr. Tesander!
Tesander looks up, shuts off his motor.
TESANDER
Yep?
JIM
How's it coming?
TESANDER
(considers a moment;
then:)
It's comin'.
With a nod he turns on his motor, resumes work. Jim exchanges
a look with Muriel and Bill.
JIM
No -- no -- I mean --
But he's drowned out by the motor.
JIM
(shouts)
Mr. Tesander!
Tesander patiently stops his motor, looks up.
TESANDER
Yep?
JIM
What I meant was -- how far down are
you?
Tesander looks at his equipment, considers.
TESANDER
Oh -- 'bout a hundred and ninety
feet.
JIM
Well -- isn't that pretty deep?
TESANDER
(thinks it over; he's
not one for snap
judgments; then:)
Yep.
He's about to turn on his motor, but Jim detains him.
JIM
Do you think maybe you'd better try
another spot?
TESANDER
Up to you.
JIM
I mean -- well, have you hit anything
yet at all?
TESANDER
(thinks it over)
Hit some limestone yesterday.
JIM
Is that good?
TESANDER
That's bad.
Jim looks at Bill who shakes his head with mock commiseration.
TESANDER
And right now it looks like we're
coming into some shale.
JIM
That's bad?
TESANDER
That's good.
JIM
Oh...
Jim looks at Muriel for comfort which isn't forthcoming.
TESANDER
'Course it might turn out to be
sandstone.
JIM
That's bad?
Tesander shakes his head, "No."
JIM
That's good?
Tesander shakes his head, "No."
TESANDER
Can't tell. Might be good. Might be
bad. One thing you know -- you got
plenty of shale, sandstone and
limestone.
JIM
...I see.
He turns a little helplessly to Muriel and Bill.
BILL
On a hot day there's nothing like a
nice cool limestone shower.
MURIEL
(sweetly)
Mr. Tesander, just for the record,
of course, what ever happened to
water?
TESANDER
Oh, it's there, all right.
(he smiles, nods,
tips his hat to Muriel)
Just got to be patient.
He turns on his motor, goes back to work. Jim, Muriel and
Bill start to move off.
BILL
If you ask me, this project's getting
a little out of hand.
JIM
(defensively)
Nothing's getting out of hand at
all. I've made a chart of the whole
operation, and --
(indicates Tesander)
with a few minor deviations, I know
exactly what every penny's going to
cost.
MURIEL
Two pennies.
JIM
(coolly)
And just what does that mean?
BILL
(drily)
Meansa we gotta blast.
There is a loud dynamite blast o.s. As a shower of dirt and
rocks cascade down and they run for cover:
DISSOLVE
JIM'S COST CHART
INSERT JIM'S COST CHART - Jim stands casually above the house
holding the line with one hand. The group pushing from below
now consists of Smith, Hackett, Simms, Retch, Tesander, Zucca
and assorted sub-contractors and workmen. As the house moves
up a thousand dollars, Jim firmly pushes it back. It now
rests at $33,500.
DISSOLVE
Muriel, Jim, Bill, Simms and Retch stand at the edge looking
down at the excavation which is partially filled with bubbling
water.
JIM
You mean you hit a spring, a bubbling
spring right here in our cellar?
SIMMS
It'll have to be diverted before
Retch here can lay his cement.
RETCH
(dubiously)
May take a while. Pumps are over in
Jersey.
Tesander walks into scene, looks down at the water.
TESANDER
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
JIM
(mild sarcasm)
Water, Mr. Tesander.
TESANDER
Yep.
JIM
At six feet!
TESANDER
Yep.
JIM
(indicates)
And over there, just thirty-two yards
away, you had to go down two hundred
and twenty-seven feet to hit the
same water.
TESANDER
Yep.
JIM
How do you account for that, Mr.
Tesander?
Tesander considers a moment, rubs his chin, then:
TESANDER
We-ll, way it seems to me, Mr.
Blandings, over here the water's
down around six feet and over there
it's -- uh --
BILL AND TESANDER
-- down around two hundred and twenty-
seven feet.
Jim exchanges a weary look with Muriel.
DISSOLVE
SPECIAL EFFECT: MONTAGE
SPECIAL EFFECT: It consists of a Montage of the following
DISSOLVING SHOTS:
(1) The water being pumped out of the excavation.
(2) The cement mixer pouring cement into wheelbarrows.
(3) The pouring of the cement floor, walls and foundations.
(4) Planks, shingles and plumbing equipment begin to arrive
and are strewn about the property.
(5) The exterior framing of the house begins to go up.
(6) The sheathing is put on.
(7) The roof is constructed.
OVER THIS MONTAGE IS SUPERIMPOSED:
Jim's Cost Chart. - With each successive operation, a new
workman is added to the already considerable group of people
who are pushing the house inexorably upward, this against
the frantic efforts of a slowly weakening Jim Blandings.
DISSOLVE
The exterior sheathing is completed and, in the roughest of
terms, the project begins to resemble a house. Among the
workmen's cars we notice the Blandings' convertible.
DISSOLVE
Two moving vans are approaching the bridge. Behind them is
the Blandings' convertible. In it are Jim, Muriel and the
children. Behind it and attached is a trailer. After a pause,
over this, we hear:
BILL'S VOICE
So-came thirty days -- and they moved.
MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BRIDGE.
MED. CLOSE SHOT - Entrance to bridge. As the cavalcade passes
through we see in the rear of the trailer, jammed among the
household effects, Gussie and a very uncomfortable Mr. Bill
Cole.
BILL'S VOICE
I mean -- we moved.
OTHER END OF BRIDGE AND FORK
The moving vans precede the convertible, make the wrong turn.
Jim stops the convertible at the fork and honks as he
impatiently gestures to the drivers to turn in the opposite
direction. Over this:
BILL'S VOICE
(as Jim would say it)
That's the wrong road! Any fool knows
that!
Jim starts his car up leading the way.
DISSOLVE
The moving vans turn up the new gravel driveway. Jim stops
his car and they all look off at the house, react with
pleasant surprise.
WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - THE HOUSE IS RAPIDLY NEARING
COMPLETION.
WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - The house is rapidly nearing
completion. A half dozen men are finishing the exterior
painting, planing down doors, etc. In front, a couple of men
from the nursery are working on the landscaping. For the
first time we, as well as the Blandings, see the property as
a clean, bright and very attractive new house.
BILL'S VOICE
Well, there she is, bright and shining --
and just about complete -- the
residence of Mr. and Mrs. James H.
Blandings.
MED. SHOT. The car pulls up, stops.
BILL'S VOICE
(efficient scoutmaster)
All right! -- Everybody out.
Everybody piles out of the car. As Jim and Muriel walk toward
the house away from us and Bill, Muriel sentimentally reaches
out, takes Jim's hand.
BILL'S VOICE
Guess you can't blame them for feeling
just a little bit proud.
At the door, Jim stops, indicates that he'd like to carry
Muriel across the threshold.
BILL'S VOICE
(sentimentally)
Look -- he wants to carry his wife
across the threshold. Romantic, isn't
it?
JOAN AND BETSY.
Joan and Betsy. They look on with distinct adolescent
disapproval.
BILL'S VOICE
Ooops! I guess I meant "corny."
GROUP SHOT. OVER MURIEL'S PLAYFUL PROTEST
GROUP SHOT. Over Muriel's playful protest, Jim starts to
pick her up.
BILL'S VOICE
Uh-uh. Watch that sacroiliac. Fifteen
years since you've done this sort of
thing.
Jim manages to lift Muriel.
BILL'S VOICE
Whew! Nice work, Tarzan. Now, let's
see if you can make it into the hall.
Jim carries Muriel over the threshold and into the foyer.
BILL'S VOICE
That's right. Go right in. Don't pay
any attention to the sign.
The CAMERA PANS TO a LOW SHOT of a sign on the floor of the
foyer. It reads:
WET VARNISH
FULL SHOT - FOYER.
FULL SHOT - foyer. In the b.g. is a painter, varnishing the
floor. He looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly
varnished floor being violated. After a couple of steps, Jim
stops, suddenly aware of the painter. The painter rises,
throws down his brush, says something caustic.
BILL'S VOICE
(imitating painter)
Don't mind me, buddy, I just got
through varnishing that floor.
Jim reacts, raises a tentative foot, the sticky varnish
practically holding it to the floor. Jim says something.
BILL'S VOICE
Whose bright idea was this?
The painter says something, points at Muriel. Jim looks darkly
and accusingly at Muriel whose weak smile is an admission of
guilt.
BILL'S VOICE
She just wanted everything to be
nice and shiny on the day they moved
in.
Jim turns and shouts something to the painter.
BILL'S VOICE
Stop painting that floor and put
some planks down in here, or some
thing!
The painter shouts back.
BILL'S VOICE
Okay, mister, but take it easy. The
Republicans ain't in yet, you know.
Jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately
trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps.
Each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish.
As Jim appears, still carrying Muriel, Betsy and Joan catch
his attention, indicate the front wall of the house which is
complete except for the windows. Jim reacts.
BILL'S VOICE
Oh, fine! A house without windows!
We'll just see about that!
Abruptly handing Muriel to Bill he starts off. Ahead of him
and unnoticed are a layer of newspapers which have been spread
out.
BILL'S VOICE
Look out for those papers!
But Jim has stepped on the papers. They stick to his feet.
After a few steps he is aware of it, tries to get rid of
them. After a few hectic but futile attempts, he disgustedly
disappears around a corner of the house, the newspapers
flapping behind him.
Jim flaps his way up to a workman who is staring at a pile
of window casements.
JIM
Where's Simms?
WORKMAN
Around back trying to figure out
what to do about them windows.
JIM
What's the problem? You put windows
up.
WORKMAN
Not these. They don't fit.
JIM
(angrily; control
going)
Oh, they don't, don't they?
He continues on toward the back of the house, the newspapers
flapping beneath him.
Simms and Retch. More window frames are neatly stacked against
the wall. Simms and Retch react as they see an angry Jim
Blandings flap his way into scene, his varnished shoes having
picked up additional paper, shavings, shingles, etc. Retch
hands Jim a sheaf of papers.
RETCH
Oh, Mr. Blandings, you'd better look
these over.
JIM
What's this about the windows?
SIMMS
(calmly)
I'm afraid there's a little slip-up.
These windows seem to belong to a
Mr. Landings in Fishkill, New York.
I talked to Mr. Landings this morning.
JIM
Well, has he got mine?
SIMMS
No, he seems to have some windows
that belong to a Mr. Blandsworth of
Peekskill.
JIM
Where are my windows?!
SIMMS
As near as we can figure out they've
either been sent to a Mr. Benton in
Evanston, Illinois, or a Mr. Bamberger
of Phoenix, Arizona.
Bill wanders into scene, looks over Jim's shoulder.
JIM
What are we supposed to do -- live
the rest of our lives in a house
without windows?
SIMMS
It'll just be a matter of a few days.
BILL
What's a "Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R"?
JIM
How should I know?
BILL
(indicating)
You've got one.
JIM
(reading from bill)
"Furnishing and installing one Zuz-
Zuz Water Soft-N-R, two hundred and
eighty dollars!"
(explosively)
I will not have any such piece of
equipment in my house!
SIMMS
I'm afraid I authorized that, Mr.
Blandings -- to save your boiler and
water pipes.
JIM
From what?!
SIMMS
Rust. The plumbing man assures us
the water from your well is the most
corrosive in his entire experience
in the trade.
BILL
Another first!
JIM
(pursing his lips)
Mm.
(irritably)
Well, if it's necessary, put it in!
We're moving in today, you know and --
RETCH
It's in.
JIM
Oh.
(a final show of
authority; sharply)
Then get me the bill for it!
BILL
(indicating bill)
You've got it.
JIM
All right then.
And he stalks off, his papers, shavings, etc. flapping behind
him.
DISSOLVE
The moving vans are driving away.
The wind is howling, the trees swaying. The lights are on in
the kitchen. CAMERA MOVES UP to the open kitchen window.
It is raining. The lights are on in the buildings.
It is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning. A rural-
looking taxi deposits a weary Jim, who pays the driver. As
the cab drives off, Jim looks speculatively at Simms' car,
which is parked there, yawns, stretches, opens the door and
enters. Under this a slightly sour underscoring of "Home On
The Range."
