Dark. We can make out the FORM OF A TALL MAN SLEEPING ALONE
at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple
the blankets too much.
On the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00.
The man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake. He reaches
out, switches on the light.
NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in
one movement. He has the physical vigor and energy of
someone twenty years younger.
3.
The second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed,
leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed. Or a
prison bunk.
For this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars.
Dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down
the stairs and heads for the front door.
This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the
President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous
man on the planet.
LINGA MOONSAMY comes to full alert as the gate opens. He is
a big, scowling man dressed in a suit. He checks the load on
a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster.
LINGA
Here he comes. Like clockwork.
JASON
It makes him such an easy target.
4.
Behind Linga, in the back seat, sits JASON TSHABALALA, a
naturally tense and suspicious man. Both of them are hollow-
eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline.
They get out of the BMW, fast and quiet. This does not look
good.
The house is now bustling with activity. A pretty member of
the KITCHEN STAFF sets a single place at the head of a big,
formal dining table.
A LADY CHEF stirs the porridge, a KITCHEN ASSISTANT cuts
fresh fruit.
Mandela's PERSONAL SECRETARY, MARY marches out of her small
office with a STACK OF CORRESPONDENCE AND FIVE NEWSPAPERS,
places them neatly next to the table setting.
7.
Outside, Mandela is surrounded by men. Inside, he has
surrounded himself with women of all shapes, colors and ages,
to make up for twenty seven years without.
CUT TO:
MANDELA SHAVES UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM. The razor is dull.
Mandela opens drawers looking for another. He opens a drawer
that is empty but for a WOMAN'S BEADED BRACELET, broken and
shedding tiny colored beads.
Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer,
looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is
warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost
all the time.
But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask
that conceals all emotion, all feeling. This is his prison
face.
This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in
the mirror. It is the face of a man whose long, hard journey
has marked his very soul.
Expressionless, Mandela shaves himself with the dull razor.
OVER, a COCK CROWS and --
CUT TO:
-- a QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS, as the RAINBOW NATION WAKES UP.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Today marks the beginning of a new
era in South Africa --
From the bush to the cities, from shanty towns to ocean-front
mansions, PEOPLE START THEIR DAY.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
-- as President Mandela takes
office in Pretoria, facing issues
that range from economic stagnation
and unemployment to rising crime --
Some start the day with a tea tray placed next to their beds
by discreet black hands, some with nothing more than brown
river water and half a fire-blackened ear of corn for
breakfast.

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
-- while at the same time balancing
black aspirations --
CUT TO:
TV ANNOUNCER
-- with white fears.
Click! The TV is turned off by MR. PIENAAR (late 40's) in
his very modest, blue-collar house.
MR. PIENAAR
(GLOOMY)
I never thought I'd see the day.
Mr. Pienaar turns and addresses his son, FRANCOIS PIENAAR,
27, a big, blond, almost-handsome man with a fighter's face
and mangled ears. Brutal toughness and honor in his
features. A powerful physical presence, possibly dangerous.
Francois drips with sweat, wears running clothes. Whatever
he does, he is strong, fit and driven.
MR. PIENAAR
I feel sorry for you, son. You've
got your whole life ahead of you.
What's it going to be like now?
MRS. PIENAAR (late 40's) enters holding some kind of PROTEIN
SHAKE for Pienaar.
MRS. PIENAAR
Don't be so gloomy.
(handing over shake)
I added vitamins -- there's a
horrible flu bug going around.
Tell Nerine when you get home.
PIENAAR
Thanks, ma.
MR. PIENAAR
I'm telling you, Francois -- look
at Angola, look at Mozambique.
Look at Zimbabwe. We're next.
They're going to take our jobs and
drive us into the sea. Just you
wait.
CUT TO:
9.
-- and catch up with the new President. Mandela is regal in
a magnificent tailored suit. Jason in front, Linga behind.
PORTRAITS of the architects and champions of apartheid look
down sternly on them as they pass.
They pass a WORKER hanging a PORTRAIT OF MANDELA next to one
of De Klerk, the previous President.
ON LINGA, as he smiles at that.
Mandela, on the other hand, looks into the empty offices, and
into the offices being packed up.
Up ahead, the double doors to the OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT,
are closed. Jason speeds up, opens them, pokes his head in,
then opens the doors wide.
JASON
(with great pride)
After you, Mr. President.
10.
Mandela's offices are fronted by a LARGE RECEPTION AREA,
already filled with PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE HIM.
To one side are his CHIEF OF STAFF'S SUITE of offices, to the
other side, the SMALL PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY OFFICE.
Beyond these are MANDELA'S SECRETARIES, TYPISTS AND
ASSISTANTS -- his gatekeepers.
Beyond that is the inner sanctum, MANDELA'S OWN OFFICE.
The phones are ringing off the hook. Fax machines are
chattering. Everyone wants a piece of Mandela.
Mandela enters, Jason and Linga behind him.
MANDELA
Good morning everybody.
ALL
(GREETINGS)
BARBARA MASEKELA, Mandela's CHIEF OF STAFF (and now
Ambassador to the U.S.), emerges from her office, carrying an
arm load of files, folders and papers --
MANDELA
Barbara, good morning. You've had
your hair done. I like it.
-- accompanies Mandela back towards his office.
BARBARA
Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk
about your cabinet appointments and
ministers.
MANDELA
Give me one moment, please.
Barbara waits outside Mandela's office, as he enters ahead of
her.
Mandela stands in the middle of his office, takes a moment to
savor where he is.
11.
Then, he takes off his jacket, hangs it up and is ready for
work.
MANDELA
BARBARA --
Barbara enters.
MANDELA
-- please assemble the staff for
me. Whoever has not already left.
BARBARA
Right now? All of them?
MANDELA
Yes, please.
CUT TO:
What's left of the UNION BUILDING STAFF are packed into the
DINING ROOM. White faces, bitter and resentful. Waiting to
be fired.
Through the glass doors, THEY SEE MANDELA APPROACHING DOWN
THE HALLWAY, Linga and Jason with him.
STAFF MEMBER#1
Here he comes.
STAFF MEMBER#2
He wants the satisfaction of firing
us himself.
They stand up straight, determined to receive the ax with
pride.
Linga and Jason amp up when they see the room full of
restless Afrikaners. At the STAFF DINING ROOM DOOR, Mandela
turns to them.
MANDELA
I'd like you to stay out here,
please.
JASON
But, Madiba ...
12.
MANDELA
I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding
behind men with guns.
Mandela opens the doors and enters. Jason and Linga stay
outside ... just.
Mandela enters, smiles -- gets not one smile in return.
MANDELA
(IN AFRIKAANS)
Gooie more almal.
STAFF MEMBER
(ASIDE)
Does he think greeting us in
Afrikaans makes this any sweeter?
MANDELA
Some of you may know who I am.
This gets a few bitter chuckles. Mandela is at this best
just talking to people, like this. Only, he doesn't just
talk to them, he wades in amongst them, shaking hands and
making individual contact as he speaks to all of them.
MANDELA
Good morning ... how are you ...
thank you for coming at such short
notice ... etc.
QUICK CUT TO:
Mandela is a continual security nightmare. You can see the
tension on Jason and Linga's faces as he disappears into the
throng.
BACK TO:
When Mandela reaches the middle of the room, he stops shaking
hands, and turns slowly as he talks to everybody.
MANDELA
I couldn't help noticing the empty
offices as I came to work today.
And all the packing boxes.
One black man, surrounded by a throng of serious white faces.
13.
MANDELA
Now, of course, if you want to
leave, that is your right. And if
you feel in your heart that you
cannot work with your new
government, then it is better that
you do leave, right away.
He can be tough and blunt, when necessary.
MANDELA
But if you are packing up because
you fear that your language, or the
color of your skin, or who you
served previously, disqualifies you
from working here now, I am here to
tell you, have no such fear.
(BEAT)
Wat is verby is verby. What's past
is past. We look to the future,
now.
This is not what they expected to hear.
MANDELA
We need your help. We want your
help. If you would like to stay,
you will be doing your country a
great service.
Mandela pauses, to look at the faces. They are receptive.
MANDELA
I ask only that you do your jobs to
the best of your abilities, and
with good hearts. I promise to do
the same.
(BEAT)
If we can manage that, our country
will be a shining light in the
world.
CUT TO:
Jason and Linga are right outside the glass doors, looking in
and listening. Jason shakes his head.
JASON
He wants to win them over, one damn
boer at a time.
CUT TO:
14.
Mandela heads back through to his office, Barbara, Mary and
other assistants forming a phalanx around him. Linga peels
off, goes into the security office.
Jason stands at the desk of one of the assistants (JESSIE),
waits for her to finish a call, then:
JASON
Molo, sister.
JESSIE
(FRAZZLED)
It's still morning?
Jason grins.
JASON
When you get a chance, can we see
the schedule for the month? We
need to plan security.
Jessie's phone rings.
JESSIE
(ANSWERING PHONE)
Office of the President, good
morning.
Jessie waves Jason off. He crosses to the security office,
enters.
Once he closes the door behind him, Jason shows his fatigue.
Linga is feet-up on the sofa, sucking on a cup of coffee.
Three more bodyguards -- SAM, KWEZI and WINSTON -- slump in
chairs.
Jason grabs coffee, sits at his desk, puts his feet up with a
groan.
JASON
We need more men.
LINGA
Did you talk to Barbara about it?
JASON
Yesterday.
15.
A knock at the door.
JASON
That's Jessie, with the schedule.
(LOUDLY)
Come in, beautiful.
The door opens -- but what enters is not beautiful.
FOUR BIG WHITE COPS in suits enter, Special Branch written
all over them. ETIENNE VAN ECK, HENDRICK BOOYENS, GEORGE and
WILLEM.
The bodyguards stand up like junk yard dogs protecting their
territory.
JASON
What is this?
ETIENNE
Mr. Jason Tshabalala?
JASON
That's me. Am I under arrest?
Etienne snaps out a crisp salute.
ETIENNE
Captain Van Eck and team reporting
for duty, sir.
Hendrick, George and Willem snap out salutes. Their military
deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body
language of the black bodyguards.
JASON
What duty?
ETIENNE
We're the Presidential bodyguard.
We've been assigned to this office.
(holding out a sheet of
PAPER)
Here are our orders.
Jason takes the orders, studies them, face increasingly
angry.
LINGA
(TO HENDRICK)
You're Special Branch, right?
16.
Hendrick nods, sternly. Linga, Sam, Kwezi and Winston react
to that -- there is a long and brutal history between them
and the Special Branch.
ETIENNE
You'll see that they've been
signed.
JASON
I don't care if they're signed or --
Jason does a double-take when he sees the signature on the
orders: NELSON R. MANDELA.
JASON
Wait here.
Jason storms out, holding the orders. The four black
bodyguards seethe with hostility. The four white bodyguards
stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground.
Mandela and Barbara look over a position paper on something
or other. When Jason knocks and enters, they pause.
JASON
Sorry to disturb you.
MANDELA
You look agitated, Jason.
JASON
That's because I've got four
Special Branch cops in my office.
MANDELA
What have you done?
JASON
Me? Nothing. They say they're the
Presidential bodyguard. They have
orders.
(BEAT)
Signed by you.
MANDELA
Yes. They've had special training,
those boys -- with the SAS. And
lots of experience. They protected
De Klerk.
17.
JASON
Yes, but --
MANDELA
You asked for more men, didn't you?
JASON
Yes, but --
MANDELA
In public, when people see me, they
see my bodyguards, too. You
represent me, directly. The
rainbow nation starts here.
(BEAT)
Reconciliation starts here.
JASON
Reconciliation? Madiba, not long
ago they tried to kill us! Maybe
even these four guys. They tried
and, often, they succeeded!
CUT TO:
Linga, Sam, Winston and Kwezi stare down Etienne, Hendrick,
George and Willem.
BACK TO:
Mandela stares at Jason in an entirely different way -- with
wisdom, compassion and sympathy.
MANDELA
Yes, I know.
(VERY GENTLY)
Forgiveness starts here, too.
Mandela lets that sink in for a moment. He knows he asks for
something very difficult, but he demands it of himself to an
even greater degree.
MANDELA
Forgiveness liberates the soul. It
removes fear. That is why it is
such a powerful weapon, Jason.
(MORE)
18.
MANDELA (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
Please try it.
Jason exhales. He isn't remotely ready to forgive.
JASON
Yes, Madiba. Sorry to disturb you.
Jason turns, leaves. Barbara shakes her head at Mandela.
BARBARA
You ask a lot.
MANDELA
Only what is necessary.
CUT TO:
Things haven't eased up one little bit inside the office.
The silence is deafening. Jason enters, looks them all over.
His face is grim.
LINGA
Can we get rid of these guys, now?
Jason flashes a look at Linga, then -- and this hurts him,
visibly -- he holds out one of MANDELA'S SCHEDULES to
Etienne.
19.
JASON
This is his schedule for the next
month. Let's look it over for duty
assignments.
ETIENNE
Right.
LINGA
What?
Linga and the others are shocked.
LINGA
Jason, I have to talk to you.
Outside.
Linga virtually pulls Jason out of the office.
Just outside the Security Office door, so they keep their
voices low.
LINGA
How can we trust them?
JASON
We can't.
(heading back in)
This is what Madiba wants, okay.
Not okay for Linga, judging by the expression on his face.
When Jason and Linga enter, Etienne looks up from Mandela's
schedule.
ETIENNE
Are there any special orders or
conditions?
JASON
No. Yes. Madiba gets upset if you
don't smile when you push people
out of the way.
HENDRICK
Seriously?
20.
LINGA
Yes, seriously. It's the new South
Africa.
ETIENNE
Madiba?
JASON
The President's clan name. It's
what we call him.
The new bodyguards share a look. They're not comfortable
with "Madiba".
ETIENNE
We'll call him Mr. President.
Jason lifts the schedule.
JASON
Let's get through this.
Still upset and hostile, the black bodyguards look over
Jason's shoulder, the white bodyguards look over Etienne's,
at the month's schedule.
Apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office.
Both teams study and discuss the schedule -- (shop talk tbd
USE THIS TO GIVE US A QUICK GLIMPSE OF A DAY/WEEK/MONTH IN
THE LIFE OF M.)
Etienne shakes his head.
ETIENNE
How's he going to do all this?
When does he take a break?
LINGA
He says he rested enough in prison.
Jason recoils at something he sees on the last page of the
schedule.
JASON
Here's a headache.
LINGA
What?
21.
JASON
A rugby match at Loftus Versfeld.
British Lions against the
Springboks.
HENDRICK
It's going to be a headache for the
Lions, that's for sure. We're
going to donder them.
JASON
I don't care about the game. I
care that the President'll be so
exposed.
LINGA
To thousands of drunken --
ETIENNE
(INNOCENTLY)
-- sports fans?
JASON
Yes. Sports fans.
LINGA
Who didn't vote for him. Who
probably hate him. Who came out of
the womb with guns in their hands.
OVER, THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUND OF PRE-GAME NOISE AT A MAJOR
SPORTING EVENT.
CUT TO:
At the entrance of the tunnel onto the field, LOTS OF COPS in
blue South African Police uniforms.
Behind the line of cops, in the tunnel, we find JASON AND ALL
THE OTHER BODYGUARDS but for Linga. They are keyed-up,
intense -- none more so than Jason.
JASON
(shouting against the
NOISE)
I want your eyes on the crowd at
all times. We're staying in the
middle of the field. He's going to
walk out, shake hands, walk back.
Nothing else. Got it?
They nod. They are like the players at game time, only the
stakes are much higher. Jason looks deeper into the tunnel,
straightens up.
JASON
Here we go.
Mandela strides down the tunnel towards them, wearing a dark
suit. Big crowds energize him. His eyes are alive with
excitement.
One pace behind him, like a huge, dark shadow, comes Linga.
Mandela gives Jason a look, Jason nods.
We follow Mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel --
Jason signals for extra bodyguards to escort Mandela all the
way up to his box. Hendrick, the biggest, leads the way.
Jason stays in the tunnel, along with Etienne. Both men are
in a muck sweat, adrenaline coursing through them.
ETIENNE
Why didn't you stop him?
JASON
Next time, you try.
25.
ETIENNE
Does he do that sort of thing all
the time?
JASON
Ask my ulcer.
(BEAT)
Good thing that was just an orange.
ETIENNE
And good thing he never saw it.
JASON
Oh, he saw it. He sees everything.
(rubbing his ulcer)
I hate rugby.
CUT TO:
In the VIP box, Mandela turns his back on the field as the
game restarts beneath him and continues in the background.
He has BINOCULARS around his neck.
MANDELA
Shall we work while we watch? We
have lots of promises to keep.
Barbara sits to his right, with her ever-present files and
folders.
BARBARA
Yes, we do.
Mary pours tea at the back of the box. Linga stands two
steps behind Mandela.
On Mandela's left, sits the PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY,
a small man with a small man's ruthlessness and drive.
MANDELA
It's not too late, if the boys can
just pick up their game.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
If they don't, heads will roll.
This is unacceptable.
(LEANING FORWARD)
Come on you bloody bastards!
27.
Mandela's expression shows that he has a gentleman's distaste
for profanity. He turns to Barbara.
BARBARA
Where do you want go first, for
foreign investment?
MANDELA
Where the money is. America,
England, Saudi Arabia.
Barbara makes notes.
Mandela lifts his BINOCULARS, but instead of looking at the
rugby, he looks at the crowd.
CUT TO:
MANDELA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- Mandela zeroes in on an
OLD SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG -- the apartheid flag. It is being
held by the FOUR KHAKI-CLAD BOERS (FARMERS). Classic South
African figures from the rural far north, they are already
drunk and suicidally depressed by the turn of events on the
field.
CUT TO:
BARBARA
Do you see all the old apartheid
flags? It's a disgrace.
Mandela lowers his binoculars.
MANDELA
It's also a constitutional right.
BARBARA
Along with the apartheid anthem. I
know. But it's time people moved
on.
Mandela grunts, raises his binoculars again.
CUT TO:
MANDELA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- Mandela finds a SMALL
KNOT OF BLACK SPECTATORS, holding the NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG
and cheering ecstatically.
CUT TO:
28.
MANDELA
Look at that. The whites are
cheering for the Springboks, the
blacks are cheering for the Lions.
Mandela lowers the binoculars.
MANDELA
We did that on the island, you
know. We supported anyone but the
`boks. It really irritated the
warders.
BARBARA
Of course it did.
ON MANDELA as he thinks about this for a moment, then lifts
his binoculars to look at the crowd again.
CUT TO:
MANDELA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- on the knot of black
spectators, who leap to their feet, reacting to ACTION ON THE
FIELD --
Mandela lowers his binoculars, sets them aside, shakes his
head. He knows it's hopeless now. He turns to the Rugby
President.
MANDELA
How long until the World Cup?
RUGBY PRESIDENT
About a year.
MANDELA
Plenty of time for improvement.
29.
The Rugby President can't take it. He stands.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
Mr. President -- I wouldn't get my
hopes up. We're a damn disgrace.
He stomps out of the box, no doubt looking for someone to
fire. Mandela gets back to work.
MANDELA
I want to go to India and
Indonesia, too.
There is a knock at the luxury box door. Linga swings to
face the door, alert, as a UNIFORMED DOORMAN opens it.
The MINISTER OF SPORT (Steve Tshwete), enters.
MINISTER OF SPORT
Sorry I'm late.
He sits down in the empty chair to the right of Mandela.
MINISTER OF SPORT
How's it going?
MANDELA
Very badly.
The Minister of Sport checks the score, winces.
MINISTER OF SPORT
Maybe it's just as well.
Mandela shoots him a sharp look.
MANDELA
Why?
MINISTER OF SPORT
(bending close, talking
QUIETLY)
I've just been at a meeting of the
National Sports Council executive.
There's strong support to drop the
Springbok emblem and colors
altogether.
(gesturing at the field)
If they're playing badly, maybe its
a good time to make a change.
(with barely hidden
RELISH)
(MORE)
30.
MINISTER OF SPORT (cont'd)
This could be the last time we have
to look at the green and gold.
The Minister of Sport shoots a glance at Mandela, to see his
reaction to all this.
Mandela is deep in thought and completely unreadable.
CUT TO:
The atmosphere is absolutely dismal as the men undress and
shower.
Nobody catches anybody else's eye. Huge, powerful, pale
bodies have been ploughed purple with rake marks, bruises and
roasties. Plus, one dark body -- that of CHESTER WILLIAMS, a
skilled wing from the Cape, a reserved and private man.
Pienaar takes off his green and gold jersey, sits, begins
taking off his cleats. His body hurts. He has been raked,
scratched, bruised, and his ankle is swollen.
A noble warrior, defeated.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
Francois Pienaar's team came to
Loftus Versfeld stadium this
afternoon, unprepared and arrogant.
31.
Meet BOLAND BOTHA as he tapes his commentary on the test
match. He is an ex-Springbok player from the boycott years,
now turned ponderous, florid rugby commentator. He is a
household name, and the last word on the state of the
Springboks.
BOLAND BOTHA
They left 80 minutes later with
their tails between their legs,
like whipped mongrels.
(BEAT)
And I, for one, am glad. Not
because we lost, but because
there's now no way to disguise the
fact that we are completely and
utterly unprepared to reenter the
world of top-notch international
rugby.
Boland defines the South African talent for pessimism and
negativity.
CUT TO:
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)
The Rugby World Cup is now less
than a year away, and I, for one,
am relieved that we are the host
nation, and therefore qualify
automatically for the tournament.
Because I'm not sure we would get
in on merit alone.
The Rugby President sucks on a rum and coke, watches Boland
with one of his HENCHMEN.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
Who gets the axe? Someone has to.
CUT TO:
No after-match party this night. Still depressed by the
loss, Pienaar stays home with this fiancee NERINE.
32.
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)
Pienaar's team played without
discipline, without strategy and
without courage.
PIENAAR
He's trying to get them to drop me.
NERINE
He's just bitter because the
Springboks were boycotted when he
played.
PIENAAR
Maybe, but people listen to what he
says.
CUT TO:
Wearing pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers, Mandela multi-
tasks, watching Boland Botha and going through a pile of
correspondence, scribbling notes or signing his name.
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)
They brought shame upon our nation,
and I, for one, can say without
fear of contradiction, that today,
these fifteen so-called men did not
deserve to wear the hallowed green
and gold.
ON MANDELA: a thought, an idea -- a big one -- is churning in
his head. He grunts, turns off the TV, puts the
correspondence aside, stands.
Mary enters with a glass of milk and some pills, on a tray.
MARY
Here's your muti. I warmed the
milk tonight.
MANDELA
You're too good to me.
Mandela takes his pills.
MARY
Your daughter called, to cancel her
visit this weekend.
33.
Mandela pauses, between pills.
MANDELA
Did she say why?
MARY
No, she didn't.
(making it up)
She said to tell you she was sorry.
Mandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill.
MARY
Do you need anything else tonight?
MANDELA
No, thank you. I'm going to bed.
Good night.
MARY
Good night, Madiba. Sleep well.
Mandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the
smile fades. As he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his
face becomes sadder and older and lonelier.
IN HIS BEDROOM, Mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown.
He looks at his bed. It is as smooth and as blank as a sheet
of paper.
He peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them
and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch.
He switches off the light and lies down, still and straight.
The most popular man in the world starts and ends each day
alone.
DISSOLVE TO:
At a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of
second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of MRS. COLEMAN, a
stout and charitable woman. Next to her, MRS. DLAMINI hands
out a lollipop and says --
MRS. DLAMINI
God bless you.
-- to each kid. The clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm
kept by Mrs. Dlamini's "God bless yous".
The last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids
reduces until there is only ONE SMALL BOY (SIPHO) left and
only one article of clothing. An old SPRINGBOK RUGBY
PRACTISE JERSEY. Green and gold.
Sipho could use it. His clothes are more holes than anything
else. He looks at the Springbok jersey mournfully.
MRS. COLEMAN
You're a very lucky boy. It's a
real Springbok practise jersey!
It's a bit big, but it's warm and
it'll last for ever!
Sipho shakes his head.
MRS. COLEMAN
It's yours, take it! Go on.
Sipho turns and leaves. Mrs. Coleman looks at Mrs. Dlamini,
completely confused.
MRS. COLEMAN
Why won't he take it?
MRS. DLAMINI
If he wears it, the others will
beat him up.
MRS. COLEMAN
Because the Springboks are playing
so badly?
MRS. DLAMINI
No. Because, for them, the
Springboks still represent
apartheid.
CUT TO:
35.
An NSC FIREBRAND has the podium and the microphone.
NSC FIREBRAND
... and now for the next item on
our agenda.
The hall is jammed. Very few white faces.
NSC FIREBRAND
The NSC executive proposes a full
membership vote on the following
motion ...
A ripple of anticipation goes through the delegates.
NSC FIREBRAND
... that as a prominent symbol of
the apartheid era, the colors,
emblem and name of the Springboks
be eliminated immediately ...
That causes a stir. The delegates understand how big this
is.
NSC FIREBRAND
... and that all sports teams
representing South Africa shall be
known forthwith as the Proteas.
Excitement and noise level rises. The NSC Firebrand has to
shout through his mike.
NSC FIREBRAND
(SHOUTING)
We will submit this motion to a
hand vote.
(MORE)
36.
NSC FIREBRAND (cont'd)
In the event of a close count, we
will go to a written ballot.
(the moment he's been
WAITING FOR)
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF ELIMINATING
THE SPRINGBOKS, RAISE YOUR HANDS.
The NSC firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air.
With a roar, the delegates respond, raising their fists.
Unanimous. The Springboks are history.
ANOTHER ANGLE, as ONE OF THE OLDER DELEGATES steps outside to
make a call.
CUT TO:
At his desk, Mandela puts down his phone. Anger in his eyes.
He slams both palms down hard on his desk.
CUT TO:
Both bodyguard units (minus Jason) are crammed into the small
office. The black bodyguards murmur amongst themselves in
Xhosa. (Ad-lib.) The white bodyguards talk Afrikaans (ad-
lib).
No talk between the two units, only tension.
Tension broken with a crash as JASON SLAMS THE DOOR OPEN.
JASON
Both units to the cars, right now.
Brusque, scowling, Mandela marches towards the exit, shadowed
by Linga, flanked by Barbara.
BARBARA
What do I tell the Japanese trade
delegation?
MANDELA
I delegate that decision to you.
BARBARA
Do you want me to inform the VP?
MANDELA
No.
BARBARA
We should at least include the
Minister of Sport.
MANDELA
No.
Mandela heads out to the cars. Barbara has no choice but to
follow.
Mandela gets in, closes the door.
BARBARA
You risk alienating your cabinet
and your party.
MANDELA
Your advice is duly noted, Barbara.
38.
BARBARA
Madiba ... the people want this.
They hate the Springboks. They
don't want to be represented by a
team they cheered against all their
lives.
MANDELA
Yes, I know. But in this instance
the people are wrong. And it is my
job as their elected leader to make
them see that.
Mandela leans forward to talk to Linga.
MANDELA
Can you tell the boys that Madiba
wants to go to Eersterust, very
fast.
Linga murmurs into his radio. The convoy pulls out, very
fast. Barbara makes one last plea.
BARBARA
You're risking your political
capital. You're risking your
future as our leader.
MANDELA
The day I am afraid to do that is
the day I am no longer fit to lead.
BARBARA
At least risk it for something more
important than rugby.
Mandela looks out the window, says nothing, angry.
NSC FIREBRAND
... brothers, sisters, comrades, we
in the executive applaud your
diligence and courage.
The NSC Firebrand and the executive applaud the members. The
applause spreads until the hall rocks. They are all very
pleased with themselves.
CUT TO:
As the applause finally begins to diminish, the NSC Firebrand
turns and nods to a CHURCH CHOIR DIRECTOR, off to the side.
The choir director brings his CHOIR onto the stage.
NSC FIREBRAND
Brothers, sisters ... join us in
our anthem.
Anyone not standing, stands. The choir director raises his
hands. The choir inhales. Go.
CHOIR
(SINGING)
Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrica etc (God
Bless Africa) --
But before the first line is fully sung, an ASSISTANT rushes
out, whispers urgently into the NSC Firebrand's ear.
40.
The Firebrand's eyes bug out in surprise. He crosses to the
Choir Director, says something quickly.
The Choir Director stops the choir in mid-chorus.
Consternation everywhere. What's going on?
NSC FIREBRAND
Brothers, sisters, members of the
choir -- we would only interrupt
such beautiful music for something
truly important. In this case, for
someone truly important.
(beat, milking it)
Please welcome President Mandela!
The place goes berserk as Mandela enters, with Linga at his
back, and -- surprise, surprise -- Hendrick Booyens leading
the way.
Face stern and unsmiling, Mandela walks the length of the
hall towards the podium. The delegates press in towards
them.
ANOTHER ANGLE - Jason coordinates security inside and out.
Lifts his radio to his mouth.
JASON
(INTO RADIO)
Smile.
ON HENDRICK, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly
becomes a smile -- which scares the throng more than the
scowl did.
ON LINGA, the same.
ANOTHER ANGLE - Barbara enters at the back of the hall,
accompanied by Kwezi.
Mandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd,
face thunderous.
When they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly.
MANDELA
Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am
here because I feel strongly that
you made a decision today without
sufficient information or
foresight.
He lectures them like a headmaster. They don't like it.
41.
MANDELA
I am aware of your earlier vote. I
am aware that it was unanimous.
(BEAT)
Nonetheless, I propose that we
restore the Springboks. Restore
their name, their emblem and their
colors, immediately.
Instant and complete silence in the hall. This is utterly
unpopular. Shocked faces, especially from the executive and
the NSC firebrand.
ON BARBARA, as she sees her worst political nightmare playing
out in front of her.
MANDELA
Let me tell you why ...
Murmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise.
Mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one.
MANDELA
... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor
Prison, my jailers were all
Afrikaners.
(BEAT)
For twenty seven years, I studied
them. I learned their language, I
read their history, I read their
poetry. I had to know my enemy, in
order to prevail against him.
(BEAT)
And we prevailed, did we not? All
of us here ... we prevailed.
For the first time, Mandela says something the crowd likes.
MANDELA
Our enemy is no longer the
Afrikaner. They are our fellow
South Africans, our partners in
democracy.
Just as quickly, Mandela loses them again.
MANDELA
And they treasure Springbok rugby.
If we take that away, we lose them.
We prove that we are what they
feared we would be.
(BEAT)
We have to be better than that.
(MORE)
42.
MANDELA (CONT'D)
We have to surprise them with
compassion, with restraint, and
generosity.
The grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder.
MANDELA
Yes, I know. All the things they
denied us.
ON HENDRICK, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping
across the crowd, feeling the tension.
MANDELA
But this is not the time to enjoy a
moment's petty revenge. This is
the time to build our nation using
every single brick available to us -
- even if that brick comes clothed
in green and gold.
The crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the
moment.
LINGA is as alert as Hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe.
MANDELA
(ANGRY)
You elected me.
(BEAT)
You elected me to be your leader.
Let me lead you now.
(BEAT)
Who is with me on this?
It's almost as if he's daring them to go against him.
MANDELA
Who is with me?
The murmuring becomes a dull roar of argument and
disagreement.
ON BARBARA as she closes her eyes and lowers her head: this
is a fiasco.
CUT TO:
Silence. Mandela looks exhausted, almost gaunt. Facing his
own people like that took it out of him. Barbara stares out
the window, chewing her lip, totally stressed out.
Linga heaves a great sigh, exhales a truckload of stress.
Jason and his crew travel in stoic silence.
Similar silence from Etienne and crew. It seems like the
silence of defeat.
BARBARA
Twelve votes. Twelve!
MANDELA
A luxury. All we needed was one
more yes than no.
BARBARA
What if you hadn't got it?
MANDELA
Well, as you know, I am an obedient
party member.
Barbara snorts disagreement. She is angry at her boss.
BARBARA
I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got
problems everywhere we look.
Housing, food, jobs, crime, our
currency. You can't keep
interrupting affairs of state to
placate a minority.
MANDELA
But, I must. This minority still
controls the army, the police, and
the economy. Without them, we
cannot address the other problems.
44.
BARBARA
So this rugby, it's just a
political calculation?
Life and energy, flood back into Mandela. He sits up against
his seat belt, faces his Chief of Staff.
MANDELA
It's a human calculation.
(BEAT)
If we take away what they cherish --
the Springboks, their national
anthem -- we just reinforce the
cycle of fear between us.
ON LINGA, in the front seat. He's not supposed to listen --
but how could he not?
MANDELA
I will do what I must to break this
cycle. Or it will destroy us.
DISSOLVE TO:
The sound of cleats approaching on concrete. Exhausted
footsteps. The DRESSING ROOM ATTENDANT PUTS CASES OF BEER
(cans) on a side table, rips them open, backs away --
-- as the Springboks enter silently, faces miserable,
shoulders slumped. They've lost another game.
One of the players grabs a beer, opens it, takes a gigantic
SWIG --
ANGRY SPRINGBOK
This beer tastes like kuk.
-- hurls the beer against the wall so hard it ruptures,
sending foaming beer everywhere.
ON PIENAAR as his eyes flash and he shoots to his feet.
PIENAAR
It's not the beer.
Pienaar picks up a case of beers, goes to the angry
Springbok.
45.
PIENAAR
Take another.
(BEAT)
Everybody take a beer.
This is an order. The entire team takes a beer, including
Pienaar.
PIENAAR
A toast ...
Pienaar cracks his beer, raises it up. They all crack and
raise their beers.
PIENAAR
... to the taste of defeat.
That bewilders his team.
PIENAAR
Drink it. Remember it. And
promise yourself never to taste it
again.
Pienaar takes one long swig --
PIENAAR
You're right. It tastes like kuk.
-- tosses his beer against the wall, so that it ruptures.
Eighteen other beers rupture against the wall. The dressing
room is awash with beer and foam -- and re-kindled passion.
As with Mandela, Pienaar is a leader, on a smaller scale.
CUT TO:
Both units crammed into the small office. As usual, neither
team talks to the other. Jason enters with two files.
JASON
Here's the schedule for the
overseas trip.
Jason and the boys look over one, Etienne and his unit look
over the other -- and discuss it amongst themselves in
Afrikaans. Hendrick says something pointed, which resonates
with the others.
46.
LINGA
What did he just say?
HENDRICK
I said --
ETIENNE
He asked when we were supposed to
sleep.
HENDRICK
As well as other basic human
functions.
JASON
Hey. If Madiba can do it, we can
do it.
CUT TO:
Mandela addresses the General Assembly, thanking them for
their support in the fight against apartheid.
MANDELA
The millions of our people say
thank you, and thank you again.
Linga and Hendrick are his closest bodyguards.
CUT TO:
Mandela addresses diplomats, members of Congress, black
leaders at a made-for-TV ceremony on the South Lawn.
MANDELA
I have come here with a message.
People of the Unites States of
America: Open your markets to us.
People of the United States of
American: Come and invest in our
country.
Linga, Jason, Etienne and Hendrick are in on this one -- a
little island of South Africans in a sea of U.S. SECRET
SERVICE PROTECTION.
CUT TO:
47.
ON TV: footage of Mandela with the Queen, riding down the
mall waving to ecstatic crowds.
TV ANNOUNCER
-- as he concluded a gruelling trip
TO--
Mr. Pienaar MUTES THE TV, so that he can deliver the latest
one-liner to Mrs. Pienaar.
MR. PIENAAR
In related news, it was announced
that President Mandela will be
visiting South Africa this week.
Mrs. Pienaar laughs.
IN THE BACKGROUND, in the kitchen, a plump, middle-aged
Tswana woman washes the dishes and keeps an eye on the TV.
This is EUNICE, the Pienaar's maid.
48.
She does not find Mr. Pienaar's joke amusing.
CUT TO:
Hendrick is being driven home through the Highveld night. He
chews on something really sticky, chewy. He pauses to
dislodge some of it from a tooth, before it pulls out a
filling.
Then, he resumes chewing.
DISSOLVE TO:
On the bedside table, THE CLOCK clicks from 4:59 to 5:00.
Mandela's eyes open in the dark ... close for a second ...
then shoot open again.
It takes everything Mandela has to sit up and switch on the
light.
CUT TO:
Mandela shaves, avoiding his own gaze.
CUT TO:
51.
Shaved, showered and dressed, Mandela descends the stairs,
sits down to breakfast by himself at the big table. He looks
at the newspaper headlines, which talk about CRIME RISING,
THE RAND FALLING, THE MANDELA HONEYMOON OVER etc. etc.
Like any other man, Mandela turns to the SPORTS SECTION for
relief -- and finally finds something to smile about.
ON THE NEWSPAPER: SPRINGBOK COACH AND MANAGER AXED. PIENAAR
STAYS ON AS CAPTAIN.
There is a PICTURE OF PIENAAR. Mandela reacts to it,
pleased.
CUT TO:
As a CABINET MINISTER AND HER ENTOURAGE leave, Barbara
enters, holding an envelope.
MANDELA
Hello Barbara. I like that dress.
BARBARA
Thank you Madiba.
(OFFERING ENVELOPE)
This is for you.
MANDELA
(TAKING ENVELOPE)
What is it?
BARBARA
Your pay checks. You haven't been
collecting them.
Mandela opens the envelope, looks at a check -- and grunts.
BARBARA
What's wrong?
MANDELA
This is terrible.
BARBARA
Madiba, it's what De Klerk got.
Plus an increase for inflation.
But, Mandela shakes his head, outraged.
52.
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Today, President Mandela announced
that, in his opinion --
CUT TO:
TV ANNOUNCER
(on TV throughout)
-- his salary is too high.
Pienaar and Nerine watch the news with MR. AND MRS PIENAAR.
MR. PIENAAR
Dead right. They're all overpaid.
IN THE BACKGROUND, once again, Eunice washes the dishes and
keeps an eye on the TV.
TV ANNOUNCER
He has therefore decided to donate
a third of his monthly income to
charity.
MR. PIENAAR
Give me the houses and cars they
give him and I'll donate a third of
my salary too.
Francois' cell phone rings.
PIENAAR
(to Mr. Pienaar)
You would not. Not in a million
years.
PIENAAR
(ANSWERING PHONE)
Hallo, Pienaar.
Whatever Pienaar hears on the phone sends him out of the room
in a hurry.
PIENAAR
(INTO PHONE)
Hang on a moment, please.
TV ANNOUNCER
President Mandela said that he
wished to set an example to other
leaders and cabinet ministers.
53.
MR. PIENAAR
Fat chance. They're lining their
pockets as fast as they can.
Nerine is interested in the call that sent Pienaar hurrying
out of the room. Mr. Pienaar MUTES THE TV.
MR. PIENAAR
Must be his girlfriend, hey Nerine.
NERINE
He knows I'd bloody kill him.
ON EUNICE, as eyes and ears alive, she finishes in the
kitchen.
Pienaar comes back, stands in the doorway, a stunned
expression on his face.
NERINE
What? Who was it?
Pienaar doesn't answer immediately.
MR. PIENAAR
Told you. It was his girlfriend.
MRS. PIENAAR
Shush!
PIENAAR
I've been invited to tea.
NERINE
Who with?
PIENAAR
The President.
MR. PIENAAR
The President of SA Rugby? Count
your fingers after he shakes your
hand.
Pienaar points at the muted TV.
PIENAAR
The President.
ON THE TV: footage of Mandela with a group of SAUDI PRINCES.
Eunice turns and looks at Francois, wide-eyed.
54.
The Pienaar family all stare at the TV, stunned.
PIENAAR
He wants me over for tea, week
after next.
Eunice picks up her handbag, puts on her coat and heads for
the door, stops when she reaches Pienaar.
EUNICE
Mr. Francois -- you must tell
Madiba that the bus service is very
bad, and too expensive. He must
please fix it.
(LEAVING)
Good night everybody.
MRS. PIENAAR
Good night Eunice, thank you.
All eyes on Pienaar.
MR. PIENAAR
What the hell does he want with
you?
Pienaar shakes his head -- he has no idea.
DISSOLVE TO:
Nerine drives. Pienaar wears a blue blazer, grey slacks and
subdued tie -- and is surprisingly nervous.
NERINE
Francois, relax. You've met him
before.
PIENAAR
I shook his hand on the rugby
field, that's all.
NERINE
You didn't even vote for him.
55.
PIENAAR
He's still the President.
(CONFESSING)
He's had dinner with the Queen.
With Presidents and movie stars.
All I do is play rugby. What if I
pull something stupid in front of
him?
Nerine stops to let Pienaar out. Gives him a kiss,
straightens his hair.
NERINE
You won't. I'll pick you up right
here.
Small office packed with big men.
ETIENNE
See who's coming for tea?
HENDRICK
My nephew wants me to get his
autograph.
LINGA
Who?
ETIENNE
Francois Pienaar.
JASON
Who wants to escort him in?
Hendrick bolts for the door.
HENDRICK
I will.
56.
JASON
No autographs.
HENDRICK
(INSULTED)
I know how to do my job, okay.
Hendrick leaves.
LINGA
Who's this Pienaar?
ETIENNE
You can't be serious? He's the
captain of the Springboks.
Linga shrugs, provocatively indifferent.
LINGA
I like soccer, myself.
ETIENNE
Well, you know what they say about
soccer -- it's gentleman's game
played by hooligans. One the other
hand, rugby is a hooligan's game
played by --
LINGA
Ja, ja, I've heard it before. It
wasn't funny the first time.
Not exactly violin music and roses ... but they are talking
to each other.
Hendrick escorts Pienaar back towards Mandela's offices.
Hendrick is the bigger man.
PIENAAR
Can I ask you a question,
Lieutenant?
HENDRICK
Ja, of course.
PIENAAR
What's he like?
They pause at the office door. Hendrick ponders that
question for a moment, then:
57.
HENDRICK
When I worked for the previous
President, it was my job to be
invisible.
Hendrick opens the door.
HENDRICK
This President ... he found out I
like English toffee and brought me
some back, from his visit to the
Queen.
Hendrick ushers Pienaar into Mandela's offices.
HENDRICK
To him, nobody is invisible.
Hendrick gestures to the waiting area.
HENDRICK
That's where you wait. One of his
assistants will come for you.
(POINTING)
There's a bathroom over there, if
you need it.
PIENAAR
Okay. Thanks.
Hendrick turns to leave, hesitates, turns back.
HENDRICK
What are our chances in the World
Cup? I mean, for real.
PIENAAR
We'll do our best. That, I can
guarantee.
Hendrick nods solemnly, heads back to security. Pienaar
heads straight for the bathroom.
Hendrick enters. Etienne and the other white bodyguards look
up.
58.
HENDRICK
Well, he's not as big as he looks
on TV.
(BEAT)
And we don't stand a bloody chance
in the World Cup.
Pienaar washes his hands, dries them, dries them again, combs
his hair, looks at himself in the mirror, adjusts his blazer.
Pienaar returns to the waiting area, sits.
There is a clock on the wall. One minute to four.
Four Japanese trade officials traipse out, having just met
Mandela.
The second hand journeys up to vertical. When it hits 4
o'clock exactly --
-- Mary walks into the waiting area.
MARY
Mr. Pienaar?
Pienaar shoots to his feet.
MARY
This way, please.
Mary leads Pienaar back to Mandela's own office, knocks,
opens the door.
MARY
Go on in.
Mouth dry, Pienaar nods --
-- and enters the inner sanctum.
Mandela leaps up from behind his desk, crosses the room to
meet Pienaar.
59.
MANDELA
Francois, what an honor. I'm so
excited.
They shake hands.
MANDELA
Thank you for coming all this way
to see me.
Pienaar gulps like a fish out of water.
PIENAAR
Yes, sir. No problem. Thank you
for inviting me.
MANDELA
Tell me. How's your ankle?
PIENAAR
My ankle?
MANDELA
I was told you'd hurt it. Has it
healed?
Pienaar relaxes, visibly. This is small talk he can handle.
This is Mandela's gift.
PIENAAR
The truth is, sir, you never play
at a hundred percent, no matter
what.
MANDELA
Yes ... yes. In sports, and in
life. Come. Sit. Please.
(indicating a chair)
Take this one. Looking into the
light hurts my eyes.
They sit in the chairs.
A KNOCK at the door, and MRS. BRITS the old Afrikaner tea
lady enters, carrying a laden tea tray.
Mandela stands again, immediately.
MANDELA
Ah, Mrs. Brits --
Pienaar stands just a beat slower.
60.
MANDELA
-- you are a shining light in my
day.
MRS. BRITS
Yes sir.
Eyes twinkling, Mrs. Brits puts the tea tray down on the
coffee table in front of them. The finest china, cookies on
a plate.
MANDELA
Mrs. Brits, this is Francois
Pienaar. He's the captain of the
Springboks.
Mandela clearly expects Pienaar to shake hands with Mrs.
Brits. Pienaar holds out his hand --
PIENAAR
(AFRIKAANS GREETING)
Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits.
-- gently shakes hers.
MRS. BRITS
Ek ook, Meneer.
(TO MANDELA)
Shall I pour, sir?
MANDELA
No thank you, I think I'd like to.
Mrs. Brits leaves. Mandela does not sit until the door
closes behind her. Pienaar only sits after he does.
Mandela's manners would not be out of place in Victorian
England.
MANDELA
How do you take your tea, Francois?
PIENAAR
Milk and sugar, please.
Mandela pours tea for both of them.
ON PIENAAR, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he
is, with the President pouring him a cup of tea.
61.
MANDELA
The English have given us many
things, including rugby, but
afternoon tea is one of the
greatest.
Mandela hands Pienaar the tea cup.
PIENAAR
Thank you, sir.
Both men have big hands. Fine china dwarfed and threatened.
In the exact moment that both their hands hold the same
saucer, Mandela looks Pienaar in the eye.
MANDELA
You have a very difficult job.
PIENAAR
I do? I sell gas braais.
Mandela lets go and Pienaar takes the tea.
MANDELA
Captain of the Springboks. A very
difficult job.
PIENAAR
Not compared to yours, sir.
MANDELA
Ah, but then nobody is trying to
tear my head off while I'm doing
mine.
Pienaar grins. True.
MANDELA
It is not so difficult to get
people to do their best. And I
imagine that anybody who plays for
their country does their best,
almost automatically.
PIENAAR
Or they wouldn't be chosen in the
first place.
MANDELA
Yes. But to get people to be
better than that?
(MORE)
62.
MANDELA (CONT'D)
Better than they think they can be?
Now, that is difficult, I find.
PIENAAR
Yes sir, it is.
MANDELA
How do we do that? By example? To
an extent. But there is more to it
than that ...
(searching for the right
WORD)
... inspiration, perhaps.
Pienaar is engrossed. This is a master lesson on leadership,
from a master.
MANDELA
How do we inspire ourselves to
greatness, when nothing less will
do? How do we inspire everyone
around us?
(BEAT)
Sometimes, I think, by using the
work of others.
Long pause. Pienaar knows to keep quiet.
MANDELA
On Robben Island, when things were
very hard, I found inspiration in a
poem.
PIENAAR
A poem?
MANDELA
A Victorian poem. Just words. But
they helped me to stand when all I
wanted was to lie down --
(SUDDENLY DISMISSIVE)
But you didn't come all this way to
hear an old man talk about things
that make no sense.
PIENAAR
No! They make a lot of sense, sir.
(BEAT)
On the day of a big match, say a
test, in the bus on the way to the
stadium, nobody talks.
63.
MANDELA
Yes ... yes. Everybody is
preparing.
PIENAAR
When I think we're ready, I have
the bus driver put on a song I've
chosen; a theme song. One we all
know. We listen together and ...
it helps.
MANDELA
Yes! I remember when I was a guest
at the 1992 Olympic Games in
Barcelona. The whole stadium
welcomed me with a song.
(BEAT)
At the time the future -- our
future -- seemed very bleak. But
to hear that song, in voices from
all over our planet ... it made me
very proud to be South African. It
helped me to come home and do
better. It allowed me to expect
more of myself.
A beat.
PIENAAR
May I ask what the song was, sir?
MANDELA
Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel'
iAfrika. A very inspiring song.
Mandela looks into Pienaar's eyes.
MANDELA
We need inspiration, Francois.
Brown African eyes, blue African eyes meet over their cups of
tea.
MANDELA
Because, in order to build our
nation, we all need to exceed our
own expectations.
Something passes between them. Whatever it is has a profound
impact on Pienaar.
64.
PIENAAR
Yes, sir. We probably do.
CUT TO:
Cameras click and whirr as MANDELA AND PIENAAR SHAKE HANDS
for the press.
(NOTE that there are NO FLASHES.)
CUT TO:
Pienaar walks away from the President's offices, still
processing his meeting with Mandela. He seems a little
stunned and mystified. Something profound just happened --
but he's not quite sure what.
Nerine drives Pienaar away. Pienaar turns, looks back at the
Union Buildings.
NERINE
So ...?
PIENAAR
Hm?
NERINE
What's he like?
PIENAAR
He's ...
(BEAT)
... he's not like anyone I've ever
met before.
An unsatisfying answer. Nerine waits for more. But, she
isn't going to get it without prying it out of Pienaar.
65.
NERINE
Well? What did he want?
This is the question Pienaar is wrestling with, too. He
thinks it over for long enough to drive Nerine crazy.
NERINE
Ag, come on Francois. It's like
talking to a bloody brick wall.
What did he want?
Pienaar turns in his seat, looks at her as realization comes
clear in him ...
PIENAAR
I think ...
(BEAT)
I think he wants us to win the
World Cup.
DISSOLVE TO:
A FRAMED PHOTO OF MANDELA SQUARING OFF AGAINST MUHAMMAD ALI
looks down --
-- on Mandela, who is surrounded by HIS GRANDCHILDREN IN THE
LIVING ROOM. Mandela likes the babies. THEIR PARENTS, shoo
and shepherd the kids, keeping them on their best behavior --
-- for the PHOTOGRAPHERS shooting this family gathering.
Seeing the photographers makes this feel staged.
Mandela looks past the photographers, sees his daughter
ZINDZI glancing in from the doorway, and then moving on.
MANDELA
Excuse me.
Mandela disentangles the babies, stands, leaves.
CUT TO:
In the DINING ROOM, Zindzi looks down at a BIG FRONT PAGE
PHOTO OF MANDELA AND PIENAAR SHAKING HANDS.
She is a modern, cosmopolitan young woman.
When Mandela enters, Zindzi looks up from the newspaper with
a very Mandela-like grunt.
66.
MANDELA
What do you think?
ZINDZI
It doesn't matter what I think.
MANDELA
Yes, it does.
ZINDZI
(DEFIANT)
Okay. I think he looks like one of
the policemen who forced us out of
our house when you were in jail. I
don't like seeing you shake his
hand. And I'm not the only one.
Mandela overreacts.
MANDELA
You criticize without
understanding. You seek only to
address your own feelings. This is
selfish thinking. It does not
serve the nation.
Zindzi shakes her head, turns, leaves.
MANDELA
Wait. Please. I --
Mandela wants to apologize, doesn't know how. Instead, he
pulls AN ENVELOPE out of his pocket, holds it out.
MANDELA
Will you give this to your mother.
ZINDZI
What is it?
MANDELA
A bracelet.
Zindzi looks into the envelope. In it is the BEADED
BRACELET, from earlier, from the bathroom.
ZINDZI
Just throw it away.
MANDELA
I don't have the right to. It's
not mine.
67.
ZINDZI
If she left it here, she meant to
throw it away.
Only children know how to twist the dagger so deftly.
Mandela turns away so that his daughter cannot see his eyes.
A man so at ease with strangers does not know how to talk to
his own family.
CUT TO:
The SAME NEWSPAPER PHOTO of Mandela and Pienaar that Zindzi
was looking at -- only, this time, someone is cutting it out,
very carefully. Eunice.
Mr. Pienaar enters to get something from the fridge, sees
what Eunice is doing. Eunice stops cutting.
Mr. Pienaar looks down at the photo for a long moment. He
doesn't know how to react to it.
EUNICE
Mrs. Pienaar said you were finished
with the paper.
MR. PIENAAR
Ja. Of course.
Mr. Pienaar leaves. Eunice keeps cutting until the photo can
be lifted up. She nods, proud.
OVER, A WHISTLE BLOWS, SHARPLY.
CUT TO:
THE MINISTER OF SPORTS BRIEFS MANDELA on the World Cup, with
the help of a BIG DIAGRAM ON AN EASEL (just like a March
Madness bracket layout, showing all the teams.) The Minister
looks ragged, exhausted.
MINISTER OF SPORT
Four pools of four teams each,
playing in nine different venues
around the country. Two teams will
advance from each pool to the
quarter finals.
Mandela studies the diagram. He loves this stuff.
MANDELA
The Ivory Coast qualified. This is
wonderful.
(For the record, the sixteen teams who qualified were: South
Africa, New Zealand, Australia, England, Scotland, Ireland,
Wales, Canada, Romania, Italy, France, Japan, West Samoa,
Argentina, Tonga and Ivory Coast.)
CUT TO:
MINISTER OF SPORT
Australia won the previous World
Cup. New Zealand won the one
before that.
(MORE)
69.
MINISTER OF SPORT (cont'd)
They're both clear favorites to
reach the finals this time.
(BEAT)
According to the experts, we'll
reach the quarter finals, and no
further.
MANDELA
According to the experts, you and I
are still supposed to be in jail.
That brings a grin from the Minister of Sport.
CUT TO:
MINISTER OF SPORT
You make a personal appearance at
the finals, and at the opening
match between the Springboks and
Australia.
(BEAT)
The finals will be broadcast to
over a billion people around the
world, live.
MANDELA
A billion people watching us!
(wheels turning in his
HEAD)
Yes ... yes. This is a great
opportunity.
CUT TO:
70.
Alone in his office, Mandela looks at the World Cup diagram,
for a moment, then picks up his phone.
MANDELA
(INTO PHONE)
Please call the head of South
African rugby for me.
CUT TO:
71.
Thirty completely wiped-out athletes. Some are too tired to
shower, some have made it that far, but are too tired to
change.
Pienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his
locker.
The SPRINGBOK MANAGER enters, followed by the RUGBY
PRESIDENT.
Pienaar and the boys drag themselves upright.
The Rugby President looks them over as if they were his very
own stable of race horses -- a stable he's not entirely sure
he likes.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
Afternoon men. It's good to see
you working so hard. I have a
short announcement.
(BEAT)
As part of the PR buildup to the
World Cup, you will be conducting
coaching clinics in townships all
over the country.
The players greet this announcement with complete silence.
RUGBY PRESIDENT
I know you have plenty on your
plates already -- but this is a
request that comes from the top.
(looking at Pienaar,
POINTEDLY)
The very top.
The Rugby President turns on his heel, and leaves, followed
by the Manager.
The players say nothing for a long moment, but body language
alone shows that they are completely disgusted.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
This is complete crap.
SPRINGBOK FLANK
Are we some kind of circus act now?
72.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
We don't have time for kuk like
this.
The boys are getting angrier by the second.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
They expect us to play our best, to
give our bloody all, then they add
to our bloody workload ...
The lock turns to Chester.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
What do you think about this,
Chester?
All eyes on Chester, as if the poor guy is a magic guide to a
world they barely understand.
CHESTER WILLIAMS
I try not to think. It interferes
with my rugby.
The perfect answer for these guys.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
See! Now there's a rugby player.
Talk to them Francois.
SPRINGBOK WING
Make them see that this is a waste
of time we don't have.
All eyes on their Captain -- who shakes his head, no.
PIENAAR
I'm not going to talk to them.
SPRINGBOK FLANK
Why not?
PIENAAR
Whether we like it or not, we're
more than just a rugby team. We're
... we're ambassadors inside our
own country. And we might as well
get used to it.
Silence. Rebellious silence. Then:
SPRINGBOK LOCK
Is this you speaking, or Mandela?
73.
Pienaar's eyes are fierce. He needs them to see how serious
he is.
PIENAAR
You know me better than that.
(BEAT)
Times change. We need to change,
too.
It is clear that much of his team disagrees with him.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE-UP ON A TV -- horrible, startling images of the
OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.
TV ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
We're looking at the remains of the
Federal Building in Oklahoma City,
America, which was destroyed today
in a massive explosion.
PULL BACK to reveal that we are in Mandela's offices.
Barbara, Mary, other assistants look on. So do the
bodyguards. All faces stunned, appalled.
Mandela approaches slowly from his office, drawn in by the
horrible, irresistible images. He stands behind his people.
TV ANNOUNCER
No one has claimed responsibility
yet, but authorities say that the
timing and target mark this as the
work of white, right-wing fanatics.
An act of revenge for the FBI
killings in Waco, Texas.
Jason and Linga share a pointed look. South Africa is a
global leader in white, right-wing fanatics.
TV ANNOUNCER
The explosive, a truck bomb, was
apparently a simple mixture of
commonly available industrial and
agricultural materials.
JASON
(TO LINGA)
That's all we need.
(MORE)
74.
JASON (CONT'D)
A homemade explosive from materials
every boer already has.
Then, Jason realizes that Mandela is standing right next to
him.
TV ANNOUNCER
So far, the official death toll
stands at over a 100 people, which
includes at least 12 children from
a day care center in the Federal
building.
Mandela turns to Barbara.
MANDELA
Please call President Clinton for
me. I wish to offer him our
condolences.
Mandela turns to Jason, eyes deep and dark.
MANDELA
Do you see why forgiveness is
essential, Jason?
(BEAT)
Revenge only begets revenge.
As Mandela walks back to his office, there is a look of utter
sorrow on his face.
DISSOLVE TO:
The Springbok squad rides in style. Most are wearing
tracksuits, most are asleep. Pienaar is awake.
CUT TO:
The bus hits a rut in the dirt road with an almighty jolt,
which wakes the sleeping Springboks.
They look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish
outskirts of the township. Every possible incarnation of
poverty, as far as the eye can see.
This shocks them. Most of them have never been anywhere like
this township.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
Shit, I'm glad I don't live here.
The bus pulls up at the field --
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
What the hell are they doing?
The driver sounds the horn again, and the kids on the field
sprint for the bus, hands and pockets full of broken glass.
PIENAAR
Don't forget, we've got TV cameras
on us at all times.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
(MUTTERING)
What a bloody joke.
A cabinet meeting in the rainbow nation, with Mandela at the
head of the table.
The MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT is making a presentation
about a campaign to put an end to littering by plastic bags.
Behind him is a VERY DRAMATIC SLIDE IMAGE of a rural barbed
wire fence festooned with wind-blown plastic bags.
MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT
-- and in addition to the
nationwide PR campaign, we propose
that all retail outlets charge a
nominal fee for plastic bags --
Mary enters quietly, slips a piece of paper in front of
Mandela, who reads it, holds up his hand.
MANDELA
Mr. Minister, please forgive me.
This sounds excellent, and we will
return to it, but if you'll indulge
me for just one minute --
Mandela nods to Mary, who switches on a big TV on the wall --
which shows NEWS FOOTAGE OF THE COACHING CLINIC in the
township.
When we see the FOOTAGE OF THE LOCK SCRUMMING WITH THE KIDS,
Mandela laughs, delighted, turns to his cabinet.
MANDELA
You see, that picture is worth any
number of speeches.
CUT TO:
Mr. and Mrs. Pienaar watch the same report ON TV. Mr.
Pienaar has quite a different reaction to Mandela's.
MR. PIENAAR
Tell me something -- how does this
help them win rugby matches?
DISSOLVE TO:
81.
People -- white people -- clap and cheer as the team enters
the building.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
The green and gold have one week to
put the finishing touches to their
gruelling training program --
The team feeds on the energy. They walk taller, faster,
closer together.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
-- and I, for one, have to admit to
being cautiously excited.
82.
A beautiful Cape Dutch style mansion. Mandela stands in his
HOME OFFICE, watches Boland on TV. The MINISTER OF SPORTS is
with him.
BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)
Which makes beating a powerhouse
Australian side in the Cup opener
next week a tall order, especially
since this is an inexperienced team
with a history of coming up short
in big matches. This is Boland
BOTHA --
Mandela switches off the TV.
MANDELA
Around the world -- objectively --
what are they saying about our
chances against Australia?
MINISTER OF SPORT
Everyone thinks they'll beat us.
And if they do, we'll have to go
through England and the All Blacks
just to get to the Final.
MANDELA
So it is very important that we
beat Australia.
(to Minister of Sport)
Thank you.
83.
The Minister leaves.
Alone in his office, Mandela sits, thinks, gets a sheet of
paper with his PERSONAL LETTERHEAD on it, uncaps his fountain
pen.
OVER MANDELA'S SHOULDER, we see him write, and then
underline, the title INVICTUS by W.E. Henley.
BARBARA KNOCKS, pokes her head in.
BARBARA
The Cabinet Ministers are here to
brief you on the trip to Taiwan.
MANDELA
I'll be right out.
From memory, Mandela writes the first line of the poem:
Out of the night that covers me ...
CUT TO:
All eyes on the stadium as the bus idles past, very slowly.
This is a coach move.
COACH
One week, boys.
Excited faces become grave, serious. The bus goes quiet.
Coach nods to himself, pleased.
-- pinned to a board in the security center.
JASON
We need snipers on top of the
stadium and these surrounding
buildings.
Jason leads the meeting. He uses an old-fashioned pointer.
All of Mandela's security detail present, plus LOCAL COP
BRASS.
LOCAL COP
Not a problem.
JASON
We want these two approaches
completely sanitized.
LOCAL COP
Two approaches?
JASON
We're not going to decide which way
we bring him in until the very last
moment.
(BEAT)
We need uniforms, plain clothes,
sharp-shooters ...
LINGA
And sniffer dogs.
JASON
Yes. No truck bombs, no Oklahoma
City.
The locals stir, share a look. This is going to be a
nightmare.
JASON
We've got an army unit on standby
at Silvermine, if you need more
men.
Not an option the cops favor, judging by their faces.
85.
JASON
We're not taking any chances, okay.
The President's going to be very
exposed.
(BEAT)
Much too exposed.
CUT TO:
The silver Mercedes tools into Cape Town past Groote Schuur.
Mandela travels with Barbara, who opens her first file of the
journey -- but is forestalled by her boss.
MANDELA
Barbara, I have been studying.
BARBARA
For the summit in Taiwan? Good.
MANDELA
No. Not exactly.
Mandela hands Barbara a folded SPORTS SECTION.
MANDELA
Test me.
Barbara unfolds the sports section --
-- to reveal COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SPRINGBOK SQUAD. A
collector's pull-out.
Barbara looks at the photos, shakes her head.
BARBARA
They look like thugs.
Mandela just smiles at that remark.
MANDELA
Block out the names. See if I can
recognize them.
Barbara gives her boss a put-upon look -- this is such a
waste of time! -- but blocks out the first row of names.
Mandela points at the first photo.
MANDELA
Andre Joubert.
(NEXT PHOTO)
(MORE)
86.
MANDELA (CONT'D)
Gavin Johnson.
(BEAT)
Did I get them right?
BARBARA
Yes, Madiba.
MANDELA
(immensely pleased with
HIMSELF)
This is how I used to study in law
school.
(next photo is of Chester)
Unfortunately, Chester is far too
easy to identify. But that will
change. It must.
CUT TO:
Normally a conference room, now equipped with fridge, pool
table, ping pong, sofas, TV etc.
The entire team has assembled, minus Pienaar. A quiet air.
Serious, relaxed.
Pienaar enters, holding a sheaf of XEROXED PAGES, begins to
hand them out.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
What's this? Homework?
87.
PIENAAR
Sort of.
The players look down at the pages.
ON A PAGE: the words to Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, in Xhosa.
One by one, the players look from the page to Pienaar.
SPRINGBOK WING
Cappie? What's this?
PIENAAR
We need to learn it. We can't just
mouth the words anymore.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
Nobody cares, as long as we win
matches.
PIENAAR
They do care.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
It's their song, not ours.
SPRINGBOK WING
It's a terrorist song.
SPRINGBOK PROP
They used to arrest you for singing
it.
PIENAAR
And now it's one of our anthems.
But he's talking to a deeply conservative group of guys.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
Cap. You know I leave my guts on
the field for you, and you know I'd
follow you into a fight anywhere,
any time. But this ...
The hooker crumples the page, is about to throw it away.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
... I can't even read it. I
definitely can't pronounce the
words.
One look at his men, and Pienaar knows he has hit a wall.
88.
PIENAAR
Okay, boys. It's optional. Take
it if you want to.
The players are relieved. Pienaar looks down at the sheet of
paper for a moment, then looks up at the guys.
PIENAAR
It means "God Bless Africa".
(BEAT)
Which you have to admit, we could
use.
Nonetheless, most of the players crumple the pages, toss them
into the closest trash can.
CUT TO:
BOLAND BOTHA
Tell us, Mr. President, have you
always been a rugby fan?
Mandela appears with Boland Botha on his show, under a ONE
TEAM, ONE NATION banner.
MANDELA
People do not realize that I once
played rugby myself, when I was a
student at Fort Hare. It is a very
rough game. Almost as rough as
politics.
Boland laughs.
BEGIN BOLAND BOTHA/MANDELA INTERVIEW SEQUENCE
SHOTS OF BOOZE BEING DELIVERED to people's houses all over
the country by BOTTLE STORE DELIVERY VANS (a very South
African alcoholic enabling service). Lots and lots of booze.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
How do you think the Springboks
will do?
MANDELA (V.O.)
I think they will do very well.
Their level of commitment is
tremendous.
89.
THE SPRINGBOKS TRAIN on an isolated field at the SILVERMINE
ARMY BASE outside Cape Town. Tactics and refinements, not
fitness training.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
Now, it's been said that you used
to support any team who played
against the Springboks.
MANDELA (V.O.)
Obviously, that is no longer true.
I am one hundred percent behind our
boys.
JASON, ETIENNE, LINGA and HENDRICK stand anxiously outside
Newlands Stadium. One of them points to the top of a tall
building nearby -- a Eureka! moment, for reasons we don't yet
understand.
BACK TO THE STUDIO:
MANDELA
After all, if I cannot change when
circumstances demand it, how can I
ask others to?
END BOLAND BOTHA/MANDELA INTERVIEW SEQUENCE
IN THE HELICOPTER, Mandela, Jason, Linga, all wearing radio
headsets. All wearing suits, as if for a state occasion.
JASON
(ON RADIO)
We're going to land you on top of
that building. We'll own the road
between it and the stadium.
Mandela likes it.
Jason gives the pilot a nod and they take off down the
peninsula towards Silvermine Army base.
FROM THE HELICOPTER, MANDELA LOOKS down at his country, and
finds it good.
90.
Mandela points down. Jason and Linga look.
POV FROM THE AIR: They can see the Springboks practising
right below them, on the army base.
Mandela pulls out the SPORTS SECTION with the Springbok team
on it. His study guide. He takes a last minute glance at it
as the helicopter loses altitude.
Jason paces restlessly, going over his mental check list,
making sure he hasn't missed anything.
CUT TO:
Mandela reads, scrawls comments, signs papers from a big "In"
pile. Mary enters with his glass of milk and his pills.
MARY
It's time for bed.
MANDELA
I think I'll stay up a little
longer. The country is excited
tonight.
MARY
You need to sleep. The doctor
said.
MANDELA
The doctor has no sense of
occasion.
94.
Mandela turns on the TV, begins flipping channels. Rugby,
rugby, rugby. Mandela is sucked in.
Mary sighs.
CUT TO:
The coach and the manager. Cats on a hot tin roof.
COACH
There's nothing more we can do.
The game plan's good. It's just a
matter of the boys executing it
tomorrow.
MANAGER
That's Pienaar's job. It's in his
hands, now.
Room dark but for one small desk light. Pienaar stands at
the window, looking out across Cape Town. He is deep in
thought.
Pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where,
under one small light, we see "Invictus", the poem Mandela
wrote out by hand.
Pienaar begins reading it. There is a soft knock at his
door. Pienaar goes to it, opens it. It is Nerine,
accompanied by a cop.
Pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that Nerine can enter.
As soon as the door closes behind her, Nerine says:
NERINE
You know the best thing about you
being the captain?
PIENAAR
Uh ... the honor?
NERINE
You don't have to share a room.
Nerine gives Pienaar a scorching kiss. He resists ... then
responds -- then pulls away.
95.
NERINE
(BREATHLESS)
Francois, come on. It's been
weeks.
PIENAAR
Uh uh. I need to be angry for
tomorrow.
Nerine takes a deep breath, nods, turns away -- and sees the
poem on Mandela's personal letterhead.
NERINE
What's this?
PIENAAR
A poem. From the President.
NERINE
How does a poem help you play
rugby?
PIENAAR
The same way your visit does.
(BEAT)
Inspiration.
OVER, REFEREE'S WHISTLE BLOWS HARD AND SHARP.
SMASH CUT TO:
Mandela looks on, calmly. The Minister of Sport isn't late
for this match. The President of Rugby is pale with nerves.
Behind Mandela, stand Linga and Hendrick. The VIP box is a
safe place, but Jason isn't taking any chances.
CUT TO:
Back to action on the field.
The highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we
saw in the township. This continues the education of those
who do not know rugby.
So, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the
resulting scrum.
We see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting
lineout.
We see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling,
strategic kicking at it's very best. Both teams are crisp
and strong.
INTERCUT SHOTS OF THE RUGBY MATCH --
-- with SHOTS OF THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS (snipers, lots and
lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc. all
overseen by Jason) --
-- with SHOTS OF THE CROWD, which, unlike the earlier test
against the Lions, is completely and passionately united
behind the Springboks (all commentators talk about the
extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) --
-- always returning to the VIP BOX, where something
interesting is taking place right behind Mandela: Linga
Moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his
scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game.
97.
When a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the
box groans, Linga leans towards Hendrick and asks:
LINGA
What happened?
HENDRICK
They scored.
When another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd
roars, Linga asks again:
LINGA
What happened?
HENDRICK
We scored.
A third ball through the uprights. Before Linga can ask:
HENDRICK
They scored again.
A fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box.
LINGA
We scored?
HENDRICK
Ja. We're tied.
A fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild.
HENDRICK
We're up by three.
ACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and
forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line.
Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the
Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the
assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted.
A ripple of concern goes through the crowd --
-- and the VIP box.
LINGA
They're ahead?
HENDRICK
By four.
Nerves in the box.
98.
But not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle
we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession --
-- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the
Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking
the last Wallaby to try and tackle him.
The crowd roars.
In the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with
everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the
waiter.
The difficult, angled conversion is missed.
LINGA
What does that mean?
HENDRICK
We're only ahead by one.
Another penalty kick.
HENDRICK
We're ahead by four.
A drop goal.
HENDRICK
By seven.
An incredible try by the Springbok fly half.
HENDRICK
By fourteen.
Everyone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant
for pessimism begins to abate.
Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows
and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at
the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this
match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY
HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day.
SUDDENLY, A REFEREE'S WHISTLE CREATES PANDEMONIUM on the
field, in the stands, and in the VIP box.
LINGA
What happened?
HENDRICK
We won!
99.
LINGA
We did?
Mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins
the famous "Mandela shuffle" -- a very cool African boogie
that is one of his signature moves. ON THE MANDELA SHUFFLE --
DISSOLVE TO:
-- the same shuffle hours later, at a VIP party. Mandela has
changed clothes, wears one of his Indonesian-inspired "Madiba
shirts" and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning
TROPHY WIFE of one of the VIP's.
TROPHY WIFE
You must be very pleased!
MANDELA
What man would not be pleased to be
dancing with a beautiful woman like
you?
TROPHY WIFE
Oh, Mr. President, you're
exaggerating.
MANDELA
Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa
chief, and therefore a polygamist.
As you know, I am not.
(BEAT)
But when I look at you ... I envy
my father.
The man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. But,
once again, he is dancing with a stranger --
-- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that
Mandela is pushing himself way past empty.
CUT TO:
Jason is asleep on his face, in his suit and shoes.
CUT TO:
100.
-- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off
the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win.
Even though most of the players are with their wives or
girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three
deep, men pay for round after round of beers.
Pienaar and Nerine are part of the action. Then Pienaar gets
a TEXT MESSAGE which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a
chagrined look.
He grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near
the player's ear and screams again the hubbub:
PIENAAR
COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS
IT ON.
The Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the
player next to him, repeats it.
Pienaar watches the message travelling through his team --
and grins.
Then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead
TV's.
ON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The
boogie is followed by a quick "How far we have come" type of
montage. One of the images shows an island ringed by rough
surf.
Pienaar gets an idea.
DISSOLVE TO:
Section B is the bleak political wing. Tiny cells line each
side of a damp concrete hallway.
A PRISON GUARD shows the Springboks into the hallway, and
they dwarf it, as they stand there, shocked. Shocked at what
was done in their names. This group is as quiet as we have
ever seen them.
PIENAAR
Can we see the President's cell?
PRISON GUARD
Yes, of course.
(leading them down past
THE CELLS)
We've done it up just the way it
was.
They reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the
door, showing the number 466/64 -- MANDELA'S PRISON NUMBER.
PRISON GUARD
(pointing at the number)
That means he was the 466th
prisoner admitted in 1964.
The Prison Guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then
unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door.
104.
Pienaar peers into the cell. It is tiny. There is no bed,
just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of
blankets. A chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate
are the only other objects in the room.
A couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. The
barred window is opaque. It lets in light but does not allow
the prisoner a view.
When Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. He
can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time.
This is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. Pienaar is
stunned by it. He turns, slowly, looking at Mandela's world
for over twenty years.
CUT TO:
The other Springboks and their partners wait to look into the
cell themselves, a little puzzled by how much time Pienaar's
taking.
Pienaar almost looks as if he is in a trance. He hears
Mandela's voice in the cell with him.
MANDELA (V.O.)
(RECITING "INVICTUS")
Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
Now, Pienaar sees Mandela in prison clothes, in the cell.
(The image is unclear, ghostly.)
MANDELA (V.O.)
In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbow'd.
Pienaar sees Mandela sitting on the dirt in the prison yard,
breaking up rock with a hammer, along with rows of other
political prisoners.
105.
MANDELA (V.O.)
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.
Pienaar sees Mandela leading his fellow prisoners to the lime
quarry, to mine lime under the eye of a guard who looks like
Pienaar.
MANDELA (V.O.)
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishment the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.
DISSOLVE TO:
Barbara, Mary, the house staff, plus Linga, Hendrick, Etienne
and Jason, all wait. All are scared. Nobody talks.
The SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS from on the top floor brings them to
their feet. MANDELA'S DOCTOR descends the stairs.
BARBARA
What happened?
DOCTOR
It's simple exhaustion, but it'll
lead to worse if it's not treated.
He needs complete rest. And I
don't mean just shifting the
affairs of state to his bedroom.
(MORE)
106.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
No phone calls, no visitors, no
meetings. No politics.
MARY
You know him. He won't do that.
DOCTOR
Then I'm going to put him into
hospital. In isolation.
BARBARA
No. Not yet. I'll threaten him
with hospital if he doesn't behave.
MARY
I'll cancel everything.
DOCTOR
And I'll come back tonight to make
sure he's not working.
The doctor leaves. The rest of them look at each other,
relieved ... and maybe a little guilty, for letting things
get this bad.
BARBARA
(to Mary, aside)
Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan.
Not yet.
CUT TO:
Dark. Curtains drawn. The door opens quietly. A shaft of
light from the door shows Mandela, on his back in bed, eyes
closed.
Barbara enters. The sight of Mandela lying like this is
chilling. It is too close to what he would look like lying
in a casket.
Barbara makes sure he is breathing. He is. She unplugs his
phone, takes it. Unplugs his TV. Sweeps the room for
papers, articles, legal briefs. For the first time, she
takes an arm load of stuff away from him. She gives Mandela
one last, long look, closes the door behind her.
We stay behind and look at Mandela, and ponder South Africa's
fate if this were worse than just deep, sedated sleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
107.
Looking frail, but better than before, Mandela pencils in a
score ON THE WORLD CUP BRACKET DIAGRAM: SOUTH AFRICA 42,
WESTERN SAMOA 14. The diagram shows us that this was a
quarter final match.
We can see that he has entered all the South African scores.
(For the record: South Africa 27 - Australia 18; South Africa
21 - Romania 3; South Africa 20 - Canada 0.)
For the semi-finals, against South Africa, Mandela pencils in
France.
108.
On the other side of the bracket, Mandela pencils in England
vs. the All Blacks.
With a satisfied grunt, Mandela steps back from the diagram.
Things are shaping up nicely.
A knock at the door, and Barbara enters, ushering in a GROUP
OF LABOR LEADERS.
BARBARA
Madiba, this is --
MANDELA
I know who this is.
Beaming, exuding energy we know he doesn't have, Mandela
rises to yet another occasion. He strides forward to shake
hands.
MANDELA
Welcome, and thank you for coming
such a long way to see me.
DISSOLVE TO:
Monsoon rain batters the bus as it crawls towards KING'S PARK
STADIUM, in Durban.
CUT TO:
Coach walks in on his team, who are dressed for the match and
ready to go.
COACH
Forty minute postponement. They're
trying to clear the field.
CUT TO:
109.
The boys stretch, jump, try to keep warmed-up.
CUT TO:
Mandela and a negotiating team are meeting with their
opposite numbers from Taiwan. A high-level affair that
cannot be interrupted.
Nonetheless, Mandela takes a discreet look at his watch, and
we realize that his mind is back home, with the Springboks.
CUT TO:
Pienaar leads his men out into the rain.
CUT TO:
Mandela flies home, still working intensely with a mixed
South African/Taiwanese trade group.
Mary slips a piece of paper in front of him, discreetly.
ON THE PIECE OF PAPER IN EXCITED WRITING: BOKS 19, FRANCE 15.
WE'RE IN THE FINALS!!! GO BOKKE!!!
Mandela's face betrays nothing. But, he gets up.
MANDELA
Please excuse me for a moment.
With Mary leading the way, Mandela goes to the back of the
plane, looking grave and leaderly --
-- but once he is through the galley curtain, he breaks into
a huge smile.
MANDELA
This is very good ... very good!
Who is our opponent?
MARY
The All Blacks play England
tomorrow. Then, we'll know.
MANDELA
Please make sure that my schedule
is clear for the entire match.
MARY
Yes, Madiba.
DISSOLVE TO:
ON A BIG SCREEN TV in a private banquet room, the Springbok
team watches the England/All Black semi-final, which the All
Blacks dominate from beginning to end --
-- thanks to the exploits of JONAH LOMU, their unnaturally
huge, fast left wing, of Tongan parentage (and unanimous
choice for the best player in the entire World Cup).
111.
Jonah Lomu scores in the first two minutes of the match, the
first of four tries. He runs through, over, and around
hapless defenders. His speed and balance are almost
unprecedented in a man his size.
The Springboks go quiet as they watch this beating by the All
Blacks.
CUT TO:
Mandela watches at home with Barbara and Mary.
MANDELA
Let's do some work while we watch.
Barbara resists her natural impulse to work and says:
BARBARA
Just enjoy the rugby.
CUT TO:
Another Lomu try, and a ripple goes through the Springboks.
112.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER
We're going to have to tackle
better than the English, that's for
sure.
PIENAAR
We do.
CUT TO:
TV blares. Barbara does some work. Mandela comes and peeks
over her shoulder --
MANDELA
Are those the judicial appointments
for the Free State?
-- and Barbara shuts the file.
BARBARA
They'll keep until after the match.
CUT TO:
Lomu scores his third try.
SPRINGBOK WING
How much does Lomu weigh?
SPRINGBOK FLANK
About 120 kilos.
SPRINGBOK LOCK
Shit, that's what I weigh.
SPRINGBOK WING
Ja, but at least you're slow.
As we will discover, the wing is going to have to defend
against Lomu.
CUT TO:
Mandela isn't watching TV. He's at the window, looking out
at a GAME OF TOUCH RUGBY, taking place on the street outside
his house.
MANDELA
Come and look at this.
CUT TO:
Barbara and Mary stand next to Mandela at the window.
Mandela's eyes twinkle with pleasure as he hears the
laughter. In a way, this small moment already justifies
everything he has done. Almost.
He gives Barbara a sly look.
MANDELA
Do you still think I'm wasting my
time with the rugby?
Before Barbara can reply, excitement on the TV makes Mandela
turn away. He looks at the TV just as Lomu scores his fourth
try, to make it 42 - 15. Mandela shakes his head, awed.
MANDELA
Barbara, can you please tell the
Minister of Sport that I need a
detailed briefing on the All
Blacks.
Barbara gives Mandela a long look.
BARBARA
This rugby, it's still strictly
political?
MANDELA
Oh yes. Of course.
CUT TO:
Pienaar hands an envelope to his father.
PIENAAR
Don't lose them. I won't be able
to get more.
Mr. Pienaar opens the envelope, pulls out TICKETS TO THE
WORLD CUP FINAL. Mr. Pienaar kisses the tickets.
MR. PIENAAR
Thanks, Francois.
(fanning out tickets)
Me, mom, Nerine -- wait, and the
fourth? Who's it for?
115.
Pienaar looks at his father, mischief in his eyes.
CUT TO:
The Minister of Sport gives Mandela his final briefing. At
his side, Barbara thrusts papers in front of Mandela for his
signature. This continues throughout.
MINISTER OF SPORT
-- they beat Wales 34 to 9, they
beat Japan 145 to 17.
MANDELA
145 points, in one match?
Linga listens openly.
MINISTER OF SPORT
It's a new international record.
(back to the briefing)
They beat Scotland 48 to 30 in the
quarter finals. You saw the match
with England.
MANDELA
45 to 29. And it was not that
close.
(BEAT)
They seem unstoppable.
MINISTER OF SPORT
If opposing teams play them
straight up, Jonah Lomu runs wild.
If they focus on Lomu, that leaves
others free.
(BEAT)
And, also, there's the business of
the haka.
116.
MANDELA
Their Maori war dance. Yes. It's
very powerful.
MINISTER OF SPORT
My sources tell me that half of the
All Black matches are won before
the first whistle, because of it.
Mandela peers out of the window at a Springbok billboard.
MANDELA
How are we going to beat them?
MINISTER OF SPORT
I have the coach's number. You
could call him and ask.
MANDELA
No ... no. I don't want to break
their focus for even a minute.
(INTENSE)
But, how do we win?
ON LINGA: an idea occurs to him. A wild idea. He almost
turns and blurts it out -- restrains himself.
MINISTER OF SPORT
Maybe we won't. They're favored
two-to-one.
(BEAT)
Madiba, we've already exceeded all
expectations. On and off the
field.
MANDELA
It's not enough. Not now. Not so
close.
(BEAT)
This country is hungry for
greatness.
Barbara pushes another paper in front of Mandela. He signs
it.
CUT TO:
The coach, the manager and Pienaar gather for a final
briefing in the coach's spartan office.
117.
COACH
How's the feeling in the dressing
room?
PIENAAR
Calm.
MANAGER
And Lomu? Are they talking about
him?
Pienaar shrugs -- of course. Coach grins.
COACH
Nobody gives us a bloody chance. I
like that. It plays into their one
weakness.
Both Pienaar and the manager look at the coach.
COACH
Their vanity.
(BEAT)
They're already counting the win.
But they want to win with style,
the way they won all their other
matches. They want to show the
world how beautiful All Black rugby
is.
(GLARING)
I just want to show the bloody
world how hard we tackle.
Pienaar's up for that.
PIENAAR
I wish tomorrow was already here.
CUT TO:
Jason wishes tomorrow was already over. He goes through his
plans, his check lists for the tenth time.
He sighs, tries to roll the tension out of his shoulders,
gives up. He leaves the office.
118.
I/E ELLIS PARK STADIUM - NIGHT
Cops at their posts. Jason walks alone through the tunnels,
until he comes to a field entrance. He goes to the edge,
looks out at the dimly lit field, trying to imagine tomorrow.
ETIENNE
(from behind him)
Come on, man. There's nothing more
you can do today.
Jason turns to Etienne.
JASON
Have I ever mentioned to you that I
hate rugby?
ETIENNE
Once or twice, yes.
JASON
I just want to get him through
tomorrow, safely. That's all.
ETIENNE
We all do.
A look between the two men: they are united. They have come
a long way.
CUT TO:
As in Cape Town, Pienaar stares out into the night,
pensively. Preoccupied.
So preoccupied, that when Nerine enters quietly, he hardly
turns.
NERINE
I brought one of your mom's protein
shakes.
Pienaar nods, thanks. Nerine puts the protein shake down.
She tries to read Pienaar's mood, see what he needs from her
at this moment.
NERINE
Thinking about tomorrow?
119.
PIENAAR
No, tomorrow's taken care of, one
way or another.
Pienaar turns to her.
PIENAAR
I'm thinking about how you spend 30
years in a tiny cell, but come out
ready to forgive the people who put
you there.
DISSOLVE TO:
We have seen that solitary shape under the blankets before.
We have seen the clock on the bedside table change from 4:59
to 5:00 before. We have seen Mandela's eyes open,
immediately.
But we have never seen Mandela roll over and go back to
sleep.
SUPER: JUNE 24, 1995 - RUGBY WORLD CUP FINAL.
Linga looks at his watch.
Hendrick does the same. Gets out.
Mandela's bedroom door is opened from outside the room.
Light from the hallway hits the bed. Mandela looks very
still under the covers.
Mary peers in, concern wiping away sleep. She sees Mandela
lying there. Mary tiptoes in, concern growing, until she
stands over Mandela --
-- who opens his eyes without moving otherwise.
MANDELA
Can a man not sleep in, when he has
a big day ahead of him?
CUT TO:
Mandela eats breakfast -- porridge and fresh fruit -- and
looks over the newspaper headlines, all screaming about
today's World Cup final.
The doorbell rings, and he pauses, listens to the sound of
voices at the door -- then the sound of heavy footsteps
approaching through the house.
Mandela wipes his mouth and waits. Linga and Hendrick appear
in the doorway. They look even bigger indoors.
MANDELA
Morning, boys.
LINGA & HENDRICK
Morning, Madiba.
MANDELA
What is it?
Linga hesitates -- until Hendrick gives him a (for Hendrick)
discreet nudge.
HENDRICK
Linga had an idea, sir.
CUT TO:
Jason addresses his entire team (minus Linga), plus assorted
POLICE OFFICERS.
JASON
The tickets sold out long before
the team became so popular. So
it's not exactly going to be the
rainbow nation out there. That's
the reality.
(BEAT)
The President will greet the
players before the match, he'll
present the trophy after the match.
He'll be exposed to 62,000 people,
twice. He'll be on TV, live, all
over the world.
(expressing his deepest
FEAR)
All it takes is one idiot trying to
make a statement, or one crazy fool
who thinks he hears god speaking to
him over the radio.
One of the cops smiles at that.
123.
JASON
It's happened before!
(SUPER INTENSE)
But not today. Not on our watch.
Not today.
The security boys are fired up.
CUT TO:
With that inward look of boxers before a big fight, the
Springboks begin the journey to the stadium.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
These All Blacks are possibly one
of the greatest international sides
ever, with a player in Jonah Lomu
who is as dominant as any this
correspondent has ever seen.
CUT TO:
Tight on Mandela's face, absolutely expressionless. His game
face.
BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
I say this with absolutely no
negativity. I simply want to save
people from the heartbreak of
unrealistic expectations.
CUT TO:
125.
The boys are very quiet -- until the sheer spectacle gets to
them. Then, the first nerves hit. You can tell in the way
they look at each other, the way they swallow.
CUT TO:
All dressed, all warmed up, the Springboks are quiet,
introspective. Everything that should be said has been said.
This is the calm before the storm.
(NOTE that almost every player wears bandages, or braces, or
is injured in some way.)
Pienaar is not in the room.
CUT TO:
I/E ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
Dressed in his rugby togs, Pienaar sneaks up the ramp to the
edge of the field, takes a peek out of the tunnel --
-- and is blown away by the magnitude of it all.
CUT TO:
CO-PILOT
Final approach, Captain.
CAPTAIN
Let it be noted that I'm taking
control of the aircraft.
ANGLE BACK THROUGH THE COCKPIT -- NO PASSENGERS.
127.
CAPTAIN
I assume full responsibility for
what happens from now on.
CO-PILOT
Duly noted.
The captain drops the nose of the 747 towards Ellis Park.
CUT TO:
Mandela is not in his seat. Linga turns. Hendrick points at
the closed door of the VIP bathroom.
LINGA
(INTO RADIO)
No time.
CUT TO:
The captain drops the 747 even lower.
SMASH CUT TO:
Everyone in the VIP box sees the jet. They all stand.
SMASH CUT TO:
CAPTAIN
Full throttle.
Captain and co-pilot go full throttle, yank the 747 straight
upwards.
CUT TO:
Linga and Hendrick share a look. They have just had a brush
with the unthinkable.
THE DRESSING ROOM VIBRATES with the roar ...
130.
SPRINGBOK WING
What the hell was that?
... which slowly fades ...
... leaving only the background roar of the revved up crowd.
The boys jog in place, dying for the release of rugby.
Pienaar appears to be praying, silently.
CUT TO:
The REFEREE walks off the field, into the tunnel, stands
there for a moment, then raises his whistle to his mouth and
blows a LONG, ECHOING BLAST --
-- which is the signal to come to the field.
The cop opens the door, throws down a full parade ground
salute as Pienaar leads his men out of the dressing room.
PIENAAR
Breathe, boys. Breathe.
WITH THE `BOKS, we head down the hallway, down some stairs to
the tunnel onto the field --
-- where the referee holds his hand up like a traffic cop,
keeping the boys in a line in the tunnel.
As they wait, they hear the CRUNCHING APPROACH OF BIG MEN IN
CLEATS.
Down the opposite stairway come THE ALL BLACKS. This is the
first time we have seen them in the flesh.
Huge men, black on black uniforms, arrogant. Been here
before, done this before. The best in the world, expecting
nothing but the best from the day.
They ignore the Springboks, dismiss them, line up next to
them in the tunnel.
131.
The SOUND OF THIRTY MEN JOGGING IN PLACE in their cleats, on
the concrete, sounds like a drum roll before a medieval
battle.
The Springbok wing sneaks a peek at JONAH LOMU.
The biggest, fastest wing ever. Even bigger looking in this
confined space. Bigger than the Springbok wing, bigger than
any of the Springbok backs, bigger than most of the Springbok
forwards.
The referee nods to both captains, turns, and leads them onto
the field --
Seen only in silhouette, Mandela walks down the tunnel. He
is flanked by Jason, The Minister of Sport and the President
of SA Rugby.
Linga, as always, has Mandela's back. Plus Hendrick.
Mandela front and center. Minister of Sport to his right,
Prime Minister of New Zealand to his left, President of SA
Rugby next to him.
Both using all their diplomatic skills to stay cool.
MANDELA
(to NZ P.M.)
Perhaps we should make a small
wager?
NEW ZEALAND P.M.
All your gold, for all our sheep?
MANDELA
I was thinking more along the lines
of a case of wine.
Behind Mandela, Linga and Hendrick suppress grins. They are
outwardly professional -- but bursting with excitement.
CUT TO:
LINGA
What happens now?
HENDRICK
Extra time. Twenty minutes.
LINGA
I don't think I can take it.
No one can. Mandela paces. Everyone is drained.
Everyone is on their feet in the press box.
MANDELA
How long before the end?
MINISTER OF SPORT
Seven minutes.
They turn out to be the longest seven minutes in Mandela's
life. In every South African's life.
BEGIN CLIMAX SEQUENCE:
This is where we fold the Rainbow Nation into the rugby
match, fully.
INTERCUT BETWEEN PEOPLE ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE RUGBY
as we show the whole nation wanting exactly the same thing at
the same time. Faces, postures, eyes are identical, no
matter where they are, who they are, what color they are.
(It would be nice if we used all the faces we've already cut
away to throughout this story.)
ON THE FIELD
The All Blacks attack desperately. The Springboks tackle and
tackle and tackle.
ON PIENAAR, totally spent but dragging himself to his feet
for another tackle.
He glances over at the referee, makes another tackle --
-- looks over at the referee --
-- the referee puts his hands on his whistle --
-- another tackle, another look --
-- the referee lifts the whistle to his lips --
-- another tackle, another look --
-- the REFEREE BLOWS THE FINAL WHISTLE.
It's over.
The Springboks have won.
140.
END CLIMAX SEQUENCE
Pandemonium in the VIP box. Mandela shakes hands with
everyone he can find. It is way too loud to say anything.
Hendrick and Linga almost hug. Almost. They shake hands
with total joy and engagement, whack each other on the
shoulder.
CUT TO:
Linga in front. Mandela is alone in the back seat. He looks
out at his people as they cheer him through.
He also looks exhausted. Spent. None of that shining life
force that makes him so big.
JASON
(INTO RADIO)
This route's too crowded. We're
changing to route B.
JASON
(INTO RADIO)
Change to route C.
Mandela leans forward, taps Linga on the shoulder.
144.
MANDELA
Tell Jason it's all right. There's
no hurry.
LINGA
(INTO RADIO)
Madiba says no need to hurry.
Jason nods, puts down his radio, settles back with a deep
sigh. So do the rest of the boys in the car. This day is
almost over.
Etienne, Hendrick loosen their ties, bask in the feeling.
Hendrick looks out at the rolling street party -- and shakes
his head in amazement.
President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela undoes the top button of
his rugby jersey, settles back with a deep sigh --
-- and drives home through a nation that has begun the
process of forgiving itself. His nation.
GO IN ON MANDELA'S FACE as it settles into the now-familiar
sphinx-like mask.
Except for his eyes.
Mandela's eyes glow with deep joy and satisfaction as he
moves slowly through a moment in history that he has worked
for, all his life.
ON MANDELA'S EYES ...
FADE EVER SO
SLOWLY TO BLACK.
THE END
Invictus
