Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup.
John and
Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming.
JOHN
She is completely full of shit.
LARA
DON'T try and agree with me now.
JOHN
You know what? I don't even believe
she is in the dental profession.
Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her
black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.
LARA
Shut up.

JOHN
I bet she can't even spell
anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete
fraud.
LARA
We went to her office party, idiot.
JOHN
I think she hit on me that night,
too.
Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in
the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....
LARA
You are completely delusional. She
wasn't even hitting on you in there;
I just don't like her.
JOHN
I understand. People who look like
that should not be allowed anywhere
near oral surgery.
She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it
away.
LARA
You are such an asshole.
JOHN
You're in the chair trying to stay
calm; how are you supposed to do that
with those things hanging over your--
She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she
stops him short by kissing him passionately. His hands slip
under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Someone's going to --
Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and
it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.
After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors.
She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other.

The "T," the city's fast-moving trolley, rises up from
underground and we CRANE UP to see the city.
JOHN (O.S.)
But Sam's your friend, right?

Tilt down from a passing T-Train to find John and Luke,
walking toward the huge, modern Allegheny County Jail.
LUKE
Not at lunch.
JOHN
Does he take your food?
LUKE
No.
JOHN
Did he say something mean?
(Luke nods)
About Mommy?

LUKE
Yeah.
JOHN
Did you hit him?
LUKE
Yeah.
JOHN
Good.
Where did you hit him?
LUKE
Near the swings.
JOHN
Wow.
I bet that hurt.
LUKE
Yeah.
22
28
The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it.
John backs out, Luke in his child seat. He brakes and finds
PAULA, the woman who lives behind them, at his window.
PAULA
How's Lara?
JOHN
She's doing okay.

PAULA
Tell her we're pulling for her.
JOHN
I will.
She holds up a plastic water bottle.
PAULA
They won't recycle these unless you
take off the cap.
(cap vs. bottle)
This is trash. This is recyclable.
JOHN
Ok.
Thanks.
John drives off, wondering what kind of world he lives in.

Sitting on the park bench, John allows his feelings to wash
over his face. He watches Luke play with a girl his age.
JOHN
Luke!
Let's go, Toad.
Come on.
Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't
notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching
him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.
NICOLE
Time to go, Carrie!
John glances in time to see CARRIE plop down in the sand,
arms folded. He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who
heads to retrieve her daughter. John walks off with Luke.

33
We're in an old working class neighborhood.
John sits in
his car, trying to pull himself together.
34
35
John, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the
back porch. Erit steps out with beers to replace their
empties. She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and
George play with the dog. After a moment Erit looks to John:
ERIT
I know you won't want to hear this...

MICK

I am really going to pay for that.
John has to smile.

John drives through a rough part of town on their way home.
He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A
flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver DAVID.
He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches
John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off.

39
It's RAINING outside. ELIZABETH stands at her car door in a
small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots. She
turns toward camera --
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes right at camera, making a terrible
impact and
ELIZABETH collapses to the floor.
40
40
Lara turns, holding the fire extinguisher.
41
42
Lara's car speeds out of the parking lot. A male co-worker
steps out of the rain just as her car passes. He stops as
he sees ELIZABETH'S BODY lying beside her car.
43
45
It's late; prime time for the ER.
John runs in.

48
John opens the door to let Jenna out; she looks considerably
older.
JENNA
I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending
he's asleep.
JOHN
(reaching for his wallet)
Don't worry about it.
JENNA
It's okay.
JOHN
I insist.
I kept you out on a school
night.
JENNA
I'm not in school anymore.
She offers a sad smile and leaves without the cash.

John rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her --
finally realizing she was never there.

John drives, taking note of the corners where young men hang
out, selling drugs or contraband.
103
103
John walks up to a guy leaning on the bumper of his car, the
trunk partially open. Call him MOUSS.
JOHN
Adderall?
MOUSS
Ten apiece, five for forty.
John hands him a twenty, Mouss digs into a bag in his trunk
and hands him a blister-pack strip of two pills, samples.
JOHN
I need some passports.
MOUSS
Piss off.
John nods and walks back across the street.
The guy watches.
104
105
John parks and steps out of his car.
106
107
They step out the back door.
HARV
You have the photos on you?
JOHN
Yes.
How much?
HARV
Fifteen hundred.
MOUSS steps out of the shadows and cracks John across the
back of the head with a pipe. John stumbles to the ground.
The two men kick the shit out of John.
John tries to protect
his face; they just keep kicking.

Mouss finally grabs John's hair and flicks a knife in his

MOUSS
I ever see you again, you lose an

The two men walk away and get into Mouss' van. John lies
doubled up on the ground and eventually tries to stand.

Eugenie reassures her skittish clients.
EUGENIE
It really is a great neighborhood.

John gets in and checks his mirror.
Luke is staring at him.
LUKE
Does your face hurt?
JOHN
A little.
LUKE
Did you hit him back?
JOHN
No.
LUKE
That's okay.
John pulls away.
117
117
John drives, looking for someone selling fake papers. He
sees Mouss' parked car and slows; Mouss stares at him. John
flashes his middle finger and drives on. Mouss considers
doing something but just flips him off.
118
118
John asks a couple of guys on the corner about papers and is
turned away. As he returns to his car, he doesn't notice
MIKE, the long-haired guy from Drake's Bar, watching from
astride his motorcycle. A SECOND RIDER pulls up beside Mike.
John pulls out and the motorcycles follow at a distance.
119
122
John tries to look tough.
Mike smiles at John's bravado.
MIKE
What do you need?
John indicates Mike should lower his voice.
JOHN
Three passports, a driver's license
and social security number that can
take a credit check.
MIKE
Thirty seven hundred.
JOHN
That's too much.

MIKE
It is if you never get them. I need

John stares at the man, trying to read him.
He turns.

126
A beat-up old van sits parked on the crumbling sidewalk.
John hands seven hundred dollars to a sketchy-looking guy
inside. The guy hands John a 9MM handgun wrapped in a
oilcloth. John unwraps it and hands it back.
JOHN
Show me how to load it.
127
132
He inserts the key, bumps it, turns.
The lock opens.

The guy comes out of the restaurant. John watches him walk

John presses the VOICEMAIL button on his phone.
MICK (V.O.)
Are you ever going to answer your
goddamn phone?
Suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John
realizes MIKE has pulled up without him noticing. His hand
goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the
SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window.
MIKE
You were supposed to leave.
JOHN
I need them.
MIKE
You notice that guy was a cop?
JOHN
Which guy?
MIKE
The one with the red light in his
back window.
John feels ridiculous.
Mike hands him the documents.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Just give me the money.
John hands him the envelope of money.
Mike checks it.
MIKE (CONT'D)
You want this too much. You're going
to fuck it up.
Mike speeds off. The second rider gives John a look and
follows. John looks over the passports with their new names.

Mick bangs again.
MICK (O.S.)
Open up!

Your car is in the garage, I know

John sits on a bench, frustrated and lost.
Luke trots up.
LUKE
Can I have my cookies?
JOHN
You hungry?
You want your sandwich?
LUKE
No.
John hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands
them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting
a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention.
NICOLE
Carrie!

I'm sorry. She just already has it
all figured out.

Nicole.

I remember your daughter.
NICOLE
She's hard to forget.

Oh, this is for you. Luke was
supposed to bring it home.
Hands him an envelope. He opens it and sees a birthday
invitation with jungle animals on the cover.
JOHN
He has his father's memory.
NICOLE
It's for Carrie's birthday party.
Please come; I'd love to meet your
wife.
JOHN
I'm afraid she can't be there.
...It's complicated.
NICOLE
I understand. With me, too. Carrie,
come on, time for lunch.
(to John)
We're going to the cafe on the corner,
would you like to join us?
JOHN
Oh, we're pretty...you know....
NICOLE
Busy?
John smiles, busted.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
Come on, we owe you for the cookies.
JOHN
That's true.
And I made those
cookies.
NICOLE
And learned how to pre-package them.

JOHN
Which requires a considerable amount

They walk toward the street, the kids trailing behind.
Neither John nor Nicole speak for a moment.
NICOLE
Do you trade off time with Luke?
JOHN
No. Luke and I are together full
time.
NICOLE
Wow. I guess that's why I see you
so much.
JOHN
She'd like nothing better than to be
here. With him. Lara. She really
misses...all this.
NICOLE
I guess it's all about priorities,
isn't it?
JOHN
No.
She's not like that.
She'd...
(has to admit)
She's in prison.
NICOLE
Oh.
JOHN
I don't tell most people.
NICOLE
I understand.
JOHN
She's innocent. She didn't kill the
woman.
NICOLE

I mean, I'm sure she didn't.
Nicole doesn't know what else to say.

John heads back and scoops up Luke.
Nicole watches, trying
not to look dumbfounded.

163
Luke and John water Paula's vegetable garden.
LUKE
But what's wrong with her?
JOHN
She's not feeling well.
LUKE
Why didn't she just stay home?
JOHN
Because sometimes people get so sick
you have to go to the hospital to
get fixed.
LUKE
How do you know when you're that
sick?
JOHN
The doctors do tests.
Something tweaks. John turns and looks back across the alley,
at his open garage...and remembers their conversation. He
drops the hose and takes Luke's hand.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Come on.
They drop the hose in the garden and walk back to the house.

Parked at a distance, John watches from inside his Prius.
Finally, a DRIVER steps out of the jail carrying a tray of
test results. He opens the back door of the van.
166
STREETS -- DAY
166
John follows the van.
167
NURSING HOME -- DAY
167
John watches as the driver steps out with a tray, point and
push his key fob, lock the doors and enter the nursing home.
IN THE PRIUS - MOMENTS LATER - John watches his stopwatch.
The driver returns with a tray. John hits the stop button.
1 MINUTE 48 SECONDS.

John waits, eating a donut. He sees the driver step out of
Pittsburgh Med Health Lab and walk to his panel van.
171

John follows the van again.
172
172
Wearing his iPod, the driver steps out with a tray and presses
his key fob; the van chirps and locks. He enters the building
as John steps up to the driver's door.
John checks no one is watching, places the tennis ball over
the key slot and punches the ball flat. The lock pops open.
60.
173
174
The driver comes back out, heading for the van. He pauses
to flirt with a nurse on her break, but she isn't buying.
175
176
The driver heads for the van as John opens the back door and
climbs out. Oblivious to his narrow escape, John closes the
door and walks away a heartbeat before the driver gets there.
177
184
John unscrews the license plate from a dusty black Prius.
He sticks the plate under his jacket, stands and checks over
his shoulder as he walks out of the massive parking lot.

196
John's father watches through the window as his son leaves.
In his gut, George knows something is wrong.
197

John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner
where he noticed kids selling drugs.
A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The
street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an
exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks
his watch and settles in to wait.
198
198
John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And
then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks
his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer
runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the
driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to
call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.
199
199
John follows the flashy car at a distance.
It stops at
another corner and something is exchanged.
It drives on;
John follows.
200
200
Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill.
The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.
Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then
makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many
houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks
over the fences.
He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a
house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch.
He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and
the light goes out again.

John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges
a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are
exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he
came.
John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the
fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back
yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside
the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait
between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.
Fade to BLACK.
Beat, then:
BANG!
BANG!
BANG!
201
201
John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks
on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize
he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,
holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is
no way he wouldn't see him.
John holds his
breath and waits. The porch light flicks
off, the locks
are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.
As before, the
two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in
John's ears is
so loud we can barely hear anything else.
John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking
over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!
He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams
him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --
ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.
202
208
John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into
the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger
seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a
heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at
the partially open window. John struggles to get the car
turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his
way into the car.
Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the
back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun.
John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in
the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the
car, the thug getting off a shot.

John swerves wide around the corner, hitting a fire hydrant
and shattering a taillight.

John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He
steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes
the door and gets in. As he drives away we see David's body
lying on the bench, waiting to be discovered.
212

Water streams from the house, the front door and windows
broken by firemen who now pack up their gear to leave.
LIEUTENANT NABULSI strides into shot, drinking a Red Bull,
which he crushes and discards on the porch.

John snips the links of a tall chainlink fence, then turns
and walks back to the Prius.

John stands in the brightly lit, glass-walled kiosk of a
rental car company, the Prius parked at the curb, as the sun
threatens to break over the horizon.

Nabulsi kneels beside a fire hydrant, using a shard from a
taillight to scrape at a smudge of flaking black paint.
Harris comes running up, out of breath, from the alley.
SGT. HARRIS
Neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase
a black car down the alley, so that's
probably his. We'll have the
taillight debris at the lab by the
time it opens.
LT. NABULSI
Before.
Nabulsi stands and hands him the large shard of glass.
225
228
Luke sits in the back seat with their carry-on bags. John
tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the
back.
He picks the last off the floor and turns and walks out to
the alley. He looks around, then stuffs this final bag into
his neighbor's trash can.
229
229
John tosses the last trash bags over the side of the dumpster
that sits in front of a demolished house. As he closes the
tailgate we get a good look at the broken taillight.
81.
230
231
John sits in his car in the back alley, watching the parking
lot. The driver comes out carrying trays of test results
and puts them in the back of his van. John grabs the large
wire cutters and screwdriver from his car and hops out. He
takes a few steps to the rear of the one-story building,
pries open the phone box and snips the phone wires.
232
233
John snips the last wire and hops back into the car.
He is
moving before the van exits the parking lot.

The van driver hops out and heads into the nursing home as
the Prius pulls into the foreground. John turns to Luke.
JOHN

John tugs Carrie's birthday invitation from his pocket, flips

John stands with Luke, who holds a hand-wrapped gift.

Luke spots Carrie on the back step and runs over.

Oh. Actually, I can't stay.
I have

Nabulsi reluctantly slips a credit card into the door jam.
Harris looks around to check no one is watching.

The sheriff's car and ambulance pull into the underground
entrance. Guard #2 steps from the passenger seat of the
ambulance and surveys the surroundings, shotgun in hand,

follow procedure in taking the prisoner into the hospital.
The sheriff watches until they are safe inside, then leaves.

Harris speeds toward the hospital.
Nabulsi is on the radio.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Lieutenant, the prisoner is secure;
jail personnel are 10-27, Code 4. A

entrance.
Nabulsi puts the walkie down and flips on the siren.
Harris

SGT. HARRIS
She just said --
LT. NABULSI

A squad car pulls up outside the hospital's main entrance.
One officer strides into the Emergency Room while the other

The unmarked car brakes hard. Nabulsi and Harris stride out
and into the ER, flipping their ID into their breast pockets.

The uniformed officer who stayed outside finds John's black
Prius with the broken taillight parked in a handicapped spot.
He lifts his walkie and CALLS IT IN.

John punches open the door and they hop down off the dock
and take off for the street.

John tugs Lara across the street, dodging traffic. He yanks
off his jacket and pulls it back on inside-out -- this side
is black and gold.

Nabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of
Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very
few pedestrians right here. Nabulsi looks to his right: a
crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to
a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving
toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team
colors - a sea of black and gold. Nabulsi curses.
276
276
Lara and John weave through the fans.
JOHN
Put your hair down.
Lara obeys without thinking. John checks his watch, then
opens a door. Leaving the throng of fans, he guides Lara
through and down the stairs into the T-Train Subway Station.
277

Nabulsi runs to the crosswalk as Harris takes the other
direction. The other two officers take the far sidewalks.
278
278A
Nabulsi searches the faces in the mall. He looks down through
the station skylight, catches a fleeting glimpse of them. He
runs for the entrance, his walkie flying to his face.
LT. NABULSI
They're on the platform! Block
stations in either direction! Call
the Port Authority. Stop all trains!

Walkie in hand, Harris jumps into their unmarked car and
pulls out. Two SQUAD CARS wail out past him.

This station sits above ground. Three squad cars scream up.

Harris skids the unmarked vehicle around the corner, heading
parallel to the underground.
286
288
The wheels SCREECH and the brakes SEIZE. Passengers topple
to the floor. John grabs Lara and they leap out onto the
tracks.
He finds the slit he cut in the tall fence. They slip out
through it, onto the street and into the parking lot beyond.
289
PARKING LOT - OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS

John yanks off his jacket as they jump into the rented SUV.
John calms his racing heart, drives away and turns the corner.
291

Harris leaps from his vehicle and runs to the fence on his
side of the tracks -- it is ten feet tall with razor wire,
no way over it. He sees:
Nabulsi charge up out of the tunnel. He jumps into the
stalled train car, looks around, doesn't see John and Lara.
292
292
The SUV comes up out of the dark and drives away from the
city center, as a police helicopter swoops overhead, going
the opposite direction.
293
294
Nabulsi pushes through the hole in the wire. Harris runs
across the tracks with his jacket off, having scaled the
fence on the far side.
LT. NABULSI
(into walkie)
Ring the city. Train and bus
stations. Get their descriptions to
the State Police.
(to Harris)
How old is their kid?
SGT. HARRIS
Six.
LT. NABULSI
Let's find out where he is.

Lara sits in the SUV at the curb. John waits at the door.
It is opened by BRENDA, Nicole's mother.
BRENDA
Hello.
JOHN
Hi.
I'm here for my son.
BRENDA
Oh, they aren't back yet.
JOHN
Back from where?
BRENDA
The zoo.
JOHN
...The zoo?
Finds an invite and hands it to him.
The back clearly says
they are going to the zoo.
BRENDA
It's a zoo party.
(in case he's worried:)
They ate first.

BRENDA (CONT'D)
They should be back in about an hour.
Would you like to wait?
JOHH
No.
Thank you.
John turns and walks back to the SUV.
Brenda watches for a
moment, made curious by his behavior.
He gets into the vehicle.
Lara is in a panic.
LARA
What's wrong?
John punches ZOO into POINTS OF INTEREST on the GPS.
LARA (CONT'D)
Where's Luke?
JOHN
He's at the party.
He sneaks a look at his stopwatch: 24 MINUTES and counting.
LARA
What party?
You said the party was
here.
JOHN
I was wrong.
She took them to the
zoo.
The GPS comes up with an address.
John punches a button.
LARA
(can't help herself)
She?
GPS VOICE
Estimated drive time: seventeen

JOHN
Carrie's mom. Nicole.
He drops the transmission into gear and speeds off.

A squad car is waiting, another arrives.

John drives like a man possessed.

The SUV swerves around a corner, heading into the outskirts
of town.
302
303
The SUV climbs up the on-ramp, leaving the city behind.
304
305
John sees the big rig truck driver look back from where he's
pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and
comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel
shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the
field beyond. He sits beside her in silence.
Behind them the cars whip by.
No one even thinks to stop to
see if they need help.
Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field.
There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know
how they got here.
Their hands sit on the gravel between each other. Without
looking at him, Lara tentatively entwines a single finger
with his. He slowly gathers strength from her touch.
306
307
A garbage truck is just pulling up as Paula shows Harris and
an officer her recycling bin. They pull out John's
overstuffed trash bag.

Lara sits in the SUV by herself, watching the entrance.

Nicole, surrounded by a dozen six year-olds, passes Luke off
to John.
JOHN
No, it really is fine. I can't thank
you enough for taking care of him.
NICOLE
It is our pleasure.
Wasn't it,
Carrie?
John and Luke turn and walk toward the exit.
310
310
Lara turns and sees John and Luke walking toward her.
LARA
Hi.
LUKE
Hi.
LARA
Did you have a nice time at the party?
LUKE
Yeah.
Lara walks him to the car, as if this day is no different
than any other.
LARA
What was your favorite thing?
LUKE
Ice cream cake.
She lifts him into his seat and buckles him in.
LARA
They had ice cream cake here?
LUKE
At Carrie's house.

LARA
Oh.
What flavor?
LUKE
Lots of flavors.
LARA
My favorite.
John starts the car.
LARA (CONT'D)
I'm going to sit back here, okay?
JOHN
Sure.
Luke plays with a toy. Lara closes the door behind her.
She looks out the window and sees:
NICOLE standing at the entrance, looking at her.
Not exactly sure why she does it, LARA offers her a grateful
smile.
NICOLE watches them pull away, confused about what she should
do.
311
313
John double-parks and pulls on a ball cap. Traffic is
snarled, the place is awash with police and squad cars.
Hundreds of people mill out front.
JOHN
Stay in the car.
John puts on his sunglasses and walks right through the middle
of it all. Lara watches, certain he will be spotted and
arrested.
John steps onto the crowded sidewalk outside the front doors.
He speaks to a large woman; she shakes her head. He goes on
to speak to a black couple, who apparently aren't interested.
He approaches an elderly couple.

The SUV heads up the on-ramp.
315

John spies the tollbooth ahead, traffic down to two lanes.
The ELDERLY MAN beside him has a small bag on his lap.
ELDERLY MAN
Are you sure twenty dollars is enough?
Ticket to Buffalo costs three times
that.
And now we notice the man's WIFE sitting in the back seat,
with Luke and Lara. John pays the toll.

(re: SUV)
This thing is very good on gas.
A State Trooper waves them toward the booth.
The trooper ahead checks them out and waves them on.
They
are free.
The same trooper stops the car behind them -- in it, a couple
with a child.
317

The Brennans drop off the elderly couple. John waves, drops
his gun in the trash can, gets back in and drives away.

The SUV takes the freeway exit and climbs the ramp.

A taxi snakes along a mountain road, through the dense forests
of Venezuela.

More rain. Detective Quinn squats in the covered parking lot,
staring at the spot where the crime took place. Flash to:
344

Elizabeth turns at her car, is slammed in the head with the
extinguisher and she falls dead.
The extinguisher is tossed to the floor and rolls.
A YOUNG FEMALE JUNKIE yanks at Elizabeth's purse, getting
blood on her hands before she frees it. She looks like a
junkie. She runs off toward the sidewalk.
344A
QUINN - IN THE PRESENT
344A
Turns and sees...
344B
LARA - IN THE PAST
344B
She hurries along the sidewalk to get out of the rain.
Turning the corner into the garage she COLLIDES with the
JUNKIE. Lara's purse catches the woman's coat.
The JUNKIE puts her hand on Lara's shoulder, leaving a SMUDGE
OF ELIZABETH'S BLOOD on Lara's raincoat. She tugs free. A
BUTTON from the woman's coat POPS OFF and hits the sidewalk.
Lara turns and yells "Hey," then keeps going.
She is about to get in the car when she sees the fire
extinguisher in front of her left wheel. She picks it up,
turns, annoyed. She places it down by the wall.

Lara gets in her car and drives off, oblivious to Elizabeth's
body lying on the concrete floor on the passenger's side.
Her co-worker sees her drive off as he steps into the garage.
He spots the body and turns and looks after Lara's car.

Quinn puts his used gum in a wrapper. COLLERO watches from
the car as her partner walks to the corner of the building.
QUINN steps up to where the two women collided and looks
down at the sidewalk.
DETECTIVE QUINN
Was it raining when we searched the
crime scene?
DETECTIVE COLLERO
Three years ago?? What are we doing
here?
Quinn drops his gum wrapper onto the sidewalk. It hits a
stream of water coming out from a rain gutter and washes
away. Quinn watches it -- then follows... Collero shakes
her head, grabs a newspaper to keep the rain off and follows.
The gum wrapper washes over the curb into the gutter and
travels to the storm drain a half a block away.
Quinn gets there, kneels.
DETECTIVE QUINN
Act like a cop. Grab the other side.
DETECTIVE COLLERO
You're out of your mind.
Quinn jerks the grate up.
Collero grabs the other side and
helps him lift.
They stare down into the hole. Quinn runs his hand along
the lip, digging up the mud and sediment...finds nothing.
DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)
You really thought you were going to
find it?
Collero wipes her hands on a tissue as Quinn stares down the
hole a little longer, then lets the grate fall.
