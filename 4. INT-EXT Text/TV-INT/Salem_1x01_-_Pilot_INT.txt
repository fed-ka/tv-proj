And as that pain resurfaces, we see a strange thing: the 
vivid red and white carnations floating in the water beside 
her begin to wither and rot. 

And as her emotions rise, the water in the pool begins to 
ripple, and the bowl itself vibrates until the glass 
EXPLODES.  Mary rips a chain from around her neck and throws 
it across the room.

 her her regal bearing.  She looks squarely at her  servant ,

No.  Then dry your eyes.  Leave

true to his vow?  Are not your

As if on cue, the sound of BOOTS on STEPS outside.  Mary 
glances out the window in time to see a broad-brimmed hat of 
a man stepping to their door --

sinewy arms.

Tituba applies a salve to Mary's soft skin and daubs her lips 
and dips into her mouth.  

Tituba removes a rounded piece of wood from a velvet bag.  
Like a thick, short broom handle, polished smooth with years 
of rubbing with oils.  We don't see what Tituba does with 
this stick -- but it sends ripples of pleasure through Mary. 

Her entire body seems to be alight by a charge through her 
 movements, spine.  Her back arches in response to Tituba s
her eyes roll back, her hair is visibly blown back by an 
unseen wind -- 

And at the peak of this orgasmic movement, in mid-writhe on 
the bed, mouth open, eyes wide and white, Mary freezes,

herself.  


The living statue of Mary suddenly comes alive with a sharp

All the girls ares only one customer --  busy, though there 
Cotton.  At the moment he lies face up amidst a pile of 
writhing, warm female pulchritude. 

Yet he seems to be taking no pleasure.  Or already taken too 
much, perhaps in futile attempt to stop his churning, guilty 
mind.

A flame-haired Beauty rises from the tangle of nude limbs.

GLORIANA
 Lost your lust for life?  Don t
tell me that you are full up.

No -- some holes cannot be filled.

She crawls towards him, offering her own places to be filled.

GLORIANA
Really my Lord?  Which holes are 
those?

COTTON
The ones we dig for ourselves.

LOUD SHOUTING from the hallway outside, POUNDING FEET, 
followed by a SPLINTERING DOOR.  Cotton jumps to his feet.

As the door BURSTS OPEN: 

Alden stands there, a pistol in his hand and fire in his 
eyes.  

The whores scatter, leaving the naked Cotton backed wide-eyed 
against the bed.  MALICE Pilot - "The Vow" 5/2/1358.


We fear for a moment Alden is there to exact revenge for the 
death of his friend.  He levels the flintlock at Cotton.

CUT TO:


A fine glass cake top -- the very one Mary was holding at the 
market -- sits on her small dressing table.  Only it doesn t 
hold a cake, but a mouse, a bird, and several black beetles.  
All very much alive.  Small glass bowls contain oils, wax, 
deep-hued powders.  

And, most curiously, all this is arrayed around a small pile 
of sawdust and several thick strands of hair in the very 
center of the table.

Mary sits before this weird array HUMMING almost inaudibly.  
As her humming rises, the sawdust on the table begins to 
vibrate, as though reacting to her voice.

Mary spits thickly into the pile of dust and hair.  She bends 
low over the table and blows ever-so-gently into the 
disgusting pile.  With a curious, almost whistling sound the 
wet dust and hair seem to CONGEAL.

Mary reaches beneath the glass top and snatches up the little 
mouse, feeling its softness and its rapid pulse in her hand 
before she crushes it in her fist and lets its liquefied 
essence drip onto the congeal on the desk.MALICE Pilot - "The Vow" 5/2/1360.


She follows this with sprinkle of fresh-crushed beetles. 

Mary wipes her hands and takes up needle and thread.  Only 
the bird remains under the glass.  It flutters its wings with 
concern.  Mary uses the horrid mixture of dust and hair and 
spit and dead things as the stuffing for a homespun DOLL.

She sews up the button-eyed doll, humming quietly, stitch by 
stitch...


Alden ascends the stairs behind Cotton.  A candle on the wall 
spreads flickering shadows like distorted faces watching 
them.  Inhuman moans and creaks echo from a door down the 
hallway.

impression of the rather fine profile of Captain John Alden.
