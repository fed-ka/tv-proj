Everyone starts furiously licking diapers and screaming out 
different chocolates. We stay with Maggie and Emma. Maggie 
goes face-first into a diaper and comes up with a Tom Selleck-

nursery is ajar. She opens the door to find...



The nursery has been completely put together. It looks 
beautiful. The curtains are hung, the crib is finished, the 
photo of Maggie with her parents (from the video) hangs above 
it. Her eyes well up and she heads downstairs.
