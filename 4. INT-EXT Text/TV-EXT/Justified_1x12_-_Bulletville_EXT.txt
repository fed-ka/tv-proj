      The house is dark.  A car drives up and out gets... BOYD 
      CROWDER.  He goes to the door and knocks.

                                  BOYD
                    Ava?  You home?

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    Who is that?

                                  BOYD
                    Boyd.

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    You get the hell away from here.

                                  BOYD
                      I apologize for the late hour.  I 
                    just want a word.

      From inside comes the sound of feet running downstairs, and 
      the sound of a shotgun being racked.  Boyd quickly backs away 
      from the door, back down the steps, his hands in the air.

      AVA appears at the door with the sawed-off shotgun.

                                  AVA
                    What the hell you want?

                                  BOYD
                    I am alone and my hands are empty 
                    as you can see.

                                  AVA
                    Maybe you can use them to keep the 
                    shot from ripping open your chest.

                                  BOYD
                    I can only imagine you d want to do 
                    that, given our history.

                                  AVA
                    Boyd, I gotta warn you, if I start 
                    counting down from ten, I may lose 
                    patience at five.

                                  BOYD
                    I came to say I m sorry, that s 
                    all.  I will go now and disturb you 
                    no further.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    2.

      Boyd starts backing to his car, hands still raised.

                                  AVA
                    Sorry about what?

                                  BOYD
                    So many things.

                                  AVA
                    You mean like world hunger?

                                  BOYD
                    So many things I have done to you.

                                  AVA
                    I wanna hear this.

      Boyd stops.

                                  BOYD
                    It s hard to know where to begin.  
                    I could start with the last time I 
                    saw you.  I kept you hostage in 
                    your own home until Raylan came and 
                      I instigated a shoot-out in your 
                    dining room.

                                  AVA
                    That didn t end so bad, far as I 
                    was concerned.

                                  BOYD
                    Before that, for years, I lusted 
                    after you and I was far from 
                    subtle.  That was wrong.  Not just 
                    because you were my brother s wife, 
                    but because it was unseemly and 
                    unwanted and I made you 
                      uncomfortable.

                                  AVA
                    If by uncomfortable you mean it 
                    made my skin crawl, then yes.

                                  BOYD
                    But by far my biggest regret 
                    concerns my brother Bowman.

                                  AVA
                    You sorry he was born?

                    Oh, I don t question the will of 
                    God, bringing a life into the 
                    world.  My regret is that I did 
                    nothing to stop or in any way 
                    curtail his atrocious behavior.  I 
                    knew how he was, but I took no 
                    action, and for that I am deeply 
                    sorry.  

                                  AVA
                    Why are you coming to me now?

                                  BOYD
                    I have embarked on a new life of

                    he will see soon enough that I am 
                    not all talk.

                                  AVA
                    What does that mean?

                                  BOYD
                    I m afraid I can t tell you.

                                  AVA
                    Seems to me, all you re doing here 
                    is talk, saying you re sorry.

                                  BOYD
                    Ava, if there are any actions I can 
                    take to atone for what I have done, 
                    I will take them.

                                  AVA
                    Like what?  Paint my house?

                                  BOYD
                    If that s what you want.

                                  AVA
                    You think painting my house would 
                    make up for years of you standing 
                    by while Bowman beat on me?

                    How about this?  How about what you 
                    do for me is you leave here and 
                    never see me again.  Let s start 
                    with that.

                                  BOYD
                    All right.

      Boyd gets in his car, drives off.  Ava watches Boyd drive 
      off.

                                        ACT ONE


      Dark, empty road, winding through the back-country.  Johnny s 
      car comes toward us, pulls off, and brakes.

      I/E. JOHNNY S CAR - ROAD - NIGHT44

      Johnny waits, checks his mirror and wristwatch.  Boyd s hand 
      knocks on the passenger side window.  Johnny reaches across, 
      and opens the passenger door.  Boyd slides in.

                    We did.  And we got the shipment.

      Johnny relaxes, grins:

                                  JOHNNY
                    Damn, Boyd!  We re takin  over!

                    They were just supposed to 
                      disappear.  Along with the truck, 
                    and the shipment.  
                          (off Boyd s silence)
                    Where is it?  Where s the shipment?

                    Johnny, it went up in a pillar of 
                    fire...

                    Oh, for--  We had a plan!  Shipment 
                      disappears, Bo takes the fall, and 
                    we step up.  There something about 
                    that plan you didn t understand?  

      Boyd, trying to be patient with a slow learner.

                                  BOYD
                    Johnny, you want to spend eternity 
                    writhing in hellfire?  Because

      Boyd gets out.  Johnny drives away.  

      OMITTED55


      Boyd and his men are just blinking awake as TWO PICK-UPS ROAR 
      IN and skid to a stop, spraying gravel, throwing up a fog of 
      dust and dead leaves.  Rufus and Hestler are in the backs of 
      the trucks, holding shotguns on Boyd and his groggy followers 
      as they line up outside their tents, pulling on their pants, 
      shielding their eyes from the sun. 

      The pick-ups  doors open and out step Bo and Johnny.

                                  BO
                          (to Boyd s men)
                    Good morning, gentlemen.

      Boyd is the only one of his men who doesn t appear ruffled by 
      the shotguns.

                    Morning, Daddy.  To what do we owe 
                    the pleasure?

                                  BO
                    Looks like you ve been a bad boy.  
                    You know what happens to bad boys?  
                    They get spanked.

                                  BOYD
                    I told you what would happen if you 
                    brought that poison here.

      Bo steps toward him.  Their faces are inches apart.

                                  BO
                    And I told you what would happen if 
                    that happened.

      A tense moment.  Then Bo seems to relax.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Who am I kidding -- I can t hurt my 
                    own son.

      He turns to walk away.  To Johnny--

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Johnny -- hurt my son. 

      Johnny shoots Bo a puzzled look, then gets it.  

                                  JOHNNY
                    Glad to oblige.  

      Johnny steps toward his cousin.  Boyd waits for him, face 
      impassive, hands at his sides.  

                                  BO
                    Don t stop until I tell you.

                    This is gonna hurt.

      Johnny starts.  Boyd does not lift a finger to protect 
      himself, GRUNTING IN PAIN as the punches land (uttering only 
      Biblical verses about forbearance -- TK).  

      Every time Boyd goes down, he gets back to his feet,  Cool-
        Hand-Luke -style, and literally turns the other cheek.  

      The whole scene is eerily quiet, the silence broken only by 
      Boyd s grunts and the sickening MEAT-ON-MEAT sound of landed 
      punches.  

      By the fourth or fifth time, Boyd doesn t pull himself back 
      up.  Blood pours.  Hard to imagine he could take much more.  

                                  JOHNNY (CONT D)
                    Think he s had enough?  

                                  BO
                    I do not.  

                                  JOHNNY
                    You want me to kill him?  

                                  BO
                    Ain t the worst idea I ve heard 
                    today.  

      Bo crosses, squats by Boyd, close to his face.  He seems 
      genuinely saddened.  

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    I know we weren t as close as we 
                    might ve been, son.  But how d it 
                    ever come to this?  

                                  BOYD
                    Guess its just one of those things. 

                                  BO
                    I guess it is.  
                          (beat)
                    Where do you keep the weapons?  

                                  BOYD
                    Don t know what you re talking 
                    about.  

      Bo just looks at Boyd.  So that s how its gonna be, huh.  Bo 
      stands, addresses Boyd s men.  






                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    14.

                    Listen up.   Less you want to stand 
                    there and watch your tin-pot 
                    messiah get beat to death, tell me 
                    where you re hiding the weapons.  

      Boyd s men look at each other.  Bo turns to Johnny.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Johnny.  

      Johnny grabs Boyd by the shirt, pulls him to his feet, then 
      punches him again.  Boyd hits the dirt, hard.  Suddenly, one 
      of Boyd s men speaks:

                                  BOYD'S MAN #1
                    Under the fire.

                          (to Boyd s men)
                    Then grab shovels and start 
                    digging.
                          (no movement)
                    Now!

      The men start to move, under the supervision of Bo s men.  
      Boyd gets up.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                          (to Boyd)
                    Not you.  You leave.

                                  BOYD
                    I will not.

                                  BO
                    Yes, you will.  You see, when we 
                    expose your weapons, we are going 
                    to rope your merry men to the trees 
                    and I am going to call your marshal 
                    friend Raylan and tell him to come 
                    on out.  Your flock will be sent 
                    away for numerous parole 
                      violations, I suspect.

                                  BOYD
                    And I will go with them.

                                  BO
                    You re not getting my point here.

                                  BOYD
                    I will not abandon them.

                    Okay, then.  

      Bo pulls his pistol.  Boyd shuts his eyes.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    Open your eyes.  I m not going to

                    Help me out here.  Which one should 
                    it be?

      Boyd looks at his men, then turns and starts walking off.

                                  BO (CONT D)
                    You think you could do what you did 
                    and there d be no consequences?  
                    All that transpires is on you.  You 
                    think about that in your exile, Mr. 
                    Church Leader.  All of this is on 
                    you.

      Boyd keeps walking.


      Boyd is walking alone in the woods, looking distraught.  And 
      then he hears a gunshot echo through.  Then another and 
      another.  Boyd runs.


      Boyd runs into his camp and slows at what he sees.  Dear God, 
      no.  He drops to his knees and weeps.

      HIS MEN

      Are dead, hanging upside down from the trees.

      OMITTEDA13A13


      Boyd, red-eyed, is tamping down a mound of dirt with a 
      shovel.  He s exhausted, covered in dried blood and dirt, 
      barely able to lift the shovel.  He finally staggers back, 
      and we reveal -

      A cluster of SIX UNMARKED GRAVES.  Boyd picks up a canteen, 
      drinks hard, then holds the canteen over his head, lets the 
      water cascade over him.    

      He tosses aside the empty canteen, picks up his tattered 
      Bible, stands facing the graves, opens the book.  After a few 
      moments reflection, he looks up.    

                                  BOYD
                    Father in Heaven, I m not gonna 
                    pretend to understand.  You showed 
                    me what You wanted done, and we did 
                    it.  How could You let it end like 
                    this?  
                            (struggling)
                    These men trusted me to lead them 
                    in the path of righteousness, for 
                    Your name s sake.  Every one of 
                    these men came to You because they 
                    believed in me.  And now they re 
                    dead.  
                          (closes the Bible)
                    I need a sign.  I need to know 
                    their sacrifice means something to 
                    you.  

      Boyd listens to the silence of the woods.  Then, he sets the 
      book aside.  There are tears in his eyes.  

                                  BOYD (CONT'D)
                          (finally)
                    Have I just been talking to myself 
                    all along?   

      Off Boyd, at the end of the road.  


      Arlo sits on the porch, waiting.  Raylan drives up, gets out 
      of his car.  They exchange a look.

                      Everything all right?  

      Arlo thought he had his poker-face on.  He covers:

                    I been cooped up here all day with

                                  RAYLAN
                    According to Helen, that s about 
                    all you do at home anyway.   

      Raylan heads inside, Arlo follows.  

      OMITTED1717


      Alerted by the gunshot, Heckle and Jeckle get out of a car, 
      pistols at their sides, and head to Raylan s room. 


      Johnny Crowder stands in Ava s front yard.  

                                  JOHNNY
                    Ava!  Ava Crowder!

      Ava opens the front door, shotgun levelled at Johnny.

                    What is...

      Soon as Ava clears the door, Hestler throws a jacket over her 
      head, Rufus grabs the shotgun.  Twists it hard away from her.  
      Bo appears behind him, wearing work gloves.  

                                  BO

      Bo hits Ava hard with the butt of the shotgun.  She goes limp

                    Hope you know how sorry I am about 
                    this, Marshal.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Yeah, I m sure you re all torn up 
                    inside.

                                  BO
                    Won t pretend I d throw myself on 
                    top of your coffin, but all this 
                       we-want-him-alive  shit -- that 
                    ain t me.

                                  RAYLAN
                    So, how do we do this?

      I/E. BEHIND CABIN/INSIDE CABIN - MORNING - SAME TIME2828

      Boyd creeps up to a window at the back, looks in.  

      Ava s tied up in the corner of a room at the front.  Hestler 
      has his back to Boyd -- he s watching Raylan, Bo and Rufus 
      out the front window.

      Boyd hears Raylan talking with Bo.

                                  BO (O.S.)
                    I d just kill you quick if I could.

      Boyd smashes the back window.  Hestler turns, fires.  Boyd 
      shoots, gets Hestler in the chest.

      Ava looks at Boyd through the shattered window.


      As Bo and Rufus turn toward the shot, Raylan grabs the gun 
      Rufus is holding, turns it into Rufus s chest and pulls the 
      trigger twice.   

      Bo turns to shoot Raylan, but Raylan kicks the gun from Bo s 
      hand, takes the gun from the dying Rufus and levels it at 
      him.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Alright, Mr. Crowder.  Hands behind 
                    your back.  

      At that moment, the cabin door opens, and Boyd steps out.   
      His gun levelled, he waves Raylan back. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    39.

                                  BOYD
                    Raylan, need you to move away from 
                    my father.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    You don t want to do this, Boyd.  

                                  BOYD
                    It isn t something I want to do, my 
                    friend.  It s something I have to 
                    do.  Step back. 

      Raylan takes a step back, but aims his gun at Boyd.  

                                  BO
                    You didn t come to save my ass, did 
                    you, son?

                                  BOYD
                    No, Daddy, I did not.  

                                  BO
                    Gonna shoot me, that it?

      Boyd doesn t look like he s sure himself.  

                                  BOYD
                    Maybe.  

                                  BO
                    Don t seem right.  I had a chance 
                    to kill you, and didn t.  

                                  BOYD
                    Well, that s where you re wrong.  

                                  BO
                    Marshal, he look dead to you?

                                  BOYD
                    There s more than one way to kill a 
                    man.  You can kill his body.  Or 
                    you can kill the spirit within.  

      Bo looks at him, puzzled.  

                                  BO
                    You gonna pull the trigger?  Or you 
                    figure on talkin  me to death?  

      BANG!  A hole appears in Bo s chest.  It didn t come from 
      Boyd.  Bo falls back to the ground. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    40.

      Raylan and Boyd exchange a look.  GUNFIRE erupts from the 
      trees around the cabin.  

      Raylan grabs his guns from dead Rufus, bullets zipping by 
      him.  

      Boyd looks down at his fallen father, and in that moment of 
      hesitation, a bullet rips into his shoulder.  

      Raylan grabs Boyd s shirt, pulls him into the cabin with him 
      and slams the door.

                                        ACT FOUR

      I/E. CABIN - DAY3030

      Raylan has dragged Boyd behind cover.  Ava is across the *
      room, flattened against a wall.  Raylan turns to Ava.  *

                                    RAYLAN*
                    You okay?*

                                  AVA*
                    Yeah. *

                    You mind putting pressure on this *
                    shoulder?  *

      She slips across the room, staying low.  *

                                  AVA*
                    Boyd come here with you?*

                                    RAYLAN*
                    He did.  *

                                  AVA*
                    So, you trust him now.  *

                                    RAYLAN*
                    Wouldn t go that far.  *

      Raylan takes up position beside the window looking out over *
      the porch.  She tends to Boyd s shoulder wound.  *

                                  BOYD*
                    If Raylan had come alone, my daddy *
                    would ve killed you both.  *

                                  AVA*
                    And you couldn t let that happen.  *

      Boyd shakes his head.  A look between them.  He could still *
      be full of shit, but right now, she isn t really sure.  *
      Raylan clocks their look, then checks his cell phone.*

                                  RAYLAN *
                    No service.*

      Raylan puts his phone away.*

                                  AVA*
                    Who s out there?*

      Raylan takes a look.  He sees an SUV parked where the road *
      comes in, out by the tree line.*

                                    RAYLAN*

      Ernesto and Pilar are behind the SUV with AKs.  Pilar motions 
      to ANOTHER GUN THUG behind a tree -- go around.  The gun thug 
      takes off running.


      The gun thug is running, keeping low, rifle in hand.  


      The gun thug approaches the cabin from behind, moving quickly 
      and quietly, heading for the broken window.  He hears gunfire 
      coming from the front of the cabin.

      The gun thug creeps up to the window and looks inside.

      GUN THUG POV:  The room is empty.


      Ernesto and Pilar, ready with their AKs.  They share a look.

      Ernesto aims the AK over the SUV and fires wildly, shredding 
      the cabin.

      Raylan and Boyd exchange a look.

                    You didn t happen to bring another

      Ava, pulls her to the back room.

      Raylan and Ava look at each other as she goes.


      Boyd helps Ava climb out the back window.  They see the dead

                    I see empty hands, maybe.

                                  PILAR
                    How do we know you won t just shoot 
                    us?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    47.

      CONTINUED:4040

                                  RAYLAN
                    How about this?  I ll come out 
                    unarmed and you step out unarmed 
                    and we ll talk.

                                  PILAR
                    Okay.

      Pilar turns to Ernesto.

                                  PILAR (CONT D)
                          (quiet)
                    The second he s clear, shoot him.  
                    In the gut.  Maybe we can get him 
                    to Gio before he dies.

      Ernesto nods.  Pilar leans her AK against the bumper of the 
      SUV.

      Raylan opens the cabin door and steps out, his hands empty, 
      pistol tucked down the back of his belt.

                                  RAYLAN
                    My hands are empty.

      Pilar appears, her hands up.

                                  PILAR
                    Me, too.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Where s your friend--?

      Ernesto swings into sight with his AK.  Before he can shoot -- 
      BANG! -- he s hit in the leg.  The shot came from...

      Boyd, in the woods, crouched by a tree with the gun thug s 
      rifle.  

      Ernesto spins to shoot at Boyd.

      Raylan shoots Ernesto and Ernesto falls.

      Pilar grabs her AK and fires bursts at Raylan and Boyd as she 
      gets in the SUV and drives off.

      Raylan takes a shot at the SUV, blows out the back window.  
      The SUV speeds off. 

      Boyd comes out of the woods, holding the rifle.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Where s Ava?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    48.

                                  BOYD
                    Running through the woods.

      Raylan starts for his car.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Where you going?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I have to stop the woman with the 
                    automatic weapon.

                                  BOYD
                    I ll get her.

      Raylan stops, looks at Boyd.  Boyd is now loosely aiming the 
      rifle at Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What re you gonna do after you 
                    catch her?

                                  BOYD
                    I haven t figured that out yet.
                    You gonna shoot to stop me?

      Boyd starts moving toward Raylan s car.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If I have to.  

                                  BOYD
                    I m pretty sure you re empty.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You bet your life on that?

      Boyd tosses the rifle into Raylan s car.

                                  BOYD
                    No, Raylan, I m betting my life on 
                    you being the only friend I have 
                    left in this world.

      The two men look at each other. 

      Boyd gets in Raylan s car, starts the engine, throws the car 
      into reverse and backs away.

      CLOSE ON RAYLAN.

      CLOSE ON BOYD.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)      EPISODE 112 - "BULLETVILLE" - 2ND BLUE REVISIONS - 3/08/10    49.

      Raylan doesn t fire.

      Boyd throws the car into drive and takes off down the road.

      Raylan watches him go.  Ava comes out of the woods, joins 
      Raylan.  

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
