        Marble floors and expensive furnishings. WAITERS flash 
      past carrying food and drinks to the terrace. We move 
        through the villa leaving the party behind.

        SADDAM and BARZAN move along a dimly lit but ornate 
        corridor, the party music fades...and is replaced by 
      the sound of an Ayatollah in full flow - an initially 
      faint but forceful VOICE of a determined old-man 
        speaking in Farsi:praising Allah, the revolution and 
      his people; denouncing the Shah, America and the 
        infidels of Iraq s Baath Party. 

                                        BARZAN
                                (easy; about the voice)
                      Khomeini has a big mouth.

        SADDAM smiles and put his hand on BARZAN S shoulder. At 
      the bottom of a corridor is a set of double doors - the 
      VOICE is emanating from behind these doors.

      The brothers move to the doors and enter...

                                                                          CUT TO:



        SADDAM enters and finds SEVERAL smartly suited MEN, 
        seated in armchairs around a long low-table. The MEN 
        occasionally sip from tumblers of whiskey and ice.

      The RECORDED VOICE of Ayatollah Khomeini fills the 
      room; the gathered men listen as Khomeini berates Iraq 
      and its leaders and urges the Shias of the south to 
        rise-up (like their brothers in Iran) and overthrow 
        Satan s government.

      See the studious faces of the gathered MEN: TARIQ AZIZ 
      (43), HAMDANI (42), ADNAN KHAIRRALLAH (38) and ALI 
        HASSAN AL MAJID (CHEMICAL ALI, (38)) as they listen to 
      the VOICE which threatens their country and their 
        power.

      The mood of the meeting is relaxed but serious. BARZAN 
        closes the door behind them and moves to turn off the 
      TV.

                                        SADDAM
                      Heard enough?

                      Exactly... He will become more 
                      dangerous by the day... And if Al 
                      Bakr s treaty with Syria proceeds...he 
                      will scent Iraqi weakness.
                                (pause)
                      America hopes for a strong Iraq; the 
                      Arab world demands it, and the Iraqi 
                      people themselves deserve it.
                                (pause)
                      But time is running out...

      See the faces of the gathered MEN. SADDAM picks up a 
      glass of Shivas Regal, poured for him by BARZAN.

        A large cage in a windowless room. Inside, leaning 
        casually against the cage, is a clean-cut Defense 
        Intelligence Agency CASE OFFICER, (35). The CASE 
        OFFICER watches as the manacles are removed from a 
        PRISONER, then he dismisses the DETAIL with a nod.

      There is a deck of cards on the table, in front of the 
        PRISONER - now revealed to be an owlish TARIQ AZIZ, 67. 
      He is pale, shrunken, a grey little man. BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 4



      The CASE OFFICER picks up the deck of cards and turns 
      the first few cards over, flicking the faces out in 
      front of the TARIQ.

                                        TARIQ AZIZ

                      card; every face, and you are going to 
                      help us... starting with Saddam

      TARIQ looks down at the over-turned cards: see Saddam, 
      Ali Hassan Al Majid (Chemical Ali), Barzan, Watban, 
      Uday, Qusay and Tariq himself.

      the centre. Then Chemical Ali alongside.

                      the Ibrahims, as you say, are his half-
                      brothers, his mother s sons... The Al

      2058

        HAMDANI and SANAA (HAMDANI S wife) are overseeing a 
      game of musical chairs for the children. The GUESTS are 
        gathered around.

        SADDAM pours a tall glass of lemonade. SAJIDA 
        approaches him and links his armed lovingly.

        SADDAM takes the glass of lemonade to a ELDERLY WOMAN 
        (SUBHA) sitting alone (sucking dates) watching the 
        party. He hands her the glass and sits beside her.

        RAGHAD passes HUSSEIN KAMEL, who gives her a broad 
        smile. RAGHAD blushes. SUBHA watches.

                      She should marry Barzan s son

                      it?

        A chorus of Happy Birthday begins as an elaborate cake 
      is wheeled in. The cake moves past a sullen looking 
      boy, UDAY HUSSEIN, 15, (SADDAM S eldest son).

      AL BAKR and SADDAM, still with HALA in his arms, stand 
      side by side. The candles light their faces in an eerie 
      glow.

        A singing circle forms around the cake; UDAY remains 
        outside the circle. He has a cane in his hand which he 
      uses to lift the dress of a YOUNG GIRL - who turns her 
      head and instinctively brushes down her rising dress 
      with her hand. UDAY responds by slapping her hand with 
      the cane. The YOUNG GIRL doesn t cry out.

      The incident is witnessed by a the GIRL S MOTHER, who 
      looks at UDAY then looks away, distressed (continuing 
      with the Happy Birthday song). Once again, UDAY lifts 
      the dress of the GIRL, who this time does nothing. Her 
      eyes fill.

      The birthday song finishes.

                      will come true.

      HALA screws up her eyes and then she and SADDAM 
        together blow out the candles. Everybody applauds.

                                (patting his tummy)
                      Just a small piece.

      AL BAKR moves off with SADDAM, BODYGUARDS on either 
      side. SADDAM S inner circle, TARIQ, BARZAN, CHEMICAL 
      ALI, ADNAN KHAIRALLAH and HAMDANI follow close behind 
      them.

      They enter the room at the bottom of the corridor. The 
        double doors close and the BODYGUARDS wait outside.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      AL BAKR stands in the middle of the room. He takes a 
        silver cigarette case from his pocket; offers it to 
        SADDAM who refuses. He puts a cigarette in his mouth 
      and SADDAM lights it...AL BAKR draws deeply. 

                                        SADDAM
                      Please, sit down. There is something I 
                      have to say.

        BARZAN, ADNAN, CHEMICAL ALI, TARIQ and HAMDANI have 
         casually  positioned themselves around the room. 

      AL BAKR is a little wary; he chooses the seat behind 
        SADDAM S desk; he looks at the faces in the room. His 
        BODYGUARDS are positioned by the door.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                                (calmly)
                      I am concerned about Khomeini...and 
                      the proposed union with Syria.
                              (a gesture from AL BAKR 
                                  encourages him to go on)
                      Khomeini continues to call on our 
                      people to join his revolution; because 
                      he knows we are weak.

                                        AL BAKR
                      Nonsense.

                                        SADDAM
                      Not at all, it s true...and an 
                      Alliance with Syria will make us 
                      weaker still.

                      Syria will be first and you will be

                      With Saddam Hussein third? Is that 
                      your true objection?

                                        SADDAM
                      I have no objection. Why object to 
                      something that does not exist? And 
                      will never exist; I will not allow it.

                      Iraq can not be ruled from beyond its

                      has passed.

      AL BAKR looks to his two BODYGUARDS at the door but 
      they do not move.

      The party is over. Two friends sit and have a quiet

        distance, their wives gossip (SAJIDA and SANAA). The 
        GUESTS have left and children are in bed. They discuss 
      the main event of the evening. HAMDANI is just a little

      They laugh; HAMDANI more than SADDAM...and it is in 
      this moment that SADDAM decides that HAMDANI will be

        SADDAM is alone. He is standing, staring through large 
        sliding glass door, out into a courtyard (or perhaps at 
      the reflection of a President).

        A second reflection appears - it is his mother, SUBHA.

      down.

                      Good night, Mama.

      SUBHA leaves with BARZAN, leaving SADDAM alone. He 
      slips off his shoes...

      Hold on SADDAM and his reflection...a little fearful; 
      not quite believing this street-rat is to be President.

        (SADDAM S OFFICE) - DAY 2, 1522

      CLOSE on AL BAKR. The Ba ath Party Revolutionary 
        Command Council (RCC) is seated round a long table. 
        Nervously AL BAKR starts to read out a prepared 
        statement. Those on the inside are impassive. The new 
      faces - including MUHIE MASHHADI, 50, Secretary General 
      of the Council - are in a state of shock.

                                        AL BAKR
                      For some time now my health has been 
                        deteriorating. I feel I can no longer 
                      shoulder the responsibilities of 
                        government...Conscience demands that I 
                      must step down.

      See MASHHADI frown, surprised.

                                        AL BAKR (CONT D)
                      And it is my view that the man best 
                      qualified to assume the leadership is 
                      my esteemed deputy, Comrade Saddam 
                      Hussein.

                                        MASHHADI
                      Mister President, this is absurd. Now 
                      is not the time to be stepping aside. 
                      We are on the brink of a new era in 
                      Arab brotherhood.

      AL BAKR looks to SADDAM for guidance.

                                        SADDAM
                      Comrade Mashhadi I have tried already 
                      to dissuade our President from 
                      retiring, but he has made up his mind.

                                        HAMDANI
                      We must respect his decision.

                      here? What s happening?

                                        AL BAKR

                      Then we can only accept your 
                      resignation and recommendation by a

                      Very well, we will have a vote in our 
                      next session; the members of the 
                      council will, I m sure, need some time 
                      for thought and reflection. 

        SADDAM looks across the room to BARZAN - the 
        instruction is there in the look.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      Close in on MASHHADI; he is slumped and bound to a 
        chair, his once crisp shirt hangs of him. He shows 
      signs of having been whipped and beaten around the 
        chest.

        A FIGURE (obscured BARZAN) speaks...

        SADDAM washes his hands, letting the water flow between 
      his fingers.  BARZAN knocks and enters.  SADDAM sees 
      him, nods.  BARZAN exits.  SADDAM looks into the 
        mirror.

        HAMDANI enters to find SADDAM with BARZAN, waiting.

                      me, I do this for the country we love.

        SADDAM steps away and HAMDANI is confronted with a 
        PISTOL held by SADDAM. He fires. HAMDANI drops to the 
        floor. BARZAN recoils just a little as tiny spots of 
      blood land close to his mouth... HAMDANI S foot is 
        twitching; see SADDAM S troubled face as he fires a 
        second bullet into HAMDANI - the foot-twitching stops.

      On on SADDAM - it was something that he didn t want to 
      do, but felt he HAD to do. Hold. See BARZAN S 
        discomfort also - he drags the tiny spots of blood from 
      his face.

      200 REPRESENTATIVES of the Ba'ath Party have packed 
        themselves into the hall. The crowd wait in 
        anticipation. 

        SADDAM walks out on to platform, a huge Havana cigar in 
      hand - the PARTY MEMBERS applaud. SADDAM looks out at 
      room from the podium, he stands behind a set of 
        microphones.

      A TV CREWis at the foot of the stage. In the front row 
      are TARIQ, an EMPTY SEAT and then ADNAN KHAIRALLAH and

      TARIQ shrugs as a hush descends upon the room. SADDAM 
      lets the quiet hang for several moments before 
        speaking.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 19

                      Comrades, it causes me great pain, 
                      that one of my first duties as 
                      President is to tell you that we have 
                      uncovered an atrocious plot against 
                      our beloved Baath Party.

      Pause for effect, then he continues to speak slowly and 
        without notes.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                      My pain is not eased by the fact that 
                      these plotters, these collaborators 
                      are sitting amongst us here today.

        SADDAM moves to a seat stage left. MASHHADI steps out 
      from the wings and moves to the podium. He unfolds a 
      piece of paper and begins to read.

                      Since 1975, I have been part of a 
                      Syrian plot to overthrow both Comrade 
                      Saddam and Bakr, in order to pave the 
                      way for an illicit Syrian Iraq 
                        union...When we, the conspirators, 
                      realised that Bakr was to step down in 
                      favour of his deputy, the assumption 
                      of the presidency by Comrade Saddam 
                      Hussein forced us to put into action a 
                      plan to remove him. But as we did so, 
                      we revealed ourselves and our plans 
                      were uncovered.

        SADDAM shakes his head in sorrow as MASHHADI folds his 
      piece of paper and a suited bodyguard escorts him from 
      the stage. SADDAM resumes his position at the podium.

                      Comrades, you can imagine how stunned 
                      I was to discover that I had been 
                      betrayed by my closest colleagues. 
                      After the first of these criminals 
                      were arrested, I asked them: "What 
                      political differences are there

                      should leave the hall.

        SADDAM passes the list to a SECURITY OFFICIAL and moves 
      back to his seat, appearing to be upset. The SECURITY 
        OFFICIAL nervously steps in front of the microphones.

        A sense of terror grips the room. The audience look 
        around in disbelief. 

      The first name is read out and BARZAN directs his 
        SECURITY MEN to the alleged CONSPIRATOR who they escort 
      from the room. As more names are read out SADDAM 
        watches scornfully continuing to smoke his cigar. One 
      of the victims starts to struggle as he is led away.

        Applause and cheering break out in the room, and SADDAM 
      takes the applause - but even his inner circle are left 
        feeling vulnerable.

      TARIQ sits in a quieter corner of the club, he is with 
        BARZAN and ADNAN KHAIRALLAH. Their mood is on the 
        serious side, although all around them, business is 
        booming; music, prostitutes, dancing, alcohol.

        CHEMICAL ALI makes his way through the club, drink in

      The Presidential car flashes past as part of a 
        motorcade.

        Inside the car find SADDAM and SAJIDA.

      The motorcade pulls into a a residential street and 
      stops outside a villa. Inside the car:

                      I can t do this. I can t face her.

        A BODYGUARD opens the door of the car. SADDAM looks at 
        SAJIDA, shakes her head. SADDAM gets out of the car 
      alone and straightens himself and his suit. People stop 
      and stare at this unexpected sighting. Some edge 
        forward to kiss the hand of the PRESIDENT as he makes 
      his way to the door of the villa - which opens as he 
        reaches it. SADDAM enters the villa. SAJIDA is still 
        sitting in the car...she knows she has to follow 
        SADDAM.

                                                                          CUT TO:

        Dressed in black they sit in a circle, holding framed 
        photographs, and wail.

        Suddenly there is silence. SADDAM has entered the room. 
      The women hold their breath. SANAA is the last to 
        notice his presence. When she sees him she is convulsed 
      with horror and fear. She manages to remain steady and 
      still with the aid of the other WOMEN.

        SADDAM stays still and waits, shaking his head slowly, 
      as if in disbelief - how did this happen?BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 28



      SANAA then realises, as do we, that SADDAM is crying.

                                        SADDAM
                      I loved him like a brother. I want you 
                      to know, you will never need for 
                      anything as long as I live. I loved 
                      him...

      He holds his arms out to her, as though asking for her
      to comfort him. SANAA holds back for a moment, but then 
        realises that she has no option. She receives a nudge 
      in the back from a relative and she steps forward, 
        SADDAM embraces her.

                      He and I spoke often, so very often, 
                      about how we would put the nation 
                      before our own needs...Did he ever 
                      talk like that to you?

                      ...Yes.

                      So I know in my heart, that he would 
                      have understood. In my place, he would 
                      have done the same.

        SANAA S DAUGHTER (8), comes up and puts her arms around 
      her mother s waist, comfortingly, protectively, staring 
        dumbly up at SADDAM. He puts his hand on the little 
        GIRL S head.

        SAJIDA has entered the room and appreciatesthe 
        perversity of the scene she is witnessing.

        finishes his Turkish coffee. He wipes his mouth, brow

        HUSBAND. SADDAM sees her. She waits at the bar with her 
        HUSBAND. SADDAM watches her for a while, she glances

        SADDAM is engrossed with SAMIRA. Her HUSBAND has been 
        side-lined; is feeling humiliated and there s nothing 
      he can do but sit there! HUSSEIN watches for a few 
        moments then sits beside the HUSBAND and twists the

        Gunfire. The car brakes, slews and shunts into the car

        breaks loose. It s an ambush.

        RAGHAD, 16 is getting ready for her wedding ceremony. 
      She is surrounded by women - her sisters RANA, 14 and 
      HALA, 11; a sister-in-law to be; some older women in 
        black. There is a festive atmosphere as they perfect

      HALA snatches up the veil, puts it on her head and runs 
      out of the room and down a corridor - the veil flowing 
        behind her. RANA chases after her on to the mezzanine 
      of the ballroom.

        confrontation.

        WATBAN, SAWABI and MOHAMMED watch...as BARZAN begins to 
        descend the stairs towards the AL-MAJIDS.

                      Iraq!BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 61



                                        SADDAM 
                                (takes hold of BARZAN S 
                                face)
                      Know your place Barzan! They are my 
                      blood!... You may be my brother but I 
                      see unrest in you; for your own sake; 
                      for the good of your son; don t make 
                      me feel that this unrest is permanent.

        BARZAN feels a chill down his spine.

                                        BARZAN
                      ....I have given you my soul....

                                        SADDAM 
                              (long pause)
                      You will attend the wedding, and then 
                      you will leave Iraq...because I love 
                      you.
                                (pause)
                      You ll have work to do elsewhere...
                                (pause)
                      I have guests waiting.

      Hold on BARZAN.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      Bang! BARZAN kicks the door of a cubicle as hard as he 
      can with the sole of his shoe - BANG - the door flies 
      back hits a wall and swings back towards BARZAN - he 
      kicks again - BANG! Again, BANG!

                                                                  INTERCUT WITH:



        RAGHAD and her procession emerge on to the mezzanine to 
      the gasps of the GUESTS below. HUSSEIN is sitting on 
      his throne; he beams at his bride-to-be as she descends 
      the stair-case. UDAY is less happy as he watches from a 
        corner of the room.

      TARIQ smiles and nods his approval. RAGHAD makes her 
      way to her throne besides HUSSEIN. Then, and only then 
      does SADDAM make his own grand entrance...

        SAJIDA looks from SADDAM to SAMIRA (KAMEL HANNA still 
      by her side); as SAMIRA watches only the PRESIDENT. The 
      smile momentarily falls from her face as she thinks she 
      spies a look between her husband and the beautiful 
        blonde. 

                                        SAJIDA
                              (to ADNAN)
                      Who s the blonde?

      In a glass elevator, SADDAM descends from the heavens 
      to the applause of the adoring family and GUESTS...
