  FADE IN:


  EXT. OLD ARENA - CAPUA - DAY

  A SEA OF SPECTATORS scream in SLOW MOTION, their faces 
  twisted in bloodlust. Time smashes back to NORMAL as a 
  MURMILLO crashes against the wall in front of the crowd. He 
  narrowly avoids

    A RETIARIUS  TRIDENT

  as it gouges the wood next to his head. TIME SLOWS AND 
  ACCELERATES as Murmillo attacks. The RETIARIUS counters, 
  casting his net. Murmillo dodges, but his opponent's trident 
  finds its mark, ripping open his shoulder.

  BLOOD SPLATTERS

  across the nearest spectators. ADJUST to find BATIATUS AND 
  TITUS in the stands, just out of reach of the crimson rain.

                                        TITUS
                        A net and trident? The man appears 
                        more common fisherman than 
                        gladiator.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The style is called Retiarius, 
                        carried from the outer regions.

                                        TITUS
                        They should carry it back. I favor 
                        the Murmillo.

  The Retiarius draws more blood. The crowd ROARS.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The crowd takes opposite opinion. 
                        Soon we will find a Retiarius upon 
                        the sands in every game. And the 
                        ludus absent them tragically 
                        lacking.

                                        TITUS
                                  reluctantly)(
                        Very well. Yet place net and 
                        trident in hands of one of our 
                        lesser man.

  Batiatus beams at the minor victory. The crowd surges to 
  their feet as the Retiarius sends the Murmillo crashing to 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.
  CONTINUED:

  the sand. Murmillo scrambles, barely avoiding the trident as 
  it slams down again and again, blasting SAND at the CAMERA.

  MURMILLO RALLIES,

  regaining his footing. But the Retiarius swings his net, 
  entangling Murmillo. Murmillo goes down. Retiarius is on him 
  in a flash, slamming his trident down through Murmillo s 
  face plate.

  BLOOD SPRAYS

  as the Murmillo goes limp. The crowd ROARS. Batiatus joins 
  them, delighted by the carnage.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Did I not tell you?! Listen to 
                        them!

                                        TITUS
                                  laughs)(
                        A spectacle, to be sure.

                                        BATIATUS
                        All the more thrilling, if viewed 
                        from the pulvinus.

  Batiatus casts a sour look up to the pulvinus where TULLIUS 
  and VETTIUS laugh and drink, surrounded by PRIVILEGED 
  ROMANS. Titus waves the comment away.

                                        TITUS
                        Invitation was extended.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And refused?

                                        TITUS
                        The pulvinus is too far removed. I 
                        would witness the games here, among 
                        the people. With son beside me.

  OFF Batiatus, the crumb of his father s affection catching 
  him by surprise, yet deeply appreciated...


  INT. CHUTES - OLD ARENA - CAPUA - DAY

  The corpse of the Murmillo is dragged away. ADJUST to find 
  ASHUR and DAGAN watching. Ashur swallows hard at the sight, 
  nerves threatening to unravel.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                        Your hour is upon you.

  They look over to find OENOMAUS approaching with their 
  swords. A gladius for Dagan, the curved sword of a Thraex 
  for Ashur. Ashur tests the weight of it, blustering to 
  bolster courage.

                                        ASHUR
                        A fine blade. To be wielded with 
                        deadly purpose.

  Oenomaus glares at Ashur, unimpressed by the bravado.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Re-form my words, in manner Dagan 
                        understands.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      An honor you have not earned.

                                        ASHUR
                                  frowns, in Aramaic)(

                        honor he does not believe earned.]

  Dagan s eyes narrow in contempt, not liking that.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Your true test awaits you. Live, 
                        and count yourself among us. Die... 
                        and prove yourselves as unworthy as 
                        I suspect.

                        ass.]

  Dagan grins. Ashur  translates. 

                                        ASHUR
                        Dagan says he will honor the House 
                      of Batiatus with gifts of blood. As 
                        will the mighty Ashur.

  Oenomaus sizes him up, doubting his boast.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Remember your training. And do not 
                        die too quickly.

  Oenomaus exits. Ashur s confidence falters as we PRE-LAP the 
  ROAR OF THE CROWD, propelling us to --


  EXT. OLD ARENA - CAPUA - DAY

  A SECUTOR hammers Ashur. Ashur is not without skill, but is 
  outmatched by his opponent.

  A BLOODIED DAGAN RUSHES PAST,

  engaged in his own battle against a HOPLOMACHUS (spear, 
  small shield). They trade thunderous blows. The Hoplomachus 
  thrusts with his spear. Dagan narrowly avoids it, counters 
  by

  HACKING OFF THE ARM

  that wields it. Hoplomachus screams. Dagan stabs him through 
  the throat, silencing the man forever.

  ASHUR

  scrambles to avoid his own opponent s deadly weapon. WHAM! 
  The Secutor lands a bone jarring blow to Ashur s helmet. It 
  flies off as he crashes to the sand. He regains his senses 
  just in time to see

  THE SECUTOR

  raising his weapon for the death blow. But a SWORD suddenly 
  bursts through the Secutor s stomach, showering Ashur in 
  blood. Dagan has run the man through from behind. Ashur 
  surges to his feet and CLEAVES THE MAN S HEAD IN TWO.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

  THE CROWD

  goes wild. Ashur throws his arms up in victory.

                                        ASHUR
                        Hasdrubal falls! As all men who 
                        face Ashur!

  Batiatus is on his feet, CHEERING with the rest of the 
  crowd. Titus frowns at Ashur s grandstanding.

                                        TITUS
                        The man assumes credit owed his 
                        better.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He is but swelled by the moment.

                                        TITUS
                        Perhaps he will turn greater 
                        performance next time.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You speak of what may never pass.

  Batiatus glares up at the pulvinus as Tullius rises to 
  address the crowd.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Now that the less prominent matches 
                        have passed, let us have something 
                      of note. Vettius, make 
                          presentation.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I give the good people of Capua 
                        this day my latest acquisition! 
                        Certain to inflame passion! And 
                        ignite fear in all who oppose him! 
                        From the darkest lands east of the 
                        Rhine... Behold Caburus! Murmillo!

  CABURUS takes the sands to the roar of the crowd. He s a 
  big, ugly, Nordic giant of a man.

                                        TITUS
                        The crowd favors Vettius  offering.

                        They greet Gannicus with louder 
                        voice, yet he stands removed from 
                        the games.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                        fate again. Our men see victory, 
                        only to be awarded exclusion.

                        And who shall face the beast! Enter 
                        Drappes! Thraex!

  DRAPPES takes the sands, squaring nervously for battle.

                                        TITUS
                        The fruits reaped, when you offend 
                        a man beyond our station.

  Titus glances up at Tullius, laughing with his privileged 
  compatriots in the pulvinus.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Begin!

  Caburus attacks, pounding Drappes. The vicious beating 
  continues in the background.

                        I but stood ground to protect our

                        Yet ambition beyond the title

                        aside, and cast eyes below such 
                        lofty goals. We must be humble if I 
                      am to repair relations with 
                        Tullius, and see all our men 
                        returned to the sands.

                        Quickly, I pray. If we are to place

                        Strike it from your thoughts, and 
                        place mind and effort towards more 
                        reasonable pursuits.

  Caburus destroys Drappes in a spray of blood. The crowd goes 
  wild. Titus takes them in with an envious frown.

  OFF BATIATUS, jaw clenched, any warmth he was starting to 
  feel from his father rapidly cooling...


  EXT. CAPUA STREETS - DAY

  An agitated LUCRETIA moves through the market with GAIA. 
  MELITTA attends.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Fleeting opportunity left to enjoy 
                        the old arena, and yet we are swept 
                        aside. Absent even casual regard.

  Gaia searches the market for something, half paying 
  attention.

                                        GAIA

                        reprieved from condemning presence. 
                        The manner Titus glares, it is a 
                        shock we do not burst into flame.

  Gaia forces a smile. Lucretia sees the genuine concern

  Gaia spots what she s been looking for -- or rather who. 
  PETRONIUS, a distinguished Roman, barters with a GRAIN 
  MERCHANT. Early 40s, handsome, with the air of wealth.

                                        GAIA
                        Possibility presents itself, in

                        Fortunate to come upon him, at such 
                        a place and hour.

  Lucretia eyes her with a smile, knowing this wasn t a 
    coincidence.

                                        GAIA
                      In desperate times fortune must 
                        give way to more assertive hands.

  She grins, heads for him. Lucretia follows.

                        I do call him husband, yes.

  Petronius takes her hand, delighted. Gaia shifts 
    uncomfortably, forgotten in his excitement.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        I have heard your house spoken of.

                        And the pleasures contained 
                        within...

  Petronius smiles knowingly. OFF LUCRETIA, her smile in 
  response barely masking her discomfort...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNSET

  Practice swords clash. PULL BACK to reveal CRIXUS sparring 
  with GNAEUS. Crixus sends him to the ground, dazed. Crixus 
  offers his hand, glancing over at BARCA listlessly working 
  the palus as he helps Gnaeus up.

                        the arena!

  A few lackluster cheers from the men. The equivalent of a 
  golf clap. Ashur glowers.

  CLOSE ON the bust of MAGNETIUS (referenced in Episode HB2)

                                        TITUS (O.S.)
                        Magnetius. One of the finest 
                        champions this house has ever 
                        forged.

  WIDEN TO REVEAL Titus studying the stone face. Batiatus 
  hovers next to Gannicus. GUARDS are posted at the doors.

                                        BATIATUS

                      As all my champions. The 
                        culmination of years of training. 
                        Dedication. Sacrifice.

                      In the arena, I am every man s 
                        equal.

                                        TITUS
                        A champion is more than his 
                        victories upon the sands. He is the 
                        sum of his actions. Every decision, 
                      no matter how small, speaks to the 
                        man. And the balance of his heart.

  Batiatus thumps Gannicus  chest.

                        Beneath his breast beats the heart 
                      of a lion.

  Titus  eyes remain on Gannicus, judging his every fiber.

                        And what does it beat for?

  Gannicus considers the question.

                                by rote)(

                        Return him to the ludus.

  Gannicus exchanges a concerned look with Batiatus as he s 
  led out. Batiatus puts on his best face for his father, 
  launches into the hard sell.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You see? The man fights for the 
                        honor of this house. As all your 
                        champions have in the past.

                                        TITUS
                        Gannicus speaks but words he knows 
                        I seek to hear. He is no champion 
                      of my house.

  Titus exits. OFF BATIATUS, smoldering...

                      It is not as if all of Rome knows. 
                        Only the most privileged tongues 
                        whisper of the delights offered 
                        within these walls. Delights 
                        Petronius and his friends long to 
                        witness for themselves...

                      To even consider it is beyond 
                        reason. If Titus were to discover 
                        such a thing --

                        What joy does my father prevent 
                        now?

  The women turn to find Batiatus entering the room, still 
  fuming from his father s low opinion of Gannicus.

                        name...?

  Lucretia shoots her a withering look, not wishing to broach 
  the subject. Gaia ignores it.

                                        BATIATUS

                        equal position.

  Batiatus considers that with a frown.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And how did good Petronius come to 
                        know of such things?

  Lucretia waves Melitta out of the room.

                        Varus and Cossutius. Their tongues

                        quick birth, or see opportunity 
                        aborted.

  Batiatus wrestles with the temptation for advancement.

                        With Petronius  support, we may yet

                      of the new arena.

                        will attend to my father.

  OFF BATIATUS, a plan taking form as the CAMERA SLOWLY SINKS 
  through the floor, TRANSITIONING US TO --


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  A GUARD escorts Melitta through the barracks. Gannicus steps 
  from the baths, half naked. His heart catching at the 
  unexpected sight of her. Melitta continues on without even a 
  glance. Gannicus hustles after her.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Melitta. A word.

                                          MELITTA

                      It is a matter of some importance.

  Melitta pauses. Sees the somber look in his eyes. Relents.

                                          MELITTA
                                to Guard)(
                        A moment.

  He moves to the side. Gannicus whispers to her. Part 
  secrecy, part intimacy.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You avoid my gaze.

                                          MELITTA
                      As you should mine. Lest suspicions 
                      be aroused.

                        Will they not also be raised, if 
                        two friends are no longer seen to 
                        speak?

  Melitta considers that, reluctantly nods. Gannicus struggles 
  to find the right words.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        What happened between us --

                        Was not of our choosing. We must 
                        turn it from thought, and never 
                        give it voice.

                                        GANNICUS
                      My tongue bends to such warning.
                                  a beat, soft)(
                        Yet the thought of you... It proves 
                        troublesome.

  Melitta sees a rare glimpse of emotion in Gannicus. 
    Uncertainty. Genuine attraction. She looks away, not wanting 
  Gannicus to see how affected she is.

                                          MELITTA
                        The memory will fade with time. As 
                      do all things born of misfortune.

  Melitta rejoins the Guard. Gannicus watches her drift away 
  to Oenomaus  cell, longing and regret swelling in his eyes.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                        more.


  INT. OENOMAUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Melitta lies naked with Oenomaus, half-listening, the 
  exchange with Gannicus weighing heavily.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The men no longer accept me as a 
                        gladiator. And do not yet give 
                        respect as doctore. Even Gannicus 
                        refuses to heed my instruction.

                                          MELITTA
                        Gannicus heeds nothing but his own 
                        desires, beyond all reason. You 
                        must teach him that you alone are 
                      in command. You must take control.

  Melitta straddles Oenomaus, her lips inches from his.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        And by firm hand, erase all doubts.

  She kisses him.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        Show them all the man I have given 
                      my heart to.

  She devours him, desperately attempting to wipe her own 
  thoughts of Gannicus from her mind. Oenomaus is surprised by 
  her passion, but quickly responds in kind. He flips her 
  over, pinning her down.

  MELITTA GASPS

  as he roughly enters her. Her nails dig into his back, 
  urging him to thrust harder. SLOWLY PUSH IN on Melitta s 
  face as she struggles to give herself over to the moment. To 
  erase her doubt. As her eyes close...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - MORNING

  FOLLOW CRIXUS  PRACTICE SWORD as it slices through the air 
  in SLOW MOTION, connecting with GNAEUS  FACE. Wood 
  splinters. Blood flies. Gnaeus drops.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                        Gnaeus!

  Gnaeus looks up to see Oenomaus, whip clenched in his hand. 
  Voice firm and commanding. Closer to the Doctore we will 
  come to know in season 1.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Your mastery of the sword falls to 
                        question. The net and trident are 
                        your weapons now.

  The other men chuckle as a LUDUS SLAVE hustles over with a 
  practice net and trident. Gannicus glances over from where 
  he sits in the shade, curious at the change in Oenomaus  
  demeanor. Gnaeus scowls.

                                        GNAEUS
                        A fucking net, Oenomaus?

  Oenomaus suddenly unleashes his whip. The shotgun CRACK of 
  leather splits the air. Gnaeus grimaces as an ANGRY WELT 
  starts from his skin. The men go quiet.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You will do as commanded, absent 
                        complaint. Or see flesh stripped 
                        from bone.

  A tense beat. Gnaeus backs down, lowering eyes in respect.

                                        GNAEUS
                        Yes, Doctore.

  Gnaeus takes the net and trident. Oenomaus barks at the men.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Return to training!

  The men comply. Gannicus ambles over.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You speak as Jupiter, hurling bolts 
                        from the heavens.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Raised there by words and touch of 
                        loving wife.

  Gannicus forces a smile. Oenomaus fails to notice the pain 
  behind them.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                        Pair with Barca. And remain far 
                        from shade.

  Oenomaus strides off. Gannicus watches him for a second, 
  before shifting his eyes to Melitta on the Balcony. She sets 
  food and wine for Batiatus, Lucretia and Titus. Melitta 
  catches the look, quickly shifts her gaze. Gannicus 
  tightens, his pain replaced by the hot sting of anger.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Barca! Bring fucking spear to 
                        purpose.

  Barca complies, somewhat lackluster. Gannicus lays into him. 
  Titus takes note from the balcony.

  Titus half chuckles, half coughs.

                        Sound and pallor threaten 
                          disagreement. You have been too

  Melitta returns with the honeyed wine. Lucretia takes it and 
  quickly pours a cup for Titus. [NOTE: Lucretia must pour the 
  wine herself.]

  Titus is seized by a minor fit of coughing. Lucretia presses

  Titus drinks the wine. Clears his throat. Eyes Batiatus and 
  Lucretia.

                                        TITUS
                        You conspire against an old man.
                                (the hint of a 
                                  smile)
                      To your advantage. Make 
                        preparation. We leave for Neapolis.

  Titus exits. Batiatus grins, whispering to Lucretia.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He is attended to as promised. Have 
                        Gaia send word to Petronius. You 
                        entertain tonight.

                        And if he and his circle overreach? 
                        The appetites of men are not easily 
                        set aside by words of a woman.

  Batiatus sees the point of that.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                        will stand in my place, and speak 
                        for the house if so needed.

                        The risk outweighs concern. See to 
                        Petronius and his guests. And with 
                        their satisfaction, our position in 
                        the opening games secured.

  Batiatus kisses her and moves inside. OFF LUCRETIA, her own 
  concerns far from assuaged...


  INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNSET

  Gruel slops into a bowl as the men take evening meal. 
  RHASKOS snorts to Gnaeus as he passes.

                                          RHASKOS
                        Snare any fish today in your little 
                        net?

  The men chuckle. Gnaeus seethes. ANGLE ON Ashur and Dagan, 
  receiving coin from Oenomaus.

                                        OENOMAUS

                        Continue and see more weigh palm.

  Dagan grins, receiving twice as much as Ashur.

                                        DAGAN

  Ashur frowns sourly, mistranslates.

                        Dagan questions receiving the 
                        greater sum. We stood equally upon 
                        the sands.

  Oenomaus dismantles Ashur with cutting eyes.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

  Oenomaus moves away. Ashur seethes. Crixus passes with a 
  crust of bread in hand, WIPING US TO --


  INT. BARCA S CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNSET

  The din of the men s VOICES echoes through to the barracks, 
  where Barca sits alone, cradling one of Auctus  birds. A 
  small reminder of his fallen lover.

                                        CRIXUS (O.S.)
                        Bread.

  Barca looks up to find Crixus in the doorway with his crust 
  of bread.

                                        CRIXUS
                        For your pets.

  Barca stares with deadened eyes, says nothing. Crixus turns 
  to go, pauses.

                        Doiros was the brother I held 
                        closest to me. A fierce warrior, as 
                        our father and all before us. I 
                        would listen at their feet to their 
                        many tales of battle. Longing for 
                        the day I was of an age to take up 
                        arms and stand with them in glory.

                        spears of the Arverni. My hands yet 
                        too small to raise sword against 
                        them. I was forced to serve. To bow 
                        and scrape. First to the shits that 
                        took my family from me. Then to the 
                        Romans they sold me to. Not a day

                        remembered.

  Crixus sets the bread down next to Barca, turns to go.

                                        BARCA

                        Now they are all that is left.

  Barca picks up Crixus  peace offering of bread, feeds it to 
  the bird he s holding. OFF the unlikely bond forming between 
  the two men...


  EXT. NEAPOLIS STREET - SUNSET

  A bustling street, vibrantly colored with MERCHANTS and 
  their wares brought in from every corner of the Republic. In 
  the distance we see SHIPS docked in the harbor, the setting 
  sun framing their sails. ADJUST TO FIND Titus and Batiatus 
  inspecting a SLAVE TRADER s row of MEN.

                      is carved, each muscle building 
                        upon the next? A worthy addition to 
                        any ludus.

  They head off, WIPING US TO --


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  SLAVES bustle as final preparations are made for Petronius 
  and his guests. DIONA absently lights a row of candles, her 
  own glow considerably dimmed. She finishes, doesn t blow her 
  stick out. Watches detached as the flame licks her fingers.

  She blows it out as NAEVIA approaches. Naevia grabs her 
  hand, inspecting Diona s fingers with worry.

  Naevia sadly watches Diona as she disappears into the 
  atrium, passing Lucretia and Melitta as they enter. 
  Lucretia, dressed in her finest gown, hands Melitta a list.

  Melitta exits as Gaia sweeps into the room, resplendent in

  smile.

                        These hands are not meant for 
                        common earth. They have held me 
                        close as dearest friend. As sister. 
                        Tonight mine shall return favor, 
                        and aid yours in seizing position 
                      so richly deserved.

  Gaia kisses Lucretia. A sincere gesture of love. As she 
  pulls back she spots SOLONIUS entering across the room, 
    unencumbered by attending slaves.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                        Solonius arrives. Let us greet him, 
                        and forge memory of a night not 
                        soon forgotten.

  Gaia moves to Solonius. Lucretia lingers, the hint of worry 
  refusing to vacate her eyes. PRE-LAP: The GRUNTS of SEX 
  rise.


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Rhaskos fucks a MASKED GIRL from behind on a raised dais. 
  Petronius and a DOZEN PRIVILEGED ROMAN MEN laugh and drink 
  as they take in the show. They are attended by beautiful, 
  topless SLAVES in masks.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.
  CONTINUED:

  A DOZEN GLADIATORS

  stand off to the side on display. Stripped to their 
    subligarias. Hardened bodies glistening with scented oils. 
  TRACK past Barca, Dagan, Ashur, Gnaeus, and Crixus, who 
  stares wide eyed at the proceedings. Come to rest on

  GANNICUS,

  who ignores the show in favor of Melitta across the room 
  with Lucretia, Gaia, and Solonius. Gannicus quickly averts 
  his gaze as

  OENOMAUS

  passes by. His hand tightens on his whip, barely concealing 
  his displeasure with such a dishonorable event. Melitta 
  catches the look, forces a pained smile of support as she 
  pours more wine for Gaia.

                                        GAIA
                        The man is no Gannicus, yet he 
                        surpasses in enthusiasm. They are 
                        well received.

  Solonius squirms, obviously uncomfortable with this.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      As are all things born of base 
                        desire.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Apologies. We ask too much of you 
                      in this, yet your presence is of 
                        much comfort.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The situation forces us all into 
                        actions otherwise never considered. 
                        The blame lies in the Fates, 
                        absolving weighted heart.

  Rhaskos thrusts harder. The Girl GASPS in pain, her mask 
  falling off to reveal DIONA. Her eyes find Naevia, who moves 
  among the Romans with an amphora of wine. Its purpose 
  forgotten in her hands as tears well in her eyes. Diona 
  looks away in shame.

  NAEVIA

  notices one of the Roman s eyes crawling over her. Her heart 
  seizes in her chest. She starts as Melitta appears at her 
  side, taking the amphora and handing her an empty.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.
  CONTINUED:

                                          MELITTA
                        See this to the pantry.
                                  soft)(
                        And remain there until I call upon 
                        you, after all have left.

  Naevia registers surprise and relief.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        Go.

  Naevia complies, sparing a pained look back at Diona before 
  exiting. Oenomaus joins Melitta, his eyes flashing disgust 
  as he whispers to her.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      We dishonor this house.

                                          MELITTA
                      We but do as commanded.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The cause does not alter result.

                                          MELITTA
                        No. Yet we must move beyond it, or 
                      be driven to madness.

  Melitta steals a glance at Gannicus as she returns to 
  Lucretia s side, her words meant to convince herself as well 
  as her husband.

  RHASKOS

  grabs Diona s hair as his thrusts increase in intensity.

                                          PETRONIUS
                                  laughing)(
                        The man fucks as a bull, horns to 
                        purpose.

  Diona grunts in pain as he climaxes. Petronius and the 
  Romans APPLAUD as Rhaskos dismounts, leaving a humiliated 
  Diona to gather her robes. Gaia nudges Lucretia forward to 
  address the guests.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gratitude to all for gracing the 
                        House of Batiatus with esteemed 
                        presence. One my husband regrets he 
                        cannot share, due to pressing 
                        business.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.
  CONTINUED:

  Petronius eyes Diona and Rhaskos with a lurid grin.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        I had not noticed his absence.

  The other Guests laugh in agreement.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What you have seen is but a taste 
                      of the pleasures afforded you 
                        beneath humble roof. Our 
                        gladiators, our slaves, everything 
                        within these walls, I place at the 
                        whims of your desire. For a single 
                        night, you are the masters of this 
                        house.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S.)
                      An enticing offer.

  Lucretia turns, shocked to find Tullius entering. Cold eyes 
  belying warm smile.

                                          TULLIUS
                        One I would see to full advantage.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Tullius.

  Her heart claws into her throat. Solonius stiffens in 
  surprise next to an intrigued Gaia. OFF LUCRETIA, forcing a 
  smile to disguise rising fear...

                                        TITUS (PRELAP)
                        I have never cared for surprises.


  INT. TAVERN - NEAPOLIS - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON a cup being filled with wine. PULL BACK TO FIND 
  Titus and Batiatus seated in a cramped, seedy tavern.

                                        TITUS
                        And you have provided many in your 
                        day.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your disappointment has often been 
                        given voice. A loud, clear one.

  Batiatus downs his cup, pours another.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.
  CONTINUED:

                                        TITUS
                          Disappointment can only exist upon 
                        expectation. You proved from tender 
                        age you would listen to no one s 
                        counsel save your own.

  Batiatus laughs at the ridiculousness of the statement.

                                        BATIATUS
                        When did I ever turn from iron 
                        advice? A desire to gain military 
                        experience raised your objection. 
                        And I turned from it. You commanded 
                        I run the ludus in your absence. I 
                        obeyed, abandoning my own desires, 
                        now long forgotten. When has son 
                        ever denied the father?

  Titus replies, more with sympathy than anger.

                                        TITUS
                        When he married a woman beneath 
                        him.

  A tense beat. Batiatus drinks, replies softly.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You were wrong about her. As you 
                        have been of many things.

  Titus feels the truth in that. A sad smile creeps across his 
  face.

                                        TITUS
                      An old man s mistakes swell in the 
                        breast, as remaining days shrink.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  snorts)(
                        You will outlive us all. You are 
                        too stubborn to die.

  Titus chuckles, takes a sip of wine.

                                        TITUS
                      Do you think me a fool, Quintus?

                                        BATIATUS
                        There are many words I would use 
                        towards your description. Fool 
                        lives not among them.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.
  CONTINUED:

                                        TITUS
                        No, it is not. You knew those 
                        slaves were shit before we ever set 
                        foot to path. The purchase of men 
                        was not the reason you parted me 
                        from the ludus, was it?

  Batiatus tenses, fearing his ruse has been discovered. But 
  Titus laughs warmly, clasping his son s arm.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        You wish to find common ground, far 
                        from the site of former 
                          disagreements.

  Batiatus returns the smile, tension fading.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My deception meant only to 
                        strengthen bond between father and 
                        son.

                                        TITUS
                        This surprise is one most welcome. 
                        And long overdue.

  Batiatus musters a smile, feeling the guilt of his lie.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                                  laughs, rises)(
                        Yet we did not need to travel so 
                        far from comfort. I would return 
                        home, and continue in warmer 
                          surroundings.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  surprised)(
                        Now? Should we not wait until break 
                      of day?

                        A few hours upon the road, and our 
                        own beds to fall to. Come. Let us 
                        put this wretched city behind us, 
                        and embrace closer future.

  OFF BATIATUS  worry of returning home too soon...                                                                                    31.


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Tullius laughs and drinks with Petronius and several other 
  Guests. He glances across the room to where Lucretia, Gaia, 
  and Solonius huddle. Appraises Gaia with an admiring eye.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        How does that man find himself

                        Petronius, or perhaps loose tongue 
                      of his confederates...

  Gaia smiles at Tullius as she whispers to Lucretia.

                                        GAIA
                        His presence changes nothing.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It upends the fucking earth.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I will break words, and gauge 
                        intent.

  Solonius moves off, concern creasing troubled brow.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      To stand with a smile in our 
                        fucking house. After the injury put 
                      to my husband.

                                        GAIA
                        Force him from thought, or see 
                        effort and risk fall short of 
                        reward. Petronius and his guests 
                        stand erect with expectation. Let 
                      us see them to climax.

  Lucretia steels her nerves, whispers to Melitta.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Bring them out.

  Melitta nods, moves off. Lucretia eyes Tullius across the 
  room with barely concealed hatred as Solonius joins him. 
  Solonius sips his wine, casually enters into conversation.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Good Tullius. Finding you here 
                        comes a surprise.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                        Surely not to you.

  Solonius tightens, lowering his voice to an agitated hiss.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I warned you of Batiatus  
                        maneuverings not as invitation, but 
                      in hopes you would prevent such 
                        foolishness. And the retribution 
                        against valued friend it would 
                        bring.

  Tullius  eyes darken, although his smile remains constant.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You warned me to grow favor. 
                        Continue speaking and see it 
                        wither.

  Solonius squirms as Lucretia steps forward with the GOLD 
  MASK OF APOLLO in her hand (similar to the one in ep 109, 
  season 1). Melitta and Slave Girls stand behind her with 
  trays of more masks. Jupiter, Neptune, Mars -- enough for 
  all the guests.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You have shared drink. Food. 
                        Distraction for eye and ear. Yet 
                        these are common things. Enjoyed by 
                        men bound by accusing morality of 
                        their deeds.

  She directs that barb at Tullius, wrapped in a warm smile.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I would see you freed from such 
                        human constraints.

  She motions Melitta and the Slaves to distribute the masks.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Touch these to flesh. Sever all 
                        ties from the mortal world. And 
                        rise as gods in the House of 
                        Batiatus.

  The Romans clamor, eyeing the Gladiators and half-naked 
  Slaves hungrily. Petronius takes the mask of Jupiter.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        Jupiter!

                        Never in our dealings have I been 
                      so elevated.

                                          TULLIUS
                        This house is truly a marvel. Yet 
                      if I am to assume mantle of a god, 
                        I would first prove myself against 
                        one.

  His eyes land on Gannicus. Lucretia tightens.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You would challenge Gannicus?

                                          TULLIUS
                        A harmless exhibition. To measure 
                        humble skill against vaunted 
                        prowess.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        I would pause in my desires, to 
                        witness such a thing.

  The other Guests chime in their drunken agreement. Lucretia 
  knows this is a bad idea, but Tullius has forced her hand.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                to Oenomaus)(

                        Wood? The clash of steel is what 
                        rings through the halls of Olympus, 
                      is it not?

  More drunken agreement from the Romans. Lucretia reluctantly 
  nods to the house Guards.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Give them your swords.

  One Guard gives his weapon to Tullius, the other to 
  Gannicus.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        Let us clear space, and have 
                        contest!

  Gannicus grins, feeling the weight of his sword. Oenomaus 
  hisses in his ear.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                        See grin removed. You are to 
                        indulge him, allow a show of blood 
                      -- but level no insult nor injury 
                      in return. Such action would bear 
                        unfortunate consequence.

  Gannicus absorbs the gravity of that.

                                        GANNICUS
                      So I am to lose?

                                        OENOMAUS
                        And win your life.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Come! Let us see if I recall what I 
                        learned, years ago in service to 
                        the Republic.

  CAMERA CIRCLES as Tullius and Gannicus face off. Gannicus 
  catches Melitta s worried look as Tullius attacks. A simple 
  exchange, easily deflected. Tullius laughs, shoots a warm 
  smile Gaia s way.

  STEEL FLASHES

  as Tullius attacks again. Faster. Light-hearted nature 
  fading as he DRAWS BLOOD. Melitta tenses. Lucretia seizes 
  Gaia s hand in concern. The Romans APPLAUD. Tullius plays to 
  them with a laugh.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Ah. It begins to return to me.

  Tullius grins at Gaia, showing off for her. Tullius circles 
  Gannicus, his eyes dancing with malevolent intent. Gannicus 
  is at a sizable disadvantage since he can only defend. 
  Tullius unleashes a deadly volley, lands another cut. BLOOD 
  FLOWS.

  GANNICUS

  grits his teeth against the pain. Crixus and the other 
  Gladiators eye the contest with mounting concern. Tullius 
  unloads a series of thunderous blows, drawing more blood. 
  Tullius pulls Gannicus close as their swords lock.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                                  whispered)(
                        I stand unscathed. Perhaps you are 
                        not the champion I believed.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

  Gannicus snarls, shoves Tullius away. The Romans TITTER 
  Tullius chuckles, delighted at getting a rise.

                        The man finally shows life.

  Gannicus shoots a look to Oenomaus, who shakes his head just 
  enough to send private warning. You cannot strike back. 
  Gannicus buries his rage as Tullius presses his assault, 
  repeatedly drawing blood.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        This goes too far.

  Lucretia looks to Solonius. He averts his eyes, powerless to 
  intercede. Tullius slices open Gannicus  chest and smashes 
  him in the face with his hilt, sending him to his knees.

  GANNICUS,

  beaten and bloodied, looks to Melitta. Swallows all his 
  pride, holds up two fingers. The MISSIO. Tullius ignores it, 
  rearing back to end Gannicus and the affront he represents.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Tullius!

  Tullius whips furious eyes to Lucretia. Silence grips the 
  room. Lucretia smiles, trying to be diplomatic.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Apologies. The man gives the 
                        missio. The match is yours.

  A tense beat. Tullius laughs, lowering his sword. Melitta 
  remembers to breathe.

                                          TULLIUS
                        A god of the arena. Saved by a 
                        woman.

  The air returns to the room as Petronius and his Guests join 
  in Tullius  amusement. Gannicus seethes, blood dripping.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                to Melitta)(
                        See him to the Medicus.

  Oenomaus helps Gannicus up, motions for a Guard to escort 
  Melitta. Petronius steps forward as they exit with Gannicus.

  The Romans applaud. Lucretia nods in thanks, her eyes 
  flicking nervously to Tullius as he steps forward.

  Tullius takes the golden mask of Apollo from Lucretia s 
  hands with a knowing smile. He brings the mask up to his 
  face, WIPING US TO --


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON A WOUND tended by frail, dirty hands. PULL BACK to 
  reveal a WITHERED MEDICUS as he finishes treating Gannicus  
  injuries. He shuffles past Melitta, exiting to dispose of 
  soiled rags and a bowl of bloody water.

  Gannicus painfully sits up.

                        I could have ended the man in half

                        Yet you allowed him to nearly kill

  He sees the genuine concern in her eyes. Is affected by it.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I was ordered not to raise hand.

  Gannicus half grins, breaking the moment.

  An electric beat. He tentatively reaches out to take her 
  hand. She instinctively pulls back. Uncertain. Needing a 
  safe distance between them.

                                          MELITTA
                        I should return to the villa.

  Gannicus rises, narrowing the gap between them. Needing to 
  be closer.

  She struggles with the question, her own guilt over 
  unexpected feelings for Gannicus swirling in her eyes. She 
  averts them, unable to hold his gaze.

  Melitta locks eyes with him. The atmosphere charged. No more 
  safe distance. Tears well, her voice trembling.

                        husband? And learned of such a

  He pulls her into a TIME STOPPING, EARTH SHATTERING KISS. 
  Melitta responds, caught in the moment. She pulls away, 
  regaining herself. Shocked at her own longing. She turns and 
  quickly exits, seized by guilt. OFF GANNICUS, hope and shame 
  mixing in equal measure...


  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Petronius and his Guests, faces obscured by the masks of the 
  gods, partake of Lucretia s offerings. Romans watch 
  Gladiators fuck Slaves. Romans fuck Gladiators and Slaves. 
  Barca gets fucked by a Roman. Another Roman watches Crixus 
  fuck a Slave while Gnaeus blows him.

  ASHUR AND DAGAN

  stand with DURATIUS, a young muscular gladiator, and a few 
  other men waiting to be chosen. A short ROMAN wearing the 
  mask of MARS approaches, taking in Dagan with hungry eyes.

                                        MASKED ROMAN
                        You are an imposing brute. Tell me, 
                        giant. Where do your tastes lie? 
                        Towards cock, or cunt?

  Dagan looks to Ashur in confusion.

                                        ASHUR
                                to Roman)(
                        Apologies, he does not grasp your 
                        language.

                                        MASKED ROMAN
                        Are you able to form words, so that 
                      he may?

  Ashur glances across the room at Oenomaus, the request 
  stirring hateful feelings of earlier slight.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.
  CONTINUED:

                                        ASHUR
                                  tight smile)(
                        I serve but to do so.

                                        MASKED ROMAN
                                to Dagan)(
                        I do not care for struggle nor 
                        complaint. Will you submit to all I 
                        ask of you?

  Ashur hesitates, his conscience making a brief appearance, 
  then mistranslates to Dagan.

                                        ASHUR
                                in Aramaic)(
                      Hu Haze lakh yatir gavra minni. [He 
                        finds you more a man than I.]

                                        DAGAN
                                  laughs, in Aramaic)(
                         Ena shapirta, haden. [A fine eye, 
                        this one.]

  The slight burns Ashur even more. He turns to the Roman, all 
  hesitation gone.

                                        ASHUR
                      He is agreeable.

                                        MASKED ROMAN
                        Come then. I would have your ass 
                        quickly.

  Dagan s mirth fades.

                                        DAGAN
                                in Aramaic)(
                      Ma hu ba e minni? [What does he 
                        want of me?]

                                        ASHUR
                                in Aramaic)(
                        Kul ma de-mithbe e, ant Hayyava le-

                        comply. Or see both our lives 
                        forfeit.]
                                to Masked Roman)(
                      He tells me he hopes you are not of 
                        a gentle nature. A brute such as 
                        this craves rough hands, and cock 
                        their equal.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.
  CONTINUED:

  Duratius glances at Ashur, wondering if that is really what 
  Dagan just said.

                                        MASKED ROMAN
                        Then he shall be well satisfied. 
                        Come.

  Dagan shoots Ashur a worried look as he s led off. Ashur 
  allows himself a dark smile. Melitta passes, returning from 
  Gannicus. Oenomaus intercepts her.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        How does he fare?

                                          MELITTA
                        Painfully. Yet he lives.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      It should not have happened.

                                          MELITTA
                      To be said of many things this 
                        night.

  Melitta turns away, the guilt of the kiss swelling. She 
  quickly moves across the room to join Lucretia, Gaia, and 
  Solonius. Lucretia eyes Tullius standing quietly amid the 
  debauchery. Watching through the Golden Mask of Apollo.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He does not drink. He does not 
                        fuck. Why does he remain?

                                        GAIA
                        The man is a mystery.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        One I would have forever solved.
                                to Solonius)(
                        You gauged nothing of his intent?

                                        SOLONIUS
                      He fears your husband attempts 
                        maneuver. I believe his presence is 
                        meant only to rattle nerves.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Would that were the end of it. 
                        Tullius will give voice to this 
                        until the din reaches Titus.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

                        Then we must keep his tongue 
                        occupied.

  Gaia s eyes sparkle with salacious intent.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You believe your charms will sway 
                        him?

                                        GAIA
                        You know nothing of women, 
                        Solonius. And even less of their 
                        charms.

  Gaia smiles at Tullius across the room. Tullius removes his 
  mask, returning it warmly.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would not ask you to do this.

                                        GAIA
                        That is why I offer.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  not buying it)(
                        The only reason?

  Gaia gives him a withering look.

                                        GAIA
                        The man proves troublesome thorn. 
                        Who better to remove it than 
                        trusted friend?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia --

                                        GAIA
                        Keep thoughts towards elevating 
                        this house. I will see to 
                        Tullius... and in the act secure 
                        elevation of my own. To the benefit 
                      of all.

  She kisses Lucretia and moves to join Tullius.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The woman thinks highly of herself.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      An estimation deeply shared.

  OFF LUCRETIA, radiating appreciation and love for her

  INT. GAIA S BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Silky fabrics have been draped from the ceiling. Overstuffed 
  trunks spread out here and there, other wigs on display. 
  Gaia enters, a cup of wine in her hand, a laugh on her lips. 
  Tullius follows, his mask discarded.

                                        GAIA
                        You have become a difficult man to 
                        gain private audience with. It was 
                        not always so.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Much has changed since our youth.

  Gaia takes him in with a coy smile.

                                        GAIA
                        Not everything I hope.

  He returns her smile with genuine affection.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I remember a time when you were the 
                        one impossible to trap alone. Every 
                        man in Capua was at your feet.

                                        GAIA
                        Now I would have but one. Standing 
                        beside me.

  It s a charged moment, perfect for a kiss, but Tullius 
  shifts the conversation.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I was saddened to hear of your 
                        husband s passing.

                                        GAIA
                        Were you?

  A knowing smile tugs at her lips. Tullius laughs, caught in 
  the lie.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Only towards thought of you. Once 
                        again with no family to speak of. 
                      No one to care for you.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                      To find a man who stands my equal.

  Tullius grins in appreciation, favoring her boldness. He 
  gently touches the red hair of her wig, considering it.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I always favored this color.

  She kisses him. He responds, passions rising. Guides her 
  down to the bed. Hands exploring...

                                          TULLIUS
                        The gods smile upon me, having had 
                        word of this evening reach my ears.

                                        GAIA
                        The fortune is mine.

  Gaia lets him open her dress, exposing her bare breasts.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                        Yet I would have word travel no 
                        further.

  Tullius pauses, eyes narrowing.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You petition this for yourself? Or 
                        the House of Batiatus?

  Gaia speaks lightly, but with great calculation behind it.

                                        GAIA
                        Lucretia is as a sister to me. I 
                        would not see her injured by 
                        wagging tongue.

  Tullius kisses her softly, his hands caressing her breasts.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You ask much.

                                        GAIA
                        I offer more...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

  Her hand slips beneath Tullius  robes. Tullius reacts, 
  kissing her roughly. She responds in kind. Two predators 
  devouring each other.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I swear I will never speak of what 
                        happened this night. If you will 
                        deliver message to your friend and 
                        her husband. One they will take to 
                        heart, coming from you...


  OFF THE DEVIL S BARGAIN...


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  The festivities are over. Petronius and the last lingering 
  Guests are escorted to the door by Lucretia and Solonius.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        Words have not inflated beyond 
                        truth. The offerings of the House 
                      of Batiatus are truly to be 
                        admired.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Even more so upon the sands. 
                        Imagine the excitement our wares 
                        would cause, if included in opening 
                        celebration of the new arena.

  Petronius gives a satisfied CHUCKLE.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        Capua would be blessed by such 
                        appearance. I will send word to 
                        your husband to discuss the matter.

  Petronius exits with the last of his Guests. Lucretia sags 
  in relief.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I thought this night never to end.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      It concludes with this house 
                        soaring to the heavens, upon your 
                        wings.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        A feat aided by your presence.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.
  CONTINUED:

  Solonius forces a smile, the guilt of his actions with 
  Tullius weighing on his conscience.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The evening would have gone as well 
                        had I never known. Perhaps more so.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The hour is late. Take to your bed, 
                        and carry with you my gratitude.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would linger, until all guests 
                        have departed.

  His eyes shift towards the villa, concerned with Tullius 
  still within.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia is a woman of great appetite. 
                        Dawn will threaten before she has 
                        had her fill.

  Solonius reluctantly nods. Starts to head out. Pauses.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Lucretia?

  She turns back. Solonius looks to her with great affection.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        This house. It would be pale 
                        shadow, absent your light.

  Solonius musters a smile, exits before she can respond. OFF 
  LUCRETIA, glowing from the praise...


  INT. TRICLINIUM/TROPHY ROOM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Naevia and other Slaves return the villa to order. Naevia 
  glances over at a deadened Diona, who avoids her look. 
  Lucretia passes with Melitta in tow as they enter the 
  deserted trophy room.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        See everything restored to proper 
                        place. Nothing must be suspected.

  Melitta s thoughts drift to her kiss with Gannicus.

                                          MELITTA
                        Yes, domina.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.
  CONTINUED:

  Lucretia catches the troubled look, misinterprets.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I know you feel it is a betrayal. 
                        Yet there are times when the truth 
                      is more hurtful. Titus must never 
                        know.

                                          MELITTA
                        Domina.

  Melitta moves off. Lucretia starts to leave, pauses. The 
  GOLD MASK OF APOLLO is resting on the flat surface of the 
  bust of Magnetius. She picks it up, eyeing it with a faint 
  smile. She and Gaia have pulled off the impossible.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S.)
                        Apollo.

  Lucretia turns, surprised to see Tullius appearing from the 
  shadows. She tenses, tries to hide it. Not wanting to give 
  Tullius the satisfaction of knowing he frightens her.

                                          TULLIUS
                        God of the sun.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And truth.

  Tullius takes the mask of Apollo from Lucretia s hands.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Something often obscured by the 
                        masks we wear.

  Lucretia swallows. Nervous. Looks around the empty room.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Your guests have abandoned you. I 
                        thought the toad Solonius would at 
                        least remain.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The hour is late. He believed you 
                        occupied for the night.

  He nods. Runs a finger across the mask.

                                          TULLIUS
                        They say Apollo brings warmth and 
                        prosperity, to those who would pray 
                      to him. Those who understand their 
                        place. On their knees.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

  He locks eyes with her. Lucretia is clearly terrified. Tries 
  to hide it with a disarming smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Tullius --

                                          TULLIUS
                        Did you know I often dreamt of 
                        Gaia s touch, when I was a younger 
                        man? The taste of her lips. Now 
                        they form words in ear, asking 
                        favor for this house. Placing me in 
                        difficult position.

  Lucretia sees a crack in Tullius  armor. Moves to exploit 
  it.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia s affections for this house 
                        are genuine. As are those she holds 
                        for you.

                                          TULLIUS
                                  soft)(
                        Returned in kind.

  He hands the mask of Apollo back to Lucretia with a warm 
  smile.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        She holds my reply. Go to her, and 
                        see it delivered.

  Tullius exits. A smile begins to bloom. Gaia has done the 
  impossible. OFF LUCRETIA s relief...


  INT. GAIA S BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Lucretia rushes in, overjoyed.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia --

  She freezes in horror, the words constricting in her throat. 
  REVERSE to find

  GAIA DEAD,

  her naked body splattered with blood. Limp arm hanging off 
  the bed. Battered face half turned towards Lucretia. 
  Lifeless eyes staring open. Her wig lays on the floor, 
  dislodged by the violence.                                                                                    48.


  EXTREME LOW ANGLE

  as the mask of Apollo slips forgotten from Lucretia s grasp. 
  It falls towards CAMERA, WIPING US TO --


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - LATE NIGHT

  Titus rails at Batiatus. Lucretia sits with tears streaking 
  her face, shell-shocked.

                                        TITUS
                        Have you lost mind!?! Again 
                        attempting to maneuver around 
                        Tullius?

                                        BATIATUS
                        I only sought to elevate our 
                        position --

                                        TITUS
                      By plunging the good name of this 
                        house into muck and shit!

                                        BATIATUS
                        What would you have me do? Bow and 
                        scrape to that fucking lunatic?

                                        TITUS
                      He is above our station! I gave 
                        warning not to provoke the man. You 
                        ignore it and here are the results. 
                        A Roman citizen. Dead in my house.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  soft)(
                      By the hands of the very man you 
                        defend.

  Titus levels a withering glare.

                                        TITUS
                        You help set this in motion, and 
                        now claim innocence in the outcome?

  Lucretia stands, grief giving way to anger.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I claim vengeance. His life for 
                        hers. Blood and brains upon the 
                        fucking floor.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Reward well deserved.

                                        TITUS
                        No. There will be no retribution.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I will see him dead!

                                        TITUS
                        You will do as fucking commanded!

  A tense beat. Lucretia calms, the fight draining out of her.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And what of Gaia?

  Titus considers the question, comes to a solution.

                                        TITUS
                        She partook of too much wine, as 
                        she was often known to do. In the 
                        night she lost footing. And fell to 
                        her death at the bottom of the 
                        cliff.

  Lucretia shoots an incredulous look to Batiatus.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                      Do not look to him! I am the 
                        dominus of this fucking house. See 
                      it done.

  Titus sweeps from the room, commanding Batiatus to follow.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Quintus.

  Batiatus hesitates. Locking sympathetic eyes with Lucretia, 
  then follows in the wake of his father. OFF LUCRETIA s 
    devastation...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Titus storms in with Batiatus in tow.

                                        TITUS
                      So this is why you spirited me to 
                        Neapolis. Not to find common 
                        ground, but to bury your father.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

                                        BATIATUS
                        That was not my intent.

                                        TITUS
                        You knew nothing of this? It was 
                        all that woman s doing?

  Batiatus doesn t answer, which is an answer.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        The two of you feed off each other, 
                        fattening yourselves with lies. I 
                        would see the feast at an end.

  Batiatus eyes him, not liking the sound of that.

                                        BATIATUS
                        What is your meaning?

                                        TITUS
                        You know my fucking meaning. That 
                        ill-bred woman has brought this 
                        family nothing but shame.

                                        BATIATUS
                        She is my wife!

                                        TITUS
                        Because I foolishly allowed it! I 
                        wanted you to have something of 
                        your own. Something that held 
                        meaning to you, even if no one else 
                        saw it. Yet what has she given you? 
                      No dowry to speak of. No name to 
                        elevate status.
                                  pointedly)(
                        And no heir to carry the name 
                        Batiatus.

  Batiatus tightens, but feels the sting of truth. Titus takes 
  a breath, calming himself.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Every choice you make, shapes your 
                        fate, Quintus. I cannot change 
                        missteps of the past. But I will 
                        see you upon proper path. And 
                        Lucretia must be swept from it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You would dissolve my marriage?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                                        TITUS
                        No. You will make that choice for 
                        yourself. Or be gone from this 
                        house with her.

  OFF BATIATUS, stricken, an impossible choice at hand...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - SUNRISE

  The sun is just starting to crest. TWO GUARDS carry Gaia s 
  body over to the edge of the cliff. No ceremony. Almost as 
  if they were dumping garbage.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Wait.

  They glance back to find Lucretia approaching. She goes to 
  Gaia, tears filling her eyes. She brushes the hair from 
  Gaia s face... gently kisses her lips one last time... nods 
  to the Guards.

  THE GUARDS

  drop Gaia s body over the cliff. They turn to go.

  LUCRETIA

  steps to the edge, grief constricting her heart as she 
  stares down into the vast sea of black. Gaia s body 
  somewhere in its depths.

  SLOWLY PULL BACK,

  down into the shadows, Lucretia dwindling high above. 
  Standing small and alone...

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
