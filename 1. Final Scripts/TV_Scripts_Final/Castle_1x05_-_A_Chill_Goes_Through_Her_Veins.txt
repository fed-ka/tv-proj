      FROM DARKNESS11*

      We open on the shimmering moon, shining in a pool of black. *
      Suddenly, it RIPPLES and we realize that we ve staring at a *
      reflection in a puddle, newly disturbed by a drop of water. *
      As the water settles, CAMERA moves slightly to reveal another *
      shape reflected in the water... Something floating above. *
      Something ghostly and white.*

      Before we can figure out what we re seeing, another drop *
      hits, obscuring our view... and another... and another. *
      Something s dripping. *

      We follow the droplets up, up until the moon comes back into *
      view, hanging low in the sky. We follow the water, past the *
      moon to...*

      A WHITE WINGED CREATURE hovering in the darkness, its WINGS *
      flapping and fluttering. But as we draw closer, we can tell *
      that this is no bird, but...*

      AN ANGEL -- Her wings spread out beyond her fluttering gown. *
      Her skin is ice white and shimmering.*

      The dripping water takes us up to her peaceful, halcyon face, *
      where we see an eerie sight. This angel s face is frozen in a *
      layer of ice. Melting ice. Beads of water roll down her *
      forehead and drip from her eye, as if she were crying.*

      And just when we re about to ask what the hell this is...*

      A BLAZE OF WORK LIGHTS IGNITE, blinding the darkness and *
      showing our angel for what she truly is...*

      The FROZEN BODY of a GOWNED WOMAN, tangled in the rebar and *
      crossbars of construction, her wings nothing but the tattered *
      remains of a garment bag that her body was wrapped in. As *
      SOUNDS OF THE CONSTRUCTION SITE rise, we too rise from the *
      body, now looking more mangled than serene.*

      PRE-LAP A RINGING PHONE...

      INT. BECKETT APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT BEFORE DAWN22*

      We find BECKETT tangled up in her sheets. Still half-asleep, *
      she finds the phone and answers.

                                    BECKETT
                    Beckett.
                          (pause)
                    Yeah. Okay. On my way.Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 1A.


      She sits up and checks her clock. It s pretty early. She 
      rises. Murder books and mysteries are stacked on her bed 
      stand, including the works of Richard Castle.

      INT. BECKETT APARTMENT, CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER33

      As MUSIC PLAYS Beckett opens a drawer. Her holster and gun 
      are neatly laid out inside. She takes out her piece, checks 
      her clip, and straps it on. This is not a super-slick gearing 
      up moment, but rather the banal routine of someone who does 
      this everyday.Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 2.


      She reaches for a jewelry box and as she pulls it close, we 
      reveal that its top is a framed photo of a man and a woman in 
      their early forties. We should assume that these are her 
      parents.

      Inside the jewelry box is her BADGE, a MAN S WATCH, and a 
      SIMPLE SILVER NECKLACE with a RING on it. 

      Again, part of her morning ritual, she slides on the watch, 
      then clips the badge onto her belt.

      She takes out the silver necklace and closes the jewelry box.  
      She glances at the photo and then slips the necklace over her 
      neck, tucking it away under her shirt so it is completely 
      unseen.

      EXT. STREET - PRE-DUSK44*

      Beckett steps out of her car... all cop. ESPOSITO approaches 
      holding a cup of coffee. He hands it to Beckett.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Why can t they find bodies between 
                    9 and 5?

      Beckett takes the coffee.

                                    BECKETT
                    Early bird gets the collar.

      CASTLE emerges from the crowd. Esposito sees Beckett react.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Yeah. He was here before I was.

                                  CASTLE
                    Ooh. Finally. You re gonna love 
                    this. 

      Beckett sees CONSTRUCTION WORKERS gathered around some *
      girders. *

                                    BECKETT
                    What?

                                  CASTLE
                    Telling would ruin the surprise.

      Beckett and Esposito follow Castle to the site.Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 3.


                                  BECKETT*
                    Don t you sleep?*

                                    CASTLE*
                    I m a writer. I have all day to *
                    sleep.*

      EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS55

      They near the CRIME SCENE, moving through the small crowd of 
      WORKERS who look on. Beckett nods to RYAN who stands nearby.*

                                    BECKETT
                    Ryan.

      Ryan turns to the crowd.

                                  RYAN
                    C mon. Show s over. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Okay. So what s so special?

      They come upon LANIE, amidst the crossbars, examining a BODY - *
      THE BODY of the woman we saw in the opening image. She s 
      wearing a gown and above her, tangled in the rebar, is a *
      ripped, tattered GARMENT BAG.*

                                  CASTLE
                    Awesome, right? My first cold case.

      Off Beckett s look.

                                  CASTLE
                    C mon. It was a little funny.

      Lanie looks down from her perch...*

                                  LANIE
                    Not so much funny as true. She s 
                    frozen solid.

                                    BECKETT
                    What was the temperature last 
                    night?

                    way she was here last night.

      Beckett examines the body.

                                    BECKETT
                    So where did she come from?

      She notices the dripping.*Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 4.


                                    BECKETT
                    She s melting.

                                  CASTLE
                    Maybe we should be looking for a 
                    pair of ruby slippers.

                                    BECKETT
                    While you re at it see if you can 
                    find one of those flying monkeys. 
                    Maybe they left her here.
                          (to Lanie)
                    So what can you tell me?

                                  LANIE
                    There are pieces of plastic on her 
                    skin from the garment bag.

                                    BECKETT
                    So she was inside it.

                                  LANIE
                    Mmm-hmmm. Other than that, it s 
                    gonna take a while for her to thaw. 
                    But I can tell you, she hasn t been *
                    here long. Maybe a couple of hours.*

                                    BECKETT
                    What about security?

                    Chain link. Bolt cutters took care

                    Kind of odd to go to the trouble of 
                    freezing someone, then dumping 
                    them. 

                                    BECKETT

                                    BECKETT
                    Doesn t want to be reminded of 
                    their crime. Maybe the flying 
                    monkey s a schizophrenic.
                          (to Lanie)

                    Won t be able to get anything until 
                    she thaws. 

      Beckett sees a C.S.U TECH approaching, camera in hand.

                                    BECKETT 
                    Give me some close ups.  I want to 
                    run her through missing persons. 

      The C.S.U tech nods. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Oh cool. Like on the Discovery 
                    Channel, when they plug the photo 
                    into one of those facial 
                      recognition databases.

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah. Just like that.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY66

      A STACK of FILES drops in front of Castle.

                                    BECKETT
                    Welcome to the Department s facial

      Ryan and Esposito chuckle.

                                  CASTLE
                    By hand? That s like life before

                    Maybe you can download an  app  on 
                    that phone of yours.

      Castle looks through the folders.

                    One way or another, we eventually 
                    find them. Some turn up dead, some 
                    turn up in a double-wide with a 
                    stripper named Trixie outside

      Beckett nods to the picture of the FROZEN WOMAN.

                                    BECKETT
                    Okay, Castle. What s her story? 

                                  CASTLE
                    I don t know how it starts, but I 
                    know how it ends. Frozen at a 
                      construction site. So flying 
                    monkeys aside, the first question 
                    is - how did she get there?  *

                                  RYAN
                      Considering she was frozen solid, 
                    she had to have been kept pretty 
                    close. *

                                  CASTLE
                    Not necessarily. *
                          (off their look)*
                    Look, it s like figuring out a *
                    plot. Sometimes you have a great 
                    idea for an ending and have to work 
                    backwards to figure out how to get 
                    there. 

      Castle gets up and moves to a city map. Points where the 
        construction site would be.

                                  CASTLE
                    Here s the site. But her body may 
                    not have been kept as close as you 
                    think. It takes a long time for a 
                    body to thaw.  Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 8.

                    No. But I cooked a turkey for 
                      Thanksgiving. Twenty-eight pounder. 
                    Took all night to unfreeze. And 
                    she s at least what, 110 pounds?

                                    BECKETT

      CASTLE TITLE CARD

      INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY88

      Beckett reads from Melanie s file, which is splayed out over 
      her desk. Castle returns from the breakroom with coffee.

                                    BECKETT
                    She had a troubled childhood, drug

                    I already read the file. She kicked 
                    the habit. Met and married Samuel 
                      Kavanaugh. She worked in a 
                      restaurant. He s a bank manager. 
                    They have two kids.

                    A day? That makes no sense.

                                  CASTLE
                    It does when you get to the third 
                      paragraph. Before they were 
                    married, Melanie was what is now 
                    known as  a runaway bride. 

      Beckett skims the report.

                                    BECKETT
                    Does it say why she ran away?

                                  CASTLE
                    No. But all it really takes is your 
                    best friend saying,  it s never too 
                    late to change your mind.

      INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN   DAY1010

      Castle sits with Beckett and Ryan, while Esposito runs 
      background on Samuel Kavanaugh.

                    Samuel Kavanaugh. Shot outside a 
                    grocery store about a year ago. Small 
                    caliber. Double tap to the chest.

      Beckett picks up a picture of SAMUEL, examines it. He s tight-
      lipped, pent-up.

                      connected?

      Castle breaks it like a story.

                    What if him and his wife got 
                      themselves into something they 
                    couldn t get out of? Maybe 
                    something to do with her drug

                    to go to the police with it.

      EXT. DAVIDSON HOUSE   DAY1111

      Beckett and Castle head up to the front door. A man, late 
      50s, comes chasing two little girls, BELA, 8, and SIMONE, 6, 
      around from the back of the house. We notice he has a slight 
      limp. This is Melanie s father, BEN DAVIDSON. 

      Beckett looks at the girls closely.

                    history of disappearing before and 
                    during her marriage.

                                    BECKETT
                    And a husband who didn t report her 
                    missing for over a day.

                                    SHERIFF SLOAN
                    For good reason. He cooperated. He 
                      voluntarily allowed C.S.U into 
                    their apartment. Anything I asked, 
                    he did.

                                  CASTLE
                    Did you know he was murdered too?

      Sloan s look tells them he didn t.

                                    SHERIFF SLOAN
                    What?

                                    BECKETT
                    He was gunned down in the street 
                    about a year ago. Do you still 
                    think facts are facts, Detective?

                                    SHERIFF SLOAN
                    It s Sheriff now.

                                    BECKETT
                    Right.

                                    SHERIFF SLOAN
                    And people get killed all the time. 
                    Look, what do you want from me? She 
                    had a pattern, I had reports of her 
                    in Philly with a meth head ex-
                      boyfriend. It was what it was.Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 21.


                                    BECKETT
                    But you never went down there to 
                    check it out?

                                    SHERIFF SLOAN
                    I didn t need to. I had reports. 

                                    BECKETT

                                    SHERIFF SLOAN
                    Yeah. So?

                                  CASTLE
                    So he s not exactly an impartial 
                    observer.

                                    SHERIFF SLOAN
                    The guy owned his own business; he 
                    had a family and he was a war 
                    veteran. I saw no reason to doubt 
                    his word.

                                  CASTLE
                    Plus, Philly s a pretty long drive.

                                    SHERIFF SLOAN
                    She was only missing back then.

                                    BECKETT
                    No, she was already dead.  You just  
                    didn t know it.

      Off Sloan,

      Beckett speeds through the streets.  Castle reads the file.

                    If I ever disappear, make sure he s 
                    not on my case.

      Beckett s not listening. Her mind still with Sloan.

                                    BECKETT
                    I hate cops like him.

                    Guy s like him, things only make 
                    sense if they fit into a box. So 
                    they make them fit. And murderers

                    I noticed your watch.

      Beckett looks at her wrist. Her watch is oversized. Clearly a 
      man s wristwatch.

                                  CASTLE
                    It s your Dad s, right? That s why

      Her phone rings. She uses it as an out.

                          (answering)
                    Beckett.

      She listens. Her expression tells us it s serious.

      EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT1616

      The storage facility is an old printing warehouse along the 
      Westside Highway near the river. Esposito and Ryan approach 
      as Beckett and Castle exit her car.

                                    BECKETT
                    You found a witness?

                    pull up to the site. Heavy-set guy 
                    pulls a large bag out of the truck

                    doesn t have the bag anymore.Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 23.

                    How d you find this place?

                    Guy also remembered seeing the word

      He points to several yellow trucks in a row of parking *

                          (checks his notes)
                    According to DMV, Albert Bolland.

                                  BECKETT*

                    Okay, look. I dumped her. But I 
                    didn t know who she was. And I

                    I didn t even know she was here.

                    -- which by the way, is totally 
                    illegal.

                                    BECKETT
                    And you thought storing a dead body

                                  ALBERT
                    What? So I could make the front 
                    page of the Ledger? Yeah, that s 
                    good for business.  And hell man, 
                    I m thinking what if it had been a

                    So did she.Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 25.


                                  CASTLE
                    And finding her, you figured the 
                    next logical step would be to dump 
                    it at a construction site.

                                  ALBERT
                    I know this guy, works over there. 
                    We re having a beer a few weeks 
                    back and he s bitching that his 
                    tools were stolen. Says the real 
                    crime is there re no cameras at the 
                    site, so there s no way to know who 
                    did it. So when I find the body I 
                    figure that s the place for it, 
                    right?

                                    BECKETT

                                  ALEXIS
                    Right. The Nikki Heat thing was 
                    about incinerating the body in a 
                      self-cleaning oven.

      Castle pulls out some leftovers in a plastic container.

                    You put things in the freezer to 
                    keep them for later, but once 
                    they re there, you rarely go back. 
                    It s just too easy to forget about 
                    them. 

      Alexis moves next to him, stares in the freezer.

                    If I put a body in a freezer it d 
                    be because I was trying to hide it.

      INT. WYLER S STORE, OFFICE - DAY2020

      Beckett with Castle inside a BOUTIQUE STORE that specializes 
      in ANTIQUES. CHARLES WYLER, late 40s, is with them. We join 
      them just after Beckett s broken the news.

                                  WYLER
                    It s hard to see your best friend 
                    suffer not knowing what happened to 
                    his wife. Where did you find her?

                                    BECKETT
                    Her body was dumped at a 
                      construction site.

                                  WYLER
                    God... First Sam, now Melanie. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Actually, we think it was the other 
                    way around.

                                  WYLER
                    What do you mean?

                                    BECKETT
                    Her body was frozen.

                                  WYLER
                    Frozen?

                                  CASTLE
                    We re pretty sure she was killed 
                    somewhere around her disappearance.

      As Wyler processes the news, Beckett continues.

                                    BECKETT
                    The detective investigating 
                    Melanie s disappearance said you 
                    told him that she was with an ex-
                    boyfriend in Philadelphia.Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 29.


                                  WYLER
                    I only told him what Sam told me.

                                    BECKETT
                    Sam told you?

                                  WYLER
                    It s where she ran to before the 
                    wedding and a few times after.

                                    BECKETT
                    But you didn t know for sure that s 
                    where she went.

                                  WYLER
                    It s the only thing that made 
                    sense. Melanie was a good person, 
                    but she was troubled. Sometimes, 
                    when things got hard, she d go out 
                    and score, y know. She d come home 
                    high and accuse Sam of ruining her 
                    life. She d say her ex was the only 
                    one who ever really loved her. She 
                    just couldn t seem to let go of the 
                    past. 

                                  CASTLE
                    How did Sam deal with that?

                                  WYLER
                    I think he did the best he could 
                    under the circumstances.

                                    BECKETT
                    Must have been quite a guy to keep 
                    taking her back.

                                  WYLER
                    What was he gonna do? I mean, he 
                    loved her and they had those two 
                    girls. Sam truly believed she was 
                    gonna change, that the next time d 
                    be different. But it never was...

                                    BECKETT
                    If he loved her, why didn t he 
                    report her missing right away?

                                  WYLER
                    He was embarrassed. He d given her 
                      everything, stood by her during the 
                    worst times. And then to find out 
                    she was back on the pipe with her 
                    old pals.

                    went down to Philly himself to try 
                    to find the guy, but by then he was 
                    gone.

                    What was it like for him, thinking 
                    his wife was out there somewhere?

                                  WYLER
                    Like I said, he loved her. He never 
                    stopped looking. He was even 
                    following up on leads the day he 
                    died.

      KEVIN HENSON, tatted up, motorcycle chic, edgy. Castle and 
      Beckett sit with him in an interview area. He s looking at a 
      photograph of Melanie.

                                  HENSON
                    Yeah. Melanie came to see me. A 
                    month before she disappeared.

                                    BECKETT
                    Why?

                                  HENSON
                    I ve known Mel since we were 
                    fifteen. We had a lot of history.

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah. So we ve heard.

                                  HENSON
                    You ever been in love, Detective? I 
                    mean, deep hard love? Makes you do 
                    crazy things.

                                    BECKETT
                    Like kill someone?

      The accusation doesn t faze Henson.

                                  HENSON
                    Like believe in things that can 
                    never be. Mel and I, when we were 
                    together, time just stopped. It was 
                    like... I don t know, magic. But 
                    from the very first day, her and 
                    me? I mean, we both knew it was 
                    never going to work. God knows her 
                    folks were never gonna let their 
                    little girl end up with a tatted-up

                    She d found out he was having an 
                    affair.

                    If she didn t love him, why did she 
                    care?

                                  HENSON
                    Because she thought he was gonna 
                    leave her and get custody of the 
                    kids, you know,  cause of the 
                    drugs. She wanted me to go with 
                    her. Take the kids and just 
                      disappear.

                    I put her on a bus.

                                  CASTLE
                    You sent her back?

                                  HENSON
                    What she needed I couldn t give. 
                    Next day I checked into rehab. I 
                    thought maybe if I got clean... 
                    That s where I was when she 
                      disappeared. By the time I got out, 
                    she was dead.

                                    BECKETT
                    How could you possibly know she was 
                    dead?

                                  HENSON
                    She stopped calling. If she were 
                    alive, she would ve called.

                    I didn t come up with this one.  
                    They did.

                    You speak  guy.  If Sam had a 
                    lover, his best friend would know 
                    about it, right? 

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah. Especially if she was hot. 

      INT./EXT. WYLER S STORE, DELIVERY AREA   DAY2424

      Beckett and Castle exit the back of the store into the 
      storage area. They find Wyler supervising the unloading of 
      some ornate desks by DELIVERY MEN. He notices them approach.

                                  WYLER
                      Detective. Mr. Castle.

                                    BECKETT
                    You lied to us, Mr. Wyler.

                                  CASTLE
                    You didn t think that maybe it was 
                    relevant that your buddy Sam was 
                    having an affair at the time of 
                    Melanie disappearance?

                                  WYLER
                    All that was a long time ago. 

                                    BECKETT
                    And Melanie was murdered a long 
                    time ago.

                                  WYLER
                    So he had an affair. What s the 
                    point in dragging everyone through 
                    the mud? Haven t their kids been 
                    through enough? Don t they deserve 
                    some peace?

      Beckett stares daggers at Wyler.

                                    BECKETT
                    What they deserve is to know what 
                    happened to their mother.

      Castle sees the anger in Beckett s eyes. He knows this is 
      personal.

                                    BECKETT
                    You have a nice business here, Mr. 
                    Wyler. But if you don t tell me 
                    what I want to know, I ll haul your 
                    ass to jail for withholding 
                      information and prosecute you as an

                    Y know, the more I think of it, a 
                    mistress is a more appropriate 
                    murderer. Woman frozen. Man gunned 
                    down in the street. It s all very 
                    noir-ish.

                                    BECKETT
                    Not noir. Noir is retribution and

                    was killed around the time the two 
                    of you were having an affair.

      Elizabeth tenses up. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    I m afraid I don t know what you re

                    I met Sam when I got transferred to 
                    the branch downtown. He was in new 
                    accounts. We were both pretty 
                    unhappy at the time.

                    Lemme guess. You started flirting 
                    in the breakroom. He asked you out 
                    for coffee. You went dutch. One 
                    thing led to another and pretty 
                    soon you were paying for hotel 
                    rooms in cash.

      Elizabeth looks down. Yeah, it was that clich .

                                    BECKETT

                     cause they realize they re still

      Alexis scrambles for cover. Castle maneuvers to another 
      column.

      With absolutely no regard for the sacredness of the epic

      the door. He opens it and is surprised to find BECKETT 
      standing there. She takes in his laser tag outfit.

                    Find what?

                                    BECKETT
                    The answer. 

                                  CASTLE
                    We have an answer. It was Sam.
                          (off Beckett)
                      Everything fits. It s a good 
                    ending.

                                    BECKETT
                    But if we can t prove it, all it is 
                    is a theory. Her family, her kids. 
                    They need more than a theory.

                    You have your ending. To get the 
                    rest, you just have to work 
                      backwards. You need to finish the

                    Ok. Yes. It s like making stuff up. 
                    But it s making stuff up based on

                    Sometimes you have your ending and 
                    have to work backwards. Well, we 
                    have our ending. And we have our 
                    killer. We just have to put it all 
                    together using the facts at hand.

                                    BECKETT
                    The facts?

                                  CASTLE
                    Fact - they had small children.

                                    BECKETT
                    So?

                                  CASTLE
                    So according to police statements, 
                    they didn t have a babysitter. With 
                    him at work, she would ve had to 
                    have been at home with the kids the 
                    day she disappeared.

                                    BECKETT
                    Ok. But Sam said she went out later 
                    that night.

                                  CASTLE
                    Which the doorman was never able to 
                      corroborate.

                                    BECKETT
                    If she was there and never went 
                    out...

                                  CASTLE
                    Then she was killed in her 
                      apartment. Another fact - he lived 
                    in Manhattan.

                                    BECKETT
                    And like most people in the city he 
                    didn t own a car.

                                  CASTLE
                    Right, so what s a good husband in 
                    Manhattan to do with his wife s 
                    body? He couldn t leave her in the 
                      apartment. He couldn t carry her 
                    through the lobby. So the question 
                    is...

                                    BECKETT
                    How did he get her body to the 
                    storage facility?Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 43.

                    there until I figured it out.

                                    BECKETT
                    I had no idea you were so dedicated 
                    to your craft.

                                  CASTLE

      INT. ROGER S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN/BATHOOM - DAY3131

      Roger stands in the middle of his living room. Beckett and 
      Castle are examining the apartment.

                    Okay, so, you and I are married.

                                    BECKETT

                                    BECKETT
                    I don t want to pretend.

                                  CASTLE
                    Scared you ll like it?

                                    BECKETT
                    If we re married, I want a divorce.

                    Yes.

      They look at each other, then--

                                  CASTLE
                    Ok. We re not married, but they 
                    are. Say the doorman s right. That 
                    means, Melanie usually got home by 
                    four.

                                  CASTLE
                    Which puts her in the kitchen.

      They move to the kitchen. It s tight. Castle and Beckett are 
      close. (Note: This scene should play like a dance)

                    So, they re what? Watching TV in

                    But the kids are in the bedroom.
                    He needs to get her out of here

                    He puts her in the tub, closes the 
                    door. Tells his kids that Mom went 
                    out to the store.

                                  CASTLE
                    Which according to the case file, the 
                    doorman could never substantiate.

                                    BECKETT
                    So, no car. How did he get her out 
                    of the apartment? 

                                  ROGER
                    Maybe he hailed a cab?

      They both turn to look at him. Give him a  You idiot  look.

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah. He and a cabbie are gonna 
                    wrestle a body into his trunk.

                                    BECKETT
                    Oh I know. Maybe the doorman 
                    helped. How much do you tip for a

                    I know it was five years ago, Mrs. 
                    Marsh, but the only delivery that *
                    day was to this apartment. If you *
                    can remember anything about the *
                    delivery at all...*

                                    DELORIS
                    Sure, I remember. I don t get many 
                      deliveries.

                                    DELORIS
                    That I had to go downstairs and 
                      straighten things out.

                                    BECKETT
                      Straighten what things out?

                                    DELORIS
                    I told the doorman I never ordered 
                      a freezer. I live alone, what do I 
                    want with a freezer? But the guy *
                    brings it up anyway. Loaded it on 
                    the freight elevator while I m 
                    still talking to the front desk.

                    What happened when you went 
                      downstairs?

                                    DELORIS
                    I told the doorman they had the 
                    wrong apartment again and when I 
                    got back upstairs the guy was gone. 
                    Does this have to do with that 
                    missing woman?

                                    BECKETT
                    Yeah. It does.

                                    DELORIS
                    Because I told that other cop all 
                    about it.

                    Don t remember his name. But I told 
                    him just like I told you. 

      INT. BECKETT S UNMARKED - DAY3434

      Castle eyes a PHOTOCOPY of the delivery ledger. On it MUELLER 
      BROS. DELIVERY. We look up to find ourselves outside...

      EXT. MUELLER BROS. DELIVERY - DAY3535

      Beckett and Castle arrive outside of a ten foot gate. A SIGN 
      near the gate s entrance says MUELLER BROS. DELIVERY SERVICE. 
      They exit the car, enter the site.

                                  CASTLE
                    I don t get it. If Sloan had that 
                    woman s report, why didn t he 
                    follow up on it. 

                                    BECKETT
                    He wasn t looking for a story.
                    He d already written it.

      Castle nods, then his eyes are drawn to something OFFSCREEN.

                    That s the same kind of truck we 
                    saw at Charles Wyler s store.

      A WORKER approaches the truck with supplies propped on a

      INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION   NIGHT3636

      Wyler sits at the table, deflated. Beckett sits across from 
      him, while Castle leans on the far wall.

                                    BECKETT
                    We can trace the rental of the 
                    delivery truck to you, Mr. Wyler.  
                    If I have to, I can bring the woman 
                    you delivered the freezer to in to 
                    identify you.

                                  WYLER
                    Look, I had nothing to do with what 
                    happened to Melanie.

                    You ve lied about everything else, 
                    why not that? 

                                  WYLER
                    I never had any reason to hurt her.

                                    BECKETT
                    But Sam did. She kept running back 
                    to that ex-boyfriend. I mean, how 
                    much could the guy take?

                                  WYLER
                    He called me that night. Said I 
                    needed to come over right away. 
                    When I got there, the kids were 
                    asleep and Melanie was in the tub 
                    in a garment bag. He said she came 
                    after him and he just snapped.

                                  CASTLE
                    Here s an idea: instead of killing 
                    her, how about a divorce?

                                  WYLER
                    You don t think I knew how wrong

                    Because he made a very bad mistake.

                    So you arranged to get a truck. 

                                  WYLER
                    He said it couldn t ever be traced 
                    to him. That s why we sent the 
                    freezer to the old lady. That s why 
                    I rented the storage space. Because 
                    we knew the cops would look at Sam. 

                                    BECKETT
                    You made the payments?

                                  WYLER
                    Sam couldn t take any chances. He d 
                    give me the cash and I d stop by 
                    twice a year.

                                  WYLER
                    Seemed a lot easier than moving 
                    her.

                                    BECKETT
                    Why d you stop paying?

                                  WYLER
                    I m truly sorry about what happened 
                    to Melanie. But what was I supposed 
                    to do? Keep paying for the rest of

                    You can say it. Pretty cold. Ironic 
                    that such a selfish act ultimately 
                    revealed the truth. Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 52.

                    There were people who knew the 
                    truth all along. They just chose 
                    not to come forward.

      He heads off. Beckett looks at the clock, sees that it s 
      late. She turns to Castle, who s nose deep in a file.

                    I m going to go talk to Melanie s 
                    parents. Let them know how this

                    Yeah. Sloan.

                    Only he didn t list her name in his 
                    report. 

                                    BECKETT
                    He probably didn t think it was 
                      important. After all, he didn t 
                    think he was looking at a murder.

                                  CASTLE
                    Right. So if you re not 
                      investigating a murder, why are you 
                    talking to a neighbor about her

                    Sometime last year. I remember

      become of them. Seeing herself in them.

                    Ben, what is it?

      The second Ben locks eyes with his wife, she knows the answer 
      to her question. Off this tableau -- 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION   NIGHT4141

      Ben sits at the interrogation table. Beckett and Castle are 
      with him.

                                  BEN
                    I m here because I questioned a 
                    woman about a freezer?

                                  CASTLE
                    Not any freezer, Mr. Davidson. The 
                    freezer where your daughter s body 
                    was stored.

                                  BEN
                    For the moment, let s assume what 
                    you say is true. What s the charge?

                                    BECKETT
                    If Mrs. Marsh s answer led to Sam s 
                    death, the charge would be murder. 

      Ben smiles, wearily. 

                                  BEN
                    I kept going over everything Sam 
                    told us, everything he claimed 
                    happened that night, until I came 
                    to the same conclusion you both 
                      apparently did: that Melanie never 
                    left her apartment alive... Mrs. 
                    Marsh s answer merely confirmed 
                    what I already knew.

                                    BECKETT
                    That your son-in-law was a killer.

      Ben looks at her, says nothing.Castle Ep 105 "A Chill Goes Through Her Veins" Blue Draft 12-10-08 56.


                                  CASTLE
                    If you d figured out what Sam d 
                    done, why not go to the police? 
                    He d have gone to prison for the 
                    rest of his life.

                                  BEN
                    If he d been convicted. They didn t 
                    have a body at the time, remember?  
                    His lawyers would have put Melanie 
                    on trial, not him.

                                    BECKETT
                    So you took matters into your own 
                    hands...

                                  BEN
                    Well, you could certainly 
                      understand how any father might 
                    want to... How he might follow his 
                      daughter s murderer one dark night, 
                    when he d be sure no other people 
                    were around; how he might confront 
                    him with a gun he d brought back 
                    from the war; might promise 
                      forgiveness in exchange for the 
                    truth, and then hearing his 
                    admission be... overcome with rage.
                          (beat; shifts)
                    Every time he brought the girls to 
                    see us, I watched a little piece of 
                    my wife die... A visit from your 
                    grandkids should be life-affirming, 
                    not a reminder of how your only 
                    child was murdered. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Killing him wasn t the answer.

                                  BEN
                    I never said I killed him. I only 
                    said that a father might be 
                      justified.
                          (shakes his head)
                    The police told me Sam was shot in 
                      a robbery. And without evidence, 
                    there would be little hope his 
                    killer would ever be brought to 
                    justice. I suppose we ll see if 
                    that s really true.

      INT. PRECINCT   NIGHT4242

      Beckett stares at the picture of Melanie. Castle rounds the 
      corner, on the phone.

                                  CASTLE
                    No, sweetie, I just wanted to make 
                    sure I said good night.

                    the morning.

      He hangs up. Sits next to Beckett.

      She offers a half-smile. Ben Davidson suddenly appears, 
      officers leading him down to holding.

                                  CASTLE
                    Think he ll be convicted?

                    But at least those kids ll know 
                    what happened.

      Beckett puts the photos back into the case file. Beat. She 
      looks up at Castle.

                    By the way, it was my mother, not 
                    my father.

      Castle doesn t say a word. He leaves the door open for her to 
      continue.

                    this detective, Detective Raglin, 
                    is waiting. They d found her. She d 
                    been stabbed.

                    Robbery?

                                    BECKETT
                    No. She still had her purse, money, 
                    jewelry. No sexual assault either. 
                    They said it was gang violence, a 
                    random wayward event. 
                          (she shakes her head)
                    And just like with Melanie, they 
                    never looked outside the box. They 
                    made up their minds and moved on. 
                    And so her killer was never caught.

                                  CASTLE
                    Why do you wear the watch?

                    But he s sober now. Five years.
                          (re: watch)
                    So this is for the life I saved...

      She reaches in her shirt and pulls out the necklace with the 
      ring on it.

                    And this is for the one I lost.

    A beat as Castle takes it in. But Beckett doesn t dwell. She 
      gathers up her coat and forces a smile. 

                                    BECKETT
                    So I guess Nikki Heat has a 
                    backstory now.

                    I don t know. I really liked the 
                    whole hooker-by-day cop-by-night 
                    angle, but the powerful emotional 
                    stuff could work too.

      She smiles, his joke letting her off the emotional hook.

      her gun back in the drawer. And then puts her badge, her 
      father s watch, and the necklace with her mother s ring into 
      the Jewelry box. She closes its top to reveal the picture of 
      her father and mother in happier times. She smiles.

      In a T-shirt and boxers, Beckett picks up the phone and
