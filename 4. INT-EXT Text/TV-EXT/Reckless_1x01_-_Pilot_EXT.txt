skyline, stealthy, as Charleston juts up, a swathe of 
shimmering lights like colored jewels against the night sky.

Down by the concrete waterfront, narrow streets are lined 
with brick buildings housing clubs and rooftop restaurants. 
Parties extend to the street; girls in bare dresses, laughter 
and occasional drunken shrieks bubble up. The city is full of 
good-looking people, all different races, with a sexy vibe; 
everyone checks each other out, but we focus on...

A WOMAN...emerging from a thumping dance club. She s thirty, 
with big, smoky eyes. She carries her strappy heels and 
tiptoes across the asphalt. A thick-necked bouncer watches as 
she tugs down the edges of her tight dress. This is LEE ANNE 
HUNTER. She gets into a used Mustang. 


Lee Anne s car sits quietly, waiting, parked next to a vacant 
lot, the squad car pulled up tight behind her. 


They walk to a dark corner near a fence, out of the light. 
She wears her heels. No one speaks, but the tension is thick.

OFFICER
Turn around, put your hands on the 
fence. 

She glances backward, then faces the fence. Her fingers curl 
around the chain link. 

OFFICER (CONT D)
Higher. 

She swallows. Raises her arms, grabbing the fence higher up. 

OFFICER (CONT D)
Spread your legs. 

She moves her feet apart. She looks a little scared now, as 
she hears him walk toward her. He places both hands on her 
waist and starts to  frisk  her...his hands coming up to feel 
her breasts, lingering there, pinching her nipples, then 
patting down, rubbing her thighs...hands go UNDER HER SKIRT.

jingle of HANDCUFFS. Her eyes snap open.

LEE ANNE (CONT D)
No!Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       3.

He comes up against her, grabbing a fist full of her hair and 
pulling it back...but instead of seeing fear in her face, we 
 expect...see something we don t

A SMILE. We begin to understand that they know each other. 

LEE ANNE (CONT D)
I like the cuffs, Trey, nice 
addition.

He nuzzles her neck and ear. 

TREY (OFFICER)
Don't say my name, you'll ruin it.

pushes back against him, moaning in pleasure...but we stay on

WE CUT TO:

TITLE CARD...letters burn large: RECKLESS


The full grandeur of Charleston Harbor is visible in the hot 
summer sun. Huge CONTAINER SHIPS come in to unload, DOLPHINS 
play among a peppering of pleasure boats and trawlers...on a 
speedy little launch, leaping across the water, we find:

ROY RAYDER, 37, with piercing eyes and a manly Blake Shelton 
look. He might be a fisherman in painter's overalls, a 
baseball cap and a face-full of wiry stubble. He cuts the 
engine as he approaches the concrete public docks of a city 
park. Steers easily into a slip, ties the boat off.

He unzips the overalls to reveal THE SUIT he wears beneath. 
He tucks the overalls and his deck shoes into a locker, 
pulling out his loafers, a briefcase and an electric razor.

Hopping ashore, he walks toward town, shaving as he goes. 

EST. SHOT - CHARLESTON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - HOT DAY88

The imposing, all-white building dominates the square, baking 
in the heat. It was designed by the same colonial architect 
that built the White House, and we can tell. 


Behind the department headquarters is a large open-air 
parking lot full of new, compact sedans; Interceptor squad 
cars, black and whites with bold blue writing. The cars are 
being washed and cared for by five dispatch guys as ONE SQUAD 
CAR drives slowly up the lane. It stops.

Trey emerges from the squad car, now in a plainclothes suit.

Thanks, Billy. 


CLOSE ON A CARD KEY swiped through a reader by a GLOVED HAND. 

TREY (V.O.)
The card key used was the victim's 
own. There was no sign of forced 
entry into her studio.


The white steps bake in the mid-afternoon. Jamie, heels on, 
walks down the steps, checking her smartphone. As she gets to 
the street level at the bottom, HER EYE is drawn away...

HER P.O.V. BRENDA, her client's girlfriend, stands on the 
curb, some distance away, under a tree. She s talking to the 
detective, Trey. Trey touches Brenda's arm; she looks down, 
stepping back. He speaks more sternly, then turns to walk 
away, right toward...

JAMIE, who stands there, caught staring.    

Trey knows she saw them. He throws Jamie a dirty look and 
gets into an unmarked police car, peeling away. 

We HOLD ON JAMIE...her wheels turning.

ACT ONE


Old oaks dripping with Spanish moss meet in a canopy over the 
street, lined with antebellum mansions. Roy Rayder walks up 
the steps of one, past a discreet brass plate under a stone 
lion: ANDERSON, FORTNUM, AND DOBBS, A LAW CORPORATION. 


Low chain link fences surround weedy patches of yard in front 
of run-down bungalows, many with porches and windows barred. 
It s busy and hot. Kids play baseball. A fire hydrant gushes 
up. Everyone's door is open in the summer heat.   

In one of the yards, we find little Shaunee playing with a 
hose...using the water to make a mud pie. WATCHING FROM THE 
PORCH are Brenda and Jamie.  

BRENDA
I told the cops, DeShaun was with 
me, the whole night. Why won t they 
listen?

JAMIE
You're his girlfriend. You could be 
 lying. And you were asleep...it s
not an airtight alibi. 

Brenda looks out over the railing. Jamie takes her opening.

JAMIE (CONT D)

McCandless.

they can make life bad for you.

Brenda looks at her.

BRENDA
No. No way...

The little girl comes toddling up the steps with her mud pie. 

BRENDA (CONT D)

CUT TO:


A happening creek across the harbor from Charleston, lined 
with restaurants where people can drive their boats right up.  

Roy steers his launch down the lit-up creek. People wave at 
him...an old fisherman working on his trawler, some pretty 
southern belles with perfect hair and short shorts.

He moves out of the commercial area, slowing as he nears a 
dilapidated old dock, marked by one light in the darkness.    


Roy walks a narrow trail through the thicket of trees until 
he emerges from the underbrush and into a CLEARING. We see a 
modest brick home, and there s a BOAT, a clapped-out trawler, 
30 feet or so, set up on cinder blocks. He pats it as he goes 
by. We HEAR a message being played:Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       17.

Less cars this late at night. Rising above it, nearby, is a

Jamie sits at a high top near the edge of the roof, having 
that beer. In the distance, we see the dramatic outlines of 
the epic and modern Ravenel Bridge, lit-up in the night. She 
turns away from the night lights over the water to see...

HER P.O.V. PRESTON DURRELL, handsome, wiry, with an urban 
sophistication, walking toward her. 

PRESTON
Hey Counselor. 

JAMIE
Hey Detective. 

PRESTON

This isn t our regular night. 

JAMIE
I know. I just needed to talk to 
someone without a southern accent. 

PRESTON
I hear that. Maybe we should both 
go back to New York. 

JAMIE
Nah. Where would we get a good dish 
of grits?

They clink beers. 

PRESTON
You look good. 

JAMIE
So do you. 

He touches her hand. A beat, and then:

He smiles. They both laugh a little. 
FADE TO:


Folly Beach is a suburb of Charleston, more rural, with wood 
homes, many in disrepair; big, untamed yards between them, 
junk and hot rods in the weeds. Redneck country.

of secret gardens within. One is covered in scaffolding, in

floor, and she LIVES on the top two.  


Jamie and Vi are walking toward her office together. 

VI
Okay, let's say Carrie was making 
and selling jewelry with fake gems.  

JAMIE
And then she sells the real jewels,  
that gives her double the money, 
double the profit. But why does she 
even go through the motions of 
buying the gems in the first place?

trawler. He stops as CAR HEADLIGHTS stripe across the trees. Stevens, RECKLESS - Network Script, 12/27/12                       35.


Roy comes around the side of the house, wiping his hands.

stacked file boxes up the walk to his front door.

A summer storm is approaching. Thunderheads loom over the 
city. The water under the bridge is choppy with whitecaps.  


Jamie is at the front door, buzzing. No one answers.  She 
goes to the window and peers in. 

HER P.O.V. The studio is now full of CANVASES...all sizes, 
from very large to small, grouped in stacks against the 
walls. There are drop cloths, brushes and pallettes. Jamie 
sees a figure moving around in back.  

Jamie knocks on the window...

Vi runs out of a shop, toward her car, cowering in the hood 
of her jacket. 


A sign on one of the shops in the mall reads: "WE BUY GOLD!" 
in both Spanish and English. We PAN OFF IT to see VI dashing 
from her car to the store. Rain still pouring.  


He opens the door. Jamie stands there, in soft, faded jeans 
and a white V neck, holding a closed umbrella.

JAMIE
You gonna let me in this time? 

He opens the door wider. She props the umbrella by the door 
and walks by him...passing close. 


The rain has stopped and left the night cooler. Jamie and Roy 
walk on the sand, each with a beer in their hand. The moon 
appears, tingeing the leftover clouds with mysterious silver.
