                        No idea what triggered it?

                        The crowd was so thick, I could've
                        gotten the vision off of anyone.

                                        BRUCE
                        But you're sure it was a racist
                          killing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whoever did it painted the words
                        "White Power".  Plus another word
                          I didn't understand.  "Rahowa."

          They look up to see Dana leaning back against Johnny's
          Land Rover with a knowing smile.

                                        DANA
                        Means "Racial Holy War."  The
                        "Jihad" every good little white
                          supremacist hopes and prays for.

                        up in something?  Sounds familiar. 
                        Mind if I tag along?

                        I think Rashid knew the person
                        who killed him.

          Walt can tell Johnny's holding back.

          During their exchange, Dana's news truck pulls up.  Now
          her cameraman and soundman hop out and wave her over.

                        Every day brings us news of some
                          terrible but distant crime.  But
                        when a crime raises the specter
                        of intolerance, we're forced to
                        stop and take stock, question our
                        own prejudices.

                        Has this changed your attitude

                          I believe this is an aberration. 
                        Cleaves Mills is a God-fearing
                        community.

          Johnny, Bruce and Dana exit the club, Johnny leading them

          He reacts as he finally sees --

          DARRYL COTTON rough-housing with a bunch of skinheads and
          punks, most a bit older than him.

                        So.  How do you normally handle a
                          situation like this?  "Hi, my
                        name's Johnny Smith.  I'm a psychic

                        to see if you're guilty of murder."

          Johnny looks at Bruce...

                        Okay, but you stay close.

          He approaches the skins, Johnny and Dana trailing.

                        Hey, you guys see a kid with a
                        blue mohawk run by?  He just jacked

          Darryl gives him a sneering once-over.

                        Sure you don't have that backwards,

          His friends laugh, ad lib:  "That's cold."  "Tell the

          puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.

                        Well, for starters you're clearly
                          a racist.  Second, the killer
                        wrote "white power" on a wall,
                        and those appear to be white power

          Darryl's pals are enjoying this.  They encourage him: 
          "Go ahead."  "Do it, man."  "C'mon Darryl, we'll still
          love ya."  But Darryl just eyes Johnny coldly.

                        It's understandable.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, yeah, he provoked me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I meant because of what happened
                        that night you turned 17.  Your
                        Dad let you borrow his car...
                                (off Bruce's look)
                        I saw it here the other day, when
                        you put your hand on my shoulder.

                                        BRUCE
                        Saw me getting pulled over and
                        beat up by those rednecks?  For
                        dating a white girl?

                                (nods)
                        I'm guessing that wasn't the only
                        time you had to deal with racism.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm still dealing with it.  The
                          convenience store clerk checking
                        his surveillance mirror when I'm
                        in the back.  Or some middle-aged
                        lady who "casually" crosses the
                        street when she sees me coming. 
                        Makes me think a punk like Cotton's
                        just vocalizing stuff that's in
                        everyone's subconscious.

          Johnny looks around at the former crime scene.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe, but everyone isn't killing
                        people, covering them with white
                        paint, and writing racist slogans
                        on walls.

                                        BRUCE
                        Which is why I want us to nail
                        him.
                                (looking around too)
                        Thing is, you've already touched
                        just about everything there is to
                        touch.

          He has indeed.  As Johnny surveys the surroundings --


  5353MEMORY FLASH (BLACK AND WHITE) - JOHNNY AS THE VICTIM
          REELS BACK FROM A CLUBBING BLOW


  5454BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny orients himself, indicates to Bruce the place where
          he, as the victim, was standing in the vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Stand there and face away from
                        me, okay?

          Bruce does.  Johnny adjusts his own position behind him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The killer would've stood here.

          Camera tilts down to his feet as he shifts them.  Bruce
          glances back, observing this...

                                        BRUCE
                        You think "standing in his
                        footsteps" could trigger a vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe if I could find them.
                                (an idea)
                        Give me your flashlight.

          Bruce hands him the heavy metal MAG-LIGHT.  Johnny grips
          it by the base... we see his feet shift again, a wider
            stance... then we tilt up as he raises it high.  WHOOSH --


  5555CU:  THE MAG-LIGHT HAS SUDDENLY BECOME A CLUB-LIKE

                        Whoa!


  55A55ABACK TO SCENE

          Bruce has turned just in time to catch Johnny's downward
          swinging arm (his turn would coincide with the victim's
          turn just as he gets hit with the first blow).  They both
          take a breath.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It wasn't a baseball bat.
                                (beat)
                        Darryl Cotton isn't the killer.

          Off which...

                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:




          As Johnny follows them out, sees Rashid -- now out of
          sight of the bartender -- pull away from Darryl, who joins
          his skinhead friends.  Johnny turns to look after Rashid,
          who is heading toward the end of the alley.


    6767SUDDENLY, THE BACKGROUND BECOMES FOREGROUND AS JOHNNY
          FINDS HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ALLEY

          Where he watches Rashid approach the passenger side of a
          nondescript SEDAN at the curb, as the unseen driver pushes
          open the door for him.  Off Johnny, reacting to this --



          As Bruce comes out the side door to join Johnny, who's
          still looking toward the street.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It only looked like they left
                          together...          DEAD ZONE: "Articles of Faith" - ACT THREE - 5/11/05 - GREEN 39.



          Starting close on Darryl Cotton's peaceful, recumbent
          face, eyes closed as though he's sleeping.  Then a sheet
          is pulled over it and we pull back to reveal Johnny
          watching as Darryl's dead body is loaded into a coroner's
          wagon.  (Note:  we should not see any bloodstains or
          anything else that might indicate what caused his death.)


  7676BACK TO SCENE

          Off Johnny, his shock at Darryl's confession now compounded
          by this vision of his imminent death...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          Once again, Johnny watches Rashid approach the car, only
          now as the passenger door is pushed open, camera tracks
          in, revealing Josh in the driver's seat, welcoming Rashid
          with a smile.  Suddenly, the camera angle flips and we're --


          TRUNK

          As the bloody club, the paint can and brush -- all wrapped
          in an old transparent plastic drop cloth -- are tossed
          inside.  The trunk lid slams shut, then we FLASH OUT TO --



          Another flash of a bloody, sheet-covered covered body
          being loaded into the coroner's wagon.

                        I'm still seeing Darryl dead.

                        I've got a deputy outside his

                        It'll happen... somehow... unless
                          I figure out how or why.

          He sees Dana, working at a computer in the main office.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why's she still here?

                        records on the Cottons.

          Johnny crosses to her.  An awkward beat.

                        Found anything?

                        You said you had a vision of Darryl

                          baseball bat?
                                (when he nods...)
                        Look at this.  The night William
                        Cotton reported his son's car
                        stolen in Seattle, there were
                        three murders.  Two were by
                          gunshot.  The other cause of death
                        was blunt trauma.
                                (flips to an autopsy
                                  report)
                        The autopsy found flakes of
                          aluminum in the wounds, indicating
                        the weapon could've been a baseball
                        bat.

          Off Johnny, mind working...



          Roscoe conducts the Cottons and their lawyer through the
          CROWD of students, congregants, and townspeople filling
          the parking lot.  Many hold BIBLES, others SIGNS with the
          word "Hate" in a circle with a slash through it.  But the
          peaceful attitude is marred by random shouts of "murderer!" -
          and "racist!" as Darryl is led past.


    101101JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          Exit the building.  Johnny scans the crowd, sees Darryl
          halfway across the lot, and starts after him --


          ALTERNATING TRACKING AND POV SHOTS

          as Johnny shoulders his way through the crowd, which seems
          to be growing more hostile, meanwhile trying to keep his
          eye on Darryl.  Bruce follows in his wake.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me... Sorry...

            Suddenly, he sees someone else in the crowd -- Josh Blake. 
          Looking nervous, holding an anti-hate sign with one hand,
          his other hand in a bulging coat pocket.  Johnny instantly
          gets the picture.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's Blake.  He's here to shoot
                        Darryl, shut him up before he can
                        recant his confession.
                              (a quick decision)
                        I'll go after him, you warn Darryl.

          JOHNNY

          Rushes up behind Josh Blake, but when he grabs his
            shoulder, spinning him around, it turns out to be another
          young man holding a sign.  Johnny looks around quickly,
          spots Josh having moved to another vantage.  He's already
          drawing his gun, but he's too far away for Johnny to reach. 
          Instead he shouts to --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce!

          BRUCE turns... sees Johnny pointing to Josh, who's leveling
          his gun.  Bruce rushes the rest of the way toward Darryl,
          brushing past a surprised Roscoe, then shoving Cotton
          aside and tackling Darryl, shielding the surprised young
          racist with his body as a GUNSHOT whizzes over them...


          JOSH

          Still aiming, trying to draw a bead on Darryl.  The moment
          of hesitation allows Johnny to tackle him, knocking his
          arm up and causing another shot to go wild.  They both go
          down as the panicked crowd scatters.  Josh struggles as
          Johnny pins him down --

                        It's over Josh.  I know.

  103103A SHORT TIME LATER

          Johnny, Walt, Bruce and Purdy watch as deputies cuff Josh
          and take him inside.  The crowd has mostly dispersed, but
          the press remains in force, kept back behind barriers.

                                        BRUCE
                        Or how about Darryl Cotton, trying
                        to be a "good" son, even if that
                        meant hating and killing?

          Purdy looks around at the scattered, stricken bystanders...
          the press trucks and reporters.

                                        PURDY
                        This town needs to heal.  It's a
                        time for reflection... and prayer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And how do you do that, Gene? 
                        How do you just "pray" that things
                        get better?

          At first Purdy thinks it's another jibe.  Then he realizes
          Johnny's serious.

                                        PURDY
                        You start by asking that question.

          As he moves off, Johnny turns to see Dana doing a stand-
          up not far away.  The two exchange a look, then Dana turns
          back to her cameraman...
