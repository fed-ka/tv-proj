Ten plastic folding chairs line the hallway -- all empty
except for one.
In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best
synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own
red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to
herself.
MARY
Four letter word for... vomit.
She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help.
MARY
Not "barf". For sure not "barf".
That's too easy. "Puke" is okay,
but maybe a bit pedestrian (that
means boring)... I like "hurl". I
do. I like the way it rolls off
your tongue -- the word, I mean.
But my all time favorite is none of
those.
She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it
together.
2.
MARY
Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E-
W. Spew... Sp-ew.
A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER
walks out.
A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals
to Mary.
TEACHER
We're ready for you now.
(a plastic Kroger shopping
Mary jumps up, grabs her purse
bag).
MARY
Jesus help me.
Mary stands in front of the chalkboard, "CAREER DAY" written
in huge letters behind her. She smiles with terror at the
class of 10 year old KIDS.
The Teacher reads from her notes.
TEACHER
Here's a treat, students. Our
final guest for Career Day, Miss
Mary Horowitz, is the crossword
constructor for the Atlanta
Citizen. You know the crossword
puzzles you see every week in the
newspaper? It's her job to create
them. Isn't that fun?
Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers.
MARY
You weren't supposed to tell them.
TEACHER
Pardon me?
MARY
I made a crossword puzzle to help
them guess what my job is. You
ruined it.
TEACHER
Oh, I'm so sorry.
3.
Mary takes the crossword puzzles out of her bag, looks at
them like lost puppies.
TEACHER
Maybe you could tell them a bit
about what your job is like?

People do crossword puzzles all the
time but they don't often think of
the person who made all the words
fit together, and who thought up
the clues, and who made sure the
little black squares at the top
mirror the ones at the bottom.
She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds
it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile.
MARY
Crossword constructors usually have
above average intelligence, with
knowledge of just about every
subject you can imagine. And it
helps if they can spell.
The card in Mary's hand reads "LAUGH". She laughs. Nobody
else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets
serious, sweeps her hand through the air.
MARY
Imagine, for a moment, a world
without crossword puzzles. A world-
Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her
off.
TEACHER
Daniel, you have a question?
DANIEL
You make a living doing that? Just
making puzzles? The Atlanta
Citizen only comes out on Fridays.
One puzzle a week can't make you
enough to live on.
A LARGE KID in the front row pipes up.
4.
LARGE KID
How do you pay your rent?
MARY
My parents -
DANIEL
You live with your parents?
The Kids all laugh their asses off. Mary just stares at
them.
LARGE KID
Oh my God, how old are you? Still
living at home!
The kids all laugh some more. Mary's on the verge of panic.
TEACHER
Children!
The Teacher shoots the Kids a warning look, then notices Mary
hyperventilating.
TEACHER
Are you okay?
Mary grasps for breath, struggles to speak.
MARY
Water.
TEACHER
Water. Just hang on.
The Teacher rushes out. The kids all stare at Mary.
MARY
Yep, I live at home...
She forces herself to get it together, totally faking it.
MARY
But so do all of you, so there...
And sure, I only create one
crossword puzzle a week but I have
deadlines, I have stress, I have
demands on me so huge you would not
believe. The newspaper business is
hell. I mean it. Hell.
Somebody's got to write about all
the horrors that go on in this
world.
(MORE)
5.
MARY (cont'd)
And after people read about those
horrors, somebody else has to bring
them back from the brink of
suicide. Who do you think that is?
She leans in close to the front row, scares herself more than
anybody.
MARY
Me! My crossword puzzle is always
good news. it enlightens.
it r andma's

mind alive so she remembers to send
you five bucks on your birthday.
Think about that as you lie in bed
tonight picking your nose and crying
yourself to sleep. I know I will.
The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the teacher's
desk, tries to look relaxed but fails miserably.
MARY
My job matters, you know. In media
circles I am, as the Dutch say,
geliefd. That means I have plenty
of friends. Hoards, in fact.
Scads even.
The kids aren't buying it.
LARGE KID
You're a freak.
The kids all nod in agreement. Mary's frozen, devastated.
The Teacher rushes back into the room with a cup of water,
hands it over. Mary sips it like communion wine. Half of it
runs down her chin.
Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a smile.
MARY
That's a pretty blouse.
The Teacher smiles back. Awkward.
The CITY BUS DRIVER watches as Mary pays her $1.75 one nickel
at a time.

She lurches for an empty seat and just about dislodges her
shoulder on the center pole. Finally settled, she peeks
under her sweater at the shoulder damage.
MARY
Hello hematoma.
She smiles at an angry ELDERLY LADY sitting across from her.
The lady gives her the "don't talk to me" glare, then stares
out the window. Mary fidgets in her seat.
7.
MARY (V.O.)
In crosswords, as in life, some
days are harder than others. It's
true. In the New York Times, for
example, the puzzles get harder as
the week goes. So on Monday, a day
that traditionally bites the big
one, the crossword is super easy.
It's comforting to know that
although life can be difficult at
times, crosswords let you off easy
when you need it the most.
Mary looks around for anybody to talk to. The other
PASSENGERS avert their eyes. Mary starts biting her nails.

ANGUS

Hartman's eyes light up.
ANGUS
Half of the Midwest and spreading.
Nobody's safe.
Steve tries on a gas mask.
HARTMAN
Please let it be the bird flu.
STEVE
Bird flu is for pussies. This
thing's unstoppable.
HARTMAN
How's it spreading?
Angus looks at Steve.
STEVE
Squirrels.
Hartman can barely contain his excitement.
HARTMAN
Oh my God, they're everywhere!
STEVE
Exactly.
HARTMAN
Al Qaeda connection?

ANGUS
Always a possibility.
STEVE
Who wishes he was in Iraq now?
HARTMAN
Not me!.
Hartman grabs a gas mask and rushes to the van's side mirror.
HARTMAN
I need blush. No, wait. I'll go
pasty. It'll look like I could be
the first media victim. "Hartman
Hughes, no such thing as too close
to the story".
Hartman looks back at Steve and Angus. They're just standing
there, unable to keep a straight face. Hartman deflates.
HARTMAN
Assholes! I knew it was too good
to be true.
He throws his gas mask down, storms off.
ANGUS
Hartman, come on.
Hartman gets in the elevator, hollers out to them.
HARTMAN
I had a perfectly good bologna
sandwich going on upstairs.
Wasted!
Angus and Steve watch the elevator door close, shrug it off.
STEVE
Next E-coli story breaks, he'll be
fine.
It's house that's been lived in. Every inch cluttered with
old newspapers, family photos, various objet d'art, and
books, books and more books.
Mary steps out of her boots and marches into the living room
where her 50ish mother, MRS. HOROWITZ, sits reading with MR.
HOROWITZ (late 50's, professorial head to toe, furrowed brow
to worn loafers).
MARY
"Brilliant" is what they said.
Never in the history of St.
Margaret's Career Day have the
children's brains been so
inordinately stimulated as they
were today by my presentation.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Good for you, sweetie.
Mary pulls the newspapers out of her bag, sorts through them,
stacks them on top of the TV.
MARY
"Inspired", the teacher told me.
MR. HOROWITZ
You get the Post?
She hands him the paper.
MARY
"Engrossing" one child exclaimed.
MR. HOROWITZ
A ten year old said that?
MARY
I'm sure that's what he meant. And
"ebullient"-
MR. HOROWITZ
What happened to your knee?
Mary looks down at the blood dripping down from her knee onto
her sock. She's completely annoyed - more at the question
than the mess.
12.
MARY
Dad, some of the greatest orators
of all time had their heads chopped
off for their labors. I'm lucky to
escape with a simple flesh wound.
Mary hands over the last newspaper, heads out to the hallway.
Her mother yells to her.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Change those socks before your
date.
MARY
I told you I'm not going.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Mrs. Alchessi says you'll like this
one.
MARY
Mrs. Alchessi has gliomatosis
cerebri.
MRS. HOROWITZ
What?
MARY
A brain tumor characterized by,
among other things, dementia.
She's nuts.
Mary walks up the stairs.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Mary, it's just a date. This is
what normal girls your age do.
Mary stops on the stairs.
MARY
I'm normal.
Silence from her parents. Mary marches back into the living
room.
MARY
In fact, I'm normalis extremes.
That's the kind of normal that
doesn't get more normal.
MRS. HANCOCK
Of course you are, sweetie.
13.
Mary looks at her obviously lying mother and uncomfortable
father. Mary's mind reels, like her head is going to
explode. Finally, a determination hits her.
MARY
I'll go.
Mary bolts up the stairs to her room.
Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz look at each other, surprised, happy.
MR. HOROWITZ
You ever want to see grandchildren,
you better burn the damn boots.
She swats him with her book, tries not to laugh.
Storage room or bedroom? Boxes and books all over the place.
In the middle of it all, a bed.
On the dresser, a bunch of photos of Mary Tyler Moore in the - MTM in a
1970's. Taped to the mirror, the chosen photo Horowitz
smart blue sweater and skirt ensemble. An
wears the exact same outfit. Oddly,
surprisingly current and actually hot.
She leans over the gerbil cage next to her desk, taps to wake
up the :Lone, fat occupant.
MARY
Carol, tonight I have a date. A
blind one. Not the guy, I mean the
situation. We are, as yet, unknown
to one another... It's nerve
wracking, I know. Try not to have
a spontaneous epileptiform seizure.
The doorbell rings. Mary freezes, listens for the muffled
voices downstairs.
She sits on the corner of her bed and breathes rapidly into a
paper bag.
There's a knock on her bedroom door. Mary folds up the bag,
puts it in her pocket for later, then opens the door a crack.
It's her mother.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Guess who's here.
14.
MARY
I'd rather not.
Mrs. Horowitz opens the door wider, takes a look at Mary,
looks like she's going to cry.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Look at you.
MARY
i already did. Repeatedly.
MRS. HOROWITZ
You're beautiful.
MARY
Please don't mean on the inside.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Beautiful and smart. And fun. And
interesting.
Mary takes a deep breath, lets it out fast.
MARY
Let's hope all that does it for
him.
A bored, CNN jacket wearing Steve looks up to see Mrs.
Horowitz descending the stairs. Not far behind, Mary takes
each step like her knees are fused together but still manages
to look hot. Steve's pleasantly surprised.
With one look at Steve, Mary's eyes glaze over as if a choir
is screaming "hallelujah" in her brain.
As Mary reaches the bottom step --
STEVE
Mary, hi. I'm Steve.
She puts up a finger - "just a second".
She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at Mrs.
Horowitz, confused.
MRS. HOROWITZ
And how's your mother?
15.
STEVE
Great. Thanks.
She just stares at him and smiles.
Mary runs into her room, kneels down in front of the mizrach
and crucifix on the wall. Hands clasped in prayer.
MARY
Gods. You may have noticed that
I'm wearing clean socks.
Translation: I'm really trying and
thus should be amply rewarded.
Thanks for your support.
She gets up, has a second thought, gets back onto her knees.
MARY
And by support I don't mean, you
know -
She hikes up her bra.
MARY
I mean your assistance, your
furtherance, your advocacy of my
efforts to get out there and... do
what I'm supposed to do.
She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she's ready.
Steve waits as Mary walks down the stairs again, this time a
bit more relaxed.
MRS. HOROWITZ
There we go.
Mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs, steps into her red
boots. Her mother cringes. Steve's a bit surprised at the
boots but who cares, Mary's still hot from the knee caps up.
STEVE
Ready?
Mary nods a bunch of times.
16.
STEVE
Mrs. Horowitz. Goodnight.
(calling into living room)
Sir.
MR. HOROWITZ (O.S.)
You kids have fun.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Be careful now. Don't forget your
seatbelts.
Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the
living room. She waves to them out the window, trying to
hide her worry but failing miserably.
MR. HOROWITZ
She'll be fine.
They look at each other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread.
Mary's parents hear the door open then Mary's footsteps hit
the stairs. Mrs. Horowitz jumps up, rushes to meet her.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Sweetie, what's wrong? What
happened? My God, you've barely
been gone ten minutes.
Mary stops on the stairs, turns back.
21.
MARY
Mom, sometimes that's all you need
to know he's the one!
Mary smiles big, takes the rest of the stairs up two at a
time. Mrs. Horowitz is about to follow her.
MR. HOROWITZ
That girl makes up her mind the
moon is green, it's green. Leave
her be. It'll pass. Eventually.
Mrs. Horowitz moves away from the stairs, no less worried.
Mary leaps from the doorway and lands on her bed in pencil
pose, smiling up at the ceiling.
MARY
Eleven letter word for serendipity.
She screams into her pillow.
MARY
The perfect answer: S-E-R-E-N-D-I-P-
I-T-Y. Serendipity. Why would you
ever need a better word than that?
She sits up, grabs her notebook, starts to draw out a new
crossword puzzle.
- DAY
A busy newspaper office. COURIERS make deliveries,
JOURNALISTS talk at their desks, SECRETARIES count the
minutes until they can go home.
In the Editor's office, JIM SOLOMAN looks over the newspaper
layout with an ASSISTANT.
SOLOMAN
Let's split the gardening feature
into two weeks. Keep them in
suspense.
He steps back, looks at the whole layout.
SOLOMAN
Looks good. How are we doing here?
22.
He checks his watch.
SOLOMAN
Five minutes to spare. Look at
that.
The Assistant points to a blank corner of page 26. Soloman's
surprised, and not particularly impressed.
SOLOMAN
Horowitz.
Mary stands at the front of the full elevator, smiling, a
piece of paper gripped in her hand.
MARY (V.0.)
When I was a fledgling (that means
novice) crossword constructor, I
would find comfort in the words of
the learned crossword sages. Above
all, my hero is Manny Nosowsky,
frequent New York Times contributor
and all around cruciverbial master.
Mary walks out of the elevator and heads through the office.
Nobody seems to notice her.
MARY (V.O.)
Manny says that a crossword
puzzle's greatness can be
determined by asking three simple
questions.
She marches in the direction of the Editor's office.
MARY (V.0.)
Is it solvable?
She almost collides with a mail cart but keeps walking.
MARY (V.0.)
Is it entertaining?
She arrives at the Editor's office, plants her feet in the
doorway.
23.
MARY (V.O.)
Does it s arkle?
She looks down at the crossword puzzle in her hands, smiles,
holds it out for Soloman.
Soloman grabs the crossword and hands it right to the
Assistant, who rushes it out the door.
Two OLD LADIES sit under the hair dryers, each doing the
Atlanta Citizen crossword puzzle. They're stumped. The
first Old Lady hollers over the noise of the dryer.
OLD LADY
I CAN'T GET ANY OF THESE!
The other Old Lady holds up her blank crossword, shrugs.
The TAXI DRIVER sits in the parked taxi doing the crossword.
TAXI DRIVER

male EXECUTIVE sits down and spots the newspaper opened to
the crossword puzzle.
GUY

know what the deal is, but it looks
like all the answers are --
Soloman holds up the crossword page.
SOLOMAN
Steve?
Mary sits and smiles.
24.
SOLOMAN
Every single answer is "Steve"?
Who the hell is Steve anyway? No
wait, I don't care, but I do care
that you pissed off our readers.
Mary's smile falls a bit.
SOLOMAN
I thought you knew better than to
pull something like this. It's
unprofessional, it's --
to him.
He's too frustrated, the words aren't coming
MARY
Romantic?
SOLOMAN
No!
MARY
Creativo? That's Italian for
"creative".
SOLOMAN
No.
MARY
How about -
SOLOMAN
Mary. We're letting you go.
MARY
Oh.

She looks like she's going to cry. She picks
bag, fidgets.
MARY
Maybe I could make it up to you by
doing a fishing themed crossword.
I know how you love the
piscatology.
Soloman shakes his head -- it's done.
Mary hesitates then finally gets up.
MARY
Okay. I'll just give you some time
then. We'll talk next week.
25.
He ignores that. She walks out, seemingly content, a bit of
denial.
A PAYROLL CLERK sees the elevator doors close behind Mary.
PAYROLL CLERK
She forgot her severance.
ASSISTANT
Don't you mean "Steverance"?
They both laugh.
An exec office. Steve relaxes on the sofa next to Angus
while Hartman noses around the office.
ANGUS
We're going to hit rush. We'll
have to take the second flight.
Exec. Producer DAN CORBITT walks in, heads straight for his
desk.
CORBITT
You're set. KDFW's on site now.
Angus and Steve start to get up.
CORBITT
Hang on.
They sit. Corbitt grabs the remote control, turns the TV on.
27.
CORBITT
Anybody want to tell me about this?
He fast forwards through footage of Hartman reporting from a
greenhouse. Corbitt slows it to normal speed, mutes it.
They watch as Hartman interviews an attractive female
BOTANIST holding a test tube with a seedling in it. Hartman
keeps pointing to the seedling - which happens to be right in
front of the Botanist's generous breasts.
The camera gets closer and closer - each time it pulls away
Hartman points to the seedling again to force the camera in
close - basically turning the piece into a giant boob-fest.
ANGUS
Take a look at those... plants.
Corbitt pauses it on the worst shot, looks at Steve.
CORBITT
We can't use this.
Hartman fakes disgust.
HARTMAN
Of course not. Nice camera work,
Stevie.
Steve glares at Hartman. Corbitt points at the frozen shot
on the TV screen, looks at Steve.
CORBITT
You want to go back to the Weather
Channel, try that again.
Corbitt checks his watch, points them out the door.
CORBITT
Get out of here. Don't embarrass
me in Dallas.
Hartman, Angus and Steve walk out. Steve nods to Hartman -
thanks asshole.
In the hallway, Steve's cell phone rings. He answers it.
STEVE
What?... Mom, let me call you
back.
28.
He listens, signals to Angus he needs a minute, then stops at
a reception area. He sorts through the newspapers, pulls out
the Atlanta Citizen, flips through it.
STEVE
What page?
He finds Mary's crossword. He looks at it closely, totally
confused. It takes him more than a second to get it.
He laughs -- then suddenly reality sets in.
STEVE
Jesus.
Mary does a crossword while soaking in the bathtub. Without
missing an answer, she reaches over the side of the tub,
grabs the telephone on the floor. She checks the dial tone,
hangs up quickly, continues with the puzzle.
MARY
Four letter word for am I going to
wait my whole life for Steve to
call?
She suddenly stops writing.
MARY
Nope.
She flails out of the tub like a salmon heading upstream,
grabs a towel barely big enough to cover her. Without any
effort to dry off, she runs out of the bathroom.
Towel wrapped around her but barely covering, Mary reaches
the top of the stairs. Her wet feet sliding all over the
place, she opts for the safety of a banister slide. She gets
up on it, slides a few inches before realizing what a bad
idea it was.
MARY
Ow ow ouch.
She gets off the banister, slops the rest of the way down the
stairs, jumps into the doorway of the living room.
29.
MARY
The news is Steve's life! It's not
just what he does, it's who he is,
imbedded deep down in his polymer
of nucleotides. I should be out
there by his side. That's what
girlfriends do, isn't it? Let him
concentrate on his work. I'll
concentrate on the relationship.
It won't be easy, I know, but
neither is quantum physics or...
the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle or... paper mache, but
I've managed to do fine with those,
haven't I?
She looks at her parents. They sit at a table playing bridge
with MR. and MRS. HANCOCK.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Mary, you remember the Hancocks.
MARY
Top of the evening.
Mr. Hancock checks out Mary's bare legs as she stands in a
puddle of bath water. Mrs. Hancock lifts her husband's chin,
snaps him out of it.
MRS. HANCOCK
Loved this week's puzzle, dear.
Whoever Steve is, he must be a very
lucky young man.
Mr. Horowitz gives Mrs. Hancock a look - "don't encourage
her".
MARY
Exactly! And all I have to do is
go to him, be near him, and do my
best to radiate... me.
Mr. Horowitz doesn't like the sound of this.
MR. HOROWITZ
And where exactly will this
radiation take place?
Mary rushes to the TV, turns it on, flips it to CNN.
ON THE TV:
30.
A shot of the Medieval Times castle in Dallas, TX. The
banner on the screen reads "WORKPLACE KILLING".
MARY
Wherever news happens, Dad.
Wherever news happens.
Mary waves to her worried parents through the closed door.
MARY
(to herself)
I'm not coming back alone.
The bus is full. Most PASSENGERS sleep.
Mary sits in the aisle seat of the first row, a BURLY MAN in
his 60's beside her. The light above their seats illuminates
the crossword puzzle he's working on. Mary looks over his
shoulder, points to the blank spaces in his puzzle.
MARY
Omaha... Einstein... cholera...
grenade... Bach... oui...
potbelly... Oreo.
The man drops the crossword, glares at her.
MARY
Sorry.
She looks away, starts biting her nails, then spots a sign on
the freeway, calls-out to the Driver and anybody else who
will listen.
MARY
Bessemer, Alabama! Named after Sir
Henry Bessemer, a Brit. Guess what
he did? Perfected the way steel is
made, of course.
(MORE)
34.
MARY (cont'd)
I won't bore you with the whole
story, just the best parts, like
how it involves molten pig iron
which does not, as one might think,
have anything to do with pigs.
It's actually a raw iron made from
iron ore, plus limestone, plus coke
- and by coke I mean the
carbonaceous residue, not the cola,
or the booger sugar.
Mary looks around for a response -- nothing.
MARY
You know what else is in Bessemer?
The city, I mean? Hitler's
typewriter. It's crazy, I know.
That guy was such an asshole.
The Driver's eyes glaze over. Please let this and.
The Driver looks at the passengers. Most of them are still
sleeping.
DRIVER
We'll just take five minutes here.
He steps off the bus. Mary turns to the man next to her.
MARY
Can you watch my stuff?
He glares at her -- you have got to be kidding. Mary grabs
her backpack and Kroger bag and steps off the bus.
Mary walks into the restaurant, heads toward the ladies room.
On her way, she spots a television behind the counter. A few
DINERS watch. Mary joins them.
On the TV: "MEDIEVAL TIMES HOSTAGE CRISIS".
35.
HARTMAN
(on TV)
Perhaps the greatest obstacle the
hostage negotiators face is the
suspect's refusal to communicate
using modern day technology. In
keeping with his role as a medieval
knight, he's insisting on an
eleventh century messenger to
deliver all communication.
The screen splits with a female news ANCHOR.
ANCHOR
What are we talking about here,
Hartman? Carrier pigeons?
MARY
Homing pigeons.
A few of the Diners overhear.
HARTMAN
Actually, homing pigeons.
The Diners look at Mary.
MARY
Carrier pigeons, despite their
name, are more or less useless when
it comes to actually carrying
anything. Homing pigeons are
better for messenger work...
The Diners lose interest. Mary catches the eye of a WANDERER
at the end of the counter. He's hanging on her every word.
MARY
You know who used them all the
time? Genghis Khan. Loved the
pigeons, scared to death of pooches
though.
The Wanderer just stares at her.
MARY
You know, dogs, canines, de honden?
Still nothing. She looks back at the TV.
36.
ANCHOR
Have the negotiators located any
homing pigeons? Where do you even
get them in this day and age?
HARTMAN
You can buy them on the internet
for twenty-five bucks a pop.
Mary looks at the Diners, smiles, points to the TV.
MARY
My boyfriend is probably holding
that camera right now.
The Diners ignore her and just eat their pie. Mary realizes
the time, runs out of the rest stop.
Norm drives as Mary drones on while flipping through a truck
repair manual.
MARY
And my other rule about crossword
puzzles is this. No pencils.
Doing a crossword with a pencil is
like screaming with your lips duct
taped together. It's weak.

MARY (cont'd)
If you're going to do a crossword,
you should do it fearlessly, with
abandon, and with a pen. I prefer
a medium tip, felt, blue -
NORM
Quiet time might be good right
about now.
MARY
Oh.
She thinks about it, whispers.
MARY
Do you mean quiet as in softly
hushed like this? Or do you mean
quiet, as in silent?
He nods. Mary squeezes her lips together, holds them. It
lasts for about a second.
MARY
Norm?
NORM
What?
MARY
Thanks for not raping me.
NORM
My pleasure.
Mary walks past TV in the bus station tuned to Fox News.
On every screen - images of an upset WOMAN dodging press to
get through the doors of Children's Hospital, Oklahoma City.
The screen caption: "The Fight for Baby Peggy".
Mary's parents share the phone.
MR. HOROWITZ
Last time I checked, freeway 20
still heads right back here.
Mrs. Horowitz hangs up the phone. Mr. Horowitz walks to the
TV, turns it on, flips stations.
MR. HOROWITZ
Oklahoma.
Images of the Oklahoma hospital vigil are everywhere.
Captions like "Breaking News: Baby Peggy" flash across the
screen.
Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz watch TV and read at the same time.
The TV is on mute --- CNN's Baby Peggy coverage.
In the corner of the screen, "amputation countdown - 35
hours". Shots of the protestors' candlelight vigil appear on
the screen.
Mrs. Horowitz spots Mary in the crowd, standing next to
Elizabeth. She sings and waves her candle around, all the
while straining to look for Steve.
MRS. HOROWITZ
There she is! Abe, look! There
she is right there.
Mr. Horowitz glances up from his book.
MR. HOROWITZ
She's going to set her hair on fire
with that candle.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Look, she's made friends.
Mrs. Horowitz tries not to cry.
Mr. Horowitz is asleep in front of the TV. He wakes up as
the amputation countdown clock on the news stops.
Angus at the wheel, Hartman in the passenger seat. In the
back, Steve nervously looks out the windows. Josh gets in
next to him.
Angus starts driving slowly across the grass behind other
news vans. Steve finally relaxes.
Hartman spots Mary in the rear view mirror.
HARTMAN
Angus, hold up.
56.
Steve sees what Hartman's looking at.
STEVE
No, go. Fast.
Hartman rolls down his window.
STEVE
Don't.
Hartman sticks his head out the window.
STEVE
Hughes, I swear I'll kill you.
Hartman waves to Mary to catch up. Angus sees her in the
mirror as he drives.
ANGUS
Is that her? She's hot.
STEVE
Angus, come on man, get me out of
here.
ANGUS
She's really hot.
STEVE
Who cares? Jesus, you guys -
Angus hits the brakes. Steve hides behind the seat just as
Mary catches up with the van.
HARTMAN
Hi beautiful.
Mary tries to get a look at Steve but can only see part of
his back hunched over behind the seat.
MARY
Steve? Are you okay? Is he okay?
Angus leans over to her window.
ANGUS
I don't think we've met. Angus.
Mary shakes Angus' hand. He can't take his eyes off her.
HARTMAN
Steve's not feeling well.
57.
MARY
Oh no.
HARTMAN
I'm sure he'll be fine by the time
we get to New Mexico.
ANGUS
Your eyes are striking.
Steve punches him through the seat. Mary's oblivious.
MARY
Thank you.
HARTMAN
Steve really wants you to follow
us. It would mean a lot to him.
STAYS
Steve cringes, goes to speak up but stops himself and
hidden.
HARTMAN
He was going to go ask you himself
but look at the poor bastard. So
sick he can't even sit up straight.
MARY
What if it's a viral zoonotic
disease? He should see a doctor.
HARTMAN
Exactly what I told him, but the
only person he wants touching his
infected flesh is you.
Mary looks at Steve, worried.
MARY
But wait, what if -
up.
Hartman grabs her face, squishes her lips to shut her
HARTMAN
Hey now, we need you to be strong
for him. Leachinan trial, Santa Fe,
can you remember that?
Mary nods, unable to speak.
HARTMAN
We'll meet you there, God willing.
58.
He lets go of her face.
MARY
Will you take care of him?
HARTMAN
Like he's my own.
She backs away from the window. Angus waves to her and
starts driving.
ANGUS
Nothing wrong with that one.
JOSH
Except for those boots.
STEVE
You're an asshole, Hughes.
Hartman laughs.
Howard starts the car. In the passenger seat, Elizabeth has
a bunch of the protest signs crammed in at her feet.
Mary gets settled in the back seat, spots a copy of
Scientific American magazine, then finds an apple stuck
behind the seat belt. She yanks the apple out, looks at it.
Howard looks at her in the rear view mirror.
HOWARD
You can have that. I have more.
MARY
Thanks.
Mary puts the apple in her Kroger bag.
MARY
Howard, if you get sleepy and want
to trade off driving for a while,
just wake me up and I'll take over.

MARY (cont'd)
I'm a night owl, yes, but I'm also
a day owl too, a burrowing owl,
technically. They stay awake all
day too. I'm pretty much alert
24/7, always have been. No
caffeine. Just sugar and my
natural tendency to, you know,
never fall asleep.
Mary leans back, closes her eyes, and she's out.
A briefing area is set up - folding chairs, table, podium. A
bunch of male journalists sit around the table playing poker -
Vince (CNN), DOUG (CNN), the COURT TV REPORTER, a BBC NEWS
PHOTOGRAPHER, a FRENCH PHOTOGRAPHER, A SPANISH JOURNALIST and
Angus.
Hartman escorts Mary in. The guys perk up a bit.
HARTMAN
You all know Mary? Steve's
girlfriend?
Mary shakes hands around the table, greets them all in their
native tongues.
MARY
Hello... Bonjour... Hola...
Jolly afternoon...
She gets to Angus. He kisses her hand.
ANGUS
My dear, sit.
He shoves the BBC guy out of the way to make room for Mary
next to him. Vince shuffles the cards.
VINCE
Mary, you in?
MARY
Poker? Technically I'm familiar
but I've never actually played.
With people, I mean.
SPANISH JOURNALIST
She's in.
Doug throws in some cash as Vince starts to deal.
65.
Mary holds her cards close to her.
MARY
"There are few things that are so
unpardonably neglected in our
country as poker." Guess who said
that one.
She looks around the table. The guys, except Angus, are
starting to lose their patience.
MARY
Mark Twain. And you know what else-
BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER
Darling, you in or not?
MARY
Sorry.
Mary looks at her cards, thinks about it for way too long,
then grabs a handful of coins from her Kroger bag, slaps them
on the table.
MARY
Send it, ladies!
Steve steps into the tent, spots Mary, turns to run back out.
HARTMAN
Don't go, Steve! Look who's here.
Mary jumps up - just about knocks the table over, then
sustains a number of injuries trying to leap over chairs. At
last she makes it to Steve, hugs him.
MARY
Thank God you're okay!
66.
He looks over her shoulder and mouths "you're dead" to
Hartman.
TO
He holds her back at arm's length, looks at her, goes
speak then stops himself, pulls her outside the tent.
At the poker table, the guys hear scuffling outside.
BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER
Fight!
They all jump up and run out of the tent.
A furious Corbitt holds the phone and replays the live shot
of Hartman at the court house.
MARY (O.S., ON TV)
OH MY GOD, STEVE, YOU'RE
BLEEDING!... OH MY GOD, STEVE,
YOU'RE BLEEDING!... OH MY GOD,
STEVE, YOU'RE BLEEDING!
CORBITT
Who the hell was that?
Mary talks on a pay phone. No pacing, no fidgeting. She
means business.
75.
MARY
I got him in trouble, Dad. I have
to go find him and make it right.
There's three places they could be
headed.
She pulls a note pad out of her pocket, looks it over.
MARY
For each story, I've worked out an
equation of potential human
casualties, estimated property
damage, availability of endlessly
repeatable images, with bonus
points for anything involving
reporters in galoshes. There's no
doubt in my mind. They're heading
to the storm in Galveston.
Mr. Horowitz talks on the living room phone, his wife on the
hallway phone - they look at each other in exasperation.
MR. HOROWITZ
Enough is enough. You've got to
get home, turn in your crossword
for next week -
MARY (O.S.)
I can't think of work at a time
like this!
MRS. HOROWITZ
You can't chase that boy any more.
If he doesn't appreciate you it's
ridiculous to -
Mary screams into the phone.
MARY
Ridiculous? Mom! How many times
did you propose to dad?
Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz think about it for a second.
76.
MRS. HOROWITZ MR. HOROWITZ
Twice. Seven times.
Mary yells on the phone. PASSENGERS start to stare.
MARY
I rest my case! If you gave up the
first time dad said no then I
wouldn't exist. Telling me to give
up so soon on my potential husband-
to-be, birth father of my twelve
future children and adoptive father
of my gerbil Carol -- you might as
well be saying that you wish you
had given up too and that you never
married dad and that I'd never been
born. Is that what you're saying?
Mrs. Horowitz looks at her husband.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Give Steve my best.
MR. HOROWITZ
Be careful.
MRS. HOROWITZ
And eat! A biscuit, anything. A
V8 wouldn't kill you.
Howard and Mary fasten their seat belts.
HOWARD
This storm could be bad. Sure you
want to drive into it?
MARY
How bad could it be?

God really hates us now.
Howard and Mary can barely see out the window. The car
inches along.
Mary digs in a KFC bag, takes out a handy wipe, starts
cleaning her body with it.
MARY
And when I met Steve, I knew right
away we had a lot in common. We're
both in the media, we both love
crosswords, we both love words. We
both felt this unexplainable
connection, no matter how much his
instinct might be to fight it.
That's okay. We just have to get
to know each other better, that's
all.
She uses the wipe on her face, gets a bit on her lip and the
taste is awful. She rolls down the window, closes her eyes
and gently sticks her face out to rinse with rain water.
The car hits a flooded patch of the road. A wave of mud
washes up and smacks Mary right in the face.
MARY
Crap.
She starts the handy wipe bath all over again. A nervous
Howard speaks up.
HOWARD
I saw Steve talking to you... He
wasn't very nice.
Mary makes herself busy putting the handy wipe in her Kroger
bag then looks out the window.
MARY
If there's one thing I learned from
crossword puzzles it's that you
can't give up.

MARY (cont'd)
Sometimes you run into a doozy and
you think you'll never be able to
solve it in a million years. If
you quit, you're right, but if you
stick with it, you'll figure it
out. Eventually.
She looks at Howard.
MARY
I have to give it one more try. I
have to fix the mess I made with
his work, then maybe he and I --
For the first time, she doesn't seem so sure. Howard
notices.
HOWARD
You know what my favorite part of
doing crosswords is? When you know
something you didn't think you
knew.
Mary thinks about it, then turns back to looking out the
window.
MARY
Me too.
Howard stares out the window, the first look of real fear on
his face.
HOWARD
Hang on.
He hits the brakes, starts backing up as quickly as possible.
Mary looks ahead -- sees what looks like a tornado up ahead.
MARY
Oh my God.
Howard backs under an overpass, points to a protected area up
the cement embankment.
Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz watch images of the storm on TV, the
captions read "BREAKING NEWS: KILLER STORM". Mrs. Horowitz
crosses herself. Mr. Horowitz puts an arm around her.
MR. HOROWITZ
She's fine. She's fine.
MRS. HOROWITZ
This is all your fault.
MR. HOROWITZ
I know.

ON THE TV: "BREAKING NEWS - ABANDONED MINE DISASTER".
CNN ANCHOR
An abandoned mine shaft on the
outskirts of Eunice, Louisiana.
The children, apparently all
hearing impaired, enjoying a trip'
to the county fair, blissfully
unaware of the danger that lay
ahead.
The FOX NEWS ANCHOR is on camera.
FOX NEWS ANCHOR
No word yet on injuries. No word

children. Well continue to bring

Steve drives, Hartman is next to him. Angus is in the back
with Doug and Josh.
88.
HARTMAN
Tornadocane my ass. Where the hell
were the cicadas? Retards in a
mine shaft, now that's a story.
STEVE
They're deaf, asshole.
They spot Mary and Howard up ahead in the ditch, next to the
car on its side.
HARTMAN
Look, it's your girlfriend.
STEVE
We're not stopping.
Hartman grabs a piece of paper, writes fast.
ANGUS
We can't just leave them.
STEVE
Highway patrol's down here every
hour. It's not like they'll rot in
the ditch.
As they get closer, Hartman rolls down his window, folds up
the piece of paper.
STEVE
What the hell are you doing?
HARTMAN
Getting some fresh air. It helps
my pores.
Steve tries to grab the paper.
STEVE
Hughes!
HARTMAN
Yes, Steven?
STEVE
You're not telling her where we're
going.
HARTMAN
Aren't I?
89.
Hartman leans out the window with the paper, waves it around.
Steve reaches for it, one hand on the wheel. As he grabs
Hartman, the truck starts swerving.
ANGUS
Christ, you two. You'll get us
killed.
Angus leans into the front seat, tries to steady the steering
wheel.
Hartman rolls up the window, happy with himself. Steve slugs
him in the arm.
STEVE
Asshole!
Hartman laughs, rubs his arm in pain.
The coal dust covered kids sit in the dark, totally unharmed.
A few of them play rock, paper, scissors. Others braid each
other's hair. An 8 year old boy signs to his friend.
DEAF BOY
(SUBTITLED)
I don't know what the hell happened
but I smell a lawsuit.
Rescuers keep a safe distance from the perilous hole. A
RESCUE SUPERVISOR oversees the effort, watches as a bucket is
attached to the old crane, barely big enough for one person.
A FIREMAN gets in the bucket, doesn't fit. He gets out. A
SKINNY FIREMAN is pushed forward. He gets in.
The bucket is lowered into the ground. Hartman jumps in
front of the scene. Steve follows with the camera.
HARTMAN
To some, a simple crane. To the
trapped, innocent, special children
-- the answer to their prayers.
The cable lowering the bucket jerks and stops. The crowd
gasps. Hartman stays on camera.
92.
HARTMAN
Or is it?
The cable jerks and begins moving again.
HARTMAN
Only time will tell.
Through the crowd, Steve sees a WOMAN who looks like Mary
from the back. fie freezes, then realizes it's not her.
Total relief.

Howard searches for a space to park. Every inch of the place

Mr. Horowitz runs down the stairs with luggage and Carol the

Complete darkness. Mary's voice full of misery.
MARY
Eight letter word for... my life
has come to this.
There's a bit of shuffling around in the dark.
MARY
Not destiny, that's only seven
letters. Not fortuity - that
sounds more like when good things
happen to people like finding a
quarter in the sofa or something.
I mean the not so great stuff
that's bound to befall some people
more than others. Fate's nasty
cousin, I mean.
Suddenly Mary's face lights up with her mini keychain
flashlight.
MARY
F-O-R-E-D-0-0-M. Foredoom.
A
Mary shines the light on her knee. Her previous cut is now
gaping wound, blood is all over the place.
MARY
Crap.
A RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR comments as a graphic shows the
cross section of the mine. As he talks, the graphic animates
with a female figure in red boots tumbling into the mine and
bouncing off the walls all the way down -- and it plays over
and over.
RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR
That area was never reinforced up
above, no need since the whole
eastern tunnel was blocked off in
the late Seventies. Of course that
would also affect the air quality
down there.

That has to be bad news for Mary
Horowitz, wouldn't you say?
RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR
Definitely not looking good.
Mr. Horowitz snaps the TV off, furious and worried.
An upset Mrs. Horowitz cracks open the curtains, looks
outside.
MRS. HOROWITZ
Who are these people?
A slick, young JOURNALIST stands on the sidewalk in front of
the Horowitz house.
99.
SLICK JOURNALIST
Mary Horowitz, described by those
who know her as smart, talkative,
very much the girl next door, that
is, if the girl next door has a
genius level IQ. She's worked for
eleven years as the crossword
constructor for the Atlanta Citizen
and lives right here with her
parents.
Mr. Horowitz opens the door an is swarmed by Reporters. The
Slick Journalist gets right in there.
MR. HOROWITZ
No, Mary doesn't live with us. She
just came over one day and won't
leave, but she has her own place.
SLICK JOURNALIST
Can you comment on the rumors that
Mary's fall into the mine was a
suicide attempt?
MR. HOROWITZ
That's ridiculous. Not our Mary.
The word depression isn't in her
vocabulary. Well, it's in her
vocabulary, obviously, but no,
nothing ever gets her down. Steady
as a rock, that one.
Mary shines her light around on the walls of the mine. Black
soot everywhere, a mine track, abandoned equipment.
MARY
I am not afraid. I am not fearful,
pusillanimous, nor am I affrighted.
Suddenly in the light - a face. Mary screams her head off.
The face doesn't budge - it's a LITTLE DEAF GIRL.
MARY
Oh my God, they forgot one! You
scared the crap out of me.
The girl just stares at her.
100.
MARY
I'm sorry, can you hear me, I mean
at all? Do you have sensorineural
hearing loss or conductive? "Deaf
people can do anything except
hear." You know who said that?
Doctor Jordan, first deaf President
of Gallaudet U. Maybe you'll go
there one day. That is, unless we
perish down here.
Mary smiles. The Little Deaf Girl just stares back.

Mary talks to the little Girl.

And then there's black lung
disease, also a problem in coal
mines. Chronic cough,
breathlessness, cyanosis - that's
where your skin turns purple --

WAGA Reporter CINDY emotes like her life depends on it.
WAGA CINDY
No one will argue that the city of
Atlanta has always been a breeding
ground for heroes. Jimmy Carter,

WAGA Cindy interviews a 30ish male SCIENTIST.
SCIENTIST
I knew Mary Horowitz in college.
She caught me trying to cheat off
her physics midterm, lectured me
for an hour and when she finally
stopped talking I asked her out.
She said no, said it was because I
was, get this - hebetudinous. Can
you believe?
He walks away, bitter, gets back to work on NASA rockets.
WAGA Cindy interviews an attractive male RESEARCHER as he
puts away books. He talks as though it still stings:
RESEARCHER
We dated for a while but she ended

He points around 'to the library - you could hear a pin drop.
RESEARCHER
Whatever that means.
Mary still talks.

And Archimedes, there's another
one. He was into math, philosophy,
all kinds of stuff, then one day he
was working out an equation in the

Mary still talks.
MARY
Happenstance, I love that word too.
And you know what else -
Mary coughs. Before she has a chance to catch her breath, a
rope with a small bag attached quickly drops next to her, the
bag hitting the floor. Mary unties the bag and looks inside
to find water and sandwiches.
110.
MARY
No dessert. Crappy. Did you know
that the word dessert comes from an
old French word that means "clear
the table"? Sometimes I feel like
dinner is just doing time so I can
get to the point, and of course the
point always involves sugar. Who
needs -
The Little Deaf Girl covers her ears, vocalizes as much as
she's able.
LITTLE DEAF GIRL
Shut up! I can't hear you but you
talk a lot.
Totally catches Mary off guard. She fully takes that in.
Her demeanor completely shifts, a calm washes over her.,
MARY
I know.
She sits down.
MARY
I know.
She notices the Little Girl's shoes are soaked. Mary moves
next to her, takes off her rubber boots and puts them on the
Little Girl. Mary puts an arm around her, holds her close at
- softly,
her side, then speaks like she's a different person
to herself, the Little Girl unable to read her lips.
MARY
I'm not good at... silence. "Mary
doesn't do quiet", that's how my
grandmother always said it.
"What's that hush?" she'd holler at
a party. "It's Mary about to
talk", then she'd laugh and laugh
and laugh. Everybody would... But
I knew something they didn't - that
if you keep talking, if you keep on
talking, you don't hear people
telling you that you're different.
You don't hear people saying they
don't like you. And if you're
talking, you just might not hear it
when some kid... calls you a freak.
Mary's eyes start to well.
MARY
I just wanted to be normal, that's
all. Steve said I was.
She thinks about it, laughs a bit.
MARY
I'm beginning to think newsmen
can't entirely be trusted.
She buttons up the Little Girl's sweater.
MARY
The truth is normal is -- not me.
She seems surprised she said it out loud. There's relief in
it.
MARY
My friends, the people I've met
over the past week, they're not
normal either. They're more
interesting, more original, more
real, more rare.
She suddenly gets it, brightens up.
MARY
That's where I fit.
- and for
She thinks about it, in silence. The sadness fades
the first time, she's comfortably quiet.
She smiles at the Little Deaf Girl. The Little Deaf Girl
smiles back. And they sit -- Mary totally calm.
Mary hears something in the distance - a gentle PLINK PLINK
PLINK she couldn't have heard while talking.
She picks up the flashlight, moves toward the noise. In a
corner of the mine, a water drip hits on some old rusted
mining tools, including two rusty vice grips.
The Little Girl coughs. Mary looks back at her, concerned.

Mary motions for the Little Deaf Girl to jump on piggyback.
She jumps up onto Mary's back, still in the red rubber boots.
Mary starts jugging up the rope, the vice grips and rope
pieces acting like ladder steps.
They start rising up slowly. Not an easy task. Mary
struggles every step.
The Guys at the bar stand up to watch to the shot of the
moving rope on TV.
Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz on the edge of their seats in front of
the Mary Watch TV coverage.
The Little Deaf Girl helps Mary move one of the vice grips up
the rope.
MARY (V.0.)
If life is like a crossword puzzle
then its worth, its greatness, its
raison d'efre should be judged in
the same way.

Mary grasps the cable with everything she has, pulls up
another step.
MARY (V.O.)
Is it solvable?
One of the red boots drops down into the mine shaft.
Mary looks up as the lights above get closer and closer.
MARY (V.0.)
Is it entertaining?
Mrs. Horowitz hands her husband the box of Kleenex as they
wail and watch Mary on TV, safely above ground.

The customers eat pie while they're glued to images of Mary
and the little Girl.
NORM
Good for her. Good for her.
The staff breathe a sigh of relief when they see Mary alive
on TV. Jim Soloman stares at the images, happy, acquiescent.
JIM SOLOMAN
We're going to have to give her her
job back.
He shakes his head, laughs.
Everybody in the bar celebrates. The BARTENDER rings the
bell.
The Career Day teacher watches Mary on TV, wipes her eyes.
The Laundry Sorters celebrate, then realize their laundry is
all pink.
The Large Kid from the Career Day class walks into the living
room where his DAD has Mary Watch on TV. The Kid holds up a
crossword, half done, and he's not happy about it.
LARGE KID
Did you start this and not bother
finishing it? Do you know how much
work goes into making these things?
Honestly, Dad.
The Kid grabs a pencil to finish the puzzle.

Mary sits right at the front talking to the female BUS
DRIVER.
MARY
In solving the puzzle of life
there's one thing you must do.
She points to the side of the road. The bus pulls over.
MARY
Find somebody just as normal as
you.
Mary stands up, gets off the bus.
MARY
if not a whole bunch.
Howard, Elizabeth, George, Lydia, Carlos, Clyde, a few old
Ladies, a bunch of other Protestors file off the bus. Mary
keeps talking to the bus driver.
MARY
And don't be a slave to your loins.
Trust me on that one.
Mary taps the side of her head.
MARY
You need to let this be the boss of
you. Cornprende ?
