                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT11

      Allison pulls into a 24 hour gas station. She gets out, 
      leaving her KEYS in the ignition. While filling the tank, she 
      glances around to notice the only other customer--

      A guy in his twenties, climbing onto a motorcycle. He flashes 
      a flirtatious smile, pulls on his helmet and tears into the 
      road.

      Allison turns back, waiting for the gas to finish pumping 
      when THE LIGHTS over the station CLICK OUT with an ELECTRIC 
      CRACKLE.

      Startled, she glances about, finding herself still alone. Not 
      a sound, other than her own nervous swallow. 

      Moving quickly, she puts the pump back and gets into her car. 
      When she reaches up, however--

      The keys are no longer in the ignition. 

      Allison checks her pockets, under her seat. Becoming more and 
      more anxious, she gets out to look around the car. 

      The JINGLE of KEYS spins her around. 

      Breath held, she searches the shadows. Then hears it again. 
      Keys CLICKING against each other. But from a different 
      direction. 

      Eyes darting from shadow to shadow, she searches for 
      movement. When she turns again--

      SOMEONE YANKS A HOOD OVER HER HEAD. Allison SCREAMS as her 
      world turns black.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT22

      Darkness. And then the hood is yanked off. A gag around her 
      mouth, Allison blinks, finding herself tied to a chair in a 
      familiar place: the Hale House. Then she sees something even 
      more frightening--                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/122.

        CONTINUED:22

      HER FATHER. Gagged and bound to a chair right next to her. 
      Argent breathes hard through his nose, trying to keep calm.

      A VOICE whispers out of the shadows.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Ever wonder what happens if a 
                    hunter gets bitten, Allison?

      She whips her head around, trying to locate the voice.

                                  VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Ever wonder what happens if you get 
                    bitten?

      She watches her father struggling against his bindings, head 
      pulling toward his knees.

                                  VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    What do you think your father would 
                    do?

      Muscles straining, Argent angles his shoulders forward.

                                  VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    What do you think he d have to do?

      Veins at his temples looking about to burst, Argent keeps 
      pulling forward, bending the back of the chair.

                                  VOICE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    When all it would take to change *
                      everything is one bite.*

      With a VICIOUS CRACK, the chair holding Argent snaps in half. 
      He falls to the floor amid the pieces.

      Astonished, Allison watches him whip his feet through his 
      bound hands. In seconds, the bindings fall to the floor and 
      Argent rises to his feet.

      He slowly turns to Allison and smiles at her.

      TWO MEN appear behind him. One is a HUNTER and the other is 
      the handsome motorcyclist from the gas station, a man named 
      BENNETT. He hands Argent a cell phone.

      Allison watches her father press a button on the phone.

                                  VOICE (CONT D)
                    One bite.*

      Argent clicks it off.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/123.

        CONTINUED:22

                                  ARGENT
                    And everything changes.

      While she glares at him, he unties her gag.

                                    ALLISON
                          (furious)
                    Is this how we re going to do 
                      father-daughter talks from now on?

                                  ARGENT
                    No. This is how we re going to 
                    train you.

      The glare subsides. Now she s ready to listen. Argent turns 
      to Bennett who hands him something unseen.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    Do you know why we use arrows?

                                    ALLISON
                    They can t heal until it s taken 
                    out.

      Argent holds up a BROKEN ARROW. The same one Allison used to 
      take down a Hunter.

                                  ARGENT
                    Look familiar?

                                    ALLISON
                    You were going to kill him.

                                  ARGENT
                    That s right. And if we find Isaac 
                    on another full moon, we will kill *
                    him. That s the hard choice we 
                    make. But it wasn t my choice.*

                                    ALLISON
                          (confused)
                    Gerard?

                                  ARGENT
                    No. You see, our family has a *
                      surprisingly progressive tradition. 
                    Knowing wars and violence are 
                    typically started by men, we place 
                    the final decisions--the hard ones--
                    with the women.

      He steps around her, moving to her bound wrists.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/124.

        CONTINUED:22

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    Our sons are trained to be 
                    soldiers. Our daughters are trained 
                    to be leaders.

      Instead of untying her, he places the arrow shaft with the 
      tip pointed up in her hands.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    And training starts now.
                          (to Bennett)
                    Time her.

      Argent and the other Hunter disappear into the shadows, 
      leaving the house. 

      Bennett holds up his phone for Allison. THE DISPLAY shows a 
      TIMER now counting the seconds.

      Gripping the arrowhead, Allison twists it around to start 
      sawing against her bindings.

      EXT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT33

      The front door swings open. An exhausted Allison steps out 
      while massaging her wrists.

      Leaning against her car parked nearby, Bennett clicks the 
      timer on his phone.

                                    BENNETT
                    Congrats.

                                    ALLISON
                    For what? It took me two and a half 
                    hours.

                                    BENNETT
                    Took me three when I did it.

      He flashes that flirtatious smile again. She can t help but 
      smile back.

      Watching her drive off, Bennett turns around to the house 
      where his motorcycle is parked to the side. But when he 
      starts forward, his leg catches on something.

                                    BENNETT (CONT D)
                    What the...

      He glances down to see something that looks like a vine 
      wrapped around his ankle. He kicks forward, pulling at it.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/125.

        CONTINUED:33

      It pulls back.

      Bennett goes off his feet, SLAMMING down to the leaves and 
      dirt. He reaches out, trying to crawl forward when a--

      A CLAWED HAND whips out, slashing across the nape of his 
      neck.

      Bennett scrambles to his feet, hand at his neck. When he 
      pulls it away, it s not blood that he sees, however. 

      It s a strange, sticky CLEAR substance.

      Yanking a gun from his jacket, he turns about, looking into 
      the darkness to find his attacker. 

      He does not see the strange CLAWED HAND held out, silhouetted 
      in the darkness. The sharp tips appear oddly translucent. 
      Even stranger is the fluid that drips like venom from the 
      frighteningly sharp tips.

      Turning, the gun trembles in Bennett s hand. Then falls right 
      out of his grasp.

      Bennett looks at his hand as if he doesn t recognize it. 
      Fingers struggling to clench, he can no longer make a fist. 
      His knees buckle and he falls again.

      Lurching onto his stomach as his body rapidly paralyzes, he 
      looks out through blurred vision to see--

      A STRANGE SILHOUETTE. A creature on all fours with glowing 
      reptilian eyes, its tail whipping up and around. 

      It approaches with an odd grace to its movement. Claws 
      digging into the ground, it rushes forward, coming right at 
      Bennett.

      Coming in for the kill.

                                                                            CUT TO:
      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY44

      Below a brilliantly glowing bank of high bay lights, a ROCK 
      CLIMBING WALL looms over the gym class. Safety lines at their 
      waists, Scott and Allison climb side-by-side, whispering to 
      each other as they move from one hand hold to the next.

                                  SCOTT
                    It had a tail. I don t have a tail.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/126.

        CONTINUED:44

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe you just haven t grown it 
                    yet.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m not growing a tail. Ever.

      She pauses, waiting for him to reach her level.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Are you slowing down for me?

                                    ALLISON
                    I was waiting for you.

                                  SCOTT
                    Waiting for me to catch up?

                                    ALLISON
                          (with a smile)
                    You looked like you were 
                      struggling.

                                  SCOTT
                    Maybe I was admiring the view.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh really? Try admiring from afar.

      She yanks herself up, faster and faster, until she reaches 
      the top with a gasp. Breathless, she turns to see--

      Scott is already there. Smiling victoriously. Charmed, but 
      slightly annoyed, Allison kicks out his foothold. The safety 
      line whips loose and Scott PLUMMETS. 

      Just before he lands, his descent halts. But then he DROPS 
      again. Scott hits the mat with a loud SLAP. Holding the 
      safety line, Coach allows himself a malicious laugh.

                                  COACH
                    McCall, I don t know why, but your 
                    pain gives me a special kind of 
                    joy.
                          (to the class)
                    All right, next two. Stilinski. 
                    Erica. Let s go.

      Stiles steps alongside ERICA REYES, a girl whose nerves look 
      as frayed as her hair. While Stiles ascends with enviable 
      speed, Erica slowly drags her out-of-shape body up.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/127.

        CONTINUED:44

      Below them, Scott and Allison try to keep their distance 
      among the other students. Neither of them notice Jackson at 
      the back, a dark and distant look in his eyes.

      As Stiles lands back down on the mats, everyone else looks up 
      to Erica. Pinned on the wall, she s not moving.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Erica? You okay? Dizzy? Vertigo?

      Next in line, Lydia gives an audible sigh.*

                                  LYDIA
                    Vertigo s a dysfunction of the 
                      vestibular system of the inner ear.

                                  COACH*
                    Erica!*

                    I m fine.*

                                    ALLISON
                    Coach, maybe it s not safe. You 
                    know she s epileptic.

                                  COACH
                    She is? Why the hell doesn t anyone 
                    tell me these things? Erica, you re 
                    good. Push off. I ll ease you down.

      But now she won t move at all, eyes squeezing shut in fear. *
      Scott steps forward to help.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Erica, just let go!

      Closing her eyes, Erica finally pushes off. She swings out, 
      hands grasping desperately for the safety line. Coach 
      grapples with the cord, managing to ease her down. When her 
      feet hit the mat, she slowly turns to face the stares. They 
      gaze on her with that horrible pity in their eyes.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    That s it, Erica. Shake it off.

      A few kids snicker, sending her slinking back into the crowd. 
      As she passes him, Scott gives an empathetic smile.

      Lydia steps in for her turn. Grasping a hand hold, she peers 
      up at the wall and above it where the large high bay lights--                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/127A.

      CLICK OFF.

      Down below, the gym now lies dark, quiet and empty. Until a 
      shadow stretches across the mats. Slowly approaching the wall 
      again, Erica gazes up at it with determination.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/128.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAY55

      Coach SMACKS a locker with his clipboard.

                                  COACH
                    Listen up. Anyone sees Isaac Lahey, 
                    you immediately tell the Principal, 
                    get a teacher or you call me. 
                    Except for you Greenberg. I don t 
                    want you calling me for anything. 
                    I m not kidding. Don t call.

      Scott and Stiles share a look.

                                  SCOTT
                    Isaac...

                    Derek s problem now.

      They head to their lockers, stepping away to reveal Jackson, 
      who clearly heard their exchange while--

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY66

      Erica inches up the climbing wall, intent on conquering it. 
      With no safety line, she struggles up and up.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - DAY77

      Changing back into school clothes, Stiles whispers to Scott.

                                  STILES
                    What do you mean tonight s not a 
                    good idea?

      As Stiles begins to pull his shirt off, Scott swings his 
      locker open, concealing him.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know. With Isaac missing 
                    and that thing we saw last night? *
                    It just doesn t feel right.*

      Scott closes the locker to reveal Stiles in a new shirt. 

                                  STILES
                    No. You re not backing out. You *
                    know why? Because you and Allison 
                    are obviously having quite a good 
                    time together. You know who else 
                    wants to have a good time? Stiles.

                    a row, in several different 
                      positions. Are you even listening 
                    to me?

      But Scott s focus is elsewhere. He looks down at his hand to 
      see it trembling.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY88

      Nearly at the top of the wall, Erica begins to smile. But 
      when she reaches for the next hand hold, she begins blinking 
      rapidly.

      A TREMOR shudders through her stiffening body. Hands 
      releasing their grip, her eyes roll back and she falls, 
      diving head first toward the floor as--

      SOMETHING surges underneath her, moving with astonishing 
      speed. Arms out, Scott catches her just before she hits.

      As Erica s body convulses against him, Scott lowers her to 
      the mats. The doors of the gym clang open, other students 
      pouring in to see what s happening.

      Stiles is the first to Scott s aid. However, he clearly 
      doesn t know what to do. But Allison does.

                                    ALLISON
                    Put her on her side.

      She helps turn Erica. Then looks to Scott.

                    How did you know?

                                  SCOTT
                    I felt it.

      He looks back to Erica, who clutches his hand through each 
      and every convulsion.

      INT. HOSPITAL/EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY99

      A BRIGHT LIGHT shines down. Now wearing a hospital gown, 
      Erica blinks as Melissa McCall pulls a pen light away. Blue 
      curtains separate her from the numerous patients in the busy 
      emergency room.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1210.

                    It s been a while since we saw you, 
                    Erica. You were being so good about 
                    your medication.

                                  ERICA
                    Are you going to tell my Mom?

                    I swear I don t want to. But *
                    there s this team of lawyers in the 
                    back who would break my legs and I *

                    but for a girl my age they re still 
                    pretty hot.*

      This coaxes a smile from Erica. Melissa gently smooths back 
      the girl s unkempt hair.

                                    MELISSA (CONT D)
                    The doctor will be over in a few, 
                    okay?

      As she steps away, Erica lies back, allowing her eyes to 
      close. She doesn t notice when TWO HANDS take hold of the 
      gurney, pushing it out of the emergency room.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - DAY1010

      Erica opens her eyes, watching the empty white-walled 
      corridor go by. She turns to look up at who s pushing her, 
      but A HAND comes down to keep her face forward. 

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Lie still.

      The gurney wheels through two double doors.

      INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE - DAY1111

      Erica sits up, seeing her reflection in the metallic surface 
      of the morgue drawers. She spins to find Derek casually 
      holding up a PILL BOTTLE to read from the label.

                    have a seizure, don t you?

      He moves closer, his fingers skirting the bedside. She gazes *
      into his eyes, seeing odd flecks of BRILLIANT RED in the 
      otherwise dark irises.

                                  ERICA

      Derek reaches his left hand down to her bare ankle. She

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY1313

      The bell RINGS sending students rushing out of class. Jackson 
      goes right for Lydia, grabbing her by the arm.

      He starts toward her with barely restrained rage. Frightened, 
      she backs into a locker.

                    Nothing happened to you. It s like--
                    it s like you re immune.

                    It s you. Whatever it is--blood, 
                    saliva, whatever soul-killing 
                    substance is running through your 
                      veins--you did this to me. You 
                    ruined it for me.

      She gazes at him in bewildered shock.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    You ruin everything.

      Still shaking with anger, he finally backs away, leaving her 
      alone at the locker, breathless and frightened.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1215.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/GIRL S BATHROOM - DAY1414

      Lydia huddles inside a stall, trying to stop the flow of 
      tears. Forcing the sobs down, she blots her eyes with a 
      handful of toilet paper. Then she sees something odd...

      A PAIR OF BARE FEET. Just outside the stall, they re oddly 
      dirty and clearly male.

                                  LYDIA
                    Hello? This is the Girl s Room.

      No response. Lydia reaches her hand up to the lock on the 
      stall door. She pauses, gazing at the two feet. Just standing 
      there. As if waiting for her to--

      Lydia yanks the door open. But no one is there. Just an empty 
      bathroom.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY1515

      The door clicks open and Lydia steps into the deserted 
      hallway. She turns, catching a glimpse of a DARK FIGURE 
      rounding the corner at the end of the corridor.  

      She sees him from behind and only for a moment, but she spots 
      the bare feet. Stepping around the corner, Lydia catches 
      another glimpse and this time, he looks oddly like-- 

      Peter Hale. 

      As the figure continues down the hall, Lydia follows from a 
      distance.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOBBY - DAY1616

      Turning the corner into the lobby, Lydia pauses when she sees 
      the bare-footed man standing in front of one of the trophy 
      cases, his hand pressed against the glass.

      After a moment, the figure peels his hand away and walks off. 
      Lydia follows, but when she looks down the other hall, no one 
      is there. 

      Walking back to the trophy case, she sees the handprint 
      fading away to reveal an old BASKETBALL TROPHY. 

      The name on the plate reads: Peter Hale.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CAFETERIA - DAY1717

      Stiles whips through the cafeteria to one large table solely 
      occupied by one large student: BOYD.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1216.

      Boyd pulls out a set of KEYS from his pocket and holds them 
      up. As Stiles reaches out, Boyd closes his fist over them.

                                  BOYD

                    No, I think I m recalling it now. 
                    But maybe I got it confused with 
                    forty?

      He puts another twenty on the table. Boyd doesn t even blink.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Come on, dude. Have you seen the 
                    piece of crap Jeep I drive?*

                    You seen the piece of crap bus I 
                    take?

      Finally, Stiles drops another ten on the table. Boyd turns 
      his hand over, keys now held in his palm for Stiles to take.

      He steps away from Boyd s lone table and rushes back to 
      another where Scott sits.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1217.

                    after work and we ll meet at the *
                    rink. Cool?

      But Scott doesn t seem to hear him. Focusing on the sounds 
      around him, the multitude of heartbeats, his eyes gravitate 
      to the cafeteria doors.

      Stiles follows his gaze to the doors which slowly push open. 
      The din and noise quiets around them. 

      The ENTIRE CAFETERIA seems to turn their heads almost 
      simultaneously as--

      Long, toned legs step through the threshold. A figure passes 
      through the crowd, catching every eye.

      The flash of a bare midriff sends jaws dropping--guys and 
      girls--as the stunning figure approaches the counter.

      A HAND reaches out to the selections of fruit. A red apple is 
      chosen and a dollar drops in front of the Cashier. Even she 
      looks awestruck.

      At the table next to Scott s, Lydia turns around.

                                  LYDIA
                    What. The holy hell. Is that?*

      Scott rises to get a better look.

                                  SCOTT
                    That s Erica.

      Turning from the cashier, Erica lets the stares fall on her. 
      Hair flowing back from now flawless skin, she takes a 
      delicate bite of the apple and heads for the cafeteria doors.

      Wide-eyes following her as she leaves, only one person is not 
      astonished by Erica s new appearance.

      Jackson. 

      Teeth clenched, he stares after her with a palpable rage. 
      Knowing there s only one way this transformation could have 
      happened.

      Scott moves for the exit to follow Erica with Stiles right on 
      his heels.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1218.


      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY1818

      The doors clatter open to the parking lot. Scott and Stiles 
      rush out of the school just in time to see a very disturbing 
      sight--

      Erica sliding into the passenger seat of a black Camaro.

      Behind the wheel, Derek locks eyes with Scott. With a slight 
      smile turning the corners of his lips, he hits the gas, 
      FLOORING it out of the lot.

      FADE IN:

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT1919

      Under the sound of BARKING DOGS in the back of the clinic, 
      Scott absentmindedly cleans around medical supplies. He picks 
      up a jar as he wipes the counter underneath it and barely 
      notices as it slips right out of his hand.

      The CRASH spins him around. 

      With a sigh, he bends down to clean up the pieces. Then 
      notices his boss, Dr. Deaton, kneeling to help.

                                  DEATON
                    Why do I get the feeling you ve got 
                    a lot on your mind?

                                  SCOTT
                    Sorry. It just kind of slipped 
                    through my fingers.
                          (to himself)
                      Everything s slipping through my 
                    fingers.

                                  DEATON
                    Now that sounds like a far too 
                      world-weary thing for a teenager to 
                    say.

                                  SCOTT
                    Sorry.

                                  DEATON
                    You might want to try a different 
                      perspective. This is actually just 
                    entropy at work.

      Wiping the shattered pieces into a dustpan, Deaton holds it 
      up for Scott to take a look.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    And this is actually more the way 
                    of the universe than that.
                          (he nods to the unbroken 
                            jars on the counter)
                    But it doesn t necessarily mean 
                    it s falling apart. It s just 
                    changing shape.

                    Exactly.

      He dumps the glass fragments into the trash and turns to go.

                                  SCOTT
                    Hey Doc? Are we ever going to talk 
                    about...

      Deaton leans in with an inquisitive raise of his eyebrows.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    That thing... that we never kind of 
                    had a chance to talk about?

                    Ah, yes. We never did talk about 
                    it, did we? Now is definitely a

      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT2020

      Allison grabs her coat while Lydia waits on the bed for her. 
      A knock comes at her open door.

                    know how this might sound, but we 
                    need you to keep on eye on her.

      They glance to Lydia who snaps a picture of herself with her 
      phone and then turns it around to admire it.

      A door swings open and Stiles pulls the key that he got from

      inside, Stiles hits the LIGHTS revealing an empty ice rink.

      Slivers of ice kick up toward them as Lydia hurtles past. 
      Displaying a superior level of skill, she spins, whipping 
      around as Stiles tries to keep up.

      Watching her, Stiles slows with a look of surprise. Lydia is, 
      in fact, amazing. Soaring by him, she toe picks into a double 
      flip jump and--

      Lands perfectly. 

      For the first time in a long time, Lydia begins to smile. 
      Losing herself in the moment, in the speed and effortlessness 
      of ice skating. Finally, she slows to meet Stiles.

      Just by her skate, she finds a single PURPLE FLOWER PETAL 
      lying on the ice. She reaches down to pick it up, staring at

                                    ALLISON
                    This one s normal.

      She glances up, realizing the word she used.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                      I mean--that s not what I meant.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s okay.

      He gently takes the photo strip from her and tears off this 
      last photo for her.

                                    ALLISON
                    Thanks.

      INT. ICE RINK - NIGHT2323

      Holding the purple petal between her fingers, Lydia skates 
      forward, eyes on the ice.

      A few feet away, she finds another petal. She slowly skates 
      toward it and then to another, discovering a trail of the 
      petals leading to an impossible sight... 

      A PURPLE WOLFSBANE FLOWER growing right out of the ice.

      Shocked, she stares at it for a moment. When she bends down 
      to examine the flower, she notices a strange SHADOW just 
      beside it. Something beneath the frosty glaze on the ice. 
      Lydia wipes away the frost to see--

      PETER HALE.

      Underneath the ice, eyes wide in fear, he opens his mouth to 
      scream.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1226.

      But it s Lydia who SCREAMS, a terrified SHRIEK piercing the 
      arena.

      Scott and Allison look up at the sound of screaming. A second 
      later, they re racing toward the entrance to the rink where--

      INT. ICE RINK - NIGHT2525

      Out on the ice, Stiles cradles Lydia in his arms. He looks up 
      to Allison and Scott as Lydia continues her terrified 
      SHRIEKING.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY2626

      Catching her reflection in a small mirror hanging inside her 
      locker, Erica smiles at herself, loving her new look. But 
      then her smile fades. She takes in a breath, sensing a 
      familiar scent. She turns around.

      Scott stands in front of her, a dead serious look in his 
      eyes.

                                  SCOTT
                    Two s not enough for Derek. I know 
                    he needs at least three. So who s 
                    next?

                                  ERICA
                    Why s there have to be a next when 
                    we ve already got you?

      She approaches, meeting him in the middle of the corridor.

                                  SCOTT
                    Who s next?

                                  ERICA
                    You know, I never knew what I 
                    looked like during a seizure until 
                    someone took a video of me once and 
                    put it online.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t care.

                                  ERICA
                    It happened during class. I started 
                    seizing at my desk. Everyone s 
                    saying they should put something in 
                    my mouth until some genius reads 
                    the card on my key ring which tells 
                    you not to because it could break

      Now Scott is listening.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    And everyone starts laughing. You *
                    know, the only good thing about 
                    seizures was that I never 
                      remembered them. Until some *
                    brilliant jerkoff has to go put a 
                    camera in everybody s phone.

      She comes closer. Scott backs into the wall. She puts her 
      hands up, trapping him.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    But look at me now.

      Scott, however, looks past her to Allison who watches them.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    Oh, that s right. You only have 
                    eyes for her. 

      Grabbing her wrists, he pulls her hands from the wall, 
      pushing her back. Roughly. Which she seems to like.

      When he turns again, however, Allison is gone.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON S ROOM - DAY2727

      Sunlight shines through the bedroom window over a pair of 
      jeans lying on the floor. Victoria Argent pauses, picks them 
      up and folds them neatly on Allison s bed. 

      Glancing around, she notices something on the desk.

      A small piece of paper sticks out from the middle of one of 
      the school books. Victoria eases the book open and finds a 
      NOTE between the pages. It reads:

      Because I love you.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/KITCHEN - DAY2828

      Calmly entering the kitchen, Victoria walks over to the 
      counter and draws a particularly sharp KNIFE from the wood 
      block.

      She gazes at the blade and then, almost casually, slices it 
      right across her forearm.

      With barely a reaction, she holds up her forearm to the 
      light, watching the blood drip down her skin.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1229.

      Gauze pressed to the wound, Melissa McCall glances up to 
      Victoria.

                                  VICTORIA 
                    This is so embarrassing.

                                    MELISSA 
                    Not at all. I ve seen far worse 
                    come through these doors. We keep a 
                    pair of bolt cutters in the back.

                    what they re for.

                                  VICTORIA 
                    Let me guess. Something to do with 
                    men and their egos?

                    Oh, I don t need an anesthetic.

                                    MELISSA 
                    Are you serious?

      Victoria nods to the needle. So Melissa goes for it. Victoria *

                    I m sure he was pretty devastated 
                    by the whole break-up.

      Allison approaches, sitting down at the table behind Scott s. 
      They face away from each other, but manage to speak 
      discreetly.

      His silence answers the question. Unable to look at each 
      other, they continue their secret conversation.

      Voice cracking as the worry begins to really hit her, she 
      gets up to leave. Scott moves to follow her. But Stiles darts 
      in to grab him.

      EXT. HALE HOUSE - DAY3232

      Out of the gray mist hovering over the woods, Jackson slowly 
      approaches the Hale House. He glances up at the windows, 
      seeing only shards of broken glass.

      Taking the steps slowly, he reaches the porch, almost at the 
      door. But then, head held low, he speaks softly...

                    Derek. I know you can hear me. You 
                    owe me an explanation. I want to 
                    know why it didn t work. I want to 
                    know what I m supposed to do. You

      But no response comes. Jackson reaches a tremulous hand to 
      the door knob.

      Bennett s body lies on a charred table, dead eyes staring out 
      with a look of terror in them.

      EXT. BOYD S HOUSE - DAY3434

      Stiles s Jeep skids to a halt at the curb. He jumps out and 
      rushes to the front porch of Boyd s home where he rings the 
      bell. Then knocks. Then rings the bell again.

      Stepping to the side, he peers in through the windows.

                                  STILES
                    Boyd? Boyd!

      Stiles hops down from the porch and heads through a side-gate 
      toward the rear of the house. Before he reaches the back 
      door, the gate SLAMS shut turning him around to face--

      Erica holds up the STARTER to Stiles s Jeep, wires dangling 
      off it. With a smile, she swings a fist up to his cheek, 
      knocking him out.

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/WAITING AREA - NIGHT3535

      A SECURITY ALARM blares throughout the clinic. Dogs howl in 
      the background, being driven crazy by the noise.

      The front door clatters open and Deaton rushes inside to type 
      a code on the keypad. The bleating alarm stops. He glances 
      about. Everything in the front seems fine.

      IN THE EXAMINING ROOM - he finds something else. Bennett s 
      body lying on the steel table.

      INT. ICE RINK - NIGHT3737

      With only a single light above illuminating the rink, Boyd 
      fires up the ice resurfacer. Spinning the wheel, he turns it 
      around and then stops.

      Scott walks across the ice toward him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Boyd!

      But the boy looks away, turning the wheel again. He sets off 
      on the resurfacer.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                          (calling out)
                    I just want to talk.

      Boyd ignores him, slowly cleaning the ice. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Come on, Boyd, please.

      But he won t even glance back as Scott follows behind.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Did Derek tell you everything? And 
                    I m not just talking about going 
                      out-of-control on full moons. I 
                    mean everything.

      Finally, Boyd eases down on the brake, slowing to a stop.

                                  BOYD
                    He told me about the hunters.

                                  SCOTT
                    And that s not enough for you to 
                    say no?

      Boyd gives a shrug. Gazing down at the ice, he can see the 
      shadow--almost a reflection--of his own large frame.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Whatever he promised you, it s not 
                    worth it. Whatever you want, 
                    there s other ways to get it.

      Boyd turns off the machine.

                    I swear, though. If you want *

                    That hurts, Scott.

      Derek stands at the entrance to the rink, Isaac and Erica 
      right behind him.

                      personally.

      Isaac and Erica move onto the ice, flanking Scott like attack 
      dogs preparing for the kill.

      Scott holds his hands up in a placating gesture, taking 
      another step back as Isaac and Erica circle him.

      But instead of another step back, Scott goes down, a CLAWED 
      HAND CRACKING into the ice. From a crouched pose, he snaps 
      his head up to reveal himself transformed into a werewolf.

      INT. ICE RINK - NIGHT3838

      Isaac SMASHES down onto the ice and goes sliding across it. 
      Launching himself back onto his feet, he snarls through his 
      fangs.

      Erica hurtles across the rink toward Scott. But with 
      acrobatic precision, Scott digs his claws into the ice and 
      kicks out at her, sending her flipping into the air.

      Derek watches the wolves circle and fight, silently pleased 
      by the vicious attacks they launch on each other.

                                  SCOTT
                    Don t you get it? He s not doing 
                    this for you. He s just adding to 
                    his own power. It s all about him.

      Laid out on the ice, an injured Erica and Isaac glance to 
      each other, now no longer nearly as confident.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    You feel like he s giving you some 
                    kind of gift, when all he s really *

                    It s true. It is about power.*

      Derek walks across the ice and with each step he seems to 
      grow. Eyes turning a BRILLIANT RED, fangs snapping out from 
      his gums, claws unsheathing from fingertips.

      Scott scrambles into a retreat, but Derek moves like 
      lightning. He grabs him by the back of his jacket.

      The two wolves go up, SNARLING AND SNAPPING at each other s 
      throats. But Derek is the Alpha. And he proves it.

      He slashes Scott s side with his claws and then with the full 
      weight of his power behind him, lifts him up over his head 
      and SLAMS him down onto the ice. 

      SHARDS and CHUNKS fly up around the boy. Blood at his lips, 
      Scott is down for the count. 

      Teeth clenched, Derek looks down at him with pity and slowly 
      backs away.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1241.

      Pushing himself up, Scott blinks away the blur to see Boyd 
      now standing over him.

                                  SCOTT
                    You don t want it. You don t want 
                    to be like them.

                    You re right. I want to be like 
                    you.

      Boyd lifts up his shirt to reveal a blood crusted WOUND at 
      his side. He s already been bitten.

      Scott slowly rests his head back down on the ice, watching 
      the canted view of not two but three new werewolves walking 
      away with their Alpha.

      EXT. ALLEY WAY - NIGHT3939

      A lone dumpster sits in the dimly lit alley. SUDDEN BANGING 
      and pounding comes from inside, accompanied by MUFFLED 
      GRIPES.

      The LID clatters open and arms fly over the edge as a gasping 
      Stiles, covered in garbage, pulls himself out.

      The back gate slides up and Scott staggers inside the 
      darkened Clinic. He leans against the waiting area s gated 
      border to take a look at the GASH in his side.

      Deaton steps out of the shadows. Past him, Bennett s body

      Under the glow of his PORSCHE HEADLIGHTS, Jackson peers down 
      at a grouping of lacrosse balls on the grass.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 203" PINK  1/10/1242.

      A glazed over look in his eyes, he scoops up a ball with his 
      lacrosse stick.

      Turning with sudden speed, he fires the lacrosse ball at a 
      HOOP TARGET. It goes right through, a perfect shot. Jackson 
      picks up another ball. Then another and another, launching 
      them as hard as he can at the target. 

      Interestingly, every single ball makes it through. However, 
      gripped in a breathless fury, Jackson doesn t seem to even 
      notice his stunning success rate.

      Even when he finishes, tossing the lacrosse equipment into 
      the trunk of the Porsche, his focus seems elsewhere.

      INT. JACKSON S CAR - NIGHT4242

      Jackson slumps into the driver s side and turns the car on. 
      But when he puts his foot to the pedal, the wheels spin, back 
      tires kicking up mud.

      He shifts to DRIVE, trying to move forward instead. Still 
      nothing. The engine REVS louder and louder.

                                    JACKSON
                    Come on!

      SLAMMING the steering wheel with his fists, he gets out.

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT4343

      Gripping the bumper, Jackson tries to push the car. Straining 
      angrily, his feet slip and he goes down, landing face-first 
      in the mud.

      Rising in absolute fury, Jackson grabs the rear of the car 
      and lifts it right off the ground.

      The car SLAMS back down, out of the mud. 

      Gasping, Jackson looks at his hands in astonishment. Then, 
      fingers slowly curling into fists, he gives a breathless 
      laugh, smiling at the display of strength. 

      Strength that can only be supernatural.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
