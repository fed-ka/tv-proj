            In response to a Starfleet order 
            we are in the Xendi Sabu star 
            system having rendezvoused with 
            a Ferengi vessel which has 
            requested a meeting. Although...

            appropriate signals to the Ferengi 
            three days ago, they have so far 
            responded only with the message: 
            "Stand by, Enterprise."

            to their vessel, inviting us now 
            to officially take possession of 
            the Stargazer. They will stand

            Picard was guilty of falsifying
