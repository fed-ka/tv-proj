THE FRONT SEAT, WITH RAHEL AND GAGE
GAGE is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly
yelling to be let out. The seat, dash, and floorboards are
littered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar
crud. These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in
this station wagon, and the wagon looks it.
RACHEL
Decided to wake up and see what home
looks like, huh?
She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just
wearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old.
THE LIVING ROOM
NIGHT
There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in
here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's
going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers'
cartons stacked all over the place.
LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned
tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first
night in the new place will understand.
He finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room. He
sits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket,
and lights one. He drops the spent match in the empty can, and
taps into the can during the scene.
SOUND: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the far side of
the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown.
RACHEL (crossing to LOUIS)
Kids are asleep, doc.
LOUIS
Great.
He hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just
two good people in all the big darkness of their new house.
RACHEL
You're not really going over to have a
beer with that old guy, are you?
LOUIS
Well, I've got a million questions about
the area, and---
RACHEL
---and you'll end up doing a free
consultation on his arthritis or urinary
problems and---
LOUIS
Did you see his shirt?
RACHEL (giggles)
Sure. Bruce Springsteen.
LOUIS
I really do have a million questions
about the area...but the thing I'm
really curious about is how come this
octogenarian Yankee is decorating the
slumped remains of his pecs with the
Boss.
She laughs.
THE PORCH, WITH JUD
The Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the
headphones casually around his neck, like a kid.
JUD
Well, come on up and have a beer.
THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT
LOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with
some cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS.
JUD
You need a glass?
LOUIS
Not at all.
JUD
Good for you.
LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught.
LOUIS
God, that's fine.
JUD
Ain't it just? The man who invented
beer, Louis, that man was having a
prime day for himself.
LOUIS
What were you listening to?
JUD
Allman Brothers.
LOUIS
What?
JUD
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were
good before drugs and bad luck caught
up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the
Walkman's PLAY button.
SOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats.
LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.
JUD
I'm sorry. Wait.
He turns it down.
JUD
Try that.
LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments.
It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot
Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off.
LOUIS
Nice.
JUD
I like rock and roll. No...I guess
that's too mild. I love it. Since
my ears started to die out on me,
it's the only music I can really hear.
And since my wife died...I dunno, some-
times a little rock and roll fills up
night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause)
One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope
your time here will be a happy one.
LOUIS (great sincerity)
Thank you, Mr. Crandall.
He drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable
silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look
toward:
THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)
One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are
little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too--
sweeps by in a blast of air.
THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
LOUIS (wincing)
Jesus!
JUD (lights a cigarette)
That's one mean road, all right--you
remember that path your wife commented on?
LOUIS
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
JUD
That road--and those Orinco trucks--
are the two main reasons it's there.
LOUIS
What's at the end of it?
JUD (smiles)
Another day--after you get settled in a
bit. Meantime, doc---
Here JUD raises his glass in a toast.
JUD (continues)
Here's to your bones.
LOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S.
LOUIS
And yours.
They drink.
A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU
DAY
Written on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN
JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!
THE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a
few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape.
We look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL,
climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a
Gerrypak.
THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN
NIGHT
There are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on
them. Guess dinner was burned.
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen
table. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is
putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and
tweezers. He's wearing glasses.
ELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown. She watches him for awhile.
LOUIS (not looking around)
Hi, babe.
ELLIE
Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there
because of the road, isn't it?
LOUIS looks around at her, surprised.
ELLIE
That's what I think. I heard
Missy Dandridge tell Mom when
Church was fixed he wouldn't
cross the road so much.
LOUIS
Well, it's always better to take
precautions--but I'm sure Church
will be all right, honey...
JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR
RACHEL is coming along with some dirty dishes. She hears voices
and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid.
ELLIE (voice)
No he won't! Not in the end! He won't
be all right in the end no matter how
you fix 'im!
LOUIS AND ELLIE
Ellis has started to cry.
ELLIE
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
LOUIS
Lovey...Church might be still alive when
you're in a high school...and that's a
very long time.
ELLIE
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems
short. I think the whole thing about
pets dying s-s-sucks!
Poor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms
and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort.
LOUIS
If it was up to me I'd let Church live
to be a hundred...but I don't make up
the rules.
ELLIE (muffled)
Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's
not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get
His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not
mine! Not--
She breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and
forth.
THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL
She is crying silently.
ELLIE'S BEDROOM
NIGHT
She is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. An oblong shaft of
light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. She's asleep
with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her
mouth.
THE DOORWAY, WITH RACHEL
RACHEL looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly
closes the door.
LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM
NIGHT
LOUIS is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the
bed. There a number of medical books scattered around him and he's
making notes from one as RACHEL comes in.
RACHEL
She's finally asleep.
LOUIS
She was a little over-excited,
that's all. Poor kid.
RACHEL
It was that place. That creepy cemetery
up in the woods. Whatever disease the
kids in this town have got, I don't want
Ellie to catch it.
LOUIS
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
RACHEL
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight,
crying as if her heart would break?
Here she is thinking Church is going to
die.
It should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, RACHEL is
much more upset than ELLIE was. LOUIS slowly puts his notebook
aside and caps his pen.
LOUIS
Rachel...someday Church is going to
die.
RACHEL (whirls on him)
That is hardly the point! Church is
not going to die today, or tomorrow--
Never mind. I can see you don't have
the slightest idea what I'm talking about.
She stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. LOUIS follows. She goes
in and slams the door. He goes for the knob.
LOUIS
Rachel--!
SOUND: CLICK OF THE LOCK.
LOUIS stares at the door, bewildered and upset.
LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM
The headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see LOUIS
and RACHEL asleep, each as far over to his/her own side as he/she
can get, with a big empty space in the middle.
Lights and TRUCK SOUNDS slowly fade.
GAGE
MORNING
Cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way
across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of
the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon.
Now he scoops up a handful and throws them.
THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE
Splat! Eggs on the serving plate of toast.
ELLIE
Yee-uck! Gross!
THE KITCHEN, A WIDER SHOT
RACHEL is at the sink, doing dishes (we see the blackboard with
its message near her).
LOUIS comes in, wearing a sport-coat and slacks, ready for his
first day on the job...and ELLIE is in a pretty first day of
school dress.
LOUIS
He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is
going to be beyond him for a few years.
BY THE KITCHEN DOOR
Here is the cat-carrier with CHURCH inside it. He waows unhappily.
THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE AND GAGE
ELLIE gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier.
ELLIE
I don't want him to get his nuts
cut, daddy! What if he dies?
RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK
LOUIS looks shocked and amused by ELLIE'S colorful choice of
words.
LOUIS
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
ELLIE
ELLIE
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a
operation!
RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK
LOUIS tries to kiss RACHEL'S mouth. She turns her head slightly so
he gets her cheek instead. She's still mad. LOUIS'S amusement
dies.
RACHEL
Honey, Church will be fine.
ELLIE, BY THE CAT CARRIER
ELLIE
But what if he dies and has to
go to the Pet Sematary?
LOUIS AND RACHEL, BY THE SINK
She gives him a look as if to say: "There! Now do you understand
what you did?"
RACHEL
Don't be silly. Church is not going
to die.
LOUIS
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the
road's a lot more dangerous than the
operation. Church will be just the same.
Well--almost the same--and we won't have
to worry about him getting turned into
catburgers by one of those damn Orinco
trucks.
At this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny way--she's
actually angered by LOUIS'S reference to catburgers--but under the
anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be
shocked by a dirty joke. For RACHEL, that's just what death is.
RACHEL
That's enough of that kind of talk!
LOUIS
I just said--
RACHEL
I know what you just said. Ellie,
clear your place.
ELLIE goes slowly back to the table.
ELLIE (sets the plate down)
I'm scared. What if school here isn't
like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want
to go h-h-home!
ELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face.
THE KITCHEN, A NEW ANGLE (FEATURES LOUIS AND RACHEL)
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they go to the table to comfort ELLIE.
RACHEL
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be
excused. Go and wash your face.
LOUIS
And Church will be fine.
ELLIE (anxious)
Do you promise, Daddy?
LOUIS
Well, honey...you know that...
RACHEL
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
the little girl her promise.
LOUIS (reluctantly)
Church will be fine. I promise.
ELLIE
Yayyyy!
She runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too.
RACHEL
Thank you, Louis.
LOUIS
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some-
thing should go wrong while he's under
the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot,
but it happens--you explain to her.
He gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and
a little frightened.
GAGE
GAGE (conversationally)
Here, Durch!
He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and
throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier.
THE CAT-CARRIER
CHURCH is close to the mesh, looking out. Scrambled eggs hit the
mesh, driving him back, surprised.
THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA
THE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will
seem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after
Sirhan shot Bobby.
As the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by
STEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student
nurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified.
LOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between
onlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and
pulsing brain tissue beneath.
There's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the
blanket is having hysterics.
GIRL
Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic!
LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
Get her out. Get them all out.
CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl.
GIRL (struggling)
No! No! He can't die! He can't die!
THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from
STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes.
CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out
the door.
LOUIS
Steve, get the ambulance over here
right now. He's got to go to EMMC.
STEVE
The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco
downtown, getting--
LOUIS
--a new muffler, oh shit--
PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of
his mouth. He begins to seizure.
One of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the
student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall.
CHARLTON rushes over.
CANDYSTRIPER
I can't look at it...I can't stand it...
CHARLTON (slaps her)
Yes you by God can. Go get the hard
stretcher!
As they start away, one helping the other down the hall, and as
CHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket,
THE CAMERA DROPS TO LOUIS AND STEVE.
LOUIS
Help me hold him.
They hold PASCOW'S spasming body.
STEVE
It wouldn't matter if we did have
the ambulance.
LOUIS
It wouldn't matter if we had the SST.
PASCOW begins to quiet.
LOUIS
He's going. Steve, go call the motor-
pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.
CHARLTON
It won't--
LOUIS
I know it won't! But let's for God's
sake do it by the rules!
She leaves. LOUIS is alone with PASCOW. CHARLTON has drawn the
drapes, so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary
privacy.
LOUIS AND PASCOW, A CLOSER SHOT
LOIS
There wasn't even supposed to be a
sprain today, my friend--that's what
I told her.
PASCOW'S fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps
LOUIS'S right wrist. The dying man pulls him slowly but
relentlessly down, until their faces are only inches apart.
PASCOW
...Pet Sematary...
LOUIS recoils, breaking the grip of the hand...but he cannot quite
snap the grip of those bright dying eyes. Blood leaks from
PASCOW'S mouth.
LOUIS (whispers)
W-What did you say...?
PASCOW struggles hard to speak again. At first he can only gurgle.
PASCOW
It's not the real cemetery...
(Long pause) The soil of a man's
heart is stonier, Louis...a man
grows what he can...and tends it.
LOUIS leans forward again, terrified, yet needing to know.
LOUIS
How do you know my name?
PASCOW (gurgling)
I'll come...to you.
LOUIS grabs PASCOW'S bloody shoulder.
LOUIS (low but urgent)
Dammit, how do you know my name?
HALLWAY ENTRANCE TO RECEPTION, WITH STEVE
STEVE
Louis, they're sending a--
LOUIS AND PASCOW
PASCOW begins to spasm again.
LOUIS (snaps)
Help me!
PASCOW spews more blood as STEVE kneels beside LOUIS.
THE MAIN INFIRMARY HALLWAY
CHARLTON is pushing along your basic MEDCU goodie-cart, covered
with emergency life-saving gear.
LOUIS, STEVE, PASCOW
PASCOW'S spasms are weakening.
LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
Never mind. He's going.
PASCOW'S hand comes up and paws at LOUIS'S shirt, leaving a bloody
handprint. Then it falls limply back. PASCOW is dead.
LOUIS
Steve, will you get a sheet to cover
him with?
STEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body
of VICTOR PASCOW. He closes the eyes.
THE CAR, WITH LOUIS
He still looks shocked by the tragedy. The dying man's bloody
handprint is partly visible on LOUIS'S shirt in spite of his
sport-coat.
LOUIS abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of
the road.
LOUIS, BEHIND THE WHEEL
LOUIS
He said my name. I heard it. He
said my name.
He stares blankly through the windshield.
THE CREED BEDROOM
NIGHT
LOUIS and RACHEL are asleep, each on his/her own side of the big
double. THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON LOUIS.
SOUND: Loud, hollow BANG. It's very loud--loud enough to wake the
dead.
LOUIS sits up. Beside him, RACHEL sleeps on. LOUIS'S eyes widen in
terror as he stares at:
THE DOORWAY, WITH PASCOW
He's exquisitely dead. Now pallid as well as smashed up.
PASCOW
Come on, doc. We got places to go.
LOUIS
He is in terror...but he is also in a state of near-trance.
PASCOW
PASCOW
Come on, doc--don't make me tell you
twice.
LOUIS
He glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud
voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast
asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW...and then gets out of bed.
He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms.
PASCOW
He turns and leaves the doorway.
LOUIS
He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at:
THE BED, LOUIS'S POV
RACHEL is sleeping as before, and LOUIS himself is also in bed
asleep, although his rest is uneasy...as if he's having a bad
dream.
THE DOORWAY, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS (relieved)
Oh. Thank God.
PASCOW (Voice)
Hurry up, doc.
THE KITCHEN
LOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the
shed/garage. This door stands open. LOUIS pauses by it.
PASCOW (low)
Come on, doc...
LOUIS goes into:
THE SHED/GARAGE
The station wagon is a dark hulk. LOUIS crosses to it and stands,
perplexed.
PASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him. LOUIS
turns... and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S
mutilated face.
PASCOW
Let's go, doc.
LOUIS (moans)
I don't like this dream.
PASCOW
Who said you were dreaming?
He begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS
follows him.
LOUIS, IN BED
His eyes snap open. He's in his own bedroom. As he sits up THE
CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that he's in bed alone; the
covers on RACHEL'S side are thrown back.
After the initial confusion and fear, LOUIS looks deeply relieved;
he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and
realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all.
RACHEL (calls)
You up, doc?
LOUIS
Getting there.
RACHEL
I got eggs down here!
LOUIS
Good d--
He throws the covers back and freezes.
LOUIS'S FEET, LOUIS'S POV
They are covered with mud and pine needles. The sheets are greased
with woods-muck.
LOUIS, CU
Utter terror.
THE LAUNDRY CHUTE, CU
LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and dump a bundle of sheets into the
chute.
LOUIS, IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL
He's naked but for a towel around his waist. He's obviously fresh
from the shower.
He starts down to the bedroom to dress.
BLACK. And on it a third title card: CHURCH.
Over this the SOUND of a RINGING TELEPHONE.
LOUIS (voice)
Hello?
THE CREED LIVING ROOM
AFTERNOON
There's a bowling match on TV. LOUIS, dressed in his Saturday
afternoon grubs (jeans and a Maine sweatshirt), has the phone to
his ear.
JUD CRANDALL (phone filter)
Louis? 'Fraid you may have a spot of
trouble.
LOUIS (frowning)
Jud? What trouble?
THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD
He's on the phone, looking out his window.
JUD
Did you tell me Rachel took the
kids back to Chicago for a few days?
THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't
go because her old man thinks I'm a
shit and the feeling is heartily re-
ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow
night. Jud, what's this about?
THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD
JUD
Well, there's a dead cat over here on
the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it
might be your daughter's.
THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
THE CREED KITCHEN
MORNING
GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE, in her first-day-of-school
dress, is in her place. LOUIS is sitting at his own place staring,
hypnotized, at the middle of the table, where there is a large
serving dish. On the dish is scrambled eggs, strips of bacon, and
CHURCH'S corpse--staring eyes, bloody ruff and all.
RACHEL (impatiently)
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the
little girl her promise.
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE
It stops. A beat later LOUIS enters the room. He picks it up,
although he already knows it's too late. He listens to the SOUND
of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle,
disgusted.
He starts to dial a number from memory.
JUD (voice)
Louis.
THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH JUD
JUD
When you talk to 'em, not one word
about what we done tonight. 'S'far's
you know, the cat's still fine.
LOUIS, BY THE PHONE
After a moment he lowers it into the cradle.
JUD
JUD
You'll understand. In the meantime,
keep your peace. What we did, Louis,
was a secret thing. Women are supposed
to be the ones who are good at
keeping secrets, but any woman who
knows anything at all would tell you
she's never seen into a man's heart.
The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
Louis--like the soil up there in the
old Micmac burying ground. A man
grows what he can...and tends it.
During this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his
hand on LOUIS'S shoulder.
LOUIS
But--
JUD
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis.
What we done was right. Another time
it might not be, but tonight it was...
at least I hope to Christ it was. Now
you make your call...but not a word
about tonight.
LOUIS, IN THE LIVING ROOM
NIGHT
He's on the phone, smiling and happy.
RACHEL (voice)
You want to talk to the birthday girl?
LOUIS
That'd be real fine.
ELLIE (voice)
Hi...daddy?
LOUIS (sings)
Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday
to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy
birthday to you!
ELLIE (voice)
That was awful, daddy.
LOUIS
Yeah, I know...how are things out
there in Chicagoland?
ELLIE
Fine...except when Mom was airing
Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and
got into Grampa's study and pooped in
Grampa's favorite chair.
LOUIS (grinning broadly)
Way to go, Gage!
ELLIE (voice)
What?
LOUIS
I said that's too bad. What did you
get for presents from Gramma and Grampa?
ELLIE (voice)
Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and
a Chatty Cathy doll...
THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE
She's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas. Her Chatty Cathy is
crooked in one arm. In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio.
ELLIE
...and a Garfield radio! How's Church,
dad? Does he miss me?
THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
The smile fades off his face. It's replaced with a look of
combined guilt and unhappiness. He's looking at his hands, which
are still dark with the dirt from CHURCH'S grave.
LOUIS
Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie.
I haven't seen him this evening, but--
THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE
RACHEL, holding GAGE, sits on the arm of ELLIE'S chair.
ELLIE
Well, make sure you put him down
cellar before you go to bed so he
can't run out in the road and get
greased. And kiss him goodnight for me.
LOUIS (voice)
Yuck! Kiss your own cat!
ELLIE
Want to talk to Gage?
Before he can answer, she puts the phone in GAGE'S hand. ELLIE and
RACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL
encourages him to say a few words.
THE CREED LVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
From the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling.
LOUIS is not listening. His eyes--and his mind--are far away.
CHURCH, ECU
He's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't
notice; THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like he's coming
right down our throats. He's hissing angrily.
LOUIS
He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry. He hits a tool-rack
on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING
NOISE.
ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON, WITH CHURCH
He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as
he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight.
LOUIS
He gets slowly to his feet again. He's getting over his fright but
we can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright.
He goes to the garage door and looks out.
LOUIS (calls)
Church?
THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
He's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there
should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living
room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly
outside. LOUIS uses this latter door now.
THE CRANDALL KITCHEN
LOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table. JUD is at the fridge. JUD
comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens
them.
JUD
I most generally don't start before
noon, but this looks like an exception.
LOUIS
What did we do, Jud?
JUD
Why, saved a little girl from being
unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
LOUIS drinks about half the beer.
LOUIS
I tried to tell myself I buried him
alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets
Felix the Cat. But...
JUD
Wouldn't wash?
LOUIS
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I
see it, and Church was dead. He smells
horrible and he uses his claws, but
he's alive...and I feel like I'm going
crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
JUD
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about
the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids
just called him Stanny B. He was half
Micmac himself.
LOUIS drains his beer.
LOUIS
Can I have another one?
JUD
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
He gets up and goes to the fridge.
JUD, AT THE FRIDGE
JUD
The Micmacs used to bury their dead
up there long before the whites came.
He returns to the table with the beer.
JUD
They buried their dead and for a long
time their dead stayed buried. Then
something happened. Half the tribe died
in a season. The rest moved on. They
said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
LOUIS
Wendigo?
JUD
Spirit of the north country. Not a good
spirit. Wendigos are great liars and
tricksters, according to the stories.
And if one touches you...
JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts.
JUD
Maybe it really was a Wendigo--
I ain't the one to say it wasn't--
or maybe it was just some disease.
Whatever the reason, those that were
left moved on. But they left that
place...the way it is now.
JUD shrugs, and drinks.
JUD'S KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS
LOUIS
You and this old Indian rag-man--
JUD
Stanny B. did for me what I did for
you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't
alone when Spot came back.
JUD AND LOUIS, IN JUD'S KITCHEN
LOUIS
How did your mother take it, Jud?
How did she take it when your dog
came back from the dead?
JUD'S face is a complication. He's lying to LOUIS, certainly--but
is he also lying to himself? Yes, I think so.
JUD
Well, she was a little upset at first,
and that's why I thought you ought to
hold your peace when you talked to
your people last night...you did, didn't
you, Louis?
LOUIS
Yes.
JUD
Why, then, things should be fine.
LOUIS
A little upset is all she was? Because
I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a
little like a nuclear reactor on the
edge of a meltdown.
JUD
She got used to the idea. Spot lived
another four years. He died peacefully
in the night that second time, and I
buried him in the Pet Sematary...where
his bones still lie.
BATHTUB FIXTURES, CU
LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and turn the spigots.
THE BATHROOM, WITH LOUIS
He starts to undress, still looking troubled. We should notice
that the door behind him is firmly shut. The bathroom has no
windows.
THE BATHTUB SPIGOTS
The hot water is steaming. LOUIS'S hands enter the frame and turn
off the faucets. SOUND of LOUIS climbing in.
LOUIS IN THE TUB
A big sigh and an expression of exquisite pleasure. He relaxes in
the hot water. After a few moments he puts a wet washcloth over
his face.
BY THE KITCHEN SINK, WITH RACHEL
RACHEL
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
the little girl her promise.
THE KITCHEN TABLE
GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE is at her place, crying. In
RACHEL'S place sits VICTOR PASCOW, bloody and wrecked. LOUIS sits
in his place. On the platter of bacon and scrambled eggs is
CHURCH'S mangled body.
PASCOW
The door must not be opened. The
barrier must not be crossed.
LOUIS
You don't understand--
THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS
The washrag is slipping, but it still covers his face.
LOUIS (mutters)
--I'm a doctor.
THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE
In attendance: PASCOW, LOUIS, ELLIE, GAGE in his high chair. Lying
in the middle of the table, clotted with dirt and blood, eyes
staring, neck a gory mess of infected wounds, is SPOT. He's also
dotted with clots of scrambled egg and bits of bacon.
PASCOW
Sometimes the dead do more than speak.
Remember, doc.
RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN SINK
RACHEL (with great force)
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Promise me.
Promise me. Promise me.
THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS
The washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are
closed--he's dozing.
LOUIS
Promise...
THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE
To LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD,
his eyes shocked and staring.
JUD (to LOUIS)
You do it for all the best reasons,
but that ain't why. You do it because
it gets hold of you...you do it
because you have to.
LOUIS, IN THE BATHTUB, CU
The washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now. His doze
is deepening; he's started to snore a little.
SOUND: A splash. Something has been dropped into the bath.
LOUIS opens his eyes. Looks puzzled. Looks down. Eyes widen in
shock.
THE BATHWATER, LOUIS'S POV
A very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath,
actually brushing against LOUIS'S chest. Blood has begun to stain
the water.
LOUIS
Turns his head, preparatory to leaping out.
THE TOILET LID, WITH CHURCH
Its mouth yawns open. It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth.
THE BATHROOM
LOUIS leaps from the tub. Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself
frantically. He's grossed out. The cat tries to arch against him
and he hits it. CHURCH falls to the floor, hissing.
LOUIS looks at the closed door.
LOUIS
How the hell did you get in?
He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He
opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once,
LOUIS helps it with his foot.
Then he looks down at:
THE BATHTUB WITH BRER RAT, LOUIS'S POV
LOUIS
Staring at the rat. Over this: THE SOUND OF JET ENGINES.
A DEPLANING AREA
DAY
Lots of people making their way up the jetway.
LOUIS, OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT
He's looking anxiously for his people. In one hand he's got half a
dozen roses. His face lights up.
THE DEPLANING AREA, LOUIS'S POV
Here comes LOUIS'S family. ELLIE is a little ahead. RACHEL is
pushing GAGE in his stroller. ELLIE sees LOUIS and lights up.
ELLIE
Daddy!
She runs for him.
JUST OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT
ELLIE comes belting up to LOUIS, weaving among the deplanees like
a slalom skier. She leaps into his arms. LOUIS swings her
cheerfully.
LOUIS
Hi, sugar!
She smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily.
ELLIE
Daddy, is Church all right?
LOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful.
LOUIS
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping
on the front porch when I left.
ELLIE
Cause I had a bad dream about him.
I dreamed he got hit by a car and
you and Mr. Crandall buried him in
the Pet Sematary.
LOUIS (trying to smile)
That was a silly dream, wasn't it?
ELLIE
Is he really all right?
LOUIS
Yes.
ELLIE
Because you promised.
LOUIS
I know.
RACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face,
good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit
stale.
RACHEL
Want to take your son, doc?
LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic.
LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply.
THE CREED KITCHEN, NIGHT
CHURCH at the door, waiting to be let out. ELLIE does the honors.
CHURCH oils out into the shed/garage. ELLIE closes the door. She
looks distressed. She crosses the kitchen again.
THE CREED LIVING ROOM, NIGHT
RACHEL, in a flannel nightgown, is watching TV. LOUIS is reading a
medical tome and making notes. GAGE, zipped into a warm blanket
suit, is sacking on the couch.
ELLIE (entering)
Can cats have shampoos?
RACHEL
Yes--you have to take them to someone
who grooms animals, though. I think
it's pretty expensive.
ELLIE (still upset)
I don't care. I'll save up my allowance
and pay for it. Church smells bad.
LOUIS
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up
the money, Ellen.
ELLIE
I hate that smell.
LOUIS, CU
He looks both grim and sad--a man discovering that what you pay
for you own, and what you own always comes home to you.
LOUIS
Yes--I hate it, too.
BLACK. And on it, a fourth title card: MISSY DANDRIDGE.
SOUND: A pen scratching over paper.
A STUDY DESK, CU
A single sheet of lined paper is spotlighted by the glow of the
desk-lamp. On it, MISSY'S right hand is just finishing: "Dr. says
Intestinal Cancer. Cannot face this Pain. Sorry."
The hand puts the pen down. It tears the paper in two, leaving
just the half with the message.
THE DANDRIDGE CELLAR, NIGHT
A light comes on and we see a hangman's noose strung over a beam.
It dangles above a kitchen table which has been relegated to
cellar duty.
SOUND: Descending footsteps.
THE NOOSE, CU
SOUND of MISSY climbing onto the table.
Her face enters the frame. She looks very sick. She puts her head
into the noose and rakes it tight at the hyoid bone.
THE CELLAR, WITH MISSY DANDRIDGE
She hangs limply, hands dangling at her sides, above the table,
which now lies upon its side. We can see the note clearly. She
pinned it to the bodice of her housedress.
SOUND: Car engines starting up.
THE BACK SEAT OF THE WAGON
JUD has tilted over in one corner and is snoring. His Walkman
'phones are on and we can hear the tinny sounds of Billy Idol. A
little old man's drool trickles down from one corner of his mouth.
SOUND: ELLEN< crying.
THE FRONT OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE
Tears are spilling freely down ELLIE'S face.
LOUIS
Ellie? What's wrong?
ELLIE
No more chocolate chip cookies.
LOUIS
Huh?
ELLIE
Missy made the best chocolate chip
cookies in the world--even Mom said
so. Now there won't be any more
because she's gonna be dead forever!
She cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair.
TV SCREEN, CU
NIGHT
On it is a scene from "Night of the Living Dead."
NEWSCASTER
Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems
almost beyond doubt: the dead are
returning to eat the living.
ELLIE (voice)
Daddy?
THE CREED LIVING ROOM
NIGHT
There's a VCR on top of the TV; LOUIS has been watching "Night."
Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the TV.
She's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly.
LOUIS
What's up, sugar?
ELLIE
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge
went to heaven?
LOUIS
What?
THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL
She's putting away the last of the supper things. She hears this
and moves toward the living room door to listen. She doesn't look
at all well. Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard.
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE
She's gotten up into his lap.
ELLIE
At school Michael McDowell said she was
gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says
all sewersides fry in hell.
LOUIS
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full
of shit he probably squeaks when he walks,
my dear.
RACHEL, AT THE DOOR
She smiles a little at this.
LOUIS AND ELLIE, IN THE LIVING ROOM
LOUIS
But don't you dare say that.
ELLIE
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you
think?
LOUIS
I don't know, honey. Different people
believe all sorts of different things
happen to us when we die. Some believe
in heaven or hell. Some think we're
born again as little children--
ELLIE
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie
you rented, Audrey Rose.
LOUIS
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but
you get the idea. And some people think
we just wink out...like a candle flame
when the wind blows hard.
ELLIE
Do you believe that?
LOUIS looks toward:
THE LIVING ROOM SOFA, WITH CHURCH, LOUIS'S POV
CHURCH is sleeping.
LOUIS AND ELLIE
LOUIS
I think we go on. I'm not sure
what happens after we die, but yeah--
I have faith in that.
ELLIE
You believe in it.
LOUIS
Oh, faith's a little more than just
believing.
RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN DOOR
Listening intently.
LOUIS AND ELLIE
LOUIS (continues)
I'll tell you what faith is--it's the
evidence of the heart; the assurance
of things not seen.
ELLIE
I don't get it.
LOUIS
Well, here we are, sitting in my
chair. Do you think my chair will
be here tomorrow?
ELLIE
Yeah, sure.
LOUIS
Then you have faith in that. But
we don't know it will be; after all,
some crazed chair-burglar might break
in while we're away and steal it, right?
ELLIE'S giggling.
RACHEL, AT THE DOOR
She's smiling, too...but tears are running down her cheeks.
LOUIS AND ELLIE
LOUIS
But we plan on that chair. We believe
in that chair. And I plan on going on
somehow as Louis Creed, after I die.
I believe I will.
ELLIE (awed)
You have faith in that.
LOUIS
Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that
it is now time for Ellen Creed to get
ready for bed. So buzz.
He gets her off his lap.
ELLIE
I'm not tired!
LOUIS
I'm sure you're not.
ELLIE
Then why do I have to go to bed?
LOUIS
Because your mother and I need
the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
She heads toward the stairs.
LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM
LOUIS is in bed, reading. RACHEL, wearing a robe over her
nightgown, comes in.
RACHEL
I heard you tonight.
LOUIS
I thought maybe you did. I know
you don't approve of the subject
being raised--
RACHEL
That's not true. The subject
scares me. Because of Zelda.
LOUIS puts his book down and looks at her thoughtfully.
LOUIS
Your sister, I know.
RACHEL sits down on the end of the bed. She's clasping her hands
nervously together.
RACHEL
Sometimes you're so good with her,
Louis--so straight with her--that
you make me ashamed of myself.
LOUIS sits up and scoots down the bed to her. He tries to put an
arm around her. She rejects it--but gently.
RACHEL
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you
to Missy's funeral. And that I
blew up when we went to that
silly animal graveyard.
LOUIS
That's forgotten.
RACHEL
Not by me, it isn't. I know how
badly I acted, how unfair I was.
It's just that I..you know.
LOUIS
Yes, I guess I do.
He makes a place for her beside him and hugs her. They lie
silently together for awhile, taking comfort from each other.
RACHEL
I'm going to try to do better.
LOUIS
You're doing fine.
DISSOLVE TO:
BLACK. And on it, a fifth title card: GAGE.
SOUND: An idling truck motor.
A FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN GOLDMAN AND LOUIS
DAY
There are others here, but they are in the b.g., and concentrating
on the scene the old man is making. He's RACHEL'S dad. LOUIS is
sitting in the aisle seat of a pew-like bench. He looks terribly
shattered--they both do, actually. He's staring at the old man as
if he cannot in the least comprehend what he's saying.
IRWIN (continues)
And now look at this!
He gestures toward:
THE FRONT OF THE FUNERAL CHAPEL
DAY
Here, half-buried in floral tributes, is a child-sized coffin.
GAGE'S.
IRWIN AND LOUIS
DAY
IRWIN (weeping)
Run over in the road like a...a
chipmunk!
THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN
IRWIN looks toward:
THE BACK OF THE CHAPEL, WITH RACHEL AND DORY GOLDMAN
They are by the sign-in book. Both are dressed in black. Both look
haggard. But RACHEL looks more than haggard; she looks damned near
insane with grief and horror.
LOUIS AND IRWIN
IRWIN (leaning forward)
With her mother! Where she should be!
As for you, I hope you rot in hell!
In hell, do you hear me?
We should; by now he's screaming his head off.
THE CAB OF THE ORINCO TRUCK
DAY
The driver is whistling. A transistor radio hangs from the rear-
view mirror on a strap. He turns it on. The Ramones. "Sheena."
Hey-ho, let's go.
THE TUCKER'S FOOT
Stamping the pedal closer to the metal.
THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN
IRWIN
You--
But there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words. As
LOUIS sits staring numbly up at him, IRWIN punches him in the
nose. LOUIS sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the
floor.
THE REAR OF THE CHAPEL, FEATURING RACHEL AND DORY
RACHEL screams and starts forward. DORY pulls her back.
RACHEL
Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT!
LOUIS AND IRWIN
LOUIS is getting up groggily. Hs nose is pouring blood.
IRWIN
How do you like that, you son
of a bitch? I should have done
it sooner!
IRWIN punches him in the stomach. LOUIS "oofs" and doubles over.
ANGLE ON THE OTHER MOURNERS
Among them we see STEVE MASTERTON and MARCY CHARLTON.
STEVE (getting up)
Hey!
LOUIS AND IRWIN
LOUIS is slowly straightening up. IRWIN is in a sour frenzy of
glee.
IRWIN
How do you like that? How do--
LOUIS pushes the old man with both hands.
IRWIN GOLDMAN
He goes stumbling and flailing backwards...strikes the coffin...
knocks it off its bier. A SCREAM goes up from the mourners.
RACHEL AND DORY
RACHEL screams. Her mother struggles to hold her but RACHEL easily
breaks free and goes running down the aisle.
ANGLE ON MOURNERS, WITH MARCY AND STEVE
MARCY
Stop them. Right now.
STEVE gets up and goes toward:
THE FRONT OF THE CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN
He's picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and
overturned floral tributes. His suit is wet from spilled water.
He's weeping.
LOUIS has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone. I think
he intends to do the Cool Jerk all over IRWIN GOLDMAN'S puny
little body. IRWIN strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic
pose.
IRWIN
Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll
take y'apart!
As LOUIS wades in, STEVE MASTERTON gets between them...at the last
possible moment.
STEVE
Stop it!
LOUIS swings. STEVE manages to block the punch with his body.
STEVE
Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with
you, Louis? It's your son's funeral,
not a boxing match!
That gets to LOUIS. He drops his fists. That stunned expression
creeps over his face again--that look that says he doesn't have
the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly
have happened.
LOUIS
PASCOW (voice)
The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
doc--
LOUIS turns toward:
THE FRONT PEW, WITH PASCOW AND CHURCH
PASCOW, bloody and ruined in his jogging shorts and muscle shirt,
has the pew to himself...except for CHURCH, who is sitting on his
lap and PURRING.
PASCOW
A man grows what he can...and tends it.
LOUIS, CU
A sense of horrible awareness comes into his face...and then he
covers it with his hands and begins to SOB.
SOUND, COMING UP: A TRUCK MOTOR.
THE CAB OF THE TANKER
The trucker is singing along with the radio.
THE GAS PEDAL
It's closer to the floorboards than ever.
THE FUNERAL CHAPEL
The fight has gone out of IRWIN and STEVE has backed away--but
cautiously. He's ready to jump back in if one or the other goes
mad again. But IRWIN is shuffling toward LOUIS, hands out--
everyone else has gathered in a knot near the front of the chapel.
Among them is RACHEL and her mother, weeping in each others' arms.
IRWIN
I don't know what happened to me.
Louis, please--
LOUIS brushes by him with no acknowledgement that IRWIN even
exists. He kneels down slowly by the coffin and puts his head
against it.
LOUIS (weeping)
I'm sorry, Gage--I'm so sorry,
little hero.
THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS
He's holding the studio portrait in his hands and looking at it
fixedly. The other photos (the good ones, that is; not the
screamers--those, we may assume, exist only in LOUIS'S tortured
memory) are scattered on the table. We only saw a few; there are
actually hundreds.
LOUIS puts the photo down as JUD comes in and crosses to the
fridge. LOUIS'S nose is badly swelled. He also has a black eye.
JUD gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table.
JUD
Your father-in-law packs a wallop,
for an old guy. He and his wife gone
back to Chicago?
LOUIS
No...squatting out there at the
Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures.
He really thinks Rachel's going to go
back with them. Her and Ellie.
JUD
Louis--
The swing door opens. They look toward:
ELLIE
She looks dazed and shocked. There are brown circles under her
eyes, but otherwise her complexion is much too white. She's
wearing fuzzy pj's. She's carrying the picture of her pulling GAGE
on the sled.
JUD AND LOUIS, AT THE TABLE
ELLIE (coming to the table)
I want to go back to my own room.
I can't sleep with mommy. She
keeps stealing the covers.
JUD
What you got there, Ellie?
At first she doesn't want to show him, but JUD is very kind.
JUD (studying it)
Why that's real nice...you pullin'
him on a sled. Bet he liked that,
didn't he?
ELLIE nods. She is starting to cry. JUD is also leaking at the
eyes.
ELLIE (crying)
I used to pull 'im a lot.
LOUIS, looking down at his hands, nods.
ELLIE
I'm going to carry this picture,
Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage
come back.
JUD reacts violently. And LOUIS looks up, dully curious...but
hasn't the thought already passed through LOUIS'S mind? Yes--I
think it has.
JUD
Ellie...God doesn't do things like
that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
ELLIE
He can if He wants to. He can do
anything, just like Inspector Gadget
on TV. But I have to keep things ready
for him, that's what I think. I've got
his picture and I'm going to sit in
his chair--
LOUIS
Ellie--
ELLIE
And I'm going to eat his breakfast
cereal, too, even though it tastes
like boogers. And...and...
She bursts into tears.
JUD
Louis, take care of your little
girl...she needs you.
LOUIS, CU
His face is stricken.
ELLIE'S BEDROOM
NIGHT
LOUIS comes in with ELLIE in his arms. He puts her gently into her
bed and pulls the covers up. She's already mostly asleep.
LOUIS (kisses her)
Good night, Ellie.
ELLIE
G'night daddy.
He starts for the door.
ELLIE, CU
ELLIE
God could take it back if He wanted
to, couldn't He? If He really, really
wanted to? Can I have faith in that?
LOUIS, AT THE DOOR
He stands looking at her for a long time, apparently thinking
about this quite deeply.
LOUIS
Yes--I suppose you can. Good night,
Ellie.
He steps out, closing the door.
ELLIE, IN BED
In some sense comforted--it may be a poison comfort but she surely
doesn't know this--she turns over on her side to go to sleep. We
can see the picture of GAGE under her arm.
THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS
The light here is fairly dim. LOUIS goes down and opens another
door. He pokes his head in.
THE MASTER BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
He reacts first with surprise, then a species of horrified
disgust.
LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BED, LOUIS'S POV
CHURCH is crouched on RACHEL'S sleeping form.
THE BED, A NEW ANGLE
LOUIS comes in and swats the cat a damned good one.
LOUIS (low snarl)
Fuck off, hairball!!
CHURCH, CU
It hisses at him through a mouthful of fangs, its eyes big green
balls...and then it flees. CAMERA FOLLOWS IT out the door.
LOUIS, BY THE BED
RACHEL stirs and mutters thickly, then lies still again...she's
doped to the gills. LOUIS bends over and kisses her gently.
He leaves the room and closes the door behind him.
THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS
He tries the door a couple of times to make sure it's firmly on
the latch (his face wears an expression of "How'd he get in there
in the first place?"). Then he walks down the hall to the stairs.
ON THE STAIRS, CU
The cat is on one of the risers. LOUIS trips over it.
THE KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS AND CHURCH
As LOUIS enters through the swing door from the dining room, JUD
is just letting CHURCH out the back door. As JUD closes the door:
LOUIS (slightly antagonistic)
I thought you'd be gone by now.
JUD
I got you a fresh beer out of the
fridge, Louis.
He indicates the table, where there is indeed a fresh beer.
LOUIS
Jud, I buried my son today and
I'm very tired. I wonder if we
could just--
JUD
You're thinking of things best
not thought of, Louis.
LOUIS
I'm thinking about going to bed.
But he begins pouring the beer into a glass.
JUD
You never asked me if anyone had
buried a person up there in the
Micmac burying ground--
LOUIS'S hand jerks. Beer goes foaming across the kitchen table.
JUD
--but I think the thought
has crossed your mind.
LOUIS
Shit! Look at this mess!
JUD
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
As LOUIS goes to get a cloth to wipe up the mess:
JUD
I know the Micmacs thought it was a
holy place...and then they thought
it was a cursed place. That's why
they moved on.
LOUIS
Because something called a wendigo
soured the ground.
JUD
And because the dead walked.
LOUIS stops sopping and looks at him.
JUD, CU
JUD
Oh, ayuh. It's been done. What you've
been thinking of has been done.
THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
NIGHT
LOUIS is now sitting down, drinking a beer, staring at JUD.
LOUIS
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the
truth, Jud?
JUD
Why...that sometimes dead is better.
That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
LOUIS (bitter)
Tell that to my wife and little girl.
JUD
It ain't your wife and little girl
that's got me worried, Louis.
THE TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA
She's in a hallway in front of a door with LUDLOW SELECTMEN
printed on the frosted glass. After a moment she opens it and goes
in.
JUD (v.o. continues)
...who finally got up enough guts to
talk to the town fathers about it.
She knew it had to be stopped, Louis.
THE SELECTMEN'S OFFICE/SEPIA
MARGIE and four men are grouped around a desk. She's talking;
they're listening. THE CAMERA LAZILY PANS the four men--one, of
course, is JUD as a YOUNG MAN.
JUD (v.o. continues)
She knew it was an abomination.
George Anderson, the town postmaster,
was there...and Alan Purinton...Hannibal
Benson...and me. I was there.
THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
LOUIS
What happened?
THE FRONT HALL, WITH TIMMY
He's burning and laughing.
TIMMY
LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING!
And into the fire he goes, still shrieking and laughing.
THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
JUD (softly)
Sometimes dead is better, Louis.
BLACK. And on it, a sixth title card: THE DEAD WALK.
SOUND BLEEDS IN: JET ENGINES.
A BOARDING GATE, WITH LOUIS AND RACHEL
In the b.g. we can see IRWIN and DORY GOLDMAN waiting by the
jetway with ELLIE as the last few passengers board. RACHEL looks
confused and grief-stricken. She also looks punchy, doped up. I
imagine she's floating on a sea of Valium, and that makes her
easier to deal with. LOUIS'S battle-scars are fading a little.
The GATE AGENT is standing by the jetway with a mike in one hand
and a bunch of boarding passes in the other.
GATE AGENT (concludes)
All passengers should now be aboard.
LOUIS
You better get going, hon.
RACHEL
Oh Louis, I just don't know about
this--
LOUIS
I told you last night--this can be the
start of patching things up with your
folks. If something good doesn't come
of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
RACHEL
Louis, are you sure?
LOUIS
I'm sure.
THE GOLDMANS, WITH ELLIE
ELLIE
I don't want to go to Chicago,
Gramma Dory.
DORY
Why not, darling?
ELLIE
I had a bad dream last night. A
nightmare.
IRWIN (kindly)
About what?
ELLIE
About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage.
DORY and IRWIN exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's
head.
ELLIE
And someone named Paxcow.
RACHEL AND LOUIS
LOUIS guides her to the jetway.
LOUIS
Come on, you guys--before you miss
the boat.
He kisses DORY. IRWIN hugs him.
IRWIN
Louis, I am sorry. What can I say?
That I lost my mind? It's the truth,
but no good excuse.
LOUIS (hugs him back)
We all lost our minds, Irwin.
LOUIS kisses RACHEL. Then he kneels and hugs ELLIE.
LOUIS
Be good to your mother, darlin'.
She needs you.
ELLIE
Come with us, daddy. Please come
with us!
LOUIS
I'll be there in three days--four
at the most. I've got to get the
electricity shut off and square
things with your school so the
truant officer ain't after you, and--
ELLIE, CU
ELLIE (crying)
Please, daddy! I'm scared!
LOUIS AND ELLIE
LOUIS
Of what?
ELLIE (crying harder)
I don't know.
LOUIS (great emphasis)
Everything's going to be all right,
Ellie. Now go on--get aboard.
ELLIE
Do you swear?
LOUIS
I swear.
The Voice of Authority has spoken. We can tell by ELLIE'S face
that while things are still not all right, they are a little
better. She joins her mother.
The four of them--RACHEL, ELLIE, and THE GOLDMANS--start down the
jetway. ELLIE looks back once, as if begging him to come...and
then they're gone.
LOUIS, CU
LOUIS'S face changes. Now it is a stony and contemplative face.
Not, when you get right down to it, a very nice face.
He turns and strides away.
THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT, WITH LOUIS
The family station wagon is in the f.g. We hear the SOUND OF JET
ENGINES, and as LOUIS reaches the wagon he turns and watches:
THE HARDWARE STORE COUNTER, CU
On it: A six-cell flashlight, Duracell D-batteries, a pick, a
shovel, and a nylon drop-sheet in cellophane packaging. Now the
CLERK'S hands come into the frame and drop a pair of heavy work-
gloves into the pile.
LOUIS AND CLERK (SMALL PUN, HEE-HEE)
CLERK
Anything else for you today?
LOUIS (after a look)
I think we got it all.
The CLERK starts to ring things up.
CLERK
Looks like heavy work.
LOUIS
It could be.
The quality of LOUIS'S reply is somehow unnatural. The CLERK looks
at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain. Then he starts ringing
things up again.
A UNITED JETLINER, WITH ELLIE AND RACHEL
ELLIE is in the window-seat, asleep. RACHEL is holding a paperback
but not reading it. Her eyes are red. She's looking into space.
CAMERA DRIFTS TO ELLIE. Her sleep is not easy. Her head turns from
side to side, as if in negation. She becomes steadily more upset.
She's starting to mutter. Suddenly her eyes flare open and she
screams.
JETLINER, SLIGHTLY WIDER
We can see the GOLDMANS in the seats behind the CREEDS. They are
startled. So are other passengers. A stewardess comes running.
ELLIE
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
RACHEL
Ellie...Ellie...what...
ELLIE
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
We have to go back! Paxcow says it's
almost too late!
UPSTAIRS HALL
NIGHT
THE CAMERA MOVES LEISURELY along this hallway, which is lined with
pictures of RACHEL, ELLIE...and GAGE (there may even be a couple
in which LOUIS is featured, but damned few). Near the end of the
hall a door is open and light spills out.
RACHEL (voice)
Honey, you just had a bad dream. You
know that, don't you?
ELLIE (voice)
It wasn't a dream. It was Paxcow.
THE CAMERA GOES THROUGH THE DOOR and into the room where ELLIE is
staying. She's in bed, still badly upset. RACHEL is sitting on the
bed beside her. There's a single lamp on the bedside table.
ELLIE
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something
really bad. He--
RACHEL
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the
boogeyman?
ELLIE
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
RACHEL turns off the bed-lamp.
RACHEL
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you
to go to sleep and forget all this
nonsense.
ELLIE
Will you at least call and make sure
daddy's okay?
RACHEL
Of course I will.
She kisses ELLIE.
RACHEL
Now will you try to go to sleep?
ELLIE (turns over on her side)
Yes, Mom.
RACHEL gets up and leaves the room.
THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
PASCOW is here, halfway down the hall to the stairs, bloody as
ever. RACHEL doesn't see him. She looks perplexed, a woman trying
to think of something. She stops very near him.
RACHEL (to herself)
Paxcow, why do I know that name?
PASCOW
Pascow.
RACHEL suddenly straightens. She looks startled and afraid.
RACHEL
Pascow? Was she saying Pascow?
She suddenly heads for the stairs, fast.
THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM
NIGHT
IRWIN and DORY are watching RACHEL with some anxiety. RACHEL is
holding the phone to her ear. We can hear the FILTERED SOUND of
one ring after another. She hangs up.
RACHEL
He's not home.
DORY
Why, he probably went out for
a hamburger or a chicken dinner,
dear. You know how men are when
they're alone.
Good old IRWIN'S face says that maybe LOUIS went out for a couple
of grams of coke and a whore in Nazi SS boots.
RACHEL is dialing another number.
THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD
He shuffles to the telephone. His Walkman 'phones are around his
neck. He's got a bottle of beer in one hand.
JUD (picks up)
Hello--you got Judson.
THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL
RACHEL
It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm
calling from Chicago.
JUD (surprised voice)
Chicago! Is Louis with you?
RACHEL
No...we're going to be here
awhile, and he wanted a few days
to wind up our affairs there.
I just wondered if he was with you.
THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD
His face says this is very serious.
JUD
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell
him to call you.
THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM
RACHEL
Jud, do you remember the name
of the student that died on Louis's
first day at work? The one that was
hit by a car?
JUD (voice)
I don't--
RACHEL
Was it Pascow?
THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD
JUD
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis
come home before I go to bed, I'll
tell him to--
THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL
RACHEL
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
JUD (alarmed voice)
Rachel!
RACHEL
Thank you, Jud. Goodbye.
She hangs up.
THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD
JUD
No! Rachel! Don't do that!
Rachel--!
The buzz of an open line. Connection broken. JUD slowly replaces
the receiver. The man looks very grim.
THE FRONT HALL OF THE GOLDMAN HOUSE
RACHEL comes down the stairs, dressed for travelling. She's
carrying a suitcase in one hand. Her parents meet her at the foot
of the stairs.
DORY
Rachel...darling...you're upset...
a night's sleep...
RACHEL
I have to go. The connections are
tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in
forty minutes. Will you drive me,
daddy?
IRWIN
You know something's wrong, don't you?
You know. And Ellie does, too.
RACHEL
Yes.
IRWIN
I'll drive you.
ELLIE (voice)
Mommy?
They all turn to:
ELLIE, ON THE STAIRS
ELLIE
Please hurry.
RACHEL AND THE GOLDMANS
RACHEL
I will. Come and kiss me.
ELLIE races into her arms.
THE GOLDMAN CAR, WITH RACHEL AND IRWIN
IRWIN
I'll come with you if you want,
honey.
RACHEL (shakes her head)
I've got three planes to catch and
I got the last seats on two of them.
It's like God saved them for me.
JETLINER, WITH RACHEL
Everyone looks impatient, but RACHEL looks half crazy.
PILOT (voice)
This is the Captain speaking.
I'm sorry about this delay, folks,
but we've got a real low ceiling
tonight and air traffic control's
playing it safe. Looks like it's
going to be about half an hour before
we get on a roll, so I'm turning off
the NO SMOKING sign.
SOUND: Bing!
There's a general groan. CAMERA MOVES IN ON RACHEL, who has closed
her eyes. I think she's praying.
RACHEL AND HER SEATMATE
SEATMATE
Think you'll make your connection
in Boston?
RACHEL
I have to.
THE JETLINER, WITH RACHEL
Her seatmate is knitting something. Across the aisle sits VICTOR
PASCOW, bloody but serene, hands clasped in his lap, looking
straight ahead. RACHEL looks around tensely.
PILOT (continues)
I'm delighted to tell you that we've
got a strong tail-wind tonight and
we expect to arrive at Boston's
Logan Airport almost on time.
PASCOW clenches his fist in a "That's one for our side!" gesture.
RACHEL (softly)
Thank God.
Her SEATMATE looks at her a bit strangely.
IGNITION, LOUIS'S POV
The keys are in the switch.
A JETWAY AT LOGAN INTERNATIONAL
People are debarking into the gate area. Through them comes
RACHEL, running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself
incoherently. PASCOW is walking near her.
PASCOW
There's just time. If you run.
Without looking at PASCOW, RACHEL takes off her shoes and runs.
THE CONCOURSE, WITH RACHEL
She's sprinting down the concourse--look out, Joanie Benoit!
GATE 27, WITH FEMALE GATE AGENT AND PASCOW
The FEMALE GATE AGENT is starting to close the jetway door.
PASCOW
Don't do that, babe.
The GATE AGENT looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought (or
maybe a gas pain). She stops closing the door. RACHEL runs into
the area. She sees:
THE JET PLANE, THROUGH THE GATE WINDOWS
It is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway.
RACHEL AND FEMALE GATE AGENT (PASCOW IS GONE)
RACHEL
Make it come back!
FEMALE GATE AGENT
I can't--
RACHEL bolts down the jetway. The GATE AGENT stares after her, and
then runs for her stand, where we can see FLIGHT 61 and BANGOR on
the slide-cards. She picks up her mike.
THE HERTZ DESK, AT BIA WITH RACHEL AND CLERK--AND PASCOW
PASCOW is lounging back against the rack of folders--and getting
some of them bloody.
HERTZ CLERK
I'm sorry...it's been very busy
tonight. I really don't have
anything.
PASCOW
What about the Aries K with the
scratch on the side?
The CLERK starts looking through her papers.
CLERK
I do have an Aries K, but it came
in sort of beat up--there's a long
scrape up one side--
RACHEL
I'll take it.
THE ARIES K WITH RACHEL AND PASCOW
Both of them look tense. RACHEL is bolt upright behind the wheel.
Suddenly, BANG! as one of the tires blow.
RACHEL
She lurches forward, but she's wearing her seat-belt--good girl!
She unbuckles it and gets out.
THE GARAGE
LOUIS slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the
kitchen. CHURCH is under the table but LOUIS Doesn't see him.
THE UPSTAIRS HALL
SOUND of LOUIS slowly plodding up the stairs. He comes into view,
dirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face. He walks down
the hall toward the master bedroom.
THE BEDROOM
The clock on the bedtable reads 2:17 A.M. LOUIS falls face-first
on the immaculate bedspread and lies still.
In this shot we should note the closet door is standing open.
THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
Fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater.
THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH CHURCH
He's under the kitchen table, green eyes gleaming. I think he
loves dead, hates living.
SOUND: The doorlatch. CHURCH MIAOWS.
THE KITCHEN, A NEW (LOW) ANGLE
GAGE'S shoes grit slowly across the linoleum, leaving dirty
tracks. CHURCH turns to watch GAGE'S passage, and then follows.
THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
CAMERA HOLDS ON LOUIS as those gritting footsteps approach. Then
we pan to the closet. On the floor is LOUIS'S little black bag. We
hold on this as the footfalls near. A small white hand enters the
frame and pulls the doctor-bag out of the closet. Now another hand
enters the frame and opens the bag. The hands search around inside
and bring out a scalpel.
They hold it up. The GAGE-THING makes a contented SOUND.
THE CAB, WITH RACHEL AND DRIVER
RACHEL
Can't you go any faster?
TRUCKER
Lady, I got nine points on my
license right now.
RACHEL
I understand. It's just that--
She looks at him, pleading. The TRUCKER speeds up.
RACHEL
Thank you. If you only understood
how important this is--
TRUCKER
That's all right, babe. Only if we
get stopped, next time I'll be the
one hitchin' and you can give me a
ride.
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD
He hurries in, turns on the light, and rushes across to his stereo
system, which is state-of-the-art digital--it looks like a flying
saucer among the more traditional furnishings of the room. He
shuts it off and looks around, frowning.
SOUND: Todd Rundgren, singing "Bang on the Drum All Day" at the
top of his voice.
JUD'S head snaps toward the SOUND.
A SONY RADIO, CU
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as JUD hurries across the kitchen to the
counter, where the radio is. He turns it off, looking around, more
bewildered than ever.
JUD (sharply)
Who's here?
He walks toward the door which gives on the hall.
THE HALL, WITH JUD
It's dimly lit by light-spill from the living room and kitchen.
JUD
Come on, stop playing games!
SOUND: Molly Hatchet, "Flirtin' with Disaster," being played top
end, from upstairs.
JUD hurries up. Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology
at work here--for the moment he's more concerned about waking the
neighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with
the prowler...and he would certainly know who--or what--that
prowler was, if he had time to think.
JUD'S BEDROOM
He enters and turns on the light. We see a portable phonograph
with the record, turning. JUD rushes over and turns it off.
He looks around, and we see by his face that he knows.
JUD
Gage? (Pause) Are you the one
playing games?
He goes to the window and looks out at:
THE CREED HOUSE, WITH THE STATION WAGON, JUD'S POV
THE BEDROOM, WITH JUD
He turns slowly and walks toward the bed.
JUD
Gage? Come on out.
He reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife. He unfolds
the blade.
JUD
I want to show you something.
SOUND: Miaow!
THE DOORWAY, WITH CHURCH, JUD'S POV
JUD, BY THE BED
JUD (to the cat)
How did you--?!
JUD'S FEET
A small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt
of the coverlet and slashes JUD'S calf,
JUD
He screams with pain and staggers backward.
JUD'S FEET
The other hand shoots out. GAGE grabs one of JUD'S ankles and
pulls.
JUD
With a startled yell, he falls.
JUD AND GAGE
This one's gotta be pretty rough. George will know what to do. We
finally see GAGE, but it should be clear to us that it's not
really GAGE at all. Some daemonic presence is riding inside the
mouldering, disfigured shell of GAGE.
There is a struggle. JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel.
Perhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife.
GAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here; only sounds.
JUD expires.
GAGE sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat.
THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
He's restless, having a very bad dream, from the look. He rolls
back and forth. Closer and closer to the edge. Finally, with a
wild yell, he goes over onto the floor.
LOUIS, ON THE FLOOR
He comes awake. Sits up. Ouch! He's aches from top to bottom and
side to side...but his back is worst. His hands go to it.
LOUIS
Jesus!
He starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on:
GAGE'S TRACKS ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV
They enter the house, go to the closet, then leave again.
LOUIS
LOUIS
Gage--?
He scrambles for the closet, his aches and pains forgotten. He
stares in wildly.
THE DOCTOR-BAG
It's open.
LOUIS
He pulls the doctor-bag out. His original hope is now tempered
with the first signs of fear. He begins to go through the doctor-
bag. Suddenly he brings out a case and opens it. The case is
empty, but the indented shape is clear. There was a scalpel in
this case...but not anymore.
LOUIS
Oh my God. (Pause) Gage!
THE HALL, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS
Gage!
LOUIS stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but
there's only silence. He rushes down the hallway and opens the
door to GAGE'S room.
GAGE'S ROOM, LOUIS'S POV
Empty.
LOUIS, ON THE STAIRS
He goes downstairs, yelling GAGE'S name.
THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
Nothing. The phone RINGS. LOUIS almost jumps out of his skin
reaching for it.
LOUIS
Hello!
IRWIN (voice)
Hello, Louis--it's Irwin.
I just wanted to be sure Rachel
got back all right.
As IRWIN says this, LOUIS'S eyes fix upon something.
THE FLOOR, WITH TWO SETS OF GAGE-TRACKS, LOUIS'S POV
One set comes in from the shed-garage and heads for the parlor and
upstairs. The other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the
kitchen door giving directly on the outside.
THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
In his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everything...or
almost everything.
IRWIN (voice)
Louis...are you there?
LOUIS (slowly)
Yes--I'm here.
IRWIN (voice)
Did she get there all right?
LOUIS
Yes, she's fine.
IRWIN (voice)
Well, put her on at that end and
I'll put Ellie on at this one.
Ellie's very worried about her
mother. (Pause) She's almost
in hysterics.
LOUIS
She...Rachel's asleep.
IRWIN (an edge in his voice now)
Then I suggest you wake her up.
Ellie...I think she had a dream that
her mother was dead.
LOUIS
I'll call you right back.
IRWIN (voice)
Louis--!
But LOUIS, whose last few responses have been almost trancelike,
hangs up. He looks at the tracks, then goes into the parlor.
THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE
Tiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle. A tiny bloody finger
dials.
THE CREED KITCHEN
The phone starts to ring. After two or three ringy-dingys, LOUIS,
looking extremely upset, comes out of the parlor and picks it up.
LOUIS
Irwin, you'll just have to--
GAGE (voice)
I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come
over and play with me?
LOUIS is dumbfounded...slack-mouthed with terror.
LOUIS (a bare whisper)
Gage?
GAGE (voice)
Mommy already came. We played, daddy.
First I played with Jud and then mommy
came and I played with mommy. We had
an awful good time. Now I want to play
with you.
GAGE begins to giggle...a really awful sound.
LOUIS
What did you do? What did you--
CLICK! The GAGE-THING hangs up, still giggling.
THE CREED BED, CU
He puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it. He
comes up with three syringes, still wrapped in paper, and puts
them aside. Then he roots around some more and comes up with
several ampoules. He holds one up for inspection and we can read
the word MORPHINE on it very clearly.
THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
He carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the
window. His hair has gone partially white.
He fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for
each syringe--i.e., enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in
the left breast pocket of his shirt. He puts the spare ampoules in
the right breast pocket of his shirt.
LOUIS is slowly going insane. What remains of his rationality is
like a rapidly fraying rope.
LOUIS
What you buy is what you own, and
sooner or later what you own comes
home to you. Wasn't that what you
said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it?
He leaves the room.
CHURCH, ON THE PATH, LOUIS'S POV
Dead.
THE FOYER OF THE CRANDALL HOME, WITH LOUIS
It's dark in here, and spooky.
LOUIS
Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause)
Gage?
No answer. He looks down and sees:
A SHOE, LOUIS'S POV
One of RACHEL'S shoes. It lies by the foot of the stairs.
LOUIS
He goes over and picks up the shoe. It's a three-quarter heel, and
it's pretty badly scuffed. RACHEL, after all, did some pretty hard
travelling to get here.
There's a spot of blood on it.
SOUND: A low giggle.
LOUIS looks up:
THE STAIRS, LOUIS'S POV
Mighty dark. Mighty shadowy.
SOUND: Another giggle.
LOUIS, AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
LOUIS
Gage?
THE STAIRS
GAGE (voice)
Let's play, daddy! Let's play hide
and go seek!
LOUIS
He takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket.
LOUIS
All right, Gage...let's.
He begins to climb the stairs.
UPSTAIRS, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS arrives on the landing. We begin the nerve-wracking business
of checking rooms. First, the bathroom...and the shower curtain is
of course pulled. LOUIS yanks it back. Nothing.
He checks the linen closet. Nothing. Goes back to the hall. Looks
down it. He walks slowly along it. He checks one room. It's a
guest room. Shadowy and empty.
Down the hall. A closet door. A bag falls off the top shelf, and a
bunch of ceramics inside it SHATTER LOUDLY. LOUIS flinches back.
Down the hall. Now he's at JUD'S room. He goes in.
JUD'S ROOM, WITH LOUIS
He checks the closet. No go. He steps around the bed and sees:
THE FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV
A bloodstain.
LOUIS
He gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain.
He sees the skirt on the bedspread. He lifts it. He is nose to
nose with JUD, who is dead with his eyes open, an expression of
incredible horror on his face.
The DOOR SLAMS.
LOUIS bolts to his feet as GIGGLES fade down the hall.
Slowly, he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread,
which has mercifully fallen back into place.
LOUIS
I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm--
There's a SQUEAKING, SQUEALING SOUND.
LOUIS turns around. He gets up again. He starts for the door. Then
he turns back and speaks to JUD again.
LOUIS
I'm going to set things back in
order. I...I know just what to do.
He goes out.
THE HALLWAY, WITH LOUIS
He takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast
pocket.
LOUIS
Gage?
Another SQUEAKING SOUND. And another GIGGLE.
LOUIS starts slowly forward. He gets about halfway down the hall--
and our nerves are tuned to the breaking point--when there is a
SQUEALING CREAK and a GRATING THUMP from overhead.
CEILING TRAPDOOR
This happens fast. The trap--which presumably gives on the attic
with a set of folding stairs--rises, and RACHEL'S body plunges
down through and then hangs, swinging: she has been bound around
the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of MISSY DANDRIDGE.
Half her face is gone. Eaten.
LOUIS
He SCREAMS and backs against the wall. Twang! The last silver
thread parts.
THE TRAPDOOR, WITH GAGE
He leaps down, crashes on the floor, and then picks himself up. He
is waving the scalpel.
GAGE (screeching)
Allee-allee-in-free! allee-allee-
in-free! Allee-allee-in-free!
LOUIS AND GAGE
I won't choreograph all the moves, but GAGE slashes his stunned
father up pretty badly with the scalpel. He's screeching the whole
time. LOUIS finally begins to react. He grapples with the little
critter, and tries to get the syringe into him. No good. It's
batted out of his hand just before he can do it. It breaks.
LOUIS and GAGE fall to the floor. LOUIS gets the other syringe out
of his pocket, but it's also knocked out of his hand. Only
consolation is this one isn't broken. It rolls off along the
floor. LOUIS finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes
on, and plunges it into GAGE'S neck.
GAGE
No fair! NO FAIR!
He gets to his feet, clawing for the needle lolling out of his
neck. He's lost all interest in his father. He goes staggering
away. He's slowing down. He goes to his knees...and falls on his
face.
LOUIS watches this... and then his vacant, half-catatonic gaze
goes to:
RACHEL, LOUIS'S POV
She swings slowly back and forth.
THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
He's splashing around a can of coal-oil. When he's got the room
wetted down to his satisfaction, he goes to the door, lights a
match, and tosses it.
Flame runs across the floor. The fire is slow at first, but then
it begins to gain rapidly.
LOUIS goes out.
THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS
LOUIS is filthy, covered with dried blood. He is playing at
Patience. He holds a handful of cards.
TOLLING CONTINUES: Six...seven...
SOUND: The back door opens.
SOUND: Crickets from outside. Ree-ree-ree...
SOUND: Gritting footsteps.
LOUIS looks up. He doesn't look behind, at what's coming. He looks
straight ahead.
LOUIS
And what you own always comes home
to you.
He flips up one card.
TOLLING CONTINUES: Eight...
THE CARD
It's the Bitch, the Queen of Spades, she who supposedly poisoned
the laddies in the Tower.
LOUIS'S hand falls upon it.
TOLLING CONTINUES: Nine...ten...
LOUIS, CU
A hand clotted with grave-dirt falls on his shoulder. A woman's
hand.
TOLLING CONCLUDES: Eleven...twelve...
RACHEL (voice)
Darling.
FADE OUT ON THE SOUND OF CRICKETS.
