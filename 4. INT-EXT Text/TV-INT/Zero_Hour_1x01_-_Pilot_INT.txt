 Widen to the BEGIN ON an ornate numeral  12 .astronomical 
clock in Strasbourg Cathedral. Like none other--a massive, 
baroque sprawl of interconnected smaller clocks and dials, 
the artwork that of the heavens, the oceans, the continents--

You get the sense that if someone actually knew the secrets 
to the grand scheme, they encoded them here, many centuries 
ago, in a candle-lit past we will never know. 

Below, we find a hive of activity. Long tables. 12 ARTISANS 
feverishly at work. Building...no great surprise...clocks. 12 
clocks. Small but almost equal in craftsmanship to the 
massive astronomical clock above. Through this comes a

Welcome to Creepytown. Priest & Colleague enter a side door. 
Gates, bars, security glass. More of a prison than a

Hank turns his iPhone on. Employs it as a flashlight, swings 
it around, illuminating the place. He catches his breath.

His face: obscured by ripples in the ice. The tiny rose

You don t understand: Europe was in

Old Clockmaker eyes the Grandfather clock. Each of the 12
