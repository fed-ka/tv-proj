      The truck s wipers SWISH erratically.  A page from a MAP is 
      clipped to the rear-view mirror.  There s a SPOT on the map, 
      marked with a RED circle.  The speedometer is stroking 80mph.

                                  THE DRIVER (O.S.)
                          (Anxious whispers)
                    Mea culpa - mea culpa - mea maxima 
                    culpa.  

      A FLASH of the driver s TEAR-FILLED eyes in the rear view.  

      His eyes shift --

      To the passenger seat.  There s a PLASTIC CONTAINER - and 
      resting on top is a shiny CRUCIFIX.  

      WILL SANDERS (25) is driving like a man possessed.

                                  THE DRIVER/WILL SANDERS
                    Forgive them, Father... Forgive 
                    them for what they do--



      The WAIL of a SIREN and Sanders  eyes ALERT to the sight of 
      the pursuing cop car in his door mirror.  

      He shifts gears and ACCELERATES --



      The plastic container is NOW bouncing around the passenger 
      seat.  The crucifix slides OFF the top and the FLASH of a 
      DARK EERIE SHAPE is revealed in the box.   

      Sanders looks at it, then back at the cop car.  He rolls DOWN 
      his window.  A gust of wind and rain BRANDS his face -- he 
      GRABS the container, with the crucifix and -- 



      Through the windshield the COPS clearly see SOMETHING being 
      TOSSED OUT of the old truck  --



      Sanders wipes his tears, rolls up the window, then happens to 
      look up -- THERE S A BIG RIG HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM!  

      He JERKS the wheel and with a calm resignation, he closes his 
      eyes to the JARRING sound of the Big Rig s HORN -- 



      DOCTOR JACOB HOOD (38), dark unruly hair, tall, handsome, 
      with the penetrating eyes of a Greek sage, is by a table, 
      holding up and studying a shiny crucifix, while being OGLED 
      by Forensic #2.      

                                  HOOD
                    You found one of these in every 
                    grave?  

                                  FORENSIC #2
                    Yeah.  With this.  
                          (Holds up an instrument)
                    It detects waves and sounds in the 
                    earth.  Mostly metal.

                                  HOOD
                    Sound - never - dies.

                                  FORENSIC #2
                    Come again?

                                  HOOD
                    The string theory.  That every 
                    scream.  Every laugh.  Every word.  
                    Every noise ever made since the 
                    earth began, is out there in space, 
                    right now.  Which if you think 
                    about it, makes the past the 
                    present.

                                  FORENSIC #2
                    And that means?...

                                  HOOD
                          (Reaches to thin air)
                    Every mystery unsolved is actually 
                    in the moment.  So, if we could 
                    just reach out and pluck the right 
                    sound wave, we could solve all of 
                    them.  

      McNeil STORMS into the tent.  He heads straight for Hood in a 
      THREATENING manner.  Hood holds his ground, comfortably.

                                  MCNEIL
                    What s going on here?!

      In a breathless second someone INTERCEPTS McNeil, twisting 
      his arm up his back and THRUSTING a forearm across his neck.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      5.

      McNeil gasps for air.  A very attractive, slim, tough as 
      nails, RACHEL YOUNG (30) has McNeil in the hold.

                                  RACHEL
                    Nod if you can breathe?
                          (He nods)
                    He s from the government, okay?
                          (He nods again)
                    Slowly... slowly...

      She let s him go.  McNeil turns to see his attacker, while 
      sensing the grins of the Forensic Guys in the tent.

                                  MCNEIL
                    And where are you from?

                                  RACHEL
                    Ohio.  Can I see your badge?

      McNeil pulls his badge and shows it to her.

                                  RACHEL
                    Sorry about that, but you came up 
                    on him too quick.

                                  HOOD
                    Rachel s my bodyguard and she s a 
                    little tense.  We ve traveled 
                    through the night to get here.  I m 
                    Doctor Jacob Hood.    

      Hood SLIPS the crucifix he s holding INTO his pocket UNSEEN.

                                  HOOD
                    Nothing broken, I hope.  Detective 
                    McNeil, right?

                                  MCNEIL
                    Who did you say you work for?

                    I didn t.  Somebody else will do 
                    that in a few seconds.

      Hood nods to Rachel.  McNeil sees her press SEND on her cell.  
      She looks straight into McNeil s eyes while it rings.  Then --

                                  RACHEL
                          (Offers McNeil the phone)
                    It s for you.

                    Hello?

      McNeil straightens up, listens intently and looks at Hood.  

                                  MCNEIL
                          (Down the phone)
                    Yes, sir.

      He hangs up, then hands the phone back to Rachel.

                                  MCNEIL
                    You re a scientific advisor?

      Hood glances across at the grim visual of NINETEEN PLASTIC 
      CONTAINERS laying on a table.  Tagged and uniformly lined up.

                                  HOOD
                    I m brought in by the government to 
                    handle very sensitive situations, 
                      detective.  Let s just say it s in 
                      everyone s best interests to 
                      investigate objectively, discreetly 
                    and thoroughly, considering your 
                    unusual find.

                                  MCNEIL
                    You mean nineteen dead babies and 
                    nineteen graves, that didn t dig 
                      themselves. 

                                  HOOD
                    Not accurate.  You ve got nineteen 
                    dead fetuses.  They only become 
                    babies after they re born.  You 
                    drink milk?  From a carton?

                                  MCNEIL
                    Why?

                                  RACHEL
                    Just answer his question.

                                  HOOD
                    The bar code on the carton.  Same 
                    principle as a DNA profile.  Right.

      Rachel hands Hood a folder.  He pulls an X-RAY FILM from the 
      folder.  He slides and secures the top of the film UNDER the 
      steel frame of the tent, CONVERTING the back-lit fabric into 
      a light box.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      7.

                    DNA is a personal barcode.  Each 
                    one s different, ergo unique.  This 
                    is the profile for the twelve week 
                    old fetus that was thrown from the 
                    truck.
                          (Adds another X-Ray film)
                    And this is the profile from the 
                    first fetus you dug up.  Spot the 
                      difference - I dare you?

      Still ruffled, McNeil glares at Rachel before he draws close 
      and studies the X-Ray film.

                                  MCNEIL
                    I can t.  

                                  HOOD
                          (Adding a 3rd, 4th, 5th)
                    Of course you can t.  Because 
                    they re identical.  All nineteen.  

      Hood suddenly POURS the remaining X-Ray films OUT of the 
      folder, SCATTERING them all over the table. 

                                  HOOD
                    These are the DNA profiles of eight 
                    other fetuses found in various 
                    places across the country, over the 
                    last 18 months.  Pick one.  

      McNeil picks one randomly.  Hood slides it OVER one of those 
      already hanging from the tent frame.

                                  HOOD
                    Also identical to the fetuses you 
                    found here.
                          (Turns to McNeil)
                    Know anything about cloning?  
                    Remember Dolly the sheep?

                                  MCNEIL
                    Yeah.

      Hood glances again at the nineteen containers laying on the 
      table, but this time with a fleeting sensitivity in his eyes.

                                  HOOD
                    Well, this abomination is what 
                    happens when you try it with women.

      Little DAVID (4) is cherry picking candies from a basket on a 
      shelf and eating them.  Customers come and go.  A Man in 
      sweats and a beanie approaches little David, takes his hand 
      and walks him off.  A beat.

      A PREGNANT girl, KELLY (20), appears in the candy aisle.

                                  KELLY
                    David!  Has anyone seen a little 
                    boy?  Dark hair, red top?

      The Customers stare blankly and keep moving.

                                  KELLY
                    DAVID!  DAVID!

      Kelly hurries down the aisle, her fear growing --  she runs 
      around to the next aisle -- and the next -- and STOPS --

      There is David with the Man in sweats, kneeling by him.

                                  KELLY
                    Stop following me!  The Judge told 
                    you to stay away from us.  Bobby, 
                    look at me!  

      The Man/BOBBY looks up and smiles, coldly --

                    Besides, a kid s got a right to see 
                    his dad.

                                  KELLY
                    Not after what you did to us.  Let 
                    my son go.  David come here.

      David walks away from Bobby and to his mom s hand.  Bobby 
      stands up and takes a good look at Kelly s pregnancy.

                                  BOBBY
                    Keepin  busy, huh?

      She turns with David to walk away and Bobby grabs her hair. 

                                  BOBBY
                    Don t you walk away from me!

      He SLAMS her up against the shelves.  She grabs her belly and 
      screams.  David cries.  An ELDERLY WOMAN approaches --

                                    ELDERLY WOMAN
                    Leave her alone!

      Kelly SLIDES down the shelves to a heap on the floor, RUBBING 
      her pregnant belly, agony on her face.  Bobby hurries away.  
      Little David stands alone and sobbing.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

      Kelly brings up her hand, it s covered in BLOOD.



      A BLACK AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD is placed on the reception 
      counter by Hood.  Rachel is with him.  McNeil is eyeing 
      Hood s wallet, filled with high-end credit cards.

                    A Judge will ask why?  Technically 
                    a fetus is medical waste.  It s not

      Hood smiles as Rachel hands him his Black Amex, which he 
      slips into his wallet, in a very NEAT way.

                                  HOOD
                    Breathe, McNeil.  You ve got a 
                    crime here.  A big crime.   
                      Implanting an embryo into a woman 
                    created by any means other than 
                      fertilization, is illegal.  

                                  MCNEIL
                    But it s not a murder and that 
                    means I ve wasted too much time 
                    already.

                                  HOOD    
                    Tell me you didn t say wasted?

      Hood is about to let rip, but Rachel OFFERS her card to 
      McNeil, who looks STRANGELY at it - there s ONLY a phone 
      number, no name, no address... nothing.  

                                  RACHEL
                    Anything that helps us detective, 
                    you can call me.

      McNeil takes the card and STORMS off.  Hood and Rachel 
      APPROACH the elevators --

                                  RACHEL
                    You like it when I use my disarming 
                    charm, I can tell.

      The elevator arrives and they get in --

                                  HOOD
                    We can do this without his help.  
                    Nineteen fetuses.  You know what 
                    that means?  Nineteen mothers.    
                          (Turns to Rachel)
                    How do you keep all of them quiet?

      The heavy METAL doors of the elevator slide shut --                                                                                    13.





      Through PLASTIC DRAPES we see a PREGNANT silhouette.  We 
      drift around the plastic drapes and come upon --

      An ULTRASOUND SCANNER, running over a baby bump.  Kelly s on 
      her back, laying very still.  She looks ANXIOUSLY at a LAPTOP 
      SCREEN - and the sound of a rapid heart beat resounds.

                                  KELLY
                    Is the baby okay?  Please tell me?

      She s looking up at DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD (50), slick back 
      grey hair, manicured and pristine.  He s studying the laptop.

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    Ssh, Kelly.  In a minute.

      Kelly looks at little David playing with a toy.  Lea Muller 
      is watching from across the room in the shadows.

                                  KELLY
                    I just keep thinking about the 
                    childless couple.  It would break 
                    their hearts if I lost the baby. 

                                  LEA MULLER
                    That s a nice thought to have, 
                    Kelly.  Keep that thought.

      Hayward STOPS the ultrasound scanner and looks WORRIED.

                                  KELLY
                    What is it?  What s wrong?

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    The placenta.  It s lying too low.  
                    It s blocking the entrance to your 
                    womb.

                                  KELLY
                    Is that bad?

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                          (Looking at Muller)
                    You just relax.  Nature has a way 
                    of making things right.

                                  KELLY
                          (Sitting up)
                    If something did go wrong, I d 
                    still get the money, wouldn t I?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.

                                  LEA MULLER
                    That childless couple you were so 
                    concerned about are not a charity, 
                    Kelly.  

      Muller s cell phone rings and she walks off to answer it.  
      Kelly looks nervously up at Hayward.

                                  KELLY
                    I need that money, doctor.  I have 
                    to get away from here, from people.

      She realizes that little David has been LISTENING to her. 



      Hayward is washing his hands.  Muller is CLEANING and 
      PREPPING the area - trashing blood soaked sheets.

                                  LEA MULLER
                    That was Geppetto, asking for an 
                    update.

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    We shouldn t have sent Kelly home.  
                    She s got grade three previa.

                                  LEA MULLER
                    She s also got the most viable 
                    fetus we ve ever seen.

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    More reason to have her in a 
                    hospital, under constant 
                      supervision.  

                                  LEA MULLER
                    For a doctor you can be amazingly 
                    stupid.

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    She should be delivered.

                                  LEA MULLER
                    It s too early.  Besides, the baby 
                    might not survive.

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    At least the girl would.  She s a 
                    time bomb!  You want to risk that?  *

                    With great risks come great 
                    rewards.

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    I don t want another dead mother on 
                    my conscience.  And if she goes 
                    into labor, she will die.

      Lea Muller grabs her bag and leaves.  Hayward looks 
      hopelessly on. 



                                  WILL SANDERS
                    You can t do this to me!

                                  HOOD
                    Actually, I can.  It s time to 
                    clear your conscience, Will.  I 
                    know you re a man of faith and we 
                    both know, at the heart of faith 
                    lies the truth.

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    Jesus knows my heart and He s 
                    forgiven me.

                                  HOOD
                    Really?  Okay, let s ask him.



      Hood is DRAGGING Sanders by the collar, down the center 
      aisle, towards the altar and a LARGE crucifix hanging above 
      it.  Rachel follows behind, eyeing the terrain.

                                  HOOD
                    Look at him, Will.  Look at the 
                    nails in his hands, in his feet.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

                    The wound in his side.  You telling 
                    me you d let that suffering 
                    continue?  Answer me!

      Sanders AVERTS his eyes from the crucifix.

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    Please, let me go.

      Hood leans to Sanders ear and whispers --

                                  HOOD
                    Ask his forgiveness, Will and he 
                    will forgive you, if you truly 
                    repent.  Tell the truth, who paid 
                    you to get rid of the containers?  

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    Stop.  PLEASE, STOP THIS!

      Sanders covers his eyes with his hands, but Hood pulls them 
      away, forcing Sanders to look AGAIN at the crucifix.

                                  HOOD
                    He knows the secrets of your heart.  
                    Cleanse yourself Will, TELL HIM!

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    It was a woman.  She never told me 
                    her name.

                                  HOOD
                    You lie to me, you re lying to Him!

      On Hood s words, Sanders stops whimpering.  He wipes his 
      tears and lowers his head in shame.  

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    I burned the first one.  Medical 
                    waste she told me.  Easy money.  I 
                    didn t think.  

                                  HOOD
                    Easy money, brings sleepless 
                    nights.  You must have a name?

                                  WILL SANDERS
                          (Snaps)
                    I TOLD YOU!  I DON T KNOW HER NAME!

      Hood s quick response is to GRAB Sanders chin, forcing him to 
      look at the image of Christ in a STAIN GLASS window.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                    I looked inside the second one.  I 
                    wished I hadn t.  There was no 
                    going back.  My soul is darkened.  
                    Mea culpa.  God must forgive me.

                                  HOOD
                    You know what I think, Will?  
                    You re a waste of God s time.  
                    Let s go.

      Hood starts away --

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    Geppetto. 
                          (Hood stops)
                    She spoke on the phone to someone 
                    called Geppetto.

      Sanders lowers his head, starts to beat his chest and pray.  
      Hood looks at Rachel.  She exhales.



      Sanders is in back with Hood.  Rachel s in front.

                                  HOOD
                    Why you, Will?

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    I worked here as a night guard 
                    until they closed the place down.  

                                  RACHEL
                    That s not an answer.

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    You don t see Divine intervention 
                    at hand?  The woman hired me to 
                    drive the girls here.  Then she 
                    gave me something, told me to burn 
                    it, but I looked.   I praise God 
                    for choosing me to give them a 
                    decent burial. 





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                    the police instead. *

      Rachel opens her door as Sanders  eyes bore into her head.



      Rachel pulls up on HUMAN SHADOWS reflecting on the wall.  She 
      swings her gun to a small army of - MANNEQUINS.  On the 
      ground are CRATES of BROKEN mannequins.  Rachel leads them 
      DEEPER into the warehouse, walking a gauntlet of SMILING, 
      lifeless, full size mannequins -- 

      They take to the old, creaking, broken stairs --



      It s empty and huge.  But in the center of the floor there is 
      a square TENT, made of PLASTIC SHEETS.  Through the plastic 
      Rachel and Hood can see all kinds of shapes --

                                  RACHEL
                    How did they keep this quiet?

                    Cash.  Lotta cash.

      Rachel approaches and quickly PULLS BACK a plastic sheet 
      REVEALING a cot, surrounded by medical equipment --

      Rachel opens a drawer by the cot and PULLS OUT a handful of 
      papers with ULTRASOUND PHOTOS attached, and the word 
      TERMINATED written on the bottom of each photo.

                    place.  That requires a real lab.



      Rachel finds something UNDER the cot.  She drags into view a 
      STEEL DRUM.  The LABEL on the drum reads WESTEC VETERINARIAN 
      SERVICES.  Hood pulls the lid free and looks inside --

                                  HOOD
                    Liquid nitrogen.  For transporting 
                    bovine semen.

      By the slightly OPEN door, Hayward is there, LISTENING --

                                  RACHEL
                    What are they making, a Minotaur?

      Hood PEELS the label from the LID of the CANISTER and puts it 
      INTO his coat pocket.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

                    They re hardly gonna label it, 
                     frozen clone embryos, handle with 
                    love.   This was just a cover.

      Sanders alerts to Hayward PERCHED eerily at the bottom of the 
      stairs, GLARING up at him.  He looks pleadingly at Hayward --  

                                  WILL SANDERS
                    I had no choice.

      Rachel just catches sight of Hayward running for the door --  



                                  RACHEL
                    You got your panic button?!

                                  HOOD
                    I think so.

      He searches his pockets.  Rachel leaps downstairs --



      Hood s looking out the window, as Hayward's car speed by, 
      with Rachel chasing.  He turns to the back stairs --



      Hayward looks up to see Hood before him.  He JERKS the wheel.                                                                                    22.





      The place is clean, but Spartan.  Kelly is sitting on the 
      sofa with little David beside her, in his pajamas.  Kelly s 
      in some discomfort as she reads him a bedtime story.

                                  KELLY
                    ...and when the King returned to

                    trusted servant had made him a 
                    beautiful coat, filled with --
                          (She winces)
                    -- all kinds of wonderful magic...

                    Oh!  David honey, give mommy a 
                    minute until this pain goes away.

      Kelly struggles to her feet.  David points to her feet --

      Kelly looks down at her feet, at DROPS of BLOOD falling from 
      her sweats to the carpet.



      Hayward s phone rings.  Scared and sweating, he drives into a 
      dark tunnel and stops --

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    If you got to a hospital, social 
                    services will take David away from

                                  KELLY
                    But I m bleeding, badly!

      Hayward looks away in consternation, pulling his tie free.

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    No hospitals, understand?  I m

      He throws her a look and gets out the car.

      She glares back at him, then enters her office --



      The Lab Manager sits down.  Hood and Rachel before her.

      Hood and Rachel look tired, but soldier on.  Hood stops on a

      Rachel is checking the room, under the bed, the bathroom, the 
      windows, the locks.  Hood is left standing in the doorway.

                                  HOOD
                    Why can t we go visit this man, 
                    Gifford?!

      She hands him his key --

                    And use your cover name if you 
                    order to the room.  Good night.

      She closes the door.  He turns and looks around the room. 
      Like a travelling salesman who s jaded, he drops to the bed.                                                                                    33.





      Rachel s humming along with the cheesy music.  The doors ping

                    Already did.  He s gone.

                    accounts frozen by the IRS. 

      Rachel tries to take the file, but McNeil pulls it away.

                    months, that s a year ago.

      She tries AGAIN to take the file, but he teasingly withdraws.

                    I said I owe you one.  I never said 
                    I d give you one.

      She GENTLY takes the file, steps back INTO the elevator, 
      GRINNING.  The doors close on McNeil, smiling.                                                                                     34.

      Kelly is laying on a bed.  An I.V Attached.  The Nurse checks

      Kelly waits a second, gets up and pulls the I.V free.

                    Not to keep.

      He goes to a table. There s a fruit bowl, loaded with grapes.  
      He sits down and PLUCKS a GRAPE.  She hands him her tweezers.

                    seed inside it is her nucleus that 
                    contains her unique DNA.  Now, if 
                    you wanna make a clone the first 
                    thing you do is get rid of the 
                    nucleus.

      Hood carefully INSERTS the tweezers into the grape and 
      REMOVES the seed --

                                  RACHEL
                    Believe it or not, I use those.

      Hood takes a SECOND grape and holds it up --

                    Then you replace it with the 
                    nucleus from any cell of the person 
                    you want to clone.  

      Again Hood INSERTS the tweezer AND CAREFULLY removes the 
      seed.  Picks up the FIRST grape and SLOWLY inserts the seed 
      from the SECOND grape.  He holds it up before Rachel --

                    lead!  We don t even know if this 
                    girl is involved with Geppetto.  We 
                    can t go banging on some 
                      billionaire s door in the middle of 
                    the night, for no reason. 

      Rachel leaves the room, closes the door after her and we hear 
      it lock from the outside.  Hood s left staring at the door.

                                  HOOD
                    Why not?



      Rachel walks into the bar to find McNeil sitting there 
      drinking a beer.  There s the same Young Guys from last 
      night.  Young Guy #1 winks at her --  

      -- she heads straight for McNeil, picks up his beer and 
      drinks it down.  McNeil looks shocked, as do the Young Guys.  

                                  RACHEL
                    My room - now.

      She walks out, quickly followed by McNeil.



      Hood pulls off his jacket.  Takes out the PANIC BUTTON and 
      looks it over.                                                                                      39.





                                  MCNEIL
                    I love what you ve done with the 
                    place.

      Rachel smiles warmly, as she removes her earrings.  McNeil 
      takes the SINGLE little flower from the vase on the desk and 
      hands it to her.  

                                  RACHEL
                    You want me to change my mind?

      He tosses the flower OVER his shoulder.  She smiles 
        approvingly, then stares into his eyes with a rare 
      vulnerability.



      Hood s sitting on his bed, eating a sandwich and zoning out 
      on a TV INFOMERCIAL --

      The lights are out, but the GROANS are very distinctive, as 
      we move to see Rachel and McNeil on the bed, HALF dressed.

                    What?

      She ARCHES her back and unbuckles her belt and HOLSTER, 
      placing them on the bedside table.

                                  RACHEL
                    Okay.



      Hood s bored.  He grabs his panic button from the table.  
      SLIPS it into his COAT pocket and leaves the room.



      Hood enters to a busy bar.  He takes a stool at the bar, 
      pulls off his coat and SITS ON IT.  Bartender approaches --

                                  HOOD
                    Scotch.  Single Malt.  Neat.



      They re under the sheets, in the throes of passion when --

      AN ALARM BUZZES ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE --

      Rachel THROWS McNeil aside and GRABS her gun --



      She SPRINTS down the hallway to Hood s room, wearing a short, 
      silk dressing gown.   She KICKS his door open and goes in --



      -- looks around.  He s not there!  She runs out --



      She sees two men just took the elevator --                                                                                    41.





      She s BOUNDING downstairs, four at a time --



      The Bartender DROPS a glass!  Hood swings around, whisky in 
      hand.  Rachel is at the door, looking very sexy, gun by her 
      side, puffing relief.  Then her eyes shift around the room, 
      to find everyone s STARING at her.

                                  HOOD
                    Oh, crap.

      He leans up and pulls his PANIC BUTTON from his coat pocket.

                                  HOOD
                    Must have sat on it. 

      Then - McNeil rushes in, HALF DRESSED.  Hood looks from one 
      to the other, then raises his glass, sheepishly --

                           ACT IV



      Someone is looking at Hood and Rachel s faces on a screen.



      The gates open and REVEAL a sprawling acreage and the center 
      piece is a huge, INDUSTRIAL-TYPE HOUSE, like an homage to 
        DECONSTRUCTIVISM.  Rachel looks at Hood.

                                  RACHEL
                    What is that?

      The interior hallway is all steel and dark, brooding wood.  
      The Butler walks off as PHILLIP GIFFORD(50) comes through a 
      door.  He s a tall, slim man.  A computer nerd in his youth, 
      an enigma in his present.  He studies Hood through glasses.

      The walls are littered with MODERN ART, PICASSO S, DALI S, 
      CHAGALL.  Each piece of furniture is unique in design and has 
      NO correlation to the next piece.  Gifford leads them in --

      Rachel s SNOOPING discreetly at a bunch of GLOSSY magazines

      He looks at her and she SHIFTS her eyes.  Reluctantly Hood

      David s frozen in his tracks.  Lea Muller pulls the bloodied 
      covers from the sofa.  The door bell rings!  She looks to the 
      door, then at David, who lowers his eyes.



      Muller opens the door to Bobby, Kelly s ex.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

                    Who are you?

                                  LEA MULLER
                    You must have the wrong apartment.

      She closes the door, but Bobby puts a hand up and stops her.

                                  BOBBY
                    Where s Kelly?

                                  LEA MULLER
                    I don t know any Kelly.

      He THROWS her aside and strides in --

                                  BOBBY
                    Kelly!  Kelly!



                                  BOBBY
                    Kelly!

      When he comes in, little David looks at him.

                                  BOBBY
                    David, where s mommy?

                                  DAVID
                    The man took her.

                                  BOBBY
                    What man?

      He then SPOTS the BLOODIED sofa covers.

                                  BOBBY
                    What the hell s going on here?!

      He turns QUICKLY.  In a flash Lea Muller PLUNGES a big pair 
      of sharp, shiny SCISSORS into his neck.

      Close on a hand DRIPPING blood.  The sound of rapid intakes 
      of labored breathing --



      She steps cautiously along the hallway of the tiny apartment.  
      She swings the gun around and into the living room -- 

      Bobby is laying on the floor, in a pool of his own blood.  A 
      pair of scissors STUCK in his neck.

                                  RACHEL
                    Can you talk?  Who are you?!

                    Get me an ambulance.

      Hood comes in --




                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                    Who did this?

                                  BOBBY
                    Some woman.  I need an ambulance! 

                                  HOOD
                    Where s Kelly?!

                                  BOBBY
                    I DON T KNOW!!  AAH!!  Get this 
                    outta my neck!

      Hood stands over him and speaks very calmly --

                                  HOOD
                    Not a good idea.  That s your 
                    external jugular vein --  
                          (Rachel dials 911)
                    The scissors are slowing the blood 
                    flow, pull them out, you ll be dead 
                    in minutes.  Best if you stay calm.  

      Suddenly, the NOISE of a CREAKING floor board BEHIND Hood.  
      Rachel SPINS around and takes aim -- 

      Little David is standing there -- Rachel sighs relief and 
      holsters her gun.

                                  RACHEL
                    It s okay, honey.  It s okay. 

      Little David looks straight at Hood, with the saddest eyes.  

                                  DAVID
                    Where s my mommy?



      McNeil is coming out of the evidence room, locking the door 
      behind him.  He s looking nervously around.  In his hands 
      he s HOLDING the PLASTIC CONTAINER that Sanders threw from 
      his truck window.  He takes his coat off and DRAPES it OVER 
      the plastic container, hiding it.



      Hood taps his fingers nervously.  Rachel notices his quiet 
      vulnerability.  She breaks the ice --

                                  RACHEL
                    You know you can t accidentally 
                    press your panic button, just by 
                    sitting on it?  It s indented.

      Hood s mood is broken.  He smiles at her.

                                  HOOD
                    You look out for me - I was just 
                    returning the favor. 

      Rachel SPOTS McNeil approaching them in the rear-view mirror.

      THE REAR WINDOW SLIDES DOWN

      McNeil reaches into the back seat and CAREFULLY places the 
      plastic container there.  He locks eyes with Hood, who nods 
      gratefully.     



      The room is being prepped by Lea Muller.  Kelly is on a cot, 
      unconscious and in pain. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.

                    Geppetto will be here soon.
                          (She turns, puzzled)
                    Hayward?  



      Muller finds Hayward standing by the balcony, looking 
      nervously back at her --

                                  DOCTOR SIDNEY HAYWARD
                    We could save ourselves.  Give them 
                    Geppetto.

      Lea Muller looks hopelessly around, then with resignation --

                                  LEA MULLER
                    I agree.  Make the call.

      Hayward turns around and as he pulls his cell phone, Muller 
      sticks a SYRINGE into his HEART.  He goes down and she DRAGS 
      his DEAD body towards a linen closet --



      They roam from room to room, until they enter --



      Gifford s in a chair, by a bed.  The place looks like it 
      hasn t been touched, tidied, or cleaned since the son died.

                                  HOOD
                    You know what today is, Mister 
                    Gifford?

                                    GIFFORD
                    Yes.  It s my son s new birthday.

                                  HOOD
                    No.  It s the first day of you 
                    accepting Gabriel is dead.                                                                                    54.





                                    GIFFORD
                    Do you know how long I ve waited 
                    for this?  How many false hopes?  
                      Argentina.  Mexico.  Malaysia -- 
                    you won t stop this.
                          (Turns to Hood)
                    In one hour my son will be reborn 
                    and in my hands again.

                                  HOOD
                    You can t believe that.

                                    GIFFORD
                    Have you ever lost a child?  How 
                    could you understand what I m going 
                    through.

                                  HOOD
                    Two years ago my wife died.  I 
                    nursed her, until her last breath.

      Rachel s REACTION means she DIDN T know this --

                                  HOOD
                    Every day I would look for some 
                    little sign, that helped me to 
                    believe she might get better.  
                    There s not a moment goes by, that 
                    I don t wish her back. 

                                    GIFFORD
                    It s not the same!  One of you dies 
                    first, it s sad, but that s the 
                    deal!  When my boy died, life was 
                    over for me!  Empty inside.  
                    Praying to go to sleep and never 
                    wake up.    

                                  HOOD
                    It s called grief!  It s natural.

                                  HOOD
                    What you re trying to do is only 
                    making your pain intolerable.

                                    GIFFORD
                    What could be worse than my son 
                    dying?

                                  HOOD
                    Your son dying over and over again.

                                    GIFFORD
                    Not possible.

                                  HOOD
                    You want to see Gabriel again?

      Hood reaches out and Rachel hands him something, wrapped in 
      cloth.  Hood pulls the cloth away and reveals a plastic 
      container with an EERIE shape, barely definable inside.

      He OPENS the container and turns back to Gifford --

                                  HOOD
                    Behold your son.  
                          (Gifford REELS)
                    Even if he d survived the genetic 
                    mutation.  Even if he d been 
                    perfect in every sense, this would 
                    never have been the boy you knew. 
                          (Gifford stares in horror)
                    It would have been some other 
                    different child.  Gabriel is not 
                    the product of his DNA, he s the 
                    sum of every day you spent with 
                    him... Every meal his mother cooked 
                    for him... every story you read 
                    him... Every ball you threw for him 
                    to catch --

      Gifford DROPS into a chair, weeping openly.  Hood CLOSES the 
      container, wraps it gently with the cloth and hands it to a 
      sad faced Rachel --

                                  HOOD
                    I m sorry you had to find out this 
                    way, that Gabriel s soul is much 
                    more than just its constituent 
                    chemical parts.  
                          (Kneels to Gifford)

      AN EKG FLATLINES!  Kelly is laying on a cot.  Someone is 
      performing HEART MASSAGE on her chest.



      It s dark.  No lights on.  There s medical equipment all 
      covered in PLASTIC wrapping.  

      Hood and Rachel enter and race along the hallway, past EMPTY 
      gurneys and more WRAPPED medical equipment.  They try random 
      doors and random rooms.  There s NO ONE to be found.  They 
      stop a second.  Hood s breathless --

                    C mon!

      They run up the stairs --



      Hood THROWS open a door and STOPS dead in his tracks.  
      There s the HUM of a FLATLINE and Kelly lying still on a cot.

      The Elegant Woman continues the heart massage.  Hood is 
      compressing the bag.

                                  HOOD
                    Are you a doctor?

                                    ELEGANT WOMAN
                    I was.  More oxygen!  Squeeze until 
                    you see the chest inflate.



      Rachel is searching the hallway.  She finds the BLOOD BANK --



      Rachel RUNS in and opens the big GLASS door of a large 
      refrigerator, labelled  BLOOD .  It s EMPTY!  

      Suddenly, REFLECTED in the door is Lea Muller, CREEPING 
      towards Rachel with a SCALPEL in her RAISED hand --  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    58.

        CONTINUED:135135


      Rachel SPINS to face her, the scalpel SLASHES Rachel s arm, 
      slicing THROUGH her coat and skin.  Rachel HEAD BUTTS Muller, 
      sending her reeling back.  Muller comes SCREAMING madly at 
      Rachel, who SIDE-STEPS her, throwing a roundhouse kick INTO 
      Muller s stomach, which sends her CRASHING THROUGH the 
        refrigerator door.  Rachel CUFFS her to the heavy door.



                                  HOOD
                    What about the baby?

      The Elegant Woman LOCKS eyes with Hood for the first time and 
      it s a look of HOPELESSNESS that answers his question.

                                    ELEGANT WOMAN
                    We have to try and save the girl.  
                          (Eyes down again)
                    She lost him a long time ago.

      Hood stares at the Elegant Woman --

                                  HOOD
                    Him?  How did you know that?

      She DOESN T look up, but works harder on the heart massage.

                                  HOOD
                    You re Geppetto...

      She STOPS the heart massage and casually backs away --

                                    ELEGANT WOMAN
                    You ll have to take over now, if 
                    you want to save her.

                                  HOOD
                    You can t just walk away -

                                    ELEGANT WOMAN
                    Fifteen compressions to two 
                    squeezes of the air bag.

      The Elegant Woman looks coldly at Hood, then simply walks out 
      of the room.  Hood SNAPS back, throws off his jacket and 
      PERFORMS the heart massage --



      Rachel comes running up the stairs and towards Kelly s room --                                                                                    59.





      Rachel enters.  Hood s ALONE, pushing on Kelly s chest.  

                                  RACHEL
                    There s no blood!

                                  HOOD
                    C mon Kelly!  Come back to us!  
                    Come back to David!  C mon!

      He doesn t give up.  Then, MIRACULOUSLY a PULSE returns to 
      the EKG, but Hood DOESN T stop working Kelly.  

                                  RACHEL
                    Hood.  Hood!
                          (He looks at her)
                    She s back.  Look!

      Hood looks at Kelly s pulse on the EKG.  He steps back, 
      allowing Rachel to place the oxygen mask over Kelly s face as 
      she coughs and breathes again.  Hood backs out of the room --



      Hood is staring in at Kelly on the cot.  He turns to the 
      window.  Down below the Elegant Lady/GEPPETTO is by her car,  
      looking up at Hood.  She climbs in and drives away. 

      Seconds pass.  Two COP CARS and PARAMEDICS come speeding in, 
      led by McNeil.



      David is playing with NEW toys.  Exhausted and frail looking 
      Kelly watches him.  Hood approaches while Rachel stands back. 

                                  HOOD
                    Hi, Kelly.

                                  KELLY
                    You re the one who saved my life.

                                  HOOD
                    You re gonna be okay.

                                  KELLY
                    I feel sorry for the childless 
                    couple.  The doctors said I can t 
                    have children again.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    60.

                                  HOOD
                    All the more love for the one you 
                    have.  You take care.

      Hood walks off as Kelly wipes a tear and David smiles at her.



      Geppetto s sitting at an ORNATE desk in a luxury suite, 
      looking through documents and smiling --

                                  GEPPETTO
                    -- and these are the girls.  All 
                    young and healthy.

      She lays out POLAROID shots of SIX young girls on the desk.

                                  GEPPETTO
                    Soon, very soon, you will both be 
                    holding your daughter in your arms, 
                    once again.

      Sitting before her is a grief stricken RICH COUPLE.  The Wife 
      picks up one of the photos, looks at it, then with anxious 
      eyes, she looks back up at Geppetto.




                              THE END
