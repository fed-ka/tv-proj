      FADE IN:

      MUSIC CUE: Gwen Stefani's "Just A Girl"

      TIGHT on a PAIR OF well-toned WOMAN'S LEGS -- feet cradled
      in Louboutin pumps, twenty-four inch waist wrapped in a tight*
      mini skirt.  PULL BACK SLOWLY to reveal we're looking at a
      reflection in a full length mirror. 

      The woman's FLAWLESS HANDS come into FRAME and hike up the
      skirt a few inches.  Then, the hands release the fabric. 
      She's adjusting, searching for the perfect skirt length.  A
      beat, the hands pull up the skirt again, almost to the point
      of a network standards note.  Then the hands tug it back
      down, just a tad.  She's frustrated.  PULL BACK FURTHER TO:

      INT. DEB & GRAYSON'S HOME - SANTA MONICA - MORNING

      The woman in the mirror is DEB DOBKINS, 22, as hot as her
      legs led us to believe she'd be.  She fidgets one last time
      and seems satisfied.  We take in her surroundings -- a bright*
      and cheerful Craftsman, right out of Veranda.

      From their bedroom, GRAYSON KENT, late 20's, so handsome it
      hurts, emerges from slumber with bedhead.  He wears sweats*
      and a UCLA LAW SCHOOL t-shirt.  Deb sees Grayson's reflection*
      in the mirror.  With complete seriousness, she asks --

                                    DEB
                    Do my knees look fat?*

      Grayson smiles. Deb wouldn't look fat next to Nicole Richie. *
      While she scrutinizes her knees, he approaches.  From behind,
      he wraps his arms around her.*

                                      GRAYSON*
                    Deb, you don't get nervous.  What's*
                    going on?*

                                    DEB*
                    Maybe I should just wear pants.*

                                      GRAYSON*
                    You and your knees are perfect.*

      She smiles.  He kisses her neck and then steps into the open*
      adjoining kitchen, she calls after him --

                                    DEB
                    What about my hair?

                    Gorgeous.

                                      GRAYSON
                      Breakfast?

      Grayson grabs a GRAPEFRUIT from the fruit bowl on the counter.

                                      GRAYSON
                      Grapefruit, two Splendas.  Deb, you
                    gotta relax, you kill at auditions.

                                    DEB
                    A prize model on "The Price is Right"
                    isn't just an audition, it's a
                    career.

      Grayson is amused by Deb.  He loves her energy and spirit.  

                                      GRAYSON
                    And with knees like yours, it's a
                    lock.

      She relaxes.  Then, as Grayson slices the GRAPEFRUIT IN HALF,
      we MATCH CUT a HALF GRAPEFRUIT TO:

      FEMALE HANDS PUSH ASIDE the GRAPEFRUIT and REACH FOR A
      CINNAMON ROLL.  The HANDS pry off the roll's outer rings,
      leaving the gooey center, which we FOLLOW into JANE BINGUM'S
      mouth.  Jane, 32, is overweight, attractively-challenged,*
      introverted and brilliant -- the opposite of Deb.

      By the look of her wrinkled, pinstriped pant suit, she's
      been working all night.  The "kitty cat" brooch on her lapel*
      is askew.  Stay with Jane as she heads into --*

      Continuing toward her office, she meets up with her assistant,
      TERI, 35, African American, librarian-hot, who's just arrived. 
      Teri gives Jane the "up-down" and quickly determines --

                                    TERI
                    You didn't go home... again.                                                                                        3.

                    Work.  I know. 

      As Jane starts to enter her office, she stops cold when --

                    Goooood morning!

      Jane turns to KIM KASTLE, 30, ZOOM smile, Michael Kors suit,
      and a blue Herm s bag which she carries like a trophy. *

                                    KIM (CONT'D)
                          (pointedly)
                    Jane, we've got Marcus Newsom this
                      afternoon.

                                    JANE
                    Yes, Kim, I know.  I've been working
                    on our prep doc --

      Teri intercedes.  Explains to Jane -- 

                                    TERI
                    It's your "day-old" outfit.  Client*
                    was here yesterday.
                          (aside, to Kim)
                    New purse?

                                    KIM
                    Herm s.  Ostrich leather.  Two year*
                    wait, but I pulled strings.
                          (then, to Jane)
                    May I offer you some constructive
                      criticism?
                          (before she can respond)
                    You look best in solid, dark colors. *
                    And no one under fifty wears a brooch. *
                    For what it's worth. *

      With that, Kim strides off.

      A PHOTO of Deb & Grayson on a beach.  PAN OVER TO the PULPED
      GRAPEFRUIT HALVES and then TO Deb, who's painted her
      fingernails RED except for one naked pinky.  She's watching
      "The Price Is Right."  Prize Model BRANDI SHERWOOD flanks a*
      NEW CAR, gesturing with her hands.  Deb imitates her gestures.

      Grayson emerges from the bathroom.  He's now dressed in an*
      Armani suit, crimson tie, and holds a bottle of blue nail*
      polish, labeled IRONIC TAFFY.

                    It was behind the Pepto.

                    Thank God for you... and my Ironic

                    You really think it's lucky, huh?

                    minutes ago.  Check this out.*

      With confidence, Deb walks for Grayson, putting too much*
      bounce in her booty.  Grayson tries to suppress a smile.*

                    You always know what to say.*

      Grayson pulls Deb toward him and they kiss.  A SCREAM from
      the T.V. grabs their attention.  A contestant's won the
      Showcase Showdown.  As WE PUSH IN ON THE T.V., MATCH CUT TO:

      JANE'S FRAMED DIPLOMA on the wall.  PAN DOWN TO JANE, who's
      at her computer.  Teri enters with a latte and gossip. 

                                    TERI
                    Kim hosted a cocktail party last
                    night, for the partners.

                                    JANE
                    She was supposed to be helping me
                    with the prep doc.

      ANGLE ON -- THE LATTE, Teri places it on Jane's desk, on TOP
      of a book, Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office.*

                                    TERI
                    You're smarter.  You work harder. 
                    The clients genuinely like you.  But
                    she's playing the game better and --

                                    JANE
                    And I can't have this conversation,
                    Teri.  Not right now. 

      As Teri gathers DRY CLEANING STUBS from Jane's desk -- 

                                    TERI
                    I'm worried about you.

                          (looks up)
                    I'm fine.  I gotta get back --

                    To work.  I know.

      Teri exits.  Jane takes a deep breath, trying to deal with
      Kim as an enemy doesn't come naturally.  She removes the
      latte from the Nice Girls book, and turns to a bookmarked*
      page entitled: Doing the Work of Others.  She reads an
      underlined passage, as a mantra:                                                                                        6.

                                    JANE
                      "Promotions are rewards for getting*
                    the job done, not necessarily doing
                    the job."*

      While reading, she reaches for her latte.  As she takes a
      sip, the lid POPS off and the coffee spills onto her blouse.

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    Damn it.

      She reaches for a tissue, but the box is empty.  Then, she
      presses her intercom buzzer.

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    Teri....  You there?  I need some
                    napkins, please.*

      No response.  Annoyed and dripping, Jane heads into --

      Emerging from her office, she calls out to Teri --

                    Teri...  What's going on?

      She now sees that everyone in the bullpen is on the ground.

                          (urgent whisper)
                    Jane --

      Teri, peaking out from under her desk, calls Jane's attention
      to a GUNMAN, 40's, brandishing a revolver.  At first, we
      think it's pointed at Jane, but we quickly realize that Jane's
      standing BETWEEN the Gunman and SENIOR PARTNER, J. PARKER,
      late 40's, distinguished.

                                      GUNMAN
                    Lady, get your ass down.

      Jane doesn't comply.  In shock, she looks to Teri who explains --

                                    TERI
                      Apparently, this gentleman has a
                    beef with Parker. 

                                      GUNMAN
                    Your boss slept with my wife.

                                      PARKER*
                    I didn't know she was married.

      Jane takes a step forward, trying to defuse the situation. 
      As she steps over Kim, on the ground in front of her, Jane's
      foot gets tangled in the strap of Kim's Hermes bag.  She
      TRIPS and FLIES toward the Gunman, who instinctively FIRES.

      INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME / HOME GYM - SAME TIME**

      STACY PUNT, 22, Sports Illustrated swimsuit sexy, wearing a
      lycra sports bra and impossibly tight bike shorts, sobs into
      the phone -- mascara bleeding down her cheeks. 

                                      STACY
                    Scott dumped me.

      Despite her emotional pain, she continues her leg lifts. 
      Her Chihuahua, TYRA, yaps throughout.

                                    DEB
                    Oh, Stacy.  I'm so sorry. 

                                      STACY
                    He said I was... I was... shallow.

                                    DEB
                    Hello --  Has he seen the indie films*
                    in your Netflix queue? *

      As Deb reapplies lipstick in the rear-view mirror, she makes
      a WRONG TURN down a ONE WAY street.  A PRODUCE TRUCK, filled
      with tangerines, comes toward her, but she's oblivious. 

                                      STACY
                    I can't afford this place on my own. *
                    And Tyra hates moving.  It makes her
                    all gassy.*

      Stacy rubs Tyra's belly, not missing a beat of her workout.*                                                                                        8.

                                    DEB
                    Maybe you should get, like, a job?*

                                      STACY
                          (offended)
                    I'm a model.

      The truck is seconds away from careening into Deb.

                                    DEB
                    And a damn good one.  But you haven't
                    worked since the J.C. Penney spread --

                                      STACY
                          (defensive)
                    The layout was printed on recycled
                    paper.  The grain added ten pounds.

      The truck's horn SCREAMS, but it's too late.  Deb looks up
      as the truck's grille, with a GIANT PAINTED SMILING TANGERINE,
      bares down on her.  BAM!!  SMASH!!  SQUISH!!  DEADLY QUIET.

                                      STACY (CONT'D)
                    Deb...  Sweetie?... Can you hear me
                    now?  Okay, call me back.*

      As "Glamorous" swells, we CUT TO:

      INT./EXT. THE PEARLY GATES - MORNING

      HARP MUSIC PLAYS, FOG WAFTS, EVERYTHING IS WHITE.  CAMERA
      PANS FROM ROWS of COMPUTER TERMINALS TO an ELEVATOR BANK. 
      An ELEVATOR OPENS and OUT WALKS DEB, in a white robe.  She's
      confused, out-of-sorts.

      FRED, 20's, in a white oxford and slacks, approaches.  He's
      nerdy-cute with attitude.  Think Adam Brody meets Woody Allen.

                                    FRED
                    Ms. Dobkins, I'm Fred, your Gate
                    Keeper.  Apologies for your sudden
                    demise.  Follow me.

        A bewildered Deb follows Fred past several terminals, staffed
      with other gate keepers assisting the "dead," to his station.*

                                    FRED (CONT'D)
                    Have a seat. 

      Fred rounds his desk and turns his attention to the computer. 
      Deb composes herself, then, still standing --

                                    DEB*

                    Come on, Fred, you seem like a sweet*
                    guy.  Help me out --*

      Deb deliberately opens her robe, revealing a hint of cleavage.*

                                    FRED
                    Pouting may work on Earth, but up
                    here it's white noise. 
                          (re: cleavage)
                    And you may want to cover-up, there's
                    a draft.  Now, sit.

      Deb complies, but she's furious.  Fred types on his keyboard.

                                    DEB
                    What are you doing?

                    Why?

                                    FRED
                          (like it's obvious)
                    Heaven or hell. 

                                    DEB
                    Sweetie, I'll save you the time.  If
                    I'm going anywhere, it's heaven.                                                                                      10.

                                    FRED

                          (a beat, then)
                    I buy Girl Scout cookies every year. 
                    And I don't even eat white flour
                    carbs.

                                    FRED

                    Because coins looks lumpy in your

                    Ms. Dobkins, I see a lot of bad people

                    you're not one of the good ones,
                    either.  Given our brief time*
                    together, I would conclude you're*
                    simply... shallow.*

      Under this, Deb eyes a list of RULES printed on Fred's desk. 
      Her eyes fall on RULE #10: THE RETURN BUTTON SHALL NOT BE
      PRESSED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.

                                    FRED
                    What're you going to do about it?

                                    DEB
                    Let's find out.

      Deb eyes Fred's keyboard and sees the RETURN button.  Before*
      he can stop her, she reaches across his desk and presses it. *
      A clap of thunder and Deb is engulfed in WHITE LIGHT.  As*
      she disappears, a SUPERVISOR races over to Fred --*

                                      SUPERVISOR
                    What the hell is going on?

                                    FRED
                    My client, she pressed return.

                                      SUPERVISOR
                    Clients do not touch the computers.

                                    FRED
                    The woman had no boundaries.*

      Supervisor regards the data on Fred's computer --*

                    Her body is in a million pieces. 
                    She can't return to it.

                                    FRED
                    So what happens?

                                      SUPERVISOR
                    Her soul gets rerouted to the nearest*
                    available body.

      Supervisor eyes a WOMAN, in a white robe, sitting at another
      station.  IT'S JANE!  PUSH IN TIGHT and MATCH CUT TO:

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

      TIGHT on JANE in a hospital bed.  Doctors are working her
      up.  Suddenly, a LOUD BEEP as she flatlines on the EKG.

                                      DOCTOR
                    I need the paddles.

      A NURSE hands the doctors the paddles.                                                                                      12.

                                      DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Clear!

      As the doctor is about to PADDLE Jane, her eyes FLUTTER OPEN! 
      Deb sees Jane's reflection in the overhead surgical mirror. 
      Confused, she touches her face.  She realizes she's looking
      at her own REFLECTION.  Overcome with horror, she SCREAMS!!! 

                                                                              FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

      The Doctor examines an x-ray of Jane's torso.  He reports to
      the Nurse, who stands over Jane, asleep in the bed.

                                      DOCTOR
                    The wound is superficial.  She didn't
                    require a stitch.

                                      NURSE
                    But the EKG?  She flatlined?

      As they talk, Fred steps into the doorway.  

                                      DOCTOR
                    It's a miracle.
                          (with a knowing smile)
                    Or the battery in the monitor went
                    dead.  It happens.

      Nurse sees Fred.

                                      NURSE
                    You a friend?

                          (considers)
                    Sure.

                                      DOCTOR
                    She's a lucky lady.  'Cept for a*
                    minor abrasion and a bump on the*
                    head from her fall, she's fine.

                                    FRED
                      I couldn't be happier.

      Doctor and Nurse start to leave.  Doctor turns back to Fred.

                                      DOCTOR
                    Oh, Sir, she woke up briefly and
                    thought she was someone else.  We
                    sedated her. 

                                    FRED
                          (under his breath)
                    Wish I had thought of that.

                                      DOCTOR
                    Temporary amnesia is not uncommon
                    with a slight concussion; we'll be
                    keeping her under observation.                                                                                       14.

      Doctor and Nurse exit.  Fred waits a beat, and then he puts
      his hand on her shoulder.  We think he's going to gently
      wake her up, but he SHAKES her.  

                                    FRED
                    Wake up!  You hear me, up!

      Groggily, Jane opens her eyes.  (Note: It's now Deb's soul
      in Jane's body, but we will continue to refer to her as Jane
      since that's how the world will know her.)

                                    JANE
                    I just had the strangest dream.

                                    FRED
                    It wasn't a dream, Sweetie.

                                    JANE
                          (bolts up)
                    Fred?

                                    FRED
                    Yup.

                                    JANE
                          (panicked)
                    Why do I feel bloated?

      She lifts her arms and sees her "plumpness."

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    Oh my God, you sent me to hell!

                                    FRED
                    Relax, your soul entered a recently
                    vacated vessel.  Your old body wasn't --

                                    JANE
                    No.  No.  No.  I'm going back to
                    sleep and when I wake up --

      Jane shuts her eyes tightly.  Fred grabs a doctor's head-
      mirror (a mirror on a headband) from the counter top.

                                    FRED
                    Her name, now your name, is Jane.

      Jane opens her eyes.  Once again, she sees "Jane's face" in
      the head mirror.  She flips out.

                                    JANE
                    This doesn't work for me.

                                    FRED
                    You should've considered that before
                    you pressed "return."*                                                                                      15.*

                                    JANE
                            (hyperventilating)
                    You don't understand.  I've never
                    been more than a size 2 and that was
                    only 'cause of the freshman 15, which
                    is why I quit community college.
                          (then)
                    Who do I have to talk to?

                                    FRED
                    Look on the bright side, you don't
                    just get Jane's body, you get her
                    brains, too.  Her IQ's off the charts.  *

                                    JANE
                    Okay.  I think I get what's going*
                    on.  This is like "Freaky Friday"*
                    when Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee*
                    Curtis got identical fortune cookies*
                    and woke up in each others bodies --*

                                      FRED*
                    Jane --*

                                      JANE*
                    Or maybe more like "Shrek the Third,"*
                    when a magic spell caused Donkey and*
                    Puss in Boots to swap.  Fred, just*
                    tell me how to get "me" back.*

                                      FRED*
                    You are Jane, now and forever. *
                      Everything you need to know about*
                    her... about you... is in here.*

      Fred picks up a brown purse, sitting by the nightstand.*

                                    JANE
                    A Mossimo bag from Target?

                                    FRED
                    Jane's purse.  Wallet, license,
                    business cards, credit cards, cell...

      Jane looks inside, pulls out the brooch.  She's despondent.*

                                      JANE*
                    She wears a brooch?  No one under*
                    fifty wears a brooch...*

      She puts it back and pulls out a lipstick --*

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    And I haven't used Cover Girl since*
                    I was twelve.                                                                                      16.

                                    FRED
                    Buy a new purse, jewelry, lipstick,*
                    I don't care.  One rule -- you don't
                    tell anyone what happened, got it?

                                    JANE
                    Why?

                                    FRED
                    Because the dead aren't supposed to
                    body swap!  People will think you're
                    nuts and I'll be forced to send you
                    back, and not to the "good place."*

                                    JANE
                    If I'm Jane, why do I still remember
                      everything about me, huh?  Shouldn't
                    I know all about her?

                                    FRED
                          ("no")
                    Memories remain with the soul. 

                                    JANE
                    Whatever.  I'm out of here.

      Wearing her hospital gown and slippers, Jane races out. 
      Fred, annoyed, has no choice but to watch her go.

      INT./EXT. DEB & GRAYSON'S HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

      Jane enters through a window.  She takes in the room.  She
      spots Grayson's UCLA LAW t-shirt (from the Teaser) on the*
      bed.  She touches it.  Smells it.  Tears well up.  She crosses
      to her closet, organized by season, and selects a skirt.*

      She takes off the hospital gown and steps into the skirt. 
      RIP!  She grabs another.  Repeats.  RIP!  She starts to shake. 

      Out of options, she puts on Grayson's robe.  Then, she opens
      another closet to reveal hundreds of pairs of high-end women's
      shoes, which bring momentary comfort.  She grabs a pair of
      Gucci heels, hugs them tightly, and slips them on.  The phone
      RINGS.  She starts to grab it, but realizes she can't.  The
      machine answers.

                                      ANSWERING MACHINE
                    Hey, it's Deb... and Grayson, leave
                    your message at the -- BEEP.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Grayson, it's Angie, Deb's sister. 
                    Calling to let you know...
                          (voice cracking)
                    The funeral is tomorrow at noon. 
                    The family's meeting at my place.  I
                    hope you'll join us.                                                                                      17.

      Jane hears the front door handle turn.  Quickly, she hides
      behind the bedroom door.  Through the crack, she watches --

      JANE'S POV -- Grayson enters.  He collapses on the sofa,
      cradling his head in his hands.  Devastated.  Only yards
      apart, but she can't reach out to him.  A tear rolls down
      her cheek.  Under the above, Jane has leaned on the back of
      a chair.  Suddenly, the chair CRACKS under her weight.  As
      Jane HITS the floor, the CRASH alerts Grayson.  Jane races
      for the window.  Wearing Grayson's robe and Guccis, she flees.

      Grayson enters to find the broken chair.  The window is open. 
      Off his confusion --

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER LAW FIRM / RECEPTION - DAY**

      TIGHT on the DOOR MONIKER: HARRISON & PARKER.  TILT DOWN to*
      a business card in Jane's hand.  It reads: JANE BINGUM,
      Attorney at Law, Harrison & Parker.  Jane's at the right
      place. 

      Suddenly self-conscious, she realizes several clients are
      staring at her.  (Recall: she's wearing heels and Grayson's*
      robe.)  The elevator opens and Fred emerges.*

                                    JANE
                    What are you doing here?

                                    FRED
                    The firm's looking for a new
                      messenger.  I'm applying.

                                    JANE
                    I mean, shouldn't you be back up...

      Jane points to the heavens.  Fred's aware that they're drawing
      attention.  He physically moves Jane out of earshot.

                                      FRED*
                    Jane --*

                                    JANE
                    Stop.  I hate her name.  I hate her
                    body.  I hate her clothes.  I hate --

                                    FRED
                    Shut up!
                          (off Jane's surprise)
                    I'm trying to answer your question. 
                    I'm here because of you.  I've been
                    demoted from a Gate Keeper to a
                    Guardian Angel because of you.

                                    JANE
                          (excited)
                    You're my Guardian Angel?*                                                                                      18.

                                    FRED
                    Afraid so.

                                    JANE
                    Make me skinny and hot, now. 

                                    FRED
                    I'm an angel, not a wizard.  And
                    between us, it's just a fancy term
                    for babysitter.  I'm responsible for
                      overseeing your transition and then
                    I can go back to my desk job.  So
                    let's make it quick.

                                    JANE
                    How did you find me here?

                                    FRED
                          (like it's obvious)
                    You're in Jane's body.

                                    JANE
                    So?

                                    FRED
                      Everyone's body has it's own needs,
                    cravings, comfort zones.
                          (then)
                    This firm is where Jane's body is at
                    ease.  She gets respect, her intellect
                    shines --

                                    JANE
                            (unenthusiastic)
                    Work is her comfort zone.  Fabulous.

                                    TERI (O.S.)
                    Jane!!!

      Jane turns to see Teri -

                                    TERI (CONT'D)
                    Thank God you're okay.

                                    FRED
                          (under his breath)
                    Your assistant.  Teri.

                                    JANE
                          (to Fred)
                    I've always wanted my own assistant. 

      Teri takes a look at Jane's "outfit."

                                    TERI
                    Let's get you to your office.                                                                                      19.*

      As Teri leads Jane into the bullpen, all heads turn to Jane. 
      A CUTE MALE ASSISTANT stands up from his cubical and starts*
      CLAPPING.  Then, the entire bullpen erupts into applause.

                                    JANE
                    Why are they clapping?

                                    TERI
                    You took a bullet for Parker.

      Jane smiles back at the assistant, and struts a bit --*

                                    TERI (CONT'D)
                            (concerned)*
                    Your doctor called.  Said you left
                    against his orders.

                                    JANE
                    Yes, apparently, I couldn't wait to
                    get back to work.

                                      TERI*
                    And your mother stopped by.  I didn't*
                    tell her about the whole 'being shot'*
                    thing.  You know how she is.  She*
                    wants to know when you'll call Mel.*

                                      JANE*
                    Mel?*

                                      TERI*
                    That guy she found for you, on-line. *
                    She sent you his profile, but told*
                    me to tell you his hair plugs look*
                    better in person and you'll get used*
                    to his stutter.

                                      JANE*
                    Wait, wait... What? *

                                    TERI
                    I told her you're in trial.  Bought*
                    you a week.*

      They push into --*

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / JANE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER**

      Teri opens the "wardrobe cabinet" to reveal a dozen gray and
      blue Lane Bryant suits -- fresh from the dry cleaners.  A
      couple of blouses.  Jane recoils at the sight of them.

                                    JANE
                    No.  No.  I do not wear Lame Bryant.*                                                                                      20.

                                    TERI
                    The doctor said you might have
                    amnesia, but come on, you love Ms.
                    Bryant. 
                          (a smile)
                    They're "stretchy and comfortable."

      As Teri lays out a gray pant suit on the sofa --

                                    TERI (CONT'D)
                    Come on, get dressed.

      Jane is mortified.  A beat, then --

                                    JANE
                    Look, Sweetie, I don't think --

                                    TERI
                    Sweetie?  Did you just call me
                    Sweetie?

      Jane's not sure what she's done wrong.

                                    JANE
                    I guess.  I don't know...  Why?*

      Teri knuckles Nice Girls still on her desk.*

                                    TERI
                    You don't use cutesy pet names. 
                    It's in your books...  Something
                    about diminishing your power center. 

                                    JANE
                    Right.  What was I thinking?

                                    TERI
                          (eyes Jane's Guccis)
                    Your sensible shoes are in the
                    credenza.

                                    JANE
                          (re: Guccis)
                    These babies go with everything.

      Teri, baffled, exits.  As she closes the door, reveal a full
      length mirror affixed to it.  Jane sees her reflection; it's
      still shocking.  Then, with dread, she looks over at the
      hideous pant suit awaiting her. 

      MUSIC CUE: Spoon's "I Turn My Camera On"

      A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

      1. Looking in the mirror, Jane wears the GRAY pant suit. 
      She hates it.  (Note: She continues to wear her Guccis.)                                                                                      21.

      2. Looking in the mirror, Jane wears a BLUE pant suit.  It's
      not any better.  She crosses to the wardrobe cabinet, and
      searches until she finds -- a SKIRT suit.

      3. Looking in the mirror, Jane wears the SKIRT SUIT.  She's
      not happy, but then she gets an idea.

      4. Jane crosses to her desk and finds paperclips.  She hems*
      her dress, crudely raising the hem line above the knees.

      5. In the mirror, Jane adjusts the skirt length, just as she
      did in the Teaser (as Deb).  She's not happy.  As she focuses
      on her LARGE KNEES, the door opens -- SMACKING INTO HER.

      Music STOPS.  Parker enters.

                                      PARKER
                    Jane --

      He starts to hug Jane, who remains wooden.  He ends up patting
      her on the shoulder.

                                      PARKER (CONT'D)
                    Thank God you're okay.  The gunman
                    was apprehended, everyone's fine,*
                    and I promise to inquire about the
                    marital status of all future dates. 
                          (notices her outfit)
                    How're you feeling?

                                    JANE
                    Not quite myself, but --*

      Teri enters, takes one look at Jane's hemmed skirt --

                                    TERI
                    What's going on here?

                                    JANE
                    I was trying something.

                                    TERI
                    Let me help.

      Teri unpins Jane's skirt, allowing the fabric to unfurl.

                                      PARKER
                    Marcus Newsom's on his way up.  Given
                    the circumstances, Kim will take
                    over as first chair.

      Teri looks to Jane, who doesn't react.  Teri steps in --

                                    TERI
                    Mr. Parker, with all due respect, 
                    Jane brought the case to the firm. 
                    She knows the client better than --                                                                                      22.

                                      PARKER
                            (dismissive)
                    Thank you for your input, Teri.

      Teri doesn't give up, she prattles on --

                                    TERI
                    Kim ditched their last depo for a
                    Botox touch-up.  And Jane's been
                    working nights and --

                                      PARKER
                            (interrupts)
                    Jane, you need anything, let me know.

      Parker exits.

                                    TERI
                    You must be furious.

                                    JANE
                    Who's Marcus Newsom?

                                    TERI
                    Funny.
                          (off Jane, clueless)
                    Yikes.  Okay.  Newsom is suing Upland
                      Pharmaceuticals.  Apparently, his
                    wife suffered an hallucination after
                    taking a sleeping pill.  She thought
                    she was a bird.  Tried to fly.  Fell
                    20 stories.  Yada.  Yada.  Does any
                    of this ring a bell?

                                    JANE
                    No... But I imagine we're suing for
                    wrongful death...

                                    TERI
                    And --

                                    JANE
                          (finishes her thought)
                    Failure to disclose, lack of informed
                    consent, fraud and possible product
                      liability, although that's tenuous.

      Jane is shocked at her sudden knowledge of the law.  It
      literally hurts her head.

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    Damn.  That was intense. 
                          (a beat, then to Teri)
                    Ask me something.  Something a smart
                    person would know.                                                                                      23.

                                    TERI
                    Huh?

                                    JANE
                    Like, what's the capital of New
                      Zealand...?  Wellington.*

      Jane laughs at herself, enjoying her "brain rush."*

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                          (on a roll)
                    What's the square root of 113?... 
                    It's a prime number!  Trick question. 
                    Listen to me...  Ha!*

                                    TERI
                    Are you okay?

                                    JANE
                    I'm smart!

                                    TERI
                    Yes, you are.  Now, march into that
                      conference room and show Kim that
                    brains trump Botox.

                                    JANE
                    If she wants to be first chair, let
                    her. 
                          (eyes outfit in mirror)
                    I need retail therapy... and fast.

      Teri isn't pacified.  She persists --

                                    TERI
                    When Kim beats you out for partner,*
                    you'll be okay with that?*
                          (off Jane's uncertainty)*
                    Jane, I don't know what's going on,*
                    but I'm here for you.  And everything
                    you need to know is in here.*

      Teri grabs a FILE.  She starts to hand it to Jane, but she's*
      distracted.  As Jane fans herself with both hands --*

                                    JANE
                    It's too hot in this office.

                                    TERI
                    We've been through this a million
                    times.  It's not hot, it's just your
                      metabolism.

                                    JANE
                    Yeah well, my "metabolism" is making*
                    me sweat.  I need some air.*                                                                                      24.

      Jane crosses to her window and tries to open it.

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    They don't open?

                                    TERI
                    We're in an office building, Jane. 
                    They're sealed.

                                    JANE
                    Then I'm going out.

      Jane exits.  Teri, with the file, dogs her.  They head into --

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS**

      Jane barrels down the corridor, followed by Teri.  MARCUS
      NEWSOM, 30, handsome, sympathetic, approaches.

                                    TERI
                    Mr. Newsom --

      He blows past Teri, towards Jane.  He's concerned --

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    Jane, I just heard.  Are you really
                    okay?

                                    TERI
                            (interjects)
                    Flesh wound.  One band-aid.  She's --

      Kim sticks her head out of a conference room.

                                    KIM
                    She's fine, Marcus.  We should get
                    started.

                                    JANE
                    Why don't you go on without --

      Teri hands Jane the PREP DOC file.  With concern --*

                                    TERI
                    Buzz me if you need anything.

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    Jane?

      Jane finds she can't protest.  OFF her look --

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

      Jane and Kim sit across from Marcus Newsom.  Jane reads her
      prep doc under the following --                                                                                      25.

                                    KIM
                    ... Tomorrow the defense will try to*
                    rattle you.  Undermine your
                      credibility.

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                      Credibility?  I was her husband.

                                    KIM
                    The defense is arguing your wife was
                    suicidal. 

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    That's bull --

                                    KIM
                    You contend she was happy and healthy. 
                    If they undermine your credibility,
                    it'll call Lisa's mental state into
                    question.

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    How can they say anything about Lisa? 
                    They didn't know her. 

                                    KIM
                    That's right, Marcus.  They didn't
                    know your wife.  So they'll go after
                    you.  Try to get you to admit she
                    was unstable in some way.  You have
                    to remain calm.

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                          (raising his voice)
                    Calm?  Lisa's dead because she took
                    their drug, and if you expect me to
                    remain calm, you have no idea what
                    it's like to lose someone you love --

      Marcus' last line grabs Jane's attention.  She looks up for
      the first time.  Given her situation, she CAN relate to him.

                                    KIM
                    Marcus, I'm on your side, but --

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    But what?  I should put on a happy
                    face?

      At this point, Jane's attention drifts to a plate of donuts
      on the table.  Kim sees Jane eyeing the donuts. 

                                    KIM
                    I think someone needs a snack. 

      Kim pushes the donuts toward Jane, who declines. *                                                                                      26.

                                    JANE
                    I'm fine.  Please continue.

                                    KIM
                    I'm sorry, Jane.  I didn't mean to
                    embarrass you.
                          (to Marcus)
                    Some people just can't help
                      themselves.

      Jane takes a beat.  Kim's remark has sparked an idea.

                                    JANE
                    You're absolutely right, Kim. 
                          (off Kim's confusion)
                    Some people can't help themselves
                    because we're all products of our
                    past.  I'm craving a donut because,
                      apparently, I'm a donut eater.  You're
                    telling a young widower to be
                      dispassionate.  Well, that's not who
                    he is.  And that's not the strategy
                    that Jane... I mean, that I, outlined
                    in the prep doc.

                    What's going on here?

                                    JANE
                    Marcus, under most circumstances I
                    would agree with Kim.  But the jury's
                    not going to sympathize unless they
                    see your pain.

                          (a beat, then)
                    Parker said that Kim will be first
                    chair tomorrow.

                                    KIM
                    That's right.

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    Jane, you're first chair.  And we're
                    done here.

      Marcus excuses himself.  As he exits, Kim looks to Jane, who
      pointedly takes a big bite of a chocolate donut and exits.*

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER**

      Jane, chocolate on her lip, approaches Teri at her desk.

                                    TERI
                    How'd it go?                                                                                      27.*

      Jane continues to eat, rather she savors, the donut.*

                                      JANE*
                    This donut...  It's just sweetened*
                    dough and congealed chocolate, but...*
                    wow.  Teri, did you have one?*

      With a tissue, Teri wipes the chocolate from Jane's lip.*

                                      TERI*
                    The case, Jane? *

                                    JANE
                          (not so thrilled)*
                    I'm back to first chair, again. *

                                    TERI
                      Fantastic.

                                    JANE
                    That was exhausting.  I'm going home --

                                    TERI
                    You've got a dinner.  A new client, *
                    Vicky Wellner.  She's divorcing her*
                    husband.  You're meeting at Mozan in*
                    twenty minutes.

                                      JANE*
                    Oh my God.  Beyonce ate there last*
                    week... Saw it on TMZ. *

                                    TERI
                    You were there that night.  You raved*
                    about the calamari.

                                    JANE
                          (pretending to recall)
                    Oh yeah --*
                          (reluctantly)
                    Give me the details.

                                    TERI
                    You ate it with cocktail sauce and
                    lemon juice?

                                    JANE
                    Details on the case. 

                                    TERI
                    Right.  I'll call you in your car,
                    which I just had washed...  You're*
                    welcome.

      As Teri hands Jane her car keys, Jane spies the keychain
      with a distinctive PORSCHE cloisonn  crest.                                                                                      28.

                                    JANE
                          (psyched)
                    I drive a Porsche?

      Teri is getting annoyed with all these questions --*

                                    TERI
                    Even if I had amnesia, I couldn't*
                    forget that car.*
                          (then)*
                    You bought it after reading 15 Steps*
                    To A Better You.  "Giving yourself*
                    an outrageous gift" was step two. *
                          (then)
                    Giving me one is step three.*
                          (off silence)
                    That was a joke.  Now, get --*

      Jane snags the keys.  She starts to exit, then turns back --*

                                    JANE
                    Where's my --

                                    TERI
                    P3.  Space 72.

      INT./EXT. JANE'S PORSCHE - EVENING

      Jane's behind the wheel of a Carrera convertible, top down. 
      She eyes herself in the rear view mirror and reacts -- her
        reflection's still jarring.  She pivots the mirror so she
      can't see herself.

      Car phone RINGS!  GPS SCREEN READS: TERI.  Jane's not sure
      how to answer.  She mistakenly turns on the stereo, Pavarotti
      blares.  AGH!  Seeing the phone icon, she presses it. 

                                    JANE
                          (shouts)
                    Hello, Teri!

      INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER - BULLPEN - SAME TIME

      Teri, at her desk, hears static which can only mean one thing --

                                    TERI
                    Your top's down?  You don't put the
                    top down.

      Jane eyes the CD's in the console -- opera and classical.

                                    JANE
                    Can you pick me up some CDs for my
                    Porsche?  Fergie, Christina, Colbie --*                                                                                      29.

                                    TERI
                    Sure...  Now, about the case.  Mrs.*
                    Wellner is --

      Under the above, Jane has pivoted the rear-view mirror back *
      into place.  She works up courage to look at herself again. *
      Then, she reaches into her purse and takes out a lipstick. *
      As she applies, we see she's not happy  --*

                                    JANE
                    And I need lip gloss -- KissKiss,
                    Granite Magic...
                          (looks in mirror again)
                    And the plumper and a luminizer...
                    and an eyelash curler.  Do I even
                    have eyelashes?

      Teri's had enough.  She focuses Jane's attention --

                                    TERI
                    Jane!  Your client's husband has a
                    net worth of five mil, but the prenup*
                    only gives her a hundred grand.

                                    JANE
                    If she was dumb enough to sign one --

                                    TERI
                    Prenup has an infidelity clause.  He
                    cheats, the prenup goes bye-bye.

                                    JANE
                    Smart girl.  Tell me he cheated.

                                    TERI
                    With their dog walker.  Your client
                    caught them together.

                                    JANE
                    He's a clich .  But ca-ching, she
                    gets half.

                                    TERI
                    Not so fast.  She refuses to go to
                    court and --

                                    JANE
                    And the only way to have a prenup
                    voided and marital assets split, is
                    by a Court Order from a Judge.  The
                    client would have to testify.
                          (then, grabs forehead)
                    Ouch.                                                                                      30.

      INT. MOZAN - EVENING

      TIGHT ON VICKY WELLNER's right foot, shaking nervously.  PAN
      UP to her face -- no makeup, tired eyes, late 30's.  She
      sits across from Jane, a platter of calamari between them.

                                      VICKY
                      Courtrooms make me uncomfortable. 
                    The thought of taking that stand --
                    no, no way.  I'm sorry.

      Jane pops a calamari ring into her mouth.  She relishes it.*

                                    JANE
                          (sounding like Deb)
                    But you need to testify --

                                      VICKY
                    Are you whining?

                                    JANE
                          (clears throat)
                    I'm giving you my expert legal
                    opinion. 
                          (offers)
                    Calamari?  They're just rings of*
                    squid lightly fried in beer batter,*
                    but... wow.*

                                      VICKY
                    Look, Ms. Bingum -- I thought I was*
                    clear with Parker.  I want to settle
                    without going to court.

      Jane takes it in.  Then asks an unorthodox question.

                                    JANE
                    Mrs. Wellner, how much do you think
                    you're worth?

                                      VICKY
                    Why?

                                    JANE
                    If you don't think you're worth much,
                    why should he?

                                      VICKY
                    I gave up my career.  Put him through
                    business school.  Raised our children. 
                    Loved him unconditionally.  What do
                    you think?

                                    JANE
                    Doesn't matter what I think.                                                                                      31.

                                      VICKY
                    I should get half.  I'm worth half.

      At this point, Vicky's foot stops tapping.

                                    JANE
                    Then that's what we'll get.

      Off Jane, no idea how she's going to deliver on her promise.

      INT. PORSCHE DRIVING - NIGHT

      Jane's GPS informs her she's HOME - a modest 2br/2ba cookie-
      cutter.  HARD CUT TO:

      INT. JANE'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

      Jane enters and stops cold.  Decor SCREAMS "lonely single
      woman": flower prints, collectible plates, Ann Geddes posters,
      and a painting of Jane with a cat.  She pauses at stack of
      self help books: Self Esteem & Plus Size Women, Losing Weight
      While Climbing the Corporate Ladder, etc.  Startled by a
      MEOW, she looks down to find a CAT, the one from the painting. 
      She may be Jane, but Deb has had enough!  SHE CAN'T TAKE IT;
      SHE WON'T LIVE HERE.

      A SERIES of QUICK POPS as Jane gathers the essentials: 1.
      clothing, 2. jewelry (selected pieces), 3. the cat.*

      FADE IN:

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - NIGHT

      We recognize this house from the Teaser.  It's Stacy's. 
      Jane, armed with the cat, knocks on the door.  The PEEK-A-
      BOO slot flies open so that Jane and Stacy are face to face.

                                      STACY
                    If you're selling Girl Scout cookies,
                    you're too old.  If you're selling
                    Avon, you forgot your face.  If you're
                    selling God, bless me and go.

      Stacy slams the slot closed.  Jane knocks again. 

                                    JANE
                    Stacy, it's me.  Deb.

      The peek-a-boo opens again.

                                      STACY
                    My best friend was a "Deb" and she*
                    died this morning.
                          (showing vulnerability)
                    So just leave me alone, okay?

                                    JANE
                    Stace, it's me.  I swear.  Please,
                    let me explain --

                                      STACY
                    Pork Chop, I'm calling the cops.

      As Stacy starts to close the slot, Jane thinks fast --

                                    JANE
                    I can prove it.  Senior year, John
                    Wahl gave you crabs.  Who else knows
                    that?

                                      STACY
                    He gave them to every cheerleader
                    and two guys on the wrestling team.

                                    JANE
                          (tries again)
                    When you were in your binge purge
                    phase, you ate your brother's 
                    birthday cake and blamed the dog.

                                      STACY
                    I told that to my shrink -- Dr. Loose
                    Lips.  Nice try.                                                                                      33.

      Stacy slams the slot.  Jane screams to her, rattling off --

                                    JANE
                    In tenth grade you got a nose job
                    but told everyone you were in France. 
                    You put Crazy Glue in Sue Bundy's
                    underwear for giving your boyfriend
                    a hand job during "Erin Brockovich." *
                    You were too nervous to buy yourself
                      a vibrator so I bought you "Boris*
                      Pecker"...*

      The slot opens again.  Jane is winning her over --

                                      STACY
                    Deb?

                                    JANE
                    You bleach your chin hairs because
                    plucking gives you hiccups.

      Stacy flings open the door.  She hugs Jane -- although she
      can't quite get her arms all they way around.  Off Stacy's
      expression, we HARD CUT TO:

      INT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER**

      Jane and Stacy in mid-conversation.  (Note: The sleek house,
      decorated a la Ian Schrager, overlooks the city -- a sharp
      contrast to Jane's place.)

                                      STACY
                    ... This is all my fault.  If I hadn't
                    called you.  If you hadn't been
                    talking on the phone --

                                    JANE
                    That's insane.  And, BTW, so sorry
                    about Scott.

                                      STACY
                          (stoically)
                    I can do better.

      As Stacy speaks, Jane's eyes land on the fireplace mantle,
      decked with photos.  Among them, a PHOTO of DEB & GRAYSON, 
      dancing at a club.  It cuts her to the core.

                                      STACY (CONT'D)
                    I said, I can do better.  And you
                    say, "Of course you can, Sweetie."*

      Jane doesn't respond.  Stacy follows her eye line.

                                      STACY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, Deb, you're not gonna tell*
                    Grayson?                                                                                      34.*

                                    JANE
                    I'm Jane now, and Deb's the reason I
                    can't tell him.  He loved her, but
                    he'd run from this.

      Jane holds up her plump arms, letting them droop.  A beat. *
      Jane tries to change the subject --*

                                    JANE (CONT'D)*
                    Hey, let's go out.  Les Deux or Hyde?*

                                      STACY*
                    Ummm.  I don't know --  We don't*
                    have to go out to have a good time.*

      Stacy's uncomfortable.  Jane gets it.*

                                      JANE*
                    That's what we said to my cousin*
                    Cindy when she stopped waxing her*
                      moustache.*

                                      STACY*
                    It's not me.  I just... I don't think*
                    you'd get across the rope, Sweetie.*
                          (then)*
                    Hey, so I know you're Jane, but do*
                    you still drink like Deb?  Splenda-*
                    mojitos?*

                                      JANE*
                    I'd rather have something to eat.*

                                      STACY*
                    But we don't eat after seven.*

                                      JANE*
                    I've been craving something --*
                          (embarrassed)*
                      Chocolate.*

      Stacy reacts, perplexed.  This is new territory.   Then --*

                                      STACY*
                      Chocolate... martinis?*

                                      JANE*
                    I can live with that.*

      Stacy gets up and crosses to the bar.  As she starts to pour*
      vodka into the shaker --*

                                      STACY
                    Hey, you said you're a lawyer.  Does*
                    that mean you're loaded?*                                                                                      35.*

                                    JANE
                    I drive a Porsche.

                                      STACY*
                    Get out.*

                                      JANE*
                    Some self-help book told "old Jane"*
                    to buy it.  Pathetic, huh?*

                                      STACY*
                    In what world is a Porsche pathetic?*

      Under the above, Stacy eyes her dog, playing with Jane's cat*
      in the corner.  They look happy.  Stacy gets an idea.

                                      STACY (CONT'D)
                    I have an idea.  A good one.  Move*
                    in with me and Tyra.  We can split*
                    the rent.

                                    JANE
                    And by split, you mean --

                                      STACY
                    You pay it... just until --

                                    JANE
                          (smiles, supportive)
                    Until you land the cover of Vogue... *
                    Roomie.

      Stacy squeals with excitement.*

                                      STACY*
                    This is going be so great.  Hey can*
                    I ask you just one question?*

                                    JANE
                    What was it like being dead?

                                      STACY
                    No, what's it like being fat?

                                                                                  CUT TO:*

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / PARKER'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY**

      Parker works at his computer.  Jane enters wearing a black
      Lane Bryant skirt suit.

                                    JANE
                    Teri said you wanted to see me.

                                      PARKER
                    You're four hours late.                                                                                      36.

                                    JANE
                    I slept in.
                          (off Parker's surprise)
                    What do you need?

                                      PARKER
                    I spoke with Mr. Wellner's counsel. 
                    He's agreed to pay five hundred grand*
                    to his wife.  We have a deal.

                                    JANE
                    I told Vicky I'd get her half.

                                      PARKER
                    They know she won't testify.  Unless
                    she's changed her mind, take it.

                                    JANE
                    Can I go?

                                      PARKER
                          (shifts gears)
                    Kim says Marcus Newsom insists you*
                    take first chair.  But I'm concerned. *
                    I heard about your amnesia and you*
                    seem a little off. *

      Before Jane can respond, Parker gets buzzed by his assistant.

                                      PARKER'S ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                    Charles Campbell on line one.

                                      PARKER
                    I've got to take this.  Jane, if
                    you're suffering from post-traumatic
                        whatever-you-call-it, get some help. 

      Parker picks up the phone, turns away from Jane.

                                      PARKER (CONT'D)
                    Chuck, how's St. Bart...?

      With his hand, Parker dismisses Jane.  Jane exits.

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER**

      Jane, annoyed, approaches the elevator.  She presses the
      DOWN ARROW.  The doors open.  She enters --

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / ELEVATOR - CONTINUES**

      Fred's inside.  He's angry.  Before Jane can say anything --

                                    FRED
                    You moved in with Stacy Punt.                                                                                      37.

                                    JANE
                    She's my best friend.

                                    FRED
                    She's Deb's best friend.  Damn it,
                    Jane.  Did you tell her?

                                    JANE
                    None of your business.

      Fred presses the EMERGENCY STOP on the elevator. 

                                    FRED
                    I have to report you.

                                    JANE
                          (a beat, then)
                    Will you get in trouble, too?

                                    FRED
                    You have no idea.

                                    JANE
                    Then don't say anything.  It's classic
                    vicarious liability.  No need for
                    you to take the blame when the fault
                    lays clearly with me, the perpetrator.

      Jane rubs her forehead.

                                    FRED
                    Wow --*

                                    JANE
                    I know.  I'm smart.  And I trust
                    Stacy. 
                          (points to belly button)
                    She never told a soul that my innie
                    was an outie before it got corrected. 
                    It's an outie again, fyi.
                          (then)
                    We cool?

                                    FRED
                    I'll think about it.

                                    JANE
                    Good enough.  Now, let's talk about
                    me.  I'm quitting this gig.  "Playing*
                    lawyer" -- not so fun.*

                                    FRED
                    You can't just up-and-leave, people
                    are depending on you.                                                                                      38.

                                    JANE
                    And I should care because...?
                          (off Fred)*
                    Look, Freddie, I'm not a morning*
                    person, I don't like schedules or*
                    meetings or Swiss Coffee walls or*
                    windows that don't open.  And as for*
                    Teri, I appreciate her whole can-do-*
                        cheerleader-routine, but she's up in-*
                      my-business.  I'm sure they'll find*
                    someone terrific to fill my Guccis.*

                                      FRED*
                    You know somethin', you're a selfish,
                      self-absorbed --
                          (cuts himself off)
                    I'm looking at Jane but all I hear
                    is Deb.

                                    JANE
                    That's because I am Deb!

                                    FRED
                    No, you're Jane.  And it's my job to
                    make sure you don't forget it.

      Suddenly, he realizes she's wearing all black. 

                                    FRED (CONT'D)
                    Jane, are you wearing black because
                    it's slimming? 

                                    JANE
                    No, Fred, I'm in black because I'm
                    on the way to a funeral... my own.

      And as Jane releases the EMERGENCY STOP on the elevator, we --

                                                                              FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:

      EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - DAY

      Grayson, tears in his eyes, delivers a eulogy to Deb's family
      and friends, including Stacy.  He stands beside an easel
      with a large PHOTO OF DEB, looking angelic while sitting on
      a swing.  Jane stands in the back row, behind TWO MODELS,
      AMY and BETH.

                                      GRAYSON
                    ... People say there are five stages*
                    of grief -- denial, anger, bargaining,
                      depression, and acceptance.  Well, I
                    can't get past my anger.  Deb was so
                    young, so full of life and love... 
                    Standing here today, I can't help
                    but remember Deb's first words to
                    me, "Are you seriously trying to
                    pull off acid wash jeans?" 
                          (muted chuckles)
                      Seriously, she changed my life.  She
                    gave me something to look forward to
                    at the end of each day.  Someone to
                    laugh with.  Someone to laugh at. 
                    Next week, we were going to celebrate
                    our one year anniversary of living
                    together.  I was planning to propose.

      Jane reacts.  Grayson begins to break down.  He tries to
      compose himself, swallows hard and takes a deep breath.

                                      GRAYSON (CONT'D)
                    Deb taught me to listen to my heart. 
                    And right now, Deb, my heart hurts.

      As Grayson continues, we RACK FOCUS to Amy and Beth.  Jane
      overhears them -

                                    BETH
                    Deb taught me patterned leggings
                    make my legs look fat.  You?

                                    AMY
                    Never mix two seasons in one outfit.

                                    BETH
                    The world is a sadder place.

      Jane's cell rings, the Jeopardy Jingle.  All heads turn. 
      Stacy, the only attendee not in black, sees Jane and excitedly
      waves.  Embarrassed, Jane answers quietly.  It's Teri.                                                                                      40.

                                    JANE
                          (sotto)
                    What?

                                    TERI (O.S.)
                    Where are you?

                                    JANE
                    Hold on.

      Jane returns her attention to Grayson, who continues  --

                                      GRAYSON
                    ... A lot of people just saw Deb as*
                    one of God's beautiful creatures...

                                    TERI (O.S.)
                    You're due in court in five minutes.

                                    JANE
                    I'm not going.

                                    TERI (O.S.)
                    What's with you?  You can't do this*
                    to Mr. Newsom. 

      Jane focuses on Grayson. 

                                      GRAYSON
                    But she was so much more.  She was
                    kind and sweet and unselfish...

      Amy takes issue with "unselfish."  Jane overhears --

                                    AMY
                    I loved her like a sorority sister,
                    but did he just say "unselfish"?

                                    BETH
                    She did give me a ride when I had my*
                    boobs done.*

                                    AMY
                    That's only 'cause she had the hots*
                    for your doctor.*

      CAMERA PUSHES IN ON JANE.  She's hurt by Deb's friends, seeing*
      her old self through their eyes is not pretty.  A beat --*

                                    JANE
                    Teri... Am I selfish?*

                                    TERI (O.S.)*
                    You volunteer for Meals-on-Wheels,    *
                    you do more pro bono than anyone at*
                    the firm, and thanks to your Christmas*
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      41.*

                                    TERI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    bonus, I send my boy to private*
                    school.  Jane, what's going on?*

      Jane smiles.  Surprisingly, it feels good to be a good person. *
      Eyeing Beth and Amy, under her breath ---*

                                      JANE*
                    I'm so not selfish.*

                                      TERI*
                    What?*

                                      JANE*
                    Teri, I'm on my way to court.*

      As Jane heads back to her Porsche, we RACK FOCUS to Grayson,*
      who curiously watches Jane depart.

      INT. LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT / COURTHOUSE - DAY**

      JUDGE LARA BASS, mid 40's, presides.  Kim sits at the
      Plaintiff's table.  The CEO of UPLAND PHARMACEUTICALS sits
      at the Defense table.  The DEFENSE ATTORNEY, male, late*
      thirties, questions Marcus Newsom.  The gallery is full; the*
      jurors are attentive.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    ... Mr. Newsom, in your deposition*
                    you characterized your wife's mental
                    state as "happy."  Is that true?

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    Yes.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                      Generally, when people can't sleep,
                    it's because something's bothering
                    them.  May I ask -- what was keeping
                    your wife up at night? 

                                    KIM
                      Objection.  Calls for speculation.

                                      JUDGE BASS
                      Overruled.  Mrs. Newsom's state of
                    mind is precisely what's at issue. 
                    The witness will answer --

      Jane enters quietly and sits down beside Kim.

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    Lisa wasn't sleeping, because we had
                    just learned she couldn't conceive.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    But you contend she was happy?                                                                                      42.

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                          (raising his voice)
                    She was a happy person, she just
                    wasn't happy about that.
                          (to the jury)
                    No one's happy all the time, right?

      Newsom eyes Jane, who approves of his emotional outburst.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    The day before she jumped from the
                    balcony, she called a Dr. Stein. 
                    What kind of doctor is he?

      A beat.  Marcus looks helpless.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Newsom?

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    He's a psychiatrist.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    No more questions.

                                      JUDGE BASS
                    Counsel --

      Jane is frantically reading over her notes.  Kim begins to
      stand when Jane gently pulls her down and stands herself.

                                    JANE
                    Just one question.  Can you describe
                    your last moments with your wife?

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    I woke up in the middle of the night. 
                    She wasn't in bed.  I found her in
                    the living room.  She was flapping
                    her arms.  And she was tweeting.

                                    JANE
                    Tweeting?

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    Tweet.  Tweet.  Like a bird.  At
                    first, I thought she was just goofing
                    around.  I tried to get her back to
                    bed, but it was like she didn't see
                    me. 
                          (tearing up)
                    Then, before I could stop her, she
                    ran onto the balcony, flapped her
                    arms, and jumped.

                                    JANE
                    Thank you.  And I'm so sorry.                                                                                      43.

      As Jane sits --

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    Your Honor, the Defense calls Dr.
                    Hiroshi Tao to the stand.

      DR. TAO, 45, erudite, expensive suit, replaces Newsom.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY (CONT'D)
                    Dr. Tao, please state your profession.

                                    DR. TAO
                    Professor of Pharmacology at Stanford
                      University.  I'm a leading scholar
                    on inhibitory neurotransmitters.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    Zolpidem is an inhibitory neuro-
                      transmitter? 

                                    DR. TAO
                    Yes.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    Do you believe Zolpidem, in any way,
                      contributed to Lisa Newsom's death?

                                    DR. TAO
                      Absolutely not.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    You sound pretty certain.

                                    DR. TAO
                    Three independent studies were
                    conducted when the drug first hit
                    the market.  In all three, it proved
                    to be an effective and safe sleep
                    aid with minimal side effects.

      Under the above, we RACK FOCUS to Kim who whispers to Jane.

                                    KIM
                    Don't forget to ask him about the
                    Stanford study.

                                    JANE
                          (alarmed)
                    That's not in my notes.

                                    KIM
                    It's the backbone of our case, Jane.

      BACK TO the Defense Attorney and Tao.                                                                                      44.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    And just to be clear, Zolpidem is
                    approved by the FDA?

                                    DR. TAO
                    For over 20 years.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    Thank you, Dr. Tao.

      Defense attorney sits, Jane stands.

                                    JANE
                    Dr. Tao, that's a beautiful suit. 
                    It looks like an Armani Collezioni. 
                    May I feel the fabric?

                                    DR. TAO
                    I guess.

                                    JANE
                          (feels fabric)
                    Italian Wool Crepe.  Like butter. 
                      Expensive?

                                    DR. TAO
                    I don't know.

                                    JANE
                    You ever watch the "The Price Is
                    Right"?
                          (off his look)
                    If you had to guess the price, what
                    would you say?

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                      Objection, Your Honor.  Relevance?

                                      JUDGE BASS
                      Sustained.

                                    JANE
                    I'd guess $2000.  $2001 if another
                      contestant bid $2000.  It's not nice,
                    but it's the smart thing to do.

                                      JUDGE BASS
                    Counsel, make your point.

                                    JANE
                    I'm thinking the witness couldn't
                    afford Armani on a professor's salary. 
                          (to Dr. Tao)
                    Sir, do you receive money from Upland,
                    the defendant?                                                                                      45.

                                    DR. TAO
                    I'm on their advisory board.  It's a
                    paid position.

                                    JANE
                    I see.  Zolpidem is Upland's most
                      successful drug, isn't it?

                                    DR. TAO
                    That's correct.

                                    JANE
                    You have an incentive to protect the
                    sales of the drug, so you can continue
                    to afford high-end items, such as
                    your suit?

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                      Objection.

                                    JANE
                      Withdrawn.  Dr. Tao, you testified
                    about clinical trials.  What about
                    real life?  Recent reports have linked
                    the drug to sleepwalking, sleep
                    eating, and even sex while asleep. 

                                    DR. TAO
                    There's a difference between odd
                    behavior and dangerous behavior.

                                    JANE
                    Are you aware that a New York woman, 
                    taking Zolpidem, opened the door to
                      a stranger and was raped?  She didn't
                    recall the attack 'til the morning.

                                    DR. TAO
                    Yes, but --

                                    JANE
                          (reads)
                    According to the Sydney Morning
                    Herald, a man jumped to his death
                    two hours after popping a Zolpidem. 
                    Are you aware of that case?

                                    DR. TAO
                          (reluctant)
                    Yes.

      Jane's hesitant about her next question.  She eyes Kim, then --

                                      JUDGE BASS
                    Counsel?                                                                                      46.

                                    JANE
                          (a beat, then)
                    Dr. Tao, can you tell me about the
                    Stanford study?

      Tao looks confused.  He eyes the Defense Attorney.  Then, to
      everyone's surprise, Kim stands and --

                                    KIM
                      Objection.

      Jane throws Kim a startled look.  What the hell is going on?  

                                      JUDGE BASS
                    You can't object to your co-counsel. 
                    Approach the Bench.  All of you.

      Jane, Kim, and the Defense Attorney approach.

                                    KIM
                    Your Honor, you granted our pre-trial 
                    motion to exclude the study because
                    the defense won't share their data.

                                      JUDGE BASS
                    Yes.  But now that your co-counsel
                    has opened the door, it's fair game.

      They return to their respective tables. 

                                      JUDGE BASS (CONT'D)
                          (to Tao)
                    Please answer the question.

                                    DR. TAO
                    The study concluded that there is no
                    link between Zolpidem and the
                      propensity to commit suicide.

      Jane's unnerved.  This wasn't in her notes.  Jane stammers.

                                    JANE
                    Marcus Newsom's wife thought she was
                    a bird.  She wasn't trying to kill
                    herself.  So the study wouldn't be
                    relevant to this case, right?

                                    DR. TAO
                    The study also concluded that the
                    patients who took the drug did not
                    suffer from hallucinations any more
                    than the general population.

      Jane is a deer in the headlights.  It appears she just lost
      the case!  A LONG beat, then Kim, full of confidence, stands --

                                    KIM
                    Dr. Tao, who paid for the study?                                                                                      47.*

                                    DR. TAO
                    Upland Pharmaceuticals.

                                    KIM
                    Has their data been submitted for
                      scientific review?

                                    DR. TAO
                    Not yet.

                                    KIM
                    So there's no way for a non-biased
                    third party to verify the findings?

                                    DR. TAO
                    Not at this time.

                                    KIM
                          (impressed with herself)*
                    Thank you, no more questions.*

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    The defense rests, Your Honor.

      Jane glares at Kim.

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / KIM'S OFFICE - DAY**

      Kim is at her desk, when Jane barrels in. 

                                    JANE
                    You set me up.  You took advantage
                    of... of my memory lapse.

                                    KIM
                    You think?  Maybe you shouldn't try
                    a case if you can't recall the*
                    details.*

      Jane takes a beat, tries a new tactic.*

                                      JANE*
                      I understand you, Kim.  I mean, I*
                    get who you are.*

                                    KIM*
                    You get me?*

                                      JANE*
                      Everything's a competition.  Every*
                    woman, a threat.  Every man, a*
                    conquest.

                                    KIM*
                    Jane, between you and me, you're no*
                    threat.*                                                                                      48.

      Jane eyes Kim's "Herm s bag" on her credenza.  She grabs it. *

                                    JANE
                    You know something, you and this
                      Herm s-knockoff have a lot in common -- *
                    You look pretty, but you're cheap.
                          (before Kim can protest)*
                    Don't even try -- they haven't done
                    ostrich in peacock blue since '03... *
                    I know fraud-a when I see it.*

      She tosses the bag AT Kim.  (As Jane tosses the bag, her left
      breast jumps half-way out of her bra.)

                                    KIM
                    Look at you, so full of spunk.  You're
                    bursting at the seams.

      Kim points.  Embarrassed, Jane adjusts.  Parker enters.

                                      PARKER
                    What the hell happened in court?

                                    KIM
                    Don't worry, I --

                                      JANE*
                    We showed the jury that Upland IS
                    studying the drug's potential suicidal
                    and hallucinogenic effects, but NOT
                    sharing the data.  It now appears
                    they're hiding something.

      Kim is steamed but can't say anything.

                                      PARKER
                    You used their study against them. 
                    Good work.
                          (a beat, then)
                    Jane, Vicky Wellner and opposing
                    counsel are in the conference room. 

      As Jane starts to head off, he orders --

                                      PARKER (CONT'D)
                    Accept their offer.

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

      TIGHT ON JANE --

                                    JANE
                    We do not accept the offer.

      REVEAL Jane flanked by Vicky.  They sit across from MR.
      WELLNER, late 30's, intimidating, and his pit bull ATTORNEY.                                                                                      49.

                                      ATTORNEY
                    Parker assured me --*

                                    JANE
                    He doesn't speak for the client.

                                      ATTORNEY
                    What are you looking for?

      Under the above, Mrs. Wellner's foot taps nervously.  Mr.
      Wellner looks under the table and makes a mental note of it. 
      Then, he tries to look Vicky in the eye, making her
      uncomfortable.  Before Jane can respond, Mr. Wellner attacks --

                                    MR. WELLNER
                    I don't give a rat's behind what she
                    wants.  We have a prenup.  If you
                    want to challenge it, fine by me. 
                    I'll see you in court. 
                          (to Jane)
                    Our offer's off the table and you're
                    indecent, Ms. Bingum.

      Jane looks down, and sees her breast is once again jumping
      for higher ground.  Annoyed and embarrassed, she adjusts.

                                    MR. WELLNER (CONT'D)
                    Let's go.

      Mr. Wellner and his attorney exit.  Vicky turns to Jane.

                                      VICKY
                    We made a terrible mistake.

                                    JANE
                    Worst case scenario, we go to court.

                                      VICKY
                    Why aren't you hearing me?  I won't
                    testify.

                                    JANE
                    We're talking two-point-five million
                    dollars. 

      Vicky is silent.  Jane thinks she knows what's going on.

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    How did that man rob you of your
                    self esteem?  Ten years ago, I bet
                    you'd've testified.  Where's that
                    woman?

                                      VICKY
                    It may sound irrational to you, but
                    money isn't everything.                                                                                       50.

      Vicky exits.  Jane rests her head in her hands, trying to
      THINK.  A beat.  Then, a KNOCK on the interior window of the
      conference room.  It's Parker.  He motions to her.

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER**

      Jane emerges to find an irate Parker.

                                      PARKER
                    I just bumped into opposing counsel --

                                    JANE
                    They pulled their offer.  It's a
                    setback.

                                      PARKER
                    Do you know why I assigned this case
                    to you and not Kim?
                          (off Jane, no idea)
                    I thought you'd understand Vicky's*
                    fears and insecurities.*

                                    JANE
                    Why would you think that?

                                      PARKER
                    I see those self-help books you're
                    always reading... You and Vicky are
                    cut from the same cloth so why are
                    you fighting her wishes?

                                    JANE
                      Because... because... I'm not the
                    person you think I am.

      With that, she storms off --

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / JANE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER**

      An upset Jane returns to her office, followed by Teri.

                                    TERI
                    What's wrong?

                                    JANE
                    What's right?  I screwed up Mrs.
                    Wellner's case.  Parker thinks I'm
                    insecure. 
                          (eyes the mirror)
                    I hate my wardrobe...

      In the mirror she sees her left breast escaping again.

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    My left breast has a mind of its
                    own.  And it's like a thousand degrees
                    in this office. 
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      51.

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                          (breaking down)
                    I can't do this anymore.

                                    TERI
                    Sit.

      Jane complies.  Teri reaches into Jane's lower desk drawer
      and pulls out a canister of Cheez Whiz.

                                    TERI (CONT'D)
                    Open your mouth.  Trust me.  Open
                    it.  Now.

      Jane's jaw clamps shut.  Teri literally gets on top of Jane
      to PRY open her mouth.  Then, she SQUIRTS the Cheez Whiz.  A
      beat.  Jane relaxes.

                                    JANE
                    Oh my God.  That stuff --

                                    TERI
                    Cheez Whiz.

                                    JANE
                    It's like Xanax.  Hit me again.

                                    TERI
                    Just one more.  I won't work for an
                    addict.

      Teri gives Jane a squirt, and then she lays out a game plan.

                                    TERI (CONT'D)
                    Lets talk this through.  First, your
                    wardrobe, you have an allergy to
                    natural fibers so that limits your
                    options.  Second, who cares if Parker
                    thinks you're pathetic.

                                    JANE
                    Insecure.

                                    TERI
                    What?

                                    JANE
                    He said "insecure," not pathetic.*

                                    TERI
                    Whatever.  What matters is how well
                    you do your job.  That's like Chapter
                    One in "10 Ways To Make Way," right?*
                          (Jane smiles)
                    Now,  the Wellner case --                                                                                      52.

                                    JANE
                    She won't stand up for herself. 
                    She's like one of those sad women
                    they find for talk show makeovers...
                    Wait, hold it.  Hold everything.  My
                    brain is working... Teri --
                          (scribbles an address)
                    Send Vicky to this address.  Then
                    schedule another settlement conference
                    for this evening.

                                    TERI
                    You got it.

      Teri, with the Cheez Whiz, starts to exit.  She turns back.

                                    TERI (CONT'D)
                    And about your runaway ta-ta, there's
                    fashion tape in your desk drawer.

      As Teri leaves, Jane finds the tape.  She takes a strip and
      affixes it to her bra.  As she's adjusting, there's a KNOCK.

                                    JANE
                    Come in, Teri.

      The door opens.  It's not Teri.  It's GRAYSON!

                                      GRAYSON
                    Hello, I'm Grayson Kent.  Do you
                    remember me?

      Off Jane's surprise --

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                      53.

                                            ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / JANE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER**

      Jane is still-shell shocked.  She stares at him.

                                      GRAYSON
                    Jane, are you okay?

      Grayson moves closer.

                                    JANE
                    You remember me?

                                      GRAYSON
                    How could I forget?

      Jane's heart leaps, but --

                                      GRAYSON (CONT'D)
                    You handed me my ass in that class
                    action dandruff shampoo case.

      Jane's heart deflates.

                                      GRAYSON (CONT'D)
                      I represented the manufacturer, who
                    promised to eliminate flakes, but it
                    also stained the scalp pink.  You*
                    picked a jury full of head scratchers. 
                      Brilliant.

      Jane is uncomfortable.  She doesn't know what to say.  Finally --

                                    JANE
                    What are you doing here?

                                      GRAYSON
                    My first day.

                                    JANE
                    You're working... here?

                                      GRAYSON
                      I interviewed yesterday morning. *
                    Parker hired me on the spot.*

      Jane tries to remain calm.  Grayson grows serious.

                                      GRAYSON (CONT'D)
                    This might sound strange to you --

                                    JANE
                    Try me.                                                                                      54.

                                      GRAYSON
                    My girlfriend, Deb Dobkins, she
                    recently passed away.  Did I see you
                    at her funeral? 

                                    JANE
                          (stammers)
                    No...  Yeah.  I was... we were
                      friends... in high school.  We
                    recently reconnected.  I'm so sorry
                    for your loss.

                                      GRAYSON
                    You seem a little older than Deb.*

                                    JANE
                    Yeah.  Right.  I was her big sister. *
                    In that big sister, little sister *
                    program.*
                          (then)*
                    Shouldn't you be home?  Grieving or*
                      something?

                                      GRAYSON
                      Everything at home reminds me of
                    her. 

      Just then, Kim, holding a plant, enters --

                                    KIM
                    Hello, hello.  Grayson, I'm Kim
                    Kastle.

      Kim sticks out her hand, Grayson takes it.

                                      GRAYSON
                    Nice to meet you.

                                    KIM
                          (re: plant)
                    Office warming gift.  Let's find the
                    right spot for it.

                                      GRAYSON
                    Thanks.
                          (to Jane)
                    I look forward to working with you.

      Kim and Grayson head off.  Jane bangs her head against the
      desk.  On the third bang, she looks up to find Teri.

                                    TERI
                    Low blood sugar? 

                                    JANE
                    Something like that.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      55.

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                          (then)
                    It's too hot in here, Teri.  I'm
                      suffocating.

                                    TERI
                    There's nothing I can do.

      Jane turns to the window, searches for a way to open it.

                                    JANE
                    These should open, damn it!

                                    TERI
                    It's a climate controlled building
                    and --

      Under the above, Jane picks up her desk chair and then, with
      all her might, she THRUSTS THE CHAIR LEGS INTO THE WINDOW,
      SHATTERING THE GLASS.  She exhales, the outside breeze blowing
      against her face.  Then --

                                    JANE
                    When they fix it, I want a latch.

      Off Teri, dumbfounded --

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / CONFERENCE ROOM B - EVENING**

      Vicky, who's just had a complete makeover, stares into a
      mirror.  Her face is flawless, hair perfect.  But her
      shoulders are slumped.  Jane enters --

                                    JANE
                    Wow.

                                      VICKY
                      I appreciate you sending me to that*
                    spa, but this isn't me.

                                    JANE
                    I was hoping you'd say that.
                          (off Vicky's confusion)
                    Today, you are not you.  Trust me, I
                    have experience in not being myself,
                    and it can change your whole
                      perspective.

                                      VICKY
                    How's this going to help our case?

                                    JANE
                    Your husband knows you've been
                    reluctant to testify.  But suddenly
                    you're unpredictable --                                                                                       56.*

                                      VICKY
                    Makeover or not, he's right.  I won't.

                                    JANE
                    Then you'll bluff.  Get him to believe
                    you'll take the stand.*

                                      VICKY*
                    I wish I was strong enough to pull*
                    this off, but I'm not like you.*

      A beat, then Jane, more serious now, pulls from her experience --*

                                      JANE*
                      Sometimes, the only way to be who we*
                    want to be -- is to fake it. *

      Vicky looks at her, desperately wanting to believe.*

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    Listen to me.  You won't shy away*
                    from eye contact.  You'll stand tall*
                    and walk with confidence.  Like this --

      As Jane continues, she demonstrates the "Toe Tap Booty
      Bounce," which Deb showed Grayson in the Teaser.*

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    Chest up, hand in the air. Toe-tap,*
                    booty bounce.  Repeat.... Come on.*

      Vicky takes a beat and then tries it.  Jane gives her pointers --

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    Shoulders back, show the rack...!*
                    That's it, Girl!

      Vicky complies, even smiles.

                                      VICKY
                    How do you know this will work?

                                    JANE
                    I learned poise in modeling camp,
                    and it's never failed me.

                                      VICKY
                    You went to modeling camp?

                                    JANE
                      A lifetime ago.

      A quick KNOCK and Parker enters with Stacy, who wears a halter
      top and booty-shorts.  A bag swung over her shoulder.                                                                                      57.

                                      PARKER
                    I found this young lady wandering
                    the halls.  She says she's a friend.

                                    JANE
                    Cute shorts.

                                      STACY
                    They're yours.  You left them in the

                                      JANE*
                    Keep 'em.*

      Parker and Vicky aren't sure what to make of this exchange --

                                      PARKER
                    Vicky, you look fantastic.  Good*
                    luck.

      Parker exits --*

                                    JANE
                    Stacy, this is my client, Mrs.
                    Wellner.

                                      STACY
                    Nice to meet you.

      Stacy pulls nail polish and a dress from her bag --

                                      STACY (CONT'D)
                    One bottle of Ironic Taffy.  Not
                    easy to find, BTW.  And a summer
                    dress --
                          (to Vicky)*
                    Size four, right?*

                                      VICKY
                    Yeah.  It's lovely.

                                      STACY
                    Ladies, I need your right pinkies.

                                    JANE
                    For good luck.

      As Stacy paints their nails --

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    I'll make chit-chat while you get
                    dressed.  Take your time; it never*
                    hurts to keep a man waiting.

                                      STACY
                    She knows what she's talking about.                                                                                      58.

                                      VICKY
                          (to Jane)
                    I've never met a lawyer quite like
                    you.

                                    JANE
                    I'm one of kind.*
                          (stands; to Stacy)
                    Let's go.

      As they head off, Jane turns back --

                                    JANE (CONT'D)
                    Vicky, you look like a million bucks.*
                    Actually, two-point-five.*

      Jane and Stacy exit into --

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS**

      As the door closes behind then, Stacy turns to Jane --

                                      STACY
                    Oh my Gawd - this is so exciting! 
                    Maybe I should be a lawyer, too.

                                    JANE
                    You'd have to go to law school.

                                      STACY
                    You didn't.

                                    JANE
                    I died.

                                      STACY
                    Touch .  See you later.

      They hug and Stacy takes off.  Jane blows on her wet pinky
      nail and then heads toward the conference room.

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / CONFERENCE ROOM A - MOMENTS LATER**

      Jane, eating a Mint Milano cookie, sits across from Mr.
      Wellner and his Attorney.  Mr. Wellner's getting annoyed. 
      There's a plate of cookies on the table.

                                    JANE
                          (offers)
                    Mint Milano?*
                          (off their looks)*
                    It's only a thin layer of rich*
                    chocolate mint sandwiched between*
                    two vanilla wafers but... wow.*

                                    MR. WELLNER
                    Where the hell is she?                                                                                      59.

      The door opens and Vicky enters with confidence, the perfect
      bounce in her step.  She slides into a chair, next to Jane.

                                      ATTORNEY
                    Ms. Wellner, you look lovely.  But*
                    what's this all about, Jane?

                                    JANE
                    My client has no problem going to
                    court.

                                    MR. WELLNER
                    Yeah, right. *

                                      ATTORNEY
                    I heard you were a Class A lawyer,*
                    Jane, but this is amateur hour.*

      CAMERA pans under the conference table.  Vicky's foot begins
      to tap.  Jane puts her hand on Vicky's leg, steadying the
      foot.  Just in time, as Mr. Wellner steals a glance.

                                    JANE
                    The prenup was violated, she gets
                    half.

      Mr. Wellner eyes Vicky.  This time, she returns his look
      with an assured, composed smile.

                                      ATTORNEY
                          (to Mr. Wellner)
                    They're wasting our time.  Let's go.

      But Mr. Wellner doesn't budge.  He stares down Vicky.

                                    MR. WELLNER
                    If you testify -- the truth will
                    come out.  I'll make sure of it.

                                    JANE
                    What's he talking about?

      Vicky begins to waffle.

                                    MR. WELLNER
                    Haven't we put our children through
                    enough?

      Vicky's leg starts to shake again.  Mr. Wellner sees it.

                                      VICKY
                          (a beat, then)
                    Jane, I'm sorry.  I can't do it. *

      Mr. Wellner and the Attorney share a moment of victory. *                                                                                      60.*

                                    MR. WELLNER*
                    Let's get out of here.*
                          (to Vicky)*
                    You gave it your best shot.  Even*
                    let her dress you up and slap on*
                    some face paint but come on, you are*
                    who you are.*

      As they head for the door, Jane turns to Vicky.*

                                      JANE*
                          (sotto)*
                    You are who you want to be.  Don't*
                    let him go.*

      A beat.  Then, Vicky slowly rises to her full stature, finding*
      her spine --

                                      VICKY*
                          (to herself)*
                    Shoulders back, show the rack.*

      Mr. Wellner turns to Vicky --*

                                    MR. WELLNER*
                    Excuse me?*

                                      VICKY*
                    I was worried "the truth" would*
                    destroy my family.
                          (eyes her husband)*
                    But if I don't stand up for myself,*
                    it'll destroy me.*

                                    MR. WELLNER*
                    You're kidding me, right?*

                                      VICKY*
                          (to Jane)*
                    My husband cheated with the dog*
                    walker, who happens to be my sister.*

                                    MR. WELLNER*
                          (reacting)*
                    Look, let's talk this through.  I'm*
                    sure we can find a way --

                                      VICKY*
                          (composed)
                      Gentlemen, if we're done here, Jane *
                    and I are going shopping.  I need a*
                    new outfit for court.*

                                    MR. WELLNER*
                    Fine.  I get it.  One million.  We*
                    call it a day.  No one's the wiser.*                                                                                      61.

                                    JANE
                      Two-point-five.*

                                      ATTORNEY
                    I think we should take a breather --*

                                    MR. WELLNER
                    Forget it, Joe.  She's serious.  I
                    know her well enough to know, I no*
                    longer know her.*
                          (to Jane)*
                      Two-point-five.*

      They exit.  Vicky lets out a squeal. *

                                      VICKY
                    That was amazing.*

                                    JANE
                    Wow... It really felt... wow.  And*
                    your bluffing -- even I fell for it.*

                                      VICKY*
                          (proudly realizes)*
                    You know what?  I wasn't bluffing. *

      Vicky smiles and hugs Jane, who is equally ecstatic.  As
      they embrace, we follow Jane's POV through the INTERIOR
      CONFERENCE ROOM WINDOW and into the BULLPEN --

      She watches Kim talking with Grayson.  Kim touches Grayson's
      shoulder as they talk.  Jane's HEART SINKS, her SMILE FADES. 
      A single tear rolls down her cheek as we --

                                                                              FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / JANE'S OFFICE (NEXT DAY)**

      Jane is at her desk, hunt-and-peck typing on her computer. 
      Fred enters, sees the now boarded up window.

                                    FRED
                    Wow, what happened?

      Jane glances at the window and shrugs.

                                    JANE
                    I hadn't noticed.

                                    FRED
                    How's your closing?  You gonna sock
                    it to the drug company?

                                    JANE
                          (with attitude)
                    Why do you care?

                                    FRED
                    What's going on here, Jane?  I thought
                    you were gonna quit?

                                    JANE
                    I changed my mind, for now. 
                          (then)
                    Look, Fred, I'm kind of busy.  Court's
                    in less than an hour and I've got
                    zip.  I can't focus, 'cuz I can't
                    stop thinking about Grayson.  Was it
                    some sort of cosmic joke having us
                    work together? 

                                    FRED
                    We don't have that kind of control.

                                    JANE
                          (a beat, then)
                    It's so unfair.  Grayson can grieve
                    for Deb, but I can't grieve for him.

                                    FRED
                    Sweetie, I think you just found your
                    closing argument.

      Off Jane, not sure what he's talking about.

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:                                                                                      63.

      INT. LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT / COURTROOM - DAY**

      The Defense Attorney, addressing the jury, wraps up his
      closing.  Jane and Kim sit at the Plaintiff's table.  Grayson
      is in the first row of the gallery, behind them.

                                      DEFENSE ATTORNEY
                    ... The drug industry is regulated. *
                    Zolpidem was tested in multiple trials
                    and not one patient attempted to
                    harm themself.  Lisa Newsom was
                      depressed.  She wasn't sleeping and
                    she was seeking the consult of a
                      psychiatrist.  While our heart goes
                    out to her husband, her suicide is
                    not a result of my client's drug.  A
                    drug which has helped millions of
                    people get the sleep they need.

      The Defense Attorney sits.  Jane stands.

                                    JANE
                    Every minute of every day, Marcus
                    Newsom remembers his life with Lisa.

      Jane looks at Grayson.  As she continues, she's talking about
      her love for him as much as she's talking about the case. 
      WE FLASH TO JANE'S MEMORY OF WHEN SHE WAS DEB:

      EXT. BEACH - DAY

      Grayson and Deb, in bathing suits, sip cocktails.  They're
      laughing.  They kiss.  Then, they SMILE for a CAMERA and a
      PHOTO is SNAPPED.  THIS IS THE PHOTO WE SAW IN DEB'S HOUSE.

                                    JANE
                    She was everything to him.

      We FLASH TO ANOTHER MEMORY:

      INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

      Grayson and Deb are dancing.  A CAMERA SNAPS a PHOTO.  THIS
      IS THE PHOTO THAT STACY HAD ON HER MANTLE.

                                    JANE
                    And he was everything to her.

      We FLASH TO A THIRD MEMORY:

      EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

      Deb is on a swing.  Grayson is playfully pushing her, by her
      feet.  They're laughing.  Grayson SNAPS a PHOTO.  THIS IS
      THE PHOTO OF DEB, ON THE EASEL, AT THE FUNERAL.

      Then, Jane echoes Grayson's eulogy from Deb's funeral.  As
      she continues, she looks Grayson in the eye.                                                                                      64.

                                    JANE
                    People say there are five stages of
                    grief -- denial, anger, bargaining,
                      depression, and acceptance.  Today,
                    Marcus Newsom can't get past his
                    anger.  He's angry at Upland
                      Pharmaceuticals because they ignored
                    evidence that Zolpidem can cause
                      hallucinations with deadly
                      consequences.
                          (to the jury)
                    While relying on outdated clinical
                    trials, Upland ignored testimonials
                    from its own customers.  Why?  Upland
                    knows if they tell the truth, people
                    might think twice before popping
                    their pills.  Help Marcus Newsom get
                    past his anger.  Assess blame where
                    it belongs.  Only then, can my client
                    continue to grieve.

      She ends with strength; Grayson's in awe.  WE DISSOLVE TO:

      TIGHT on a CINNAMON ROLL.  CAMERA PIVOTS to the RIGHT -- TO
        A GRAPEFRUIT HALF.  THEN BACK TO the CINNAMON ROLL.  Then TO
      the GRAPEFRUIT.  FINALLY, PULL BACK INTO --

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / KITCHEN - LATER**

      Jane stands over her two choices.  She's trying to decide
      between the cinnamon roll and the grapefruit, representing
      two very different lives.  Parker enters --

                                      PARKER
                    I hear you did a bang up job on your
                    closing.

                                    JANE
                    We'll find out soon enough.

      Parker approaches Jane.  He's clearly got something on his
      mind.  His proximity makes Jane uncomfortable.  Then --

                                      PARKER
                    When I referenced those self-help
                    books.  I didn't mean to insult you.

                                    JANE
                    It's fine.  We're fine.

                                      PARKER
                    There's nothing wrong with trying to
                    improve yourself...  Not that I think*
                    you need improving. 

      Parker starts to stammer -- digging a hole, deeper and deeper.                                                                                      65.

                                      PARKER (CONT'D)
                    I mean, we all have things we don't
                    like about ourselves.

                                    JANE
                            (uncomfortable)
                    Yes, we do.  And we deal with them...
                    in our own ways.

                                      PARKER
                    Oh damn, I did insult you.  Look,
                    I've got issues too.

                                    JANE
                          (interest piqued)
                    Really?

                                      PARKER
                    I've been told I'm a bad listener. 
                    I don't respect personal space.

                                    JANE
                    That's true.

      Jane gently pushes him away from her, just a tad.

                                      PARKER
                    And I've got hair in places --

                                    JANE
                    Stop.  I get it.  You're a troubled
                    man.  Can we move on?

      Just then, Teri enters. 

                                    TERI
                    Clerk's office called.  Verdict's
                    in.

      As they head out, Jane grabs the cinnamon roll and takes a
      big bite.

      INT. LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT / COURTHOUSE - DAY**

      PAN FROM Jane, Kim, and Marcus at the Plaintiff's table, TO
      Grayson and Parker in the gallery, TO the Judge --

                                      JUDGE BASS
                    Has the jury reached a verdict?

      Judge looks to the JURY FOREMAN, who stands.

                                    JURY FOREMAN
                    We have your Honor.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      66.

                                    JURY FOREMAN (CONT'D)
                    We the jury find for the plaintiff,
                    Marcus Newsom, and award actual
                    damages in the amount of $100,000...
                    punitive damages in the amount of*
                    eight million dollars.*

      The Courtroom erupts.  Marcus, choked up, turns to Jane --

                                      MARCUS NEWSOM
                    Thank you.*

                                    JANE
                    Thank you for believing in me.

      Marcus steps away; Grayson approaches.

                                      GRAYSON
                      Congratulations. 

                                    JANE
                    Thanks for your help.
                          (off Grayson)
                    I sorta borrowed your eulogy... for
                    my closing.  It was a tribute, to*
                    you. 

                                      GRAYSON
                    And to Deb.

                                    JANE
                    Yes.  Of course.
                          (then)
                    For what it's worth, Grayson, she
                    told me there was nothing in the
                    world she wanted more than to be
                    your wife.

      Under this, Jane places her hand on the banister.  Grayson
      notices her Ironic Taffy nail polish, still on her pinky. 
      He touches her pinky, sending electricity through her body.

                                      GRAYSON
                    Jane...

                                    JANE
                    Yes?

                                      GRAYSON
                    Is that... Ironic Taffy?

      Jane's head is spinning.  Grayson looks into her eyes.  Does
      he see something?  As her heart races, Kim approaches.

                                    KIM
                    Parker wants to celebrate.  Gimlets
                    at Sky Bar.                                                                                      67.

                                    JANE
                    Not me.  It's been a long day.

                                      GRAYSON
                    You sure?

      Under the above, Jane catches Grayson eyeing her Ironic Taffy
      nail polish, yet again.  She swallows her emotion.

                                    JANE
                    Yeah.  But go have fun... Deb would*
                    want you to.

      Jane exhales.  She watches them go, knowing it will never
      get easier working with the man she loves. 

      INT. HARRISON & PARKER / JANE'S OFFICE - EVENING**

      Jane's back is to her desk.  She's looking out the window,
      an OPEN WINDOW, that now has a big, brass latch.  The fresh*
      air feels good.  She's lost in thought as Fred enters.

                                    FRED
                    What are you still doing here?

                                    JANE
                    Where else would I be?

                                    FRED
                    Home?

                                    JANE
                    I'll get there.  Like you said, I'm
                      comfortable here.
                          (then; grows serious)
                    I miss her, Fred.  Deb may not have
                    been the best person in the world,
                    but I still miss her.

                                    FRED
                    You're grieving.

                                    JANE
                    Yeah, for myself.
                          (echoes Fred from the
                            elevator)
                    Does that make me self-absorbed,
                    selfish?

                                    FRED
                    No, Jane, it makes you human.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            THE END
