
    A darkened office.  The silhouetted figure of a woman
    wearing SURGICAL GLOVES, works quickly to pick the lock on a
    file cabinet, then starts rifling through file folders.
    Suddenly, a shaft of light floods the office as the door
    swings open revealing DOCTOR ALAN FROST, late 50's, a simple
    man in sport jacket and tie, who's stunned by what he sees.

                                    DR. FROST
                   Katherine! What are you doing?!

    The woman turns, revealing DOCTOR KATHERINE PEROT, 30-ish,
    smart and beautiful.

                                    KATHERINE
                   Doctor Frost!

                                    DR. FROST
                   I thought this was settled.  Those
                   files are to be destroyed.

                                    KATHERINE
                   Those files represent years of my
                   father's work.

                   Katherine, Project Valhalla was a
                   horrible mistake.

    CLAUDINE PEROT, Katherine's mother, late 40's-early 50's.  A
    sultry, attractive woman, revealingly dressed to the nines
    including white gloves, and a Tiparillo.  She gives the
    impression she'd destroy anyone who got in her way.  Think
    Joan Collins only not as classy.  She steps into the office,
    closing the door behind her.

                   Nice work mother.  I thought you

                   Yes.  Well, apparently I'm not
                   Doctor Frost's type.

                   Claudine, this is insane.  Even 
                   your husband admitted that 
                   experiment never should have 
                   happened.

                   I'm entitled to all his belongings.
                   Including his files on the Valhalla 
                   Project.

                                    DR. FROST
                   That's absurd.  Look, I've already 
                   begun putting calls out to the 
                   kids who were involved in the 
                   experiment...

                                    CLAUDINE
                          (interrupting)
                   Then we'll just have to work a lot
                   faster.

    She nods to Katherine who turns back to the file cabinet.  
    As Frost turns toward Katherine, Claudine pulls a letter 
    opener from her purse.

                                    DR. FROST
                   No! You can't play God with
                   people's lives...

    Claudine comes up behind him, stabbing him in the back with 
    the letter opener.  He stiffens a beat, then falls to the 
    ground.

                                    CLAUDINE
                   Oh yes we can.

    Katherine turns, holding a folder boldly marked VALHALLA.  
    She eyes the fallen doctor, then looks at her mother who 
    slips the letter opener back into her purse.

                   Dan Scardino sent it over and I

                   That must be some itch.

                   Oh, you would?  Well we have strict 
                   orders not to turn this place into 
                   a media circus.

                          (to Clark)
                   Perhaps you could interpret for

    A very pregnant woman with an oxygen mask over her face lies 
    on a gurney that's wheeled down the corridor by a doctor in 
    surgical scrubs, including mask and cap.  A closer look 
    reveals Clark as the doctor, the patient, Lois.  Suddenly, 
    Lois lets out a loud MOAN and continues MOANING thru...

                                    CLARK
                   Nurse!  I have an emergency here!

    Nurse Berkey rises from her seat and hurries to the gurney, 
    as Jimmy appears from behind a corner and slips past the 
    nurses station into Frost's office unseen.

                   for a C-section!

                                    NURSE BERKEY
                   Who should I get for an
                   anesthesiologist?

    Clark's face suddenly goes blank.  Lois MOANS louder.

                   Anybody!

                   What's the diagnosis?

                   Uh... uh...

    Another LOUDER MOAN.

                   Pain!  A lot of pain!

                   Take the staff elevators Doctor,
                   it's faster.

    Clark and Lois exchange a look, obviously neither of them 
    know where the staff elevators are.  Another LOUD moan as 
    Nurse Berkey eyes them, suspicious.

                                    NURSE BERKEY (CONT'D)
                   Doctor!  The staff elevators!

    She points down the corridor, opposite of the way they came.
    Clark runs to the other end of the gurney and quickly pushes 
    in the direction the nurse pointed.

                   very unhappy with the level of 
                   security for this hospital.

    As Clark tries maneuvering the unwieldy gurney past the 
    threesome he loses control and CRASHES into a food cart.
    The impact sends trays flying and Lois' 'baby,' a 
    BASKETBALL, rolls out from under the sheet.  As Katherine 
    Perot picks it up, an angry Nurse Berkey advances on them.
    Lois hops off the gurney.

    Lois and Jimmy burst in to discover SARAH LONGLEY, early
    20's, pretty, smart, with an acerbating wit and a tendency
    to overanalyze everything.  At the moment she's standing in
    her living room, struggling to extricate herself from the
    grasp of MARTIN WONG, late 20's, powerfully built.

                                    JIMMY
                   Hey, leave her alone!

    At the sight of Jimmy and Lois, Wong releases Sarah, darts
    through an open window and heads down a fire escape.

                   remember is waking up on the couch
                   and seeing that guy standing over

                   I'm sure it's a possibility the
                   police will be investigating.

                                    JIMMY
                   I wonder what else we have in

                   My daughter views this project as 
                   some kind of validation of her late 
                   father's work.  Me, I smell money.  
                   Lots of money.  So my goal is to 
                   please you.

                   The synthetic virus injected into 
                   these subjects is lying dormant and 
                   can be activated only during 
                   heightened metabolic periods.
                   These periods are indicated by a 
                   red rash.

                                    MR. MUUNOUR

    Lifting a model of the human brain.

                                    KATHERINE
                   The virus only affects the 
                   pre-frontal cortex... that's the 
                   area that controls free thought.

                                    MR. MUUNOUR
                   I know what it is.  I'm not a 
                   moron.

                   So I can assume you know where that
                   area is.

    Muunour confidently pinpoints an area on the model with his
    finger.  Katherine pushes his finger over an inch.  He 
    withdraws, unamused.

                   The ultimate effect is similar to 
                   brain washing.  Once the subject is 
                   injected with the pentobarbitol 
                   serum the virus is activated.  Then 
                   they're able to be controlled by 
                   use of the trigger word, 'Warrior.'

                                    MR. MUUNOUR
                   But given the price you ask, you 
                   still haven't convinced me of its

                   You know, Mr. Muunour, unlike my

                   The virus can be mass produced.  
                   Under the guise of public health, 
                   you can set up clinics and alter 
                   everyone in your country.

    She gestures to Katherine to open the door to the nearby

    G.E. MALLOW, bound and gagged on an examining table.

    Sarah's in the kitchen cooking scrambled eggs.  Lois comes 
    into the kitchen dressed but still in rollers.  As Lois 
    grabs a cup of coffee...

                                    SARAH
                   You know I can tell a lot about you 
                   by the way you've organized your 
                   kitchen.  I'm taking this course in 
                   applied psychology and...

                                    LOIS
                   Sarah, there's something you need 
                   to know.  I hate anyone trying to 
                   analyze me.

    She heads back toward the bedroom.

                                    SARAH
                   That's amazing.  That's exactly how 
                   I would have described you from the 
                   way you organized your kitchen.

    Lois stops and shoots her a look, then decides not to get 
    into it.  She exits to the bedroom as the DOORBELL RINGS.

                                    SARAH (CONT'D)
                   I got it.

    She goes to the door and opens it revealing Dan Scardino.
    He flashes his big smile.

                   Hi. Is Lois home?

    Sarah takes Dan in.  Obviously he's not her type.

                                    SARAH
                   Sure.  Can I tell her who's here?

                   Dan.  What are you doing here?

    Sarah finally steps back, her analytical eyes never leaving 
    him.  A little disconcerted, Dan quickly slips by.

                                    DAN
                   I just came by to ask if you'd made

                   Since she's putting me up, I'll go

                   Dan, a casual evening out is what 
                   you have with friends of the same 
                   sex.  What we're talking about has

                   I'm afraid she's right, Dan.  You

                   relationship is formed from the 
                   moment both parties meet.  So

                   Right, right Well, I heard about
                   something back in the 70's.
                   Something called the Valhalla

                   According to the rumors, some rogue
                   doctors were trying to tinker with

                   The idea was to turn them into

                   scuttled when the Pentagon found 
                   out about it.  The General in 
                   charge kept his commission, but his 
                   career went nowhere after that.

                                    LOIS
                   Well, maybe he talked to his wife 
                   about the project.  My dad's a 
                   doctor and he always told my Mother 
                   about his day over dinner.

                                    CLARK
                   It's just a rumor, we haven't
                   confirmed anything yet.

                                    SARAH
                   But if it is true, and we were 
                   tested on... are you saying that 
                   someone can control our minds?

    He flashes a wan smile and heads OS.  As he does, he passes 
    a staffer who lays a couple of message slips on Lois' desk.

                                    STAFFER
                   You got three calls while you 
                   were out, Lois.  They're all from 
                   someone named Scardino.

                                    CLARK
                   Three calls?  Is he so insecure 
                   he's afraid you won't call back if 
                   he only leaves one message?

                                    LOIS
                          (defensive)
                   Maybe it's something important.

    Clark snatches the messages off her desk.

                                    CLARK
                   'What about dinner tonight?'

                          (drops them back on

                   We went out on a date, okay?  It 
                   went great.  Then we kissed.  That 
                   was better than great.  But now 
                   it's like we're in some kind of

                   And now this Scardino is looking
                   pretty good.

    Lois eyes her, unsure.

                                    SARAH (CONT'D)
                   Lois, it's classic.  Psych 101.  
                   Look, Clark's a terrific guy, 
                   anyone could see that.  But he's 
                   kind of like a rowboat.

                   Yeah.  You feel secure, you know 
                   you'll get across the lake safely, 
                   but it's not an exciting trip.  
                   Scardino, on the other hand, is a 
                   speedboat.  Fast, sleek, a wild 
                   ride.
                          (a cautionary finger)

    Mallow.  A worried Jimmy holds a photo out to Lois who 
    stands behind him.

                   Look.  On his arm.  He's got the
                   same rash we do.

                                    LOIS
                   According to neighbors his behavior 
                   was totally out of character.  He's 
                   basically a shy little messenger.

                   You think this guy was already
                   under mind control?

                                    LOIS
                   It's possible.  It's exactly the 
                   kind of behavior the Admiral said 
                   project Valhalla was capable of 
                   producing.

                   Okay... I've got to express this, 
                   otherwise I'm gonna start 
                   manifesting symptoms of post-trauma 
                   paranoia.

                   I'm scared.  I'm really scared..

                   It's a Nordic myth.  Supposedly 
                   there was a band of young women 
                   called Valkyries.  They rode great 
                   airborne war horses over 
                   battlefields.  Their job was to 
                   choose those fallen warriors who 
                   were fit to enter Valhalla.

    Clark enters.

                   name's Martin Wong.  That's about 
                   all they know.  And his one phone 
                   call was to some bail bondsman 
                   named Roxie Terrace.

                   Doctors found a drug called
                   pentobarbitol in his blood.

                   Apparently too much pentobarbitol 
                   leads to an overload of the brain 
                   synapses.  That was the problem

                   More likely he didn't think to 
                   check.  He always was sloppy in his 
                   work.  If it wasn't for my help and 
                   constant prodding he would have 
                   died a lowly second lieutenant.

                   Lois are you hungry?

                   Yeah, how'd you know?

                                    CLARK
                   Because you babble when you've got 
                   low blood sugar.  I'll go get us 
                   some dinner.  We can pick this 
                   conversation up after we eat.

                                    LOIS
                   Okay.  Can you get Thai food?  I've
                   been craving Mee Krob all day.

                                    CLARK
                   Mee Krob it is.

                   Call the office and tell them where
                   we are.

    As Clark walks off down the street...

    Lois sits alone.  Bored, she checks her watch.  Suddenly,
    she's startled by a TAP TAP TAP on the passenger window.

                                    VOICE (O.S.)
                   Police! Open up!

    She turns to see Scardino smiling in at her.

                                    LOIS
                   Scardino!  What do you think you're
                   doing!?

    He holds up a small cardboard picnic type box.

                   I got dinner.

    She unlocks the car and Scardino hops in.  He rests the box 
    on the floor in front of him.

                                    DAN (CONT'D)
                   I heard you were on stake-out and I
                   thought you might be hungry.

    He pulls out two wine glasses and puts them in the cup 
    holders on the console thru...

                                    LOIS
                   Actually Clark went for food... but 
                   I don't know what's taking him so 
                   long.

    He unpacks two six-inch Correl dishes, hands her one and 
    puts the other on the dash.

                                    DAN
                   I got some great Mee Krob.

    She's at a loss for words as he opens a cardbord take out 
    containers.

                                    LOIS
                   How did you know I like Mee Krob?

                   Lois, I'm an undercover cop.

    He pulls out a wine bottle already open and re-corked and 
    pours two glasses.

                                    LOIS
                   What else do you know about me?

    He smiles a wickedly knowing smile then hands her a glass of 
    wine.  He takes the other.

                                    DAN
                   Shall we toast?

    She lets out a big sigh then puts the glass down.

                   Boy, you never stop, do you?

    For a brief moment all pretensions drop away and we see the 
    serious side of Dan.

                                    DAN
                   Lois, when you live the kind of 
                   life I do, you learn real fast that 
                   time is a precious commodity.
                          (beat)
                   Look, I'm attracted to you... and 
                   every minute that goes by that 
                   we're not together... seems like a 
                   terrible waste.

    His words impact her deeply.  There's a moment between them.
    Then he lifts his glass, back to the upbeat Dan.

                                    DAN (CONT'D)
                   Carpe diem.

    She smiles and they clink glasses.  But the moment is broken 
    by the car door opening.  It's Clark, carrying take out.  He 
    eyes Scardino, then looks at Lois.  His face can't hide his 
    negative feelings for Dan.

                                    LOIS
                          (forced upbeat)
                   Clark, where've you been?  Agent
                   Scardino was...

                                    DAN
                   Just in the neighborhood.

                                    CLARK
                   You know, Scardino, you want to 
                   chase Lois, that's your business.
                   But when you start doing it on my
                   time... that's my business.

                                    LOIS

                   Now I'd appreciate it if you let us
                   do our job... alone.

    Scardino smiles.  He's not interested in a confrontation.

                                    DAN
                   Hey, not a problem.

    He gets out of the car and faces Clark, non-threatening.

    As he walks off, Clark eyes him, then gets back in the car. 
    There's an uncomfortable beat, then Lois tentatively asks...

                                    LOIS
                   Would you like to continue the

    Lights are low, popcorn's in the bowl.  Jimmy and Sarah sit 
    on Lois' couch watching an old TV show.  Jimmy laughs at 
    something on the screen.

                          (off her dubious look)
                   Look, I know it's kinda hokey but 
                   it's... it's funny.  I mean, 
                   Corporal Agarn, Chief Wild Eagle...
                          (stops, sighs)
                   You think I'm retarded, don't you?

                                    SARAH
                   No...
                          (turns to him)
                   I think you're just weird enough to
                   be sexy.

    Whoa.  She scooches a little closer.  Jimmy grabs the 
    remote, flips off the tube.

                   Bag F Troop.

    She leans in closer, a beat, then they kiss.  When they 
    break, Jimmy's so hot he's steaming.  He swallows, his 
    throat dry.

    Sarah mechanically complies.  As Claudine opens her purse

                   couch, but I don't remember going 
                   to sleep last night.  I don't

                   Clark Kent.  Yeah, she's right 
                   here.

    Focused on the screen, he absently hands the phone to Sarah.

                                    SARAH
                   Hello? What?
                          (and then, evenly)
                   Yes. Yes, I understand.

    She slowly hangs up the phone, her eyes cold, steely.

                                                        CUT TO:



    Jimmy KNOCKS on Lois' door. A beat, then the door opens
    revealing Lois in jeans and sweatshirt.

                                    LOIS
                   Jimmy. What are you doing here?

                          (evenly)
                   I left my wallet here last night.

                                    LOIS
                   Really? I didn't see it. But come
                   on in and look.



    As Jimmy steps, Lois heads for the bedroom.

                                    LOIS
                   I was just getting dressed for
                   work.  There's some coffee on the
                   stove if you want.

    As she disappears, Jimmy methodically moves to a kitchen
    drawer and pulls out a HUGE, GLEAMING CHEF'S KNIFE.

                                                        CUT TO:



    Sarah reaches Lois' desk, opens her purse.  Behind her,
    Clark's glued to the computer screen, unaware of what Sarah
    is up to.  As she reaches into her purse...

    Clark reacts to something on the screen.

                                    CLARK
                   This says there's a drug that 
                   permanently deactivates the 
                   synthetic serum...

    He looks up at Sarah just as she turns and levels the gun 
    she used against Jimmy.  Clark reacts, then takes a quick 
    look at his phone.  Realizes.

                   It's okay, Sarah.  Just relax.

    Sarah cocks the gun.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Sarah?  It's me, Clark.  Put down 
                   the gun.

    Fat chance.  As Sarah FIRES...

    In one swift motion, Clark SUPERSPEEDS behind Sarah and 
    knocks the gun free from her.  The wood carving on Lois' 
    desk spins crazily from Clark's backdraft as staffers SCREAM 
    and react to the SOUND of the shot.  Clark wrestles with the
    struggling Sarah as Perry and others rush up.

                                    CLARK
                   She's been brainwashed.

    As Sarah struggles violently, two SECURITY GUARDS rush up 
    and take her free Clark's grip.

                   Take her into my office, get her to 
                   lie down.  And somebody call the

                   Lucky she's a bad shot.

    He surreptitiously opens his hand at his side, REVEALING THE
    BULLET SHE SHOT.  As he drops it unseen in a wastebasket...

                   He left.  Said Lois called and
                   wanted him.

    Off Clark's realization...

                                                        CUT TO:



    Jimmy, knife in hand, approaches Lois's bedroom.  She's at
    the bed, her back to him, now in her blouse and skirt,
    brushing out her hair.

                                    LOIS
                   I'm surprised Perry let you go out
                   alone.

    Jimmy is now at the threshold of her bedroom. He starts
    raising the knife...

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   Did Katherine Perot ever leave her
                   house?

    Jimmy is within three steps of Lois. As he brings the knife
    over his head, ready to strike, Lois, hairbrush in hand,
    suddenly turns around.  In that one moment everything comes
    crystal clear to her.


65  ANOTHER ANGLE                                                     65   

    As Jimmy brings the knife down toward her she SNAPS A SHARP
    KICK TO JIMMY'S MID-SECTION sending him stumbling backward,
    and the knife flying.

    She makes a dash for the front door. Jimmy tackles her.
    Again she kicks free.  She scrambles for the door, but Jimmy
    grabs her from behind and throws her back into the room.
    She lands near the knife.

    Jimmy also sees the knife. He dives for it as Lois reaches
    for it.

    She grabs it a split second before him and rolls away.  They 
    both scramble to their feet, Jimmy in between Lois and the 
    door.  Lois holds the knife out at Jimmy.

                                    LOIS
                          (panting)
                   Jimmy... listen to me.  It's Lois.
                   You've been brainwashed.

    Jimmy, a chilling blank look on his face, advances on her.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   Jimmy don't.  Stay back.

    Lois backs away as Jimmy continues to advance on her.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   Jimmy, you've got to stop!

    Jimmy passes a floor lamp.  He picks it up and swings it at
    Lois' legs.  It connects, knocking her to the floor, face
    down.  Again the knife goes flying.  Jimmy jumps on top of
    Lois.

    and Mr. Muunour.

                   Help! Help me!

    As they watch passively, Jimmy sits on Lois' back as he pins
    her arms to the floor with his legs.  He grabs the cord from
    the lamp he swung and brings it under her neck.  As he pulls
    up on it A BEAM OF HEAT VISION hits the cord and it breaks
    in Jimmy's hands.  He looks up to see...

                   Take it easy, Jimmy.

    Jimmy slowly rises, then suddenly DARTS TO A WINDOW AND
    JUMPS THROUGH IT with a CRASH.  As Superman starts after
    him...

    they come face to with Dan Scardino and his gun.

                                    CLARK
                   The chief physician said they'll be
                   out of the hospital in a day or
                   two.  Just as soon as they can

                   Oh, by the way Lois.  You got a
                   visitor.

    He points to the coffee area, where Scardino chats with some

    heads for Scardino.
