      Inside, DEPUTY LINDA EVERETT (20s) turns on the lights in the 
      station s jail, which has a row of three small cells.  Only 
      one of them is occupied.  

                                  LINDA
                    Duke?  

      Inside an open cell, the local sheriff, DUKE PERKINS (50s), 
      is resting on one of the jail bunks with his hat pulled low 
      over his eyes.  He doesn t stir when Linda enters, just 
      responds calmly from beneath his brim.

                                  DUKE
                    Testing our accommodations.  

                                  LINDA
                    Right.  Uh, sorry to bother, but 
                    Sam Verdreaux called.            UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   3.


      Duke grunts.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Yeah, he sounded good and sauced, 
                    but he also wanted us to know he 
                    heard some kinda bang.

                                  DUKE
                          (still not moving)
                    A bang like a generator backfired 
                    or a bang like Tommy Anderson 
                    finally shot his wife?

                                  LINDA
                    Didn t specify.  Wasn t too sure 
                    about the when of it all either.  
                    He s the only one who called it in, 
                    so I didn t want to overreact...

      But now Duke sits up, and as he pushes back his hat, we can 
      see the sheriff s world-weary face for the first time.

                                  DUKE
                    Nah, you were right to get me, 
                    Linda. 

      The stoic man then straps on his old-school GUN BELT. 

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    You never know with this goddamn 
                    place.



      Inside, we find JAMES  BIG JIM  RENNIE (50s), an awesome 
      presence in every sense of the work.  He s reading a Tom 
      Clancy military thriller over his epic meal, as owner ROSE 
      TWITCHELL (40s) stops by to top off his coffee.

                                  ROSE
                    Anything else, Selectman Rennie?

                                  BIG JIM
                            (gregarious)
                    Spare me the formalities, Rose.  
                    I m off-duty for the weekend.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   4.


      Rose smiles, drops off the check.

                                  ROSE
                    You working the lot today?

                                  BIG JIM
                    Big sale on all our pre-owned 
                    stock.  Hoping we re a little 
                    busier than here, no offense.

      Rose looks at the empty tables with resignation.

                                  ROSE
                    First shift s been brutal ever 
                    since they opened up that Denny s 
                    over in Lewiston.  What the holy 
                    hell is a Moon Over My Hammy, 
                    anyway?

      Big Jim smiles, pays his tab.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Well, you hang in there.

      But as Jim heads out, Rose notices his payment, calls after 
      him.

                                  ROSE
                    Jim!

      She holds up the HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL he left for her.

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                    What is this?

                                  BIG JIM
                    Me buying your next vote.

                                  ROSE
                          (calling bullshit)
                    Says the guy who always runs 
                      unopposed?

      Jim just gives her a knowing look.

                                  BIG JIM
                    We re all in this together.

      With that, the enigmatic selectman is out the door, headed 
      for the expensive black SUV parked out front.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   5.



      Inside a modern studio apartment, an attractive young couple 
      is still in bed, passionately making love.  The woman on top 
      is ANGIE, and beneath her is an athletic college freshman who 
      everyone just calls JUNIOR.  

      As she finishes riding him, a satisfied Angie rolls off 
      Junior, who stares at her like she s a goddess.   

                                  JUNIOR
                    God.

                                  ANGIE
                    I know, right?

                                  JUNIOR
                    No, you don t.  Angie... I love 
                    you.

      Angie takes a moment.  She s not entirely comfortable with 
      this declaration.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   8.


                                  ANGIE
                    Yeah. 
                          (beat)
                    It s been a fun summer.

      That hits Junior like a gut punch.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Ouch.

      Angie climbs out of bed, pulls on her drab waitress uniform.

                                  ANGIE
                    Junior, we both knew this was just 
                    fun.  You re going back to school 
                    in a few days.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Not necessarily.

      Angie freezes.

                                  ANGIE
                    What does that mean?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I m dropping out.  Dropped out.  
                    I m done.

                                  ANGIE
                    Are you insane?

                                  JUNIOR
                    You haven t been there.  Trust me, 
                    college is just another... bullshit 
                    pyramid scheme.

                                  ANGIE
                    They hand you a free ride out of 
                    this place, and you just throw it 
                    away?

                      JUNIORANGIE
      This is about us, not some-- Please don t.

                                  JUNIOR
                    No, listen to me.  We should have 
                    done this a long time ago.  I have 
                    loved you since third grade, all 
                    right?  You re the only person in 
                    the world who knows the real me.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   9.


                                  ANGIE
                    Yeah.
                          (then; softer)
                    That s why I can t be with you.

      Junior darkens.

                                  JUNIOR
                    What did you say?

                                  ANGIE
                    Whatever, I m gonna be late.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Why are you acting like this?

      Angie starts to leave, but Junior GRABS her wrist.

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    Talk to me!

      Flinching in pain, Angie hauls off and SLAPS Junior as hard 
      as she can.  She stares at her old friend in disbelief.

                                  ANGIE
                    You can let yourself out.  And take 
                    your stupid electric toothbrush 
                    with you.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Angie, wait!

      Junior yells after her, but Angie is already gone, leaving 
      the crushed young man alone with his thoughts.



      Barbie absentmindedly flicks on the radio, which comes to 
      life with the voice of local disc jockey PHIL BUSHEY:

                                  PHIL (FROM RADIO)
                    --with you all weekend long at 
                    WKIC, your only locally owned 
                    emporium of rock and--

      And just as quickly, Barbie flicks the radio off.  He rides 
      in silence for a bit, only to be startled by the sound of his 
      ringing CELL PHONE.  Barbie picks up, though we can only hear 
      his side of the conversation:

                                  BARBIE
                    Hey.  No, I m fine.  Look, don t 
                    freak out, but the deal went 
                    south...  No, your seller showed, 
                    he just turned out to be a colossal 
                    asshole.  I brought the money to 
                    his place like you said, but he 
                    tried to renegotiate, aggressively.
                          (beat)
                    Well, what do you think I did?

      Suddenly, Barbie notices another car traveling down this 
      road, headed his way on the opposite lane and moving at a 
      good clip.  It s still far away, but Barbie can already make 
      out the red and blue LIGHTS mounted on the vehicle s roof.  

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Eloise... I m gonna have to call 
                    you back.

      Slapping his cell shut, Barbie reaches for the glove 
        compartment, pops it open.  Inside is a HANDGUN.



      Duke is behind the wheel of this approaching squad car, with 
      Deputy Linda Everett in shotgun.  

                                  LINDA
                    I m just saying, if they were both 
                    in their primes, Tyson would 
                    destroy Ali.

                                  DUKE
                    You re out of your mind.  Ali could 
                    take Tyson today.              UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   11.


                                  LINDA
                    Whatever.  Rusty used to box and he 
                    agrees a hundred percent.

                                  DUKE
                    Another reason you never should 
                    have said yes to a meathead 
                    fireman.  

      Linda smiles, looks down at her ENGAGEMENT RING with pride.

                                  LINDA
                    They prefer meathead firefighters, 
                    thank you very much.  And their 
                    insurance plan blows ours to shit.

      That s when Duke spots Barbie s car headed their way.

                                  DUKE
                    Incoming.  No front tag.

                                  LINDA
                      Definitely not local.  Little early 
                    for the tourist crowd.  You want me 
                    to pop the lights?

                                  DUKE
                    Let s do our homework before we 
                    start harassing Sunday drivers.

      Linda picks up their dashboard s two-way radio.



      Barbie, meanwhile, keeps his eyes dead ahead as the police 
      cruiser closes in... and eventually blows right past him.  

      Is he in the clear?



      As Duke keeps driving, Linda cranes her head back to read 
      Barbie s rear plate to a dispatcher.

                                  LINDA
                    This is 102.  You on, Jackie?

                                  FROM RADIO 
                    Go ahead, 102.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   12.


                                  LINDA
                    Do us a favor and run an Ohio 
                    plate?  Boy Adam Boy, One Six Two.  



      Barbie keeps his eyes on the rearview, fully expecting the 
      police car to SKID AROUND and start pursuing him... but it 
      just keeps going. 

      He EXHALES for the first time in almost a mile.  But the 
      second Barbie takes his eyes off the rearview, he finally 
      notices what s directly in his path: a COW that has wandered 
      into the middle of the road.

                                  BARBIE
                    SHIT!

      Barbie jinks the steering wheel hard, narrowly dodging this 
      cow.  Careening into a nearby pasture, the car speeds towards 
      the rest of this animal s HERD.



      Back in the halted police cruiser, Linda is understandably 
      concerned about her boss.  

                                  LINDA
                    Jesus, Duke.  Are you...?

      But Duke catches his breath, waves her off.

                                  DUKE
                    I m fine.  Just my damn pacemaker 
                    skipping a beat.

                                  LINDA
                    And that s supposed to make me feel 
                    better?!

                                  FROM RADIO
                    102, you still on?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   14.


      Duke tries to answer, but Linda grabs the radio from him.

                                  LINDA
                    Forget the tag, we got a bigger 
                    problem.

                                  FROM RADIO
                    I know, my whole switchboard s out.  
                    All our landlines are dead.

                                  LINDA
                    What...?

      Before the dispatcher can respond, TWO DIFFERENT MALE VOICES 
      broadcast over competing frequencies.  Annoyed, Duke snatches 
      the radio back from Linda.

                                  DUKE
                    One at a time, geniuses.  Freddy, 
                    you first.

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Sorry, Duke.  We got a downed power 
                    line over by the health center.  

                                  DUKE
                    George?

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Yep, same story at the Food City.  
                    Sparks and everything!  

      Linda looks at Duke with concern.

                                  LINDA
                    Those are on either side of town.  
                    What could even do that?  A 
                      twister...?

      But when Duke looks out his window, all he sees in the bright 
      clear sky is a single SMALL PLANE flying high above them.



      Inside its cockpit, a middle-aged woman named CLAUDETTE is 
      getting flying lessons from her tanned instructor CHUCK.

                                  CLAUDETTE
                    Whoa, little wiggle on the stick.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   15.


                                  CHUCK
                    Just a bump, you re doing fine.  
                    Let s drop on down to eight 
                    hundred, take her out to Route 119.

      Claudette flashes her teacher a mischievous smile.

                                  CLAUDETTE
                    I just wanted to say, thanks again.  
                    For last week.  Andy hasn t gone 
                    down on me since our honeymoon.  He 
                    calls it  sodomy. 

                                  CHUCK
                          (a nervous laugh)
                    Well, I m glad to help.  We just 
                    have to be careful.  

      But Claudette lets go of her tandem controls, starts moving 
      closer to Chuck.  

                                  CLAUDETTE
                    Screw careful.

      Her head disappears into Chuck s lap, as he looks out at the 
      cloudless sky with contentment.

                                  CHUCK
                          (to himself)
                    Beautiful goddamn day.



      Inside a dimly lit little studio, we meet the voice behind 
      the local DJ Barbie heard earlier, eccentric indy rock 
      devotee PHIL BUSHEY (30s).  He grabs a microphone as his 
      console again powers up.

                                  PHIL
                    Apologies for the technical 
                      difficulties and difficult 
                      technicalities, but we are back on 
                    your airwaves, rocking another 
                      scrumptious playlist home-cooked by 
                    your old friend Phil, not ladled 
                    out by some corporate stooge.  Eat 
                    up, my lovelies...  

      He hits a switch, and the studio fills with the sound of LED 
      Soundsystem s  North American Scum.   

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Phil!

      The studio door is flung open by Phil s only colleague, 
      hipster radio engineer DODEE WHEELER (20).             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   21.


                                  PHIL
                    Dodee, hey.  Have you heard this 
                    new--

                                  DODEE
                          (ignoring him)
                    We re the only thing on the air 
                    right now.  AM, FM, anywhere.

                                  PHIL
                    Yeah, the blackout, I know.  

                                  DODEE
                    No, listen, even if that were 
                      statewide, every station our size 
                    has its own generator.  Why is the 
                    whole dial still static?

      Phil gives this serious consideration.  

                                  PHIL
                    I don t know... but our ratings are 
                    going to be amazing.

      And as he cranks his hand-picked music, CUT TO:



      Inside, Alice is behind the wheel, her wife Carolyn is in 
      shotgun, and Norrie is between them in back, listening to her 
      iPod loud enough that we can overhear the atonal Skrillex 
      song through her headphones.

                                  ALICE
                    Norrie!  Take those out for the 
                    rest of the trip, please.

      Norrie removes a single earbud.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   29.


                                  NORRIE
                    Why?

                                    CAROLYN
                    Look, your mother and I are using 
                    vacation days for this excursion, 
                    so I think we re owed at least one 
                    normal family conversation.

                                  NORRIE
                    We re not a normal family.  And I 
                    don t feel like talking, I just 
                    want to listen to music.

                                  ALICE
                          (a little frayed)
                    Fine, we can listen to music 
                    together.

      Alice hits SEEK on her radio dial, but Norrie is already 
      sneaking her other earbud back in as an indy rock song comes 
      over the car s speakers.



      Cut to this song s source, where DJ Phil Bushey is watching 
      his engineer Dodee fiddle with a television in their break 
      room.  She s just getting the old  blue screen of death. 

                                  DODEE
                    See, television, too.  I can t even 
                    get a regular broadcast signal.  

                                  PHIL
                    Maybe it s, like, solar flares or 
                      something.

                                  DODEE
                    Solar flares?  Phil, something 
                    massive is going down out there. 

                                  PHIL
                    Dodee, the cable is out, that 
                    doesn t mean it s the end times.

      Annoyed, Dodee mutters under her breath.

                                  DODEE
                    Whatever.  When the roving packs of 
                    mutants start swarming this place, 
                    you re gonna--           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   30.


      BAM BAM BAM.  Dodee and Phil are both startled by a sudden 
      POUNDING on their locked station door.  

                                  BIG JIM (O.S.)
                    This is Selectman Rennie!  Open up!

                                  PHIL
                    Who?

                                  BIG JIM (O.S.)
                    Open the damn door, Bushey!

                                  PHIL
                    Uh, look, unless you have some kind 
                    of warrant--

      WHAM.  An impatient Big Jim kicks the door open.  Phil tries 
      to stand in his way, but Big Jim LOOMS over the smaller man.

                                  BIG JIM
                    I need to make an emergency 
                      broadcast.  You re going to put me 
                    on the air right now, or I pull 
                    your license for good.

      What else can Phil do?  He nods at Dodee, who leads Big Jim 
      to their broadcasting room.



      Across town, WKIC is playing on a battery-operated radio in 
      Junior s childhood bedroom, still decorated with high school 
      football trophies and other ephemera from the popular local 
      kid s past.

      Junior is sitting on the edge of his bed, carefully balancing 
      a HUNTING KNIFE by its sharp tip on his extended finger.  He 
      flips the knife into the air, catches it by the handle.  

      For a beat, Junior just stares at his reflection in the 
      polished blade.  With frightening calmness, he then holds the 
      blade directly over his left wrist.  He contemplates ripping 
      into his own flesh, starts pressing the knife against a 
      raised blue vein...

      That s when the song is interrupted by an urgent voice:

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Everyone, please stop what you re 
                    doing and listen.

      Junior pauses, cocks his head.  Did he really just hear that?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   31.



      In the back of the Sweetbriar Rose, a BUSBOY turns up his 
      radio as waitress Angie stops working to listen.

                                  FROM RADIO
                    This is Selectman Rennie.  Uh, Big 
                    Jim Rennie.  But this isn t a 
                      commercial.



      Or almost everyone, as back in their rental car, Carolyn is 
      arguing with her daughter Norrie while Big Jim s voice plays 
      quietly beneath them.

                                  NORRIE
                    You re the one who s addicted!

                                    CAROLYN
                    I use my phone for work, not for 
                    sending naked pictures of myself to 
                    random boys.

                                  NORRIE
                    For the millionth time, I was 
                    wearing underwear.  And it was a 
                    joke!      

      Ignoring them, Alice turns up the radio.

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Once again, every car that can hear 
                    my voice needs to pull over 
                      immediately.  This is not a drill.  

                                  ALICE
                    Is anyone else hearing this?             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   32.


                                  FROM RADIO 
                    I can t tell you if this is an act 
                    of terror or an... an Act of God, 
                    but I promise to keep everyone 
                    updated as we learn more.

                                  NORRIE
                    It s just some stupid viral 
                    marketing thing, mom. 

                                  ALICE
                    I don t know...

      Carolyn has just noticed another vehicle headed their way, a 
      DELIVERY TRUCK about to make a stop in Chester s Mill.

                                    CAROLYN
                    She s right, Alice.  There are 
                    other people on the road.  This is 
                    probably just some stunt to keep 
                    tourists in town a little--

      Before she can finish that thought, the incoming delivery 
      truck SMASHES against the invisible barrier s exterior.  The 
      ensuing blast COATS the outside of the barrier in a fiery 
      collage of foodstuffs.  

      Seeing this, Alice SLAMS on the brakes, and the rental car 
      stops just inches from the inside of the invisible wall.  The 
      tourists are now TRAPPED... but at least they re alive.



      Having run the whole way home, teenager Joe McClatchey bursts 
      into the foyer of his family s modest house.

                                  JOE
                    Mom?  Mom!

                    Joe?  

      Startled, Joe turns to see ANGIE, still dressed in her 
      waitress uniform.  She looks as freaked out as the young man 
      we now realize is her younger brother.

                                  JOE
                    Ange.  Where the hell is mom?

                                  ANGIE
                    I don t know, you re the one who 
                    lives here.  Where s dad?

                                  JOE
                    Still on the road.

                                  ANGIE
                    You re sure?  A customer at the 
                    diner said there might have been 
                    some kind of chemical spill.  I was 
                    worried maybe it was dad s rig or--

                                  JOE
                    Chemical spill?  Retard, it s nine-
                    eleven outside!  

      Angie tires to make sense of this, as a frantic Joe keeps 
      looking for signs of his mother s whereabouts.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   36.


                                  ANGIE
                    I... I should get to the hospital.  
                    They ll need volunteers.  They ll 
                    need--  

                                  JOE
                    Jesus.

      Angie looks over at her brother, who s just found a NOTE left 
      on a nearby table.

                                  ANGIE
                    Joe?  What is it?

                                  JOE
                    Note from mom.  She s having brunch 
                    with Uncle Steve.  At Denny s.  

                                  ANGIE
                    So...?

      Joe processes this, not yet sure whether to be depressed or 
      excited about his future.

                                  JOE
                    I m on my own.

      And off Angie, wondering what the hell she s missed, CUT TO:



      It s bedlam inside the local hospital, where a handful of 
      NURSES and VOLUNTEERS struggle to triage the incoming wave of 
      CASUALTIES.  In the crowded waiting room, a young nurse is 
      trying to bandage an older man s head.

                                  NURSE
                    You gotta stay still for me, Mr. 
                    Dinsmore.

                                  OLDER MAN
                    I just don t get it.  What did my 
                    tractor even hit?

      The waiting room s front doors whoosh open to reveal Julia 
      and Barbie.  The patients fall silent as they see that this 
      duo is carrying the CORPSE of the handless woman.

                                  JULIA
                    Does anyone know her?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   37.


                                  NURSE
                    I, I think her name s Myra.  From 
                    the library.  Is she...?  

      Barbie nods, as two EMTs reverently take the woman s still-
      warm body.  Meanwhile, a male orderly rushes over to greet 
      Julia.  He looks relieved to see her.

                                    ORDERLY
                    Mrs. Shumway, thank God.  Is the 
                    doc with you?

                                  JULIA
                    What are you talking about?  I 
                    thought he was here.  Peter always 
                    works Sundays.

      The orderly grows uncomfortable, not sure how to respond. 

                                    ORDERLY
                    Ma am, your husband hasn t worked 
                    weekends in months.

      Julia goes white.  Whatever this means, it can t be good.  
      Still, Barbie puts a reassuring hand on her shoulder.

                                  BARBIE
                    Probably just a miscommunication.  
                    I m sure he s home, worried sick 
                    about you.

      Julia nods, but she doesn t look too convinced.



      Inside Town Hall s spacious lobby, Big Jim walks out of his 
      office to greet the sheriff.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Duke.

                                  DUKE
                    Jim.  Appreciate your help with the 
                    roads.  You saved some lives today.  

      Those words mean the world to Jim, though he does his best to 
      downplay it.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Well.  Just doing my job and all 
                    that.  How are your men holding up?

                                  DUKE
                    Stretched thin, but they ll soldier 
                    on.

                                  BIG JIM
                    For now.  But what if this goes on 
                    days?  Weeks?  
                                  (MORE)           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   39.

                                  BIG JIM (CONT'D)
                    We re going to need more manpower 
                    to maintain the peace.  

                                  DUKE
                    Jim--

                                  BIG JIM
                    Just hear me out.  During 
                      emergencies, selectmen have the 
                    power to authorize auxiliary 
                    deputies.

      But Duke is already shaking his head.

                                  DUKE
                    Look, I know you just want to help, 
                    but I m the head law enforcement 
                    officer here, and you have zero 
                    official standing.  At all.  Until 
                    we hear otherwise from the county 
                    or above, you re not authorizing 
                    anything, understood?

      Frustrated, Jim pushes his anger down someplace deep.

                                  BIG JIM
                      Understood.

      Duke gives a shallow tip of his hat before turning to leave, 
      when Jim calls out after him.

                                  BIG JIM (CONT D)
                    One other thing.  What should we do 
                    if people start asking about the 
                    propane?  

      Duke stops in his tracks.  He turns back to glare at Jim.

                                  DUKE
                    That s got nothing to do with this.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Oh, I know that.  But some people 
                    might find it hard to swallow that 
                    we just happened to start 
                      stockpiling generator fuel right 
                    before some Act of God took out all 
                    the power.  Some people might get 
                    the idea that we saw this coming.  

                                  DUKE
                    We didn t.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   40.


                                  BIG JIM
                    So we tell them the truth?  

                                  DUKE
                    That s your business.  I have no 
                    idea what the hell you wanted with 
                    all that shit.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Please.  You may have been happy to 
                    turn a blind eye, but you re not 
                    dumb.  You know exactly where that 
                    poison was headed.

      Incensed, Duke gets right in Jim s face.

                                  DUKE
                    I know I did what I had to do to 
                    keep this town solvent.  To keep it 
                    safe.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Of course.  And I ll do my best to 
                    protect your secret.

                                  DUKE
                    Are you threatening me?  You?  

                                  BIG JIM
                    Not at all.  Just reminding you 
                    what the lay of the land is.
                          (then)
                    We re all in this together.

      Jim echoes what he told Rose in the diner, but now the words 
      sound more like a WARNING than a source of comfort.

      With nothing left to say, Duke can only storm off, leaving a 
      quietly triumphant Big Jim to contemplate his next move.



      ...only to find her foyer dark and silent.  

                                  JULIA
                    Peter?  Peter, you home?

      ARK ARK ARK!  Startled, Julia turns to find HORACE, her 
      husband s loyal Welsh Corgi.  The dog comes bounding up to 
      her, and a crestfallen Julia scratches behind his ears.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   44.


                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    Where is he, boy?  Where d he go?

      But the dog just whines for his supper, as a deeply troubled 
      Julia is left wondering what s become of the one person in 
      Chester s Mill she thought she knew. 



      Back inside WKIC, engineer Dodee is straining to listen to 
      something on headphones, adjusting sliders at her console 
      while Phil watches with interest.

                                  DODEE
                    Huh.

                                  PHIL
                    You got something?

                                  DODEE
                    So regular receivers aren t strong 
                    enough to pull a signal through 
                      whatever s cut us off, but I used 
                    to use our broadcasting tower like 
                    an oversized antenna to grab cool-
                    sounding feedback loops for my--  

                                  PHIL
                    Dodee, just tell me what you heard.

                                  DODEE
                    This.

      Flipping a switch, Dodee plays her intercepted transmission 
      over speakers.  The studio is instantly filled with an 
      ETHEREAL VOICE.  

                                  PHIL
                            (mesmerized)
                    Sounds like an angel.

                                  DODEE
                      Actually... I think it s Bj rk.

      And as Dodee turns up the volume, we can indeed hear that 
      singer s unique voice.  But then it disappears. 

                                  DODEE (CONT D)
                    Comes and goes like that.  
                    Sometimes it s music, sometime s 
                    it s, like, people s cell phone 
                      conversations.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   45.


                                  PHIL
                    So who s filtering what gets 
                    through?

      As Dodee considers this question, a MAN S VOICE starts to cut 
      through the static.

                                  PHIL (CONT D)
                    What now?

                                  DODEE
                    I dunno, but I ve been hearing some 
                     victor bravo  shit.  Military 
                      transmission, maybe?

                                  PHIL
                    Turn it up.

      Dodee does, and she and Phil can now hear the voice of a 40-
      something Army official we ll eventually learn is named 
      COLONEL JAMES COX:

                                    COLONEL COX (OVER SPEAKERS)
                    --but our best guess puts the dome 
                    over Chester s Mill at roughly 
                    forty thousand feet in height and--  

      The faint signal again craps out, as Dodee looks at her 
      colleague with disbelief: 

                                  DODEE
                    Hold up, did he just call it a 
                    dome?

                                  PHIL
                    Shut up a second.

      Colonel Cox s voice returns, though less clearly than before.

                                    COLONEL COX (OVER SPEAKERS)
                      --awaiting your authorization to 
                    fire a -kzzkt- with a medium-yield 
                    warhead at the exterior of the-- 

      And now the signal disappears for good, but Phil s heard more 
      than enough to suddenly look TERRIFIED.

                                  PHIL
                    They re talking about a nuke.  
                          (then)
                    They re talking about launching a 
                    goddamn nuke at us.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   46.


                                  DODEE
                    And?  That ll punch a hole in this 
                    thing, right?

                                  PHIL
                    Maybe.  But it ll also kill every 
                    living thing inside.

      Dodee is understandably aghast.

                                  DODEE
                    No way.  They re on our side.  
                      Whatever s going on out there, 
                    those guys wouldn t risk killing 
                      civilians.  Right?

      Hearing the uncertainty in Dodee s voice, Phil just looks 
      away.  He s already weighing what to do with this 
        information.  Should they tell someone, and if so, who?

      But as an Icelandic voice again ripples through the static, 
      we CUT TO:  



      Returning home after a long day of hell at the hospital, 
      Angie flips on a light switch, but nothing happens.  Shit, 
      that s right, without a generator, she s in the dark.  

      Stumbling into her kitchen, Angie pulls out a book of 
      matches.  She lights one, illuminating a FIGURE standing 
      directly behind her. 

      It s Junior.  He grabs Angie, putting one hand over her 
      mouth.  With his free hand, he presses his hunting knife to 
      the terrified woman s throat.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Relax.  Relax!  It s me, Angie.  
                    It s me.  Listen.  My truck is 
                    right out back.  If you do 
                      everything I say, I promise you 
                    won t--

      No passive victim, Angie ELBOWS Junior hard in the sternum.  
      He drops his blade, and Angie goes RUNNING for the door.  

                                  ANGIE
                    HELP ME!  SOMEBODY--

      That s when Junior TACKLES his smaller opponent.  On their 
      way to the ground, Angie s skull hits the edge of a Formica 
      countertop with a sickening THUD. 

      Her body trembles for a moment, then falls still.  Junior 
      looks down at the unconscious woman with regret.

                                  JUNIOR
                    I m so sorry, Ange.  

      He kneels down, and kisses Angie on her bleeding forehead.

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    I didn t want it to go like this.

      With that, he lovingly scoops her into his arms.



      Inside, Barbie walks into what looks like the scene of some 
      earlier STRUGGLE: furniture has been flipped, pictures have 
      been broken, etc.

      He goes to an overturned couch and pushes it back a few 
      inches.  Underneath, he finds the other BLUE TENNIS SHOE 
      belonging to the man Barbie buried this morning.  Must have 
      been knocked off during their fight.  Now that he s stuck in 
      town indefinitely, Barbie s returned to the scene of his 
      crime, one he was clearly forced to leave in a hurry.  



      Pushing deeper into the cabin, Barbie now inspects its only 
      bedroom, appointed with a little wooden chair and desk.  He 
      looks at the dead man s unmade bed, tries to imagine if he 
      could actually sleep in it.

      Barbie checks the closet, mostly empty.  He opens a drawer in 
      a night stand, nothing in it but some weird old porno 
      magazines.  Who the hell was this guy?  

      Spotting a little WASTEBASKET, Barbie tips out its contents 
      onto the floor: candy wrappers and a few crumpled pieces of 
      paper.  Barbie picks up one of these scraps, unfolds it.  
      It s just some random doodles and a few scratched out phone 
      numbers.  But when he flips the sheet over, Barbie FROWNS.

                                  BARBIE
                    Shit.

      The piece of paper is from a PRESCRIPTION PAD belonging to 
      DOCTOR PETER SHUMWAY, Julia s missing husband.  

      Did this cabin belong to him?  Is that who Barbie killed, the 
      spouse of a fucking investigative reporter?

      Realizing exactly how bad this might be for him, Barbie 
      starts WIPING DOWN every surface he s touched, doing his best 
      to eliminate any trace of prints.  



      Later that evening, Angie finally opens her eyes.  She s 
      horrified to learn that she s RESTRAINED to a small bed 
      inside some kind of CONCRETE BUNKER.  A single bare bulb 
      illuminates a sink, toilet, and some old provisions.

      A thick metal door creaks open to reveal Junior, who offers 
      an apologetic smile.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Hey, Angie.

      As soon as she sees him, Angie begins to SCREAM. 

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    Save your voice, babe.  No one can 
                    hear us all the way down here.

                                  ANGIE
                    Down...?  

                                  JUNIOR
                    My family s always been paranoid 
                    about security.  This is our 
                    fallout shelter.  You re safe here.

                                  ANGIE
                    The hell are you talking about?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I know how this must look, but I 
                    swear to Christ, in the long run, 
                    you re going to thank me for this.

      Hearing the words  long run,  Angie starts to CRY.

                                  ANGIE
                    Oh my God.  You ve lost your 
                    goddamn mind.

                                  JUNIOR
                    No, I m the only person who 
                      understands what s really going on 
                    here.  All I ask for is patience.  

                                  ANGIE
                    Moron!  You don t think people will 
                    look for me?  When they find out 
                    what you did, you re going to 
                    Shawshank for the rest of your 
                    goddamn life!

      But Junior just looks at her with confidence.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   53.


                                  JUNIOR
                    Patience.

      Angie once again starts to SCREAM, as Junior exits, closing 
      the thick door behind him and instantly MUTING her cries.



      With her dog Horace asleep at her feet, Julia is hard at work 
      on her laptop.  Refusing to let her husband s disappearance 
      stop her from doing her job, Julia is mocking up tomorrow s 
      72-point headline.  She can only think of one word to 
      describe the day s unexplained horrors: TRAGEDY

      Suddenly, Julia hears a noise downstairs.  It s someone 
      KNOCKING at her front door.

                                  JULIA
                    Peter.

      She leaps over Horace and races for the stairs, praying this 
      might finally be her wayward husband returning home.



      Silence.  Barbie is alone in one of Julia s cozy, eerily 
      quiet spare bedrooms, wondering how the hell his day ended 
      here.  

      He tosses his duffel bag onto a fold-out bed, then begins 
      looking for any more clues about Julia s husband.  But this 
      room s walls are lined with nothing but framed stories from 
      Julia s days as a reporter in Chicago.

      Returning to his duffel bag, Barbie UNZIPS it and finally 
      reveals the item he was sent to Chester s Mill to obtain.  
      It s not drugs or bricks of cash, but a SMALL BLACK BOX, 
      about the size and thickness of a modern Apple TV.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   58.


      It appears to be made of onyx or hard plastic, and the lid of 
      the box is adorned with a UNIQUE SYMBOL, one that looks like 
      an elaborate character from some ancient language.

      Barbie OPENS the lid of the small box... to reveal that it s 
      COMPLETELY EMPTY.  He mutters under his breath:  

                                  BARBIE
                    Why the hell would anybody die for 
                    this?

      CRASH.  Barbie s startled by the sound of glass breaking 
      elsewhere in this house, followed by SCREAMING.

      Tossing the strange box back into his open bag, a concerned 
      Barbie races out of the guest room.



      Julia is sitting on the edge of a desk in her husband s DEN, 
      which is decorated with various diplomas and medical 
        credentials.  

      Entering this room, Barbie immediately notices the smashed 
      remains of a framed picture that the clearly distraught Julia 
      just threw against a wall.  

                                  BARBIE
                    Julia...?

                                  JULIA
                    You must think I m an idiot.

      Uh-oh.  Barbie tenses.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    I m a goddamn investigative 
                    reporter, and I can t see what s 
                    going on right under my nose.

                                  BARBIE
                    What are you--

                                  JULIA
                    I just found this hidden in the 
                    back one of Peter s drawers. 

      Julia holds up a CELL PHONE.  

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    I ve never seen this before in my 
                    life, but my husband s been using 
                    it for months.  
                                  (MORE)           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   59.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    He made hundreds of calls on this 
                    thing, all to the exact same 
                    person.
                          (beat)
                    A woman named Eloise.

      Shit.  Barbie tries to play it cool, but he recognizes this 
      name immediately.  It s the name of the woman Barbie called 
      right before the dome came down.    

                                  BARBIE
                          (nervously)
                    You have any idea who that is...?

                                  JULIA
                    Of course I do.  It must be his 
                    mistress.

      Relieved, Barbie reaches down to pick up the smashed picture.  
      Inside its frame is a photo of Peter Shumway with his wife 
      from happier times.  No question about it, this is definitely 
      the same man Barbie buried this morning.  Shit.  

                                  BARBIE
                    This is him, huh?

        A devastated Julia can barely muster a nod.  Barbie tries to 
      offer some solace.

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Look, there s no point in jumping 
                    to conclusions--

                                  JULIA
                    I m not.  Things have been... off 
                    between us for a while now.  I 
                    thought the move would help.  A 
                    fresh start, you know?  Christ, I 
                    gave up everything for him.

      Barbie shakes his head, looks this woman in the eye, and 
      tells her the truth:

                                  BARBIE
                    Listen to me.  A man would have to 
                    be out of his mind to step out on a 
                    woman like you.

      For a beat, Julia simply looks at this younger man.  Maybe 
      it s just the aftereffects of this traumatic day, but 
      something overtakes her.  

      She grabs Barbie, pulls him close... and KISSES him deeply.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   60.


      At first, Barbie resists, gently pulling away.  How the hell 
      can he do this to the same woman he just turned into a widow?  
      But as a smoldering Julia stares at him, whatever better 
      angels Barbie once possessed are soon vanquished.

      And as Barbie kisses her back with equally violent passion, 
      our camera drifts away from this duo, craning out the den s 
      open window.
