      OPEN on rolling countryside in the ancient province of 
      Gascony, near the Spanish border. A small party of MUSKETEERS 
      ride their horses at walking pace. Their uniforms are 
        distinctive though dirty from the road. The men - five of 
      them in all - look weary. At the head of them is ATHOS (30s), 
      a handsome man of striking aristocratic features. We know a 
      hero when we see one, but we also might sense a hidden 
      melancholy he is too proud to show to the world at large. 

      At his side rides CORNET. He is still young but has an air of 
      authority. He leads a mule with a rope tied to his saddle; 
      the patient creature is laden with heavy saddle bags. Athos 
      reins in his horse and turns to him. 

                                    ATHOS
                    This is as far as I go. The road is 
                    safe enough from here. 

      Cornet extends his hand. Athos shakes it. 

                                    ATHOS
                    Go on to Bayonne and wait. 

      Cornet nods and glances at the saddle-bags. 

                                    CORNET
                      Athos? Don t you wonder what s in 
                      there?

                                    ATHOS
                    We re not paid to be curious. 
                      (Pause) When we re paid at all. 

      He smiles and spurs his horse, turning back in the direction 
      they ve come. Cornet s smile fades. We sense a tension in the 
      tight line of his mouth and the way his gaze flicks 
      restlessly around the hills. He darts a glance at his men 
      laughing and joking a few yards behind him. His face clouds. 
      Something is wrong here. But what? 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The day is fading towards evening. An old farmhouse stands 
      amidst peaceful fields. A lamp stands in the window, a beacon 
      cutting through the dying light. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      OPEN on the streets of seventeenth century Paris. We follow 
      ATHOS as he hurries through the bustling crowd. We see a 
      caption on screen OVER: PARIS 1625.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ARAMIS dashes outside. A fine CARRIAGE stands in the road. 
      The shutter opens and Aramis locks eyes briefly with whoever 
      is inside but then just in time another carriage comes 
      rattling past. The door flies open and ATHOS leans out. 

                                    ATHOS
                    Get in!

      Aramis grabs his hand and jumps. The carriage - driven by 
      PORTHOS - rattles away at high speed.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ARMAND JEAN DU PLESSIS, known to history as CARDINAL 
      RICHELIEU emerges from his carriage. He is in his 40s, 
      elegantly dressed, with only the heavy gold cross around his 
      neck to indicate his position within the church hierarchy. A 
        good-looking and outwardly affable man, he has an 
        intimidating aura of power.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      D ARTAGNAN comes to an inn in a shabby part of town. The 
      place is dreary and down at heel.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D ARTAGNAN crashes through the stable roof and lands with a 
      crunching impact on the thin straw. He struggles to his feet, 
      holding his ribs and gasping at the pain. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D ARTAGNAN flees the angry MOB. He draws his pistol and 
      fires. The vigilantes duck for cover as the Inn sign is blown 
      from its hinges and falls with a clatter. By the time the 
      smoke clears d Artagnanis gone. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D ARTAGNAN rounds the corner and sees a woman at a market 
      stall. Her name is CONSTANCE BONACIEUX. She is very pretty, 
        dark-haired and in her mid-20s. 



                                                                                          14                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      Glancing up to see the LANDLADY turning the corner in 
      pursuit, he grabs Constance s arm. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    I ll give you five livresto kiss 
                    me. 

      He takes her in his arms and kisses her. Taken completely by 
      surprise she submits for just long enough for the oblivious 
      Landlady to walk straight past and disappear into the crowd. 

      A second later the outraged Constance frees herself and stabs 
        d Artagnanin the hand with a small pen knife.

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Let me go, you pervert!

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Owww! That hurt.

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Touch me again and I ll gut you 
                    like a fish. Do I look like a 
                      working girl?

      D Artagnan nurses his hand and looks her up and down. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      Well...

                                    CONSTANCE
                    This is my best dress! It s the 
                      height of fashion. How does this 
                    say prostitute to you?

      He looks around. The coast is clear. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    My apologies, Madame. I won t 
                      trouble you any further.

      He walks a few steps but then staggers, clutching his ribs.

                                    CONSTANCE
                            (Despite herself)
                    Are you all right? 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Do you know what fainting feels 
                    like?

                                    CONSTANCE
                      A sort of woozy feeling, mild 
                      sickness and then loss of 
                        consciousness. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Ah. That would explain it.


                                                                                          15                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      His eyelids flutter and he slides to the ground with a thump, 
      out cold. Constance stares at him. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                          (Beat)
                    Walk away, Constance. Just walk 
                      away... 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The rumble of cart wheels. A YOUNG WOMAN wearing a simple 
      cotton shift of virginal white, stands in a tumbril led by a 
      donkey. Her white gown is reminiscent of the one flapping on 
      the line. A PRIEST stands next to her. A rope is slung over 
      the sturdy branch of a tree. The EXECUTIONER secures the 
      noose. ATHOS sits on his horse watching silently.

      We cannot see the condemned woman s face but we know she is 
      beautiful. Her hands are tied and her head is bowed as the 
      priest whispers in her ear. As the EXECUTIONER drags her 
      down, we see a flicker of horror on Athos s face -

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:



      An arrow thuds into the bulls eye of a target. CHANGE ANGLE 
      to show KING LOUIS XIII holding a crossbow and surrounded by 
      applauding COURTIERS. LOUIS is in his mid-20s, good-looking 
      but weak-willed, lazy but not a fool. At his side stands 
      TREVILLE. Louis turns to him in triumph.




                                                                                          16                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    LOUIS
                      There. Could any of your Musketeers 
                    do better?

      Treville tries to answer politely but leaves too long a 
      pause. The king gives him a wry look.

                                    LOUIS
                    You should try flattery sometime, 
                      Treville. It plays very well around 
                    here.  

      He indicates his fawning COURTIERS with scorn. 

                                    LOUIS
                      I could shoot any one of them now 
                    and they d say the wound was no 
                    worse than a wasp sting. 

      He loads an arrow in his bow and turns it on the crowd, who 
      scatter in alarm. He smiles gleefully, enjoying their 
      reaction, then notices Treville s grave expression. 

                                    LOUIS
                    What is it?

                                    TREVILLE
                    Bad news, Your Majesty. Cornet has 
                    gone missing. 

      Louis s face reddens with surprise and anger.

                                    LOUIS
                    What do you mean, missing? Did he 
                      complete his mission?

                                    TREVILLE
                      I don t know. 

                                    LOUIS
                    You assured me he was trustworthy. 
                    Do you realise what is at stake? 

                                    TREVILLE
                      There s no need for panic yet...

                                    LOUIS
                    I M NOT PANICKING!

      The courtiers look up and Louis lowers his voice. 

                                    LOUIS
                    The Cardinal must not know about 
                    this. Do you understand? He must 
                    not know. 

      Treville bows. Louis looks at him bitterly. 



                                                                                          17                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    LOUIS
                    You have disappointed me, Treville. 
                    And King Louis doesn t like 
                      disappointment. It makes him very
                      unhappy.

      He tosses his crossbow to a servant and stalks away. Treville 
      sighs. It could have been worse. Just.  

                                                                              CUT TO:



      CLOSE on a carriage as it rolls to a stop in a narrow street. 
      DUBOIS, a bourgeois figure in fine clothes, opens the door. 
      He looks up to see his DRIVER with his hands in the air. TWO 
      MASKED MEN in Musketeer livery hold their pistols on him. 

                                    GAUDET
                    Your purse, please. 

                                    DUBOIS
                    This is outrageous. You re a King s 
                      Musketeer...

      The Musketeer shoots him and he goes down, screaming. 

                                    GAUDET
                      I asked for your purse, not your 
                      opinion. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ARAMIS, PORTHOS and D ARTAGNAN ride hard along the road to 
      Gascony. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



        D ARTAGNAN, PORTHOS and ARAMIS ride along a rural track. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    This is the only road to Bayonne. 
                    They had to come this way after 
                    Athos left them.   

                                    PORTHOS
                      I asked around. Cornet gambles. 
                    Money owed all over Paris. Suppose 
                    he knew his cargo was valuable and 
                    stole it? 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Why would his men go along with it?

                                    PORTHOS
                            (Shrugs)
                    They were all in it together.

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    That doesn t explain why they would 
                    ride forty miles out of their way 
                    to kill a complete stranger.

                                    ARAMIS
                    Maybe those were Cornet s orders. 
                    Did your father have any enemies? 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    He spoke against the King s taxes 
                    and defied the Cardinal over Gascon 
                      rights. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    So just the two most powerful men 
                    in France. No one significant. 

      D Artagnan turns on him angrily. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    He wasn t a traitor. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Maybe that s not how they saw it in 
                      Paris.




                                                                                          37                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Then why not just arrest him and 
                    put him on trial? And why blame it 
                    on Athos?

      They have no answer. D Artagnan looks around. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      There s a wood ahead. A notorious 
                    local spot for thieves and bandits. 
                    Athos couldn t have known about it. 
                    After that the road to Bayonne is 
                      clear. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The Musketeers ride at a walk, looking around. And then 
      D ARTAGNAN sees something. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Wait!

      He dismounts and walks to a nearby tree. A low branch hangs 
      limply where it has been shattered. Aramis looks at it. 

                                                                              CUT IN:

      A pistol fires in SLOW MOTION. We see the charge explode and 
      the ball spinning from the barrel. It whistles through the 
      air and crashes into the tree branch, sending sap 
        exploding...

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

      D Artagnan takes out his dagger and digs in the truck of a 
      nearby tree. He turns to the others holding something small 
      in the palm of his hand. It is squashed and flattened but 
        unmistakably a pistol ball. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      A pistol ball. They were ambushed.

      Aramis sees broken vegetation and marks on the ground where 
      something heavy has been dragged through the undergrowth. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Over here... 

      They follow the trail to a clearing. The earth has been 
      freshly dug and hastily covered with leaves. Porthos gets to 
      his knees and clears away the top layer of soil. He stops 
      abruptly. A dead face stares up at him from a shallow grave. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



                                                                                          38                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12



      Three bodies have been uncovered. All of them are in their 
        underclothes, with their hands tied behind their backs. There 
      is dried blood on their faces. PORTHOS gazes down at them, 
      seething with anger and disgust.

                                    PORTHOS
                    All of them tied up and shot in the 
                    head. It was an execution.

                                    ARAMIS
                    They never even had a chance to 
                    draw their swords. Where s Cornet?

                                    PORTHOS
                    Maybe he got away. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Or they took him with them.

                                    ARAMIS
                    They wouldn t do this and then 
                    leave a witness. If he s still 
                    alive there s only one explanation. 
                      (Pause) He betrayed his own men. 

      They look at each other, considering the options. 

                                    PORTHOS
                      You ve just sold out your men and 
                      stolen the King s gold. What do you 
                    do next?

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Slip over the border to Spain and 
                    start a new life. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    How do you know it was gold he was 
                      carrying?

                                    PORTHOS
                    What else would make him do 
                      something like this?

      It s hard to argue with this but Aramis looks uncertain.

                                    ARAMIS
                    The one thing Athos was told is 
                    that Cornet was supposed to make 
                      contact with someone in Bayonne. We 
                    don t know who, but we do know 
                      where. We ll start there. 

                                                                              CUT TO:




                                                                                          39                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12



      The same eerie atmosphere as before. The condemned woman is 
      pushed towards the gallows tree by THE EXECUTIONER. She 
      stumbles to her knees and ATHOS cries out. 

                                    ATHOS
                    Treat her kindly. 

      The woman struggles to her feet. The PRIEST now comes to 
      Athos and whispers urgently. 

                                    PRIEST
                    There is still time to show mercy. 

                                    ATHOS
                    She showed none to my brother. 

                                    PRIEST
                    She is your wife!

                                    ATHOS
                      I can t defy the law. She must die.

      The young woman bows her head and turns to the Executioner. 

                                    CONDEMNED WOMAN
                    If he doesn t love me I have 
                      nothing to live for. Do your work 
                      swiftly.

      As the EXECUTIONER loops the noose around her neck we finally 
      CUT TO a close up of the condemned woman. It is MILADY. She 
      is magnificently defiant, refusing to show fear or beg for 
      mercy. The EXECUTIONER covers her beautiful face with a hood 
      and stands waiting nervously. Athos finally nods. 


                                                                                          41                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


        Immediately the Executioner kicks away the platform 
      supporting her body. We see her legs kick wildly as her body 
      is suspended in space and she begins to choke to death. 

      Athos s face creases with disgust. His first instinct is to 
      dash forward and save her. But abruptly he turns his horse 
      and gallops away, never once looking back. 

                                                                      CUT BACK TO: 



      DUJON comes round to see three faces looming over him - 
        D ARTAGNAN, PORTHOS and ARAMIS. Porthos has his sword at his 
      throat. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                      Where s Cornet? 

      Dujon says nothing. Aramis leans over him, his tone affable 
      but his eyes steely. 

                                    ARAMIS
                    Take us to him or die here. Your 
                      choice.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      A gilded coach rattles through the streets. The DRIVER and 
      FOOTMAN wear hooded cloaks. Inside the carriage we catch a 
      brief, silhouetted glimpse of the Queen, dressed in lavish 
      jewels and a beautiful dress. As the coach nears a turning it 
      slows - and suddenly a GANG of FOUR MASKED MUSKETEERS 
        materialise from the shadows, pistols levelled. 

                                    GAUDET
                    Step down from the carriage, Your 
                      Majesty and you won t be harmed.

      We see the Queen s face in shadow. GAUDET lifts his pistol to 
      the window and the  Queen  turns to look at him -  

      - it is ADELE, who in this light could be the Queen s double. 
      In the same second CONSTANCE, disguised as the Queen s maid, 
      rams the door in GAUDET S face, sending him sprawling and 
      allowing the hidden D ARTAGNAN to spring out from his hiding 
      place inside the carriage. 

      Now PORTHOS and ARAMIS - the driver and his footman - throw 
      off their cloaks and level their pistols. The report of the 
      guns is shattering in the night - one of the false Musketeers 
      is killed.

      GAUDET aims his pistol but D ARTAGNAN kicks it out of his 
      hand. D ARTAGNAN fights like a demon but slips and falls; for 
      a second he is at GAUDET S mercy but then ARAMIS flicks up 
      his sword with his foot and tosses it back to him. D ARTAGNAN 
      catches it and launches himself back into the fight in one 
      fluid movement. 

        Distracted, ARAMIS doesn t see a fake Musketeer level his gun 
      and fire. The bullet catches him a glancing blow on the 
      forehead and sends him spinning to the ground.

      D ARTAGNAN is pushed back against the coach, fighting two men 
      on his own. CONSTANCE suddenly leans out of the carriage and 
      grabs one of them around the neck. He struggles and drags her 
      out of the carriage, clawing at her and ripping her blouse, 
      but CONSTANCE ducks inside a deadly thrust of his sword and 
      trips him up, sending him sprawling, then grabs his own sword 
      and stabs him with it. She looks deeply shocked as she 
      watches his blood seeping darkly onto the cobbles. 

      At the same moment PORTHOS finishes off his own opponent and 
      pauses to glance admiringly at CONSTANCE, who looks quite 
      something with her shirt torn to the waist, bosom heaving and 
      the sword clutched in her hand. 


                                                                                          51                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    PORTHOS
                    If there s one thing I love it s a 
                      half-dressed woman with a sword. 

      With his men down, GAUDET can see the fight is hopeless and 
      abruptly throws down his own sword. D ARTAGNAN plunges his 
      sword towards his stomach but ARAMIS knocks it away.

                                    ARAMIS
                    If you kill him now who will speak 
                    for Athos?

      A beat, then D ARTAGNAN lowers his sword. PORTHOS grabs 
      GAUDET and pushes him away. ARAMIS goes to the carriage and 
      kisses ADELE fondly.

                                    ARAMIS
                    You were magnificent. A queen in 
                    all but name. 

                                    ADELE
                    I was scared.

                                    ARAMIS
                    I ll comfort you. Tomorrow night. 
                    After dinner.

                                    ADELE
                    What if the Cardinal is with me?

                                    ARAMIS
                      I have a feeling he ll be otherwise 
                      engaged.

      Elsewhere, D ARTAGNAN goes to CONSTANCE. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Who taught you to fight like that?

                                    CONSTANCE
                      I told you. I have three brothers. 

      He sees she is shaking with shock and covers her with his 
      jacket. She looks at him a little helplessly.

                                    CONSTANCE
                      I killed him. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    You had no choice. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                    One moment he was alive and the 
                      next... gone. I did that to him. 

      She is shivering violently. He takes her in his arms and 
      holds her tightly.



                                                                                          52                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    You risked your life for me. If 
                      there s any way I can ever repay 
                    the debt, you only have to say the 
                    word. 

      She looks up at him, hardly taking this in. 

                                    CONSTANCE
                    Take me home. My husband will be 
                    back soon. He can t know about any 
                    of this. 

      She removes herself gently from his arms with a last 
      anguished glance at the dead body in the gutter.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The Cardinal s magnificent carriage rattles along, its 
      shutters closed against the evening sun. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      The carriage door opens and ADELE gets out but the CARDINAL 
      remains behind. Instead of a picnic, there are two RED GUARDS 
      waiting for her. ADELE looks at their grim expressions and a 
      sudden dread falls over her. She looks back at the CARDINAL. 

                                    ADELE
                      What s this? 

                                    CARDINAL
                    Your surprise, my love. 

      One of the Guards draws a gun from his belt. Adele sees it is 
      Aramis s pistol. She turns back to the Cardinal in terror. 

                                    ADELE
                    My God. You re going to kill me. 

                                    CARDINAL
                    An ugly necessity. You re a traitor 
                    and a spy and I can t trust you. 
                    You give me no option.  

      She runs to him desperately but the GUARD holds her back. 

                                    ADELE
                    Have you no mercy?

                                    CARDINAL
                    Mercy belongs to God, not man. 


                                                                                          59                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


                                    ADELE
                    You pious hypocrite! You ll burn in 
                    hell. 

                                    CARDINAL
                      Perhaps. But I have work to do here 
                      first. The Devil may have his share 
                    of me later. 

      He nods to the Guard, who drags Adele away. She shouts back 
      at him, terrified but defiant. 

                                    ADELE
                      I love Aramis. I ll love him with 
                    my last breath. 

      We see anger ripple across the Cardinal s studiously benign 
        expression. He nods sharply to the Guard, then closes the 
      door of the carriage. He picks up some papers and begins to 
      study them.

      We hear a scuffle and a scream. A second later there is the 
      loud explosion of the pistol, followed by a terrible silence. 

      A beat, then there is a knock on the carriage door. The 
      Cardinal opens it and the Guard offers him the pistol. The 
      barrel is still warm and smoking. 

                                                                              CUT TO:



      ARAMIS knocks on the door. No notices that all the shutters 
      are closed. He knocks again. After a long moment a SERVANT 
      opens the door a few inches and looks out at him. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      I have an appointment with 
                      Mademoiselle Bessette. 

                                    SERVANT
                    She s gone to the country. 

      The Servant hands him an ornate wooden case. 

                                    SERVANT
                      A gift for you. From the Cardinal. 

      Aramis stares in astonishment at the beautiful case. He 
      suddenly has a sick sense of what it will contain. He opens 
      it and inside is his own pistol. He looks up in horror at the 
      shuttered house. 

                                    ARAMIS
                      Adele! Adele!




                                                                                          60                            THE MUSKETEERS Ep 1 by Adrian Hodges 12.09.12


      HOLD on his mounting desperation, then -

                                                                              CUT TO:



      D ARTAGNAN walks the crowded street. He hears shouts and 
      looks back to see a carriage hurtling at speed towards him. 
      He throws himself out of the way. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Hey! Watch out! 

      He races along beside it, banging on the door. 

                                    D ARTAGNAN
                    Who do you think you are?

      The shutter opens and a head emerges from the window. It is 
      MILADY. Her blonde hair is piled up and her neck is decorated 
      with a magnificent jewelled choker. She smiles and blows him 
      a kiss. A second later the carriage accelerates and 
      disappears into the distance. 

      HOLD on D ARTAGNAN, transfixed by the vision of MILADY s 
      enigmatic beauty, and then, slowly - 

                                                                    FADE TO BLACK. 
                                                                    END OF EPISODE
