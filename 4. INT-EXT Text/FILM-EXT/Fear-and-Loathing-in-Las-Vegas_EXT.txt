AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
miles an hour.
THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.
AT THE WHEEL
STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,
BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.
BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND
WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.
The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.
GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.
DUKE (V/O)
I remember saying something like:
"I feel a bit lightheaded.
Maybe
you should drive..."
GONZO starts shaving.
2.
DUKE (V/O)
Suddenly there was a terrible roar
all around us and the sky was full
of what looked like huge bats, all
swooping and screeching and diving
around the car...
Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.
The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.
We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
DUKE (V/O)
... and a voice was screaming: Holy
Jesus!
What are these goddamn
animals?
CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -
DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.
No bats anywhere.
GONZO casually looks over...
GONZO
What are you yelling about?
DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.
The sudden wrench
makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.
DUKE
Never mind.
It's your turn to drive.
DUKE (V/O)
No point mentioning these bats.
I
thought.
The poor bastard will see
them soon enough.
DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,
frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.
DUKE desperately rifles
through the impressive stash.
DUKE (V/O)
We had two bags of grass, seventy-
five pellets of mescaline, five
sheets of high powered blotter
acid, a salt shaker half full of
cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
colored uppers, downers, screamers,
laughers... Also a quart of tequila,
a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
pint of raw ether and two dozen
amyls.
3.
DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with
another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
back into the car.
DUKE (V/O)
Not that we needed all that for the
trip, but once you get locked into
a serious drug collection, the
tendency is to push it as far as
you can.
THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,
weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A
BAT?
IN THE RED SHARK
GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver.
DUKE (V/O)
The only thing that really worried
me was the ether.
There is nothing
in the world more helpless and
irresponsible and depraved than a
man in the depths of an ether binge.
And I knew we'd get into that
rotten stuff pretty soon.
The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape
recorder.
RADIO NEWS
An overdose of heroin was listed as
the official cause of death for
pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
whose body was found stuffed in a
refrigerator last week...
GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
The RED SHARK fishtails.
GONZO
"One toke over the line, sweet
Jesus."
4.
DUKE
(muttering to himself)
One toke.
You poor fool.
Wait
till you see those goddamn bats.
UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD
A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a
thumb.
The RED SHARK roars past.
Then, fifty yards down
the road...
GONZO
Let's give that boy a lift.
GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
of the road.
DUKE
We can't stop here - this is bat
country!
GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.
The
HITCHHIKER races to the car.
A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.
HITCHHIKER
Hot damn!
I never rode in a
convertible before!
Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the
sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.
DUKE
Is that right?
Well, I guess
you're about ready, eh?
The HITCHHIKER hesitates.
GONZO
We're your friends.
We're not like
the others.
DUKE
(hissing sharply)
No more of that talk or I'll put
the leeches on you.
DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.
The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
SHARK screams down the road.
5.
GONZO sings along to the tape player.
The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
and taking his chances.
DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
view mirror.
DUKE (V/O)
How long could we maintain, I
wondered.
How long before one of
us starts raving and jabbering at
this boy?
What will he think then?
This same lonely desert was the
last known home of the Manson family.
The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
down GONZO's neck.
DUKE (V/O)
Would he make that grim connection
when my attorney starts screaming
about bats and huge manta rays
coming down on the car?
DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
the words, sometimes not.
DUKE (V/O)
If so - well, we'll just have to
cut his head off and bury him
somewhere.
Because it goes without
saying that we can't turn him loose.
He'd report us at once to some kind
of outback Nazi law enforcement
agency, and they'll run us down
like dogs...
DUKE
(out loud to himself)
Jesus!
Did I say that?
DUKE (V/O)
Or just think it?
Was I talking?
Did they hear me?
GONZO
(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
It's okay.
He's admiring the shape
of your skull.
DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
giggles nervously.
6.
DUKE (V/O)
Maybe I better have a chat with
this boy I thought.
Perhaps if I
explain things, he'll rest easy...
DUKE
(roaring over the
road noise)
THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --
The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.
DUKE
(yells)
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.
DUKE climbs
into the back seat.
DUKE
That's good.
Because I want you to
have all the background.
This is a
very ominous assignment -- with
overtones of extreme personal
danger.
I'm a Doctor of Journalism!
This is important, goddamnit!
This
is a true story!...
(WHACKS the BACK OF
THE DRIVER'S SEAT
with his fist)
The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.
GONZO
(screams)
Keep your hands off my fucking neck!
The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.
DUKE GRABS
HIM BACK DOWN.
DUKE (V/O)
Our vibrations were getting nasty --
but why?
Was there no communication
in this car?
Had we deteriorated
to the level of dumb beasts?
The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.
7.
DUKE
(to HITCHHIKER)
I want you to understand that this
man at the wheel is my attorney!
He's not just some dingbat I found
on the Strip.
He's a foreigner.
I
think he's probably Samoan.
But it
doesn't matter, does it?
Are you
prejudiced?
HITCHHIKER
Hell, no!
DUKE
I didn't think so.
Because in
spite of his race, this man is
extremely valuable to me.
Hell, I
forgot all about this beer.
You
want one?
(HITCHHIKER shakes
his head)
How about some ether?
HITCHHIKER
What?
DUKE
Never mind.
Let's get right to the
heart of this thing.
Twenty-four
hours ago we were sitting in the
Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
Hotel...
DUKE and GONZO emerge.
DUKE
The Mint 400!
The richest off-road
race for motorcycles and dune-
buggies in the history of organized
sport!
(handing parking
ticket to Valet)
-- a fantastic spectacle in honor
of some fatback grossero who owns
the luxurious Mint Hotel in the
heart of downtown Vegas... at least
that's what the press release says.
Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.
They
jump in.
DUKE
We're going to have to drum it up
on our own.
Pure Gonzo Journalism.
And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-
bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.
The PINTO races through shot.
DUKE (V/O)
Getting hold of the drugs and
shirts had been no problem...
10.
The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back
window full of Hawaiian shirts.
DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
... but the car and tape recorder
were not easy things to round up at
6:30 on a Friday afternoon in
Hollywood.
The PINTO races down street.
DUKE (V/O)
The store was closed, but the
salesman said he would wait, if we
hurried...
They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.
DUKE
BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.
DUKE (V/O)
But we were delayed en route when a
Stingray in front of us killed a
pedestrain.
Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered
corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.
DUKE (V/O)
We had trouble, again, at the car
rental agency.
Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with
satisfaction -- checking it out.
A nervous AGENT holds out
a clipboard.
DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.
AGENT
Say... uh... you fellas are going
to be careful with this car, aren't
you?
DUKE
Of course.
DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the
gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.
AGENT
Well, good god!
You just backed
over that two foot concrete abutment
and you didn't even slow down!
Forty-five in reverse!
And you
barely missed the pump!
DUKE
No harm done.
I always test the
transmission that way.
The rear
end.
For stress factors.
12.
GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box
of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.
AGENT
Say.
Are you fellows drinking?
DUKE
Not me.
We're responsible people.
He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.
The
AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.
GONZO
There's another worrier.
He's
probably all cranked up on speed.
STRANGE AND MAGICAL.
In the moonlight: the silhouetted
figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.
DUKE (V/O)
We spent the rest of that night
rounding up materials and packing
the car.
Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming.
The surf crashes in the distance...
DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.
He lets himself
float up through the silvery bubbles...
DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING
MOONLIT SURF.
DUKE (V/O)
Our trip was different.
It was to
be a classic affirmation of
everything right and true in the
national character; a gross,
physical salute to the fantastic
possibilities of life in this
country.
But only for those with
true grit...
DUKE's intense face.
DUKE
...and we're chock full of that!
13.
GONZO
Damn right!
DUKE
My attorney understands this
concept, despite his racial handicap.
But do you?!
The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.
DUKE (V/O)
He said he understood, but I could
see in his eyes that he didn't.
He
was lying to me.
GONZO
My heart!
GONZO clutches his heart.
The car veers off the road and
screeches to a halt.
He slumps over the wheel.
GONZO (CONT'D)
Where's the medicine?
DUKE
The medicine?
Yes, it's right here.
DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.
DUKE
Don't worry, this man has a bad
heart... Angina Pectoris.
But we
have a cure for it.
DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.
GONZO
falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.
The
HITCHHIKER looks petrified.
GONZO
(suddenly flailing
his naked arms at the sky)
Turn up the fucking music!
My
heart feels like an alligator!
Volume!
Clarity!
Bass!
We must
have bass!
What's wrong with us?
Are you goddamn old ladies?
DUKE
(turns up music to
full volume)
You scurvy shyster bastard!
Watch
your language!
You're talking to a
Doctor of Journalism!
14.
GONZO
(laughing uncontrollably)
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Somebody call the police!
We need
help!
DUKE
(to HITCHHIKER)
Pay no attention to this swine.
He
can't handle the medicine.
(he begins laughing)
GONZO
(to the HITCHHIKER)
The truth is we're going to Vegas
to croak a scag baron named Savage
Henry.
I've known him for years
but he ripped us off -- and you
know what that means, right?
GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.
GONZO (CONT'D)
Savage Henry has cashed his check!
We're going to rip his lungs out!
DUKE
And eat them!
That bastard won't
get away with this!
What's going
on in this country when a scum
sucker like that can get away with
sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.
The HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,
AND FLEES.
HITCHHIKER
Thanks for the ride.
Thanks a lot.
I like you guys.
Don't worry about
me.
DUKE
(yells)
Wait a minute!
Come back and have
a beer!
The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.
15.
GONZO
Good riddance.
That boy made me
nervous.
Did you see his eyes?
(laughing)
Jesus, this is good medicine.
DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.
DUKE
(suddenly clambering
into the front seat)
Move over!!
We have to get out of
California before that kid finds a
cop!
DUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...
THE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead
driving.
DUKE (V/O)
It was absolutely imperative that
we get to the Mint Hotel before the
deadline for press registration.
Otherwise, we might have to pay for
our suite.
GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.
The top comes off
and the powder swirls away on the wind.
GONZO
Oh, Jesus!
Did you see what god
just did to us?
DUKE
God didn't do that!
You did it!
You're a fucking narcotics agent,
that was our cocaine, you pig!
GONZO
(waving his .357
Magnum at Duke)
You better be careful.
Plenty of
vultures out here.
They'll pick
your bones clean before morning.
DUKE
You whore!
GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.
16.
GONZO
Here -- chew this.
It's your half
of the acid.
DUKE takes his half -- chews it.
DUKE
How long do I have?
GONZO
Maybe thirty more minutes.
As your
attorney, I advise you to drive at
top speed.
It'll be a goddamn
miracle if we can get there before
you turn into a wild animal.
Are
you ready for that?
Checking into
a Vegas hotel under a phony name
with intent to commit capital fraud
and a head full of acid.
DUKE (V/O)
Thirty minutes.
It was going to be
very close.
The RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:
"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20
YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!"
Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE
SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.
Clay pigeons shatter.
The Mint
Gun Club.
Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400
RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT
TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights,
topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.
DUKE wanders through.
DUKE (V/O)
The racers were ready at dawn.
Very tense.
But the race didn't
start until nine so we had three
long hours to kill.
A sign by a long trestle table: "KOFFEE & DONUTS." DUKE
walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall.
DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
Those of us who had been up all
night were in no mood for coffee
and donuts.
We wanted strong drink.
We were, after all, the Absolute
Cream of the National Sporting
Press and we were gathered here, in
Las Vegas, for a very special
assignment.
And when it comes to
things like this you don't fool
around.
MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...
A flag goes down.
The CROWD cheers.
The MOTORCYCLES ROAR
AWAY.
A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS
as they disappear into the desert...
A moment...
REPORTER
Well, that's that.
They'll be back
in an hour or so.
Let's go back to
the bar.
The CROWD turns and streams back into the tent.
MOTORCYCLES REV.
A flag goes down.
The CROWD cheers.
The
MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.
Another great cloud of dust goes up...
The CROWD head back for the bar.
Nothing.
Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.
Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits.
The RIDER staggers off his bike.
The PIT CREW gas it up and
sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.
DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.
DUKE (V/O)
By 10 they were spread out all over
the course.
It was no longer a
race, now it was an Endurance
Contest.
The idea of trying to
"cover this race" in any
conventional press sense was absurd.
A HORN HONKS.
A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.
LACERDA
hangs out of the window.
LACERDA
It's great, isn't it?!
Jump in!
DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.
IN THE BRONCO.
DUKE hangs on with his beer.
Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.
LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all!
28.
LACERDA
I'll just keep trying different
combos of film and lenses till I
find one that works in this dust!
The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...
We hear music and voices singing:
BATTLE HYMN
"...As we go marching on
When I reach my final campground,
in
that land beyond the sun,
And the Great Commander asks me..."
[What did he ask you, Rusty?]
"Did you fight or did you run?"
A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.
DUKE
coughs, chokes, drinks beer.
BATTLE HYMN
(continuing)
[And what did you tell them,
Rusty?]
"We responded to their rifle fire
with everything we had..."
The sound of gun shots...
A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.
The radio blares:
"THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."
The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.
A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes.
A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.
They
yell over the roaring engines.
DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
Where's the damn race?
DUKE
Beats me.
We're just good patriotic
Americans like yourself.
DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.
In
response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his
grip on an automatic weapon.
DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
(suspiciously)
What outfit you fellas with?
29.
DUKE
The sporting press.
We're
friendlies.
Hired geeks.
The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.
DUKE
If you want a good chase, you
should get after that skunk from
CBS News up ahead in the black jeep.
He's the man responsible for that
book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.
DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1
HOT DAMN!
DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2
A black jeep, you say?
And they ROAR away.
DUKE
Take me back to the pits.
LACERDA
No, no -- we have to go on.
We
need total coverage.
DUKE gets out of the Bronco.
DUKE
You're fired.
After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver
roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.
DUKE (V/O)
It was time.
I felt, for an
Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole
scene.
The race was definitely
under way.
I had witnessed the
start; I was sure of that much.
But what now?
MUSIC PUMPS OUT.
CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.
THE
SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER
IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.
PSYCHEDELIC
LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.
CITY OF LOST
SOULS.
30.
DUKE
Turn up the radio!
Turn up the
tape machine!
Roll the windows
down.
Let's taste this cool desert
wind!
Aaah, yes!
This is what
it's all about!
DUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world.
GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor.
DUKE (V/O)
Total control now.
Tooling along
the main drag on a Saturday night
in Vegas, two good old boys in a
fire apple red convertible...
stoned, ripped, twisted... Good
people!
GONZO
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot
Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds
heavy.
Twenty-nine cent hotdogs...
DUKE
Look, what are we doing here?
Are
we here to entertain ourselves, or
to do the job?
GONZO
To do the job, of course.
Here we
go... a Crab Louie and quart of
muscatel for twenty dollars!
The Shark hits a bump.
GONZO
As your attorney I advise you to
drive over to the Tropicana and
pick up on Guy Lombardo.
He's in
the Blue Room with his Royal
Canadians.
They hit another bump.
DUKE
Why?
GONZO
Why what?
CUT to wide shot.
They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a
large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers.
31.
DUKE
Why should I pay out my hard-earned
dollars to watch a fucking corpse.
I don't know about you, but in my
line of business it's important to
be Hep.
TWO BIG SCREAMING FACES.
DOORMAN #1
What the hell are you doing?!
DOORMAN #2
You can't park here!
DUKE
Why not?
Is this not a reasonable
place to park?
Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the
Desert Inn.
TWO DOORMEN loom over the car hood.
The
MARQUEE says: TONIGHT.
DEBBIE REYNOLDS.
GONZO leaps from the car, waving a five-dollar bill at the
DOORMAN.
GONZO
We want this car parked!
We drove
all the way from L.A. for this show.
We're friends of Debbie's.
A pause, then... the DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a
parking stub.
DUKE and GONZO hurry into the hotel.
DUKE DRIVES FAST into the night.
They're both LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY.
DUKE
(in hysteria)
We wandered into a fucking time
capsule!
THEN... GONZO finds a TINY TEAR IN HIS JACKET...
GONZO
What's this?...
GONZO is instantly MOROSE.
GONZO
That scum...
GONZO twists round in the car -- SCREAMS back into the night.
GONZO
SCUM!
I know where you live!
I'll
find you and burn down your fucking
house!
A hundred foot high neon clown: BAZOOKO CIRCUS.
The RED SHARK pulls up beneath the sign.
DUKE
This is the place.
They'll never
fuck with us here.
GONZO
Where's the ether?
This mescaline
isn't working.
Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy
steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS
NOSE.
34.
DUKE (V/O)
Ah, devil ether.
It makes you
behave like the village drunkard in
some early Irish novel... total
loss of all basic motor skills;
blurred vision, no balance, numb
tongue --
(throws away kleenex)
The mind recoils in horror, unable
to communicate with the spinal
column.
Which is interesting,
because you can actually watch
yourself behaving in this terrible
way, but you can't control it.
DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care-
taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.
DUKE (V/O)
You approach the turnstiles and
know that when you get there, you
have to give the man two dollars or
he won't let you inside... but when
you get there, everything goes wrong.
THE ETHER KICKS IN:
DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES,
GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING
CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.
DUKE (V/O)
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
you think: What's happening here?
What's going on?
Then you hear
yourself mumbling.
DUKE
(mumbling)
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of
mine.
Watch out!... Why money?
My
name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
GONZO
Get sheep over side... women and
children to armored car... orders
from Captain Zeep.
The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES.
35.
DUKE (V/O)
Ether is the perfect drug for Las
Vegas.
In this town they love a
drunk.
Fresh meat.
So they put us
through the turnstiles and turned
us loose inside.
DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.
DUKE
Don't run.
They'd like any excuse
to shoot us.
GONZO
(in an extended fall)
You drive!
I think there's
something wrong with me.
We are in SAN FRANCISCO.
IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.
DUKE (V/O)
THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,
AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE
SPARKS ANYWHERE.
THERE WAS A
FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT
WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,
THAT WE WERE WINNING.
AND THAT, I
THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE
OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE
FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.
NOT IN ANY
MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T
NEED THAT.
OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY
prevail.
We had all the momentum;
we were riding the crest of a high
and beautiful wave...
DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
DUKE (V/O)
So now, less than five years later,
you can go up on a steep hill in
Las Vegas and look west, and with
the right kind of eyes you can
almost see the high water mark --
that place where the wave finally
broke and rolled back.
52.
The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.
Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi
shouting "WOODSTOCK BER ALLES!"
GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of
brand-new fine cowhide luggage.
DUKE (V/O)
Panic.
Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN
with a smile.
The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves
at the CAR BOY.
DUKE (V/O)
Stay calm.
Stay calm.
I'm a
relatively respectable citizen -- a
multiple felon, perhaps, but
certainly not dangerous.
The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.
DUKE jumps in.
The
back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint
400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.
DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
Luckily, I had taken the soap and
grapefruit and other luggage out to
the car a few hours earlier.
Now
it was only a matter of slipping
the noose...
DUKE shifts into drive.
Deliverance!
CLERK'S VOICE
MR. DUKE!
DUKE freezes.
CLERK'S VOICE
Mr. Duke!
We've been looking for
you!
DUKE (V/O)
The game was up!
They had me.
DUKE
(to himself)
Well, why not?
Many fine books
have been written in prison.
55.
Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.
A young CLERK
arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS
HAND.
CLERK
Sir?
(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
This telegram came for you.
Actually, it isn't for you.
It's
for somebody named Thompson, but it
says 'care of Raoul Duke'.
does
that make sense?
DUKE
(barely able to speak)
Yes... It makes sense.
DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.
The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous
stash inside.
CLERK
I checked the register for this man
Thompson.
We don't show him but I
figured he might be part of your
team.
DUKE
He is.
Don't worry, I'll get it to
him.
He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.
SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word
or two.
CLERK
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's
signature on the telegram from Los
Angeles.
When we knew he was right
here in the hotel.
DUKE
You did the right thing.
Never try
to understand a press message.
About half the time we use codes --
especially with Dr. Gonzo.
CLERK
Tell me.
When will the doctor be
awake?
56.
DUKE
(tenses)
Awake?
What do you mean?
DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.
CLERK
(uncomfortably)
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem,
would like to meet him.
Nothing
unusual.
Mr. Heem likes to meet
all our large accounts... put them
on a personal basis... just a chat
and a handshake, you understand.
DUKE
Of course.
But if I were you, I'd
leave the Doctor alone until after
he's eaten breakfast.
He's a very
crude man.
DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.
CLERK
But he will be available?
Perhaps
later this morning?
DUKE
Look.
That telegram was all
scrambled.
It was actually from
Thompson, not to him.
Western
Union must have gotten the names
reversed.
I have to get going.
I
have to get out to the track.
CLERK
There's no hurry!
The race is over!
DUKE
(taking off)
Not for me.
He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.
CLERK
Let's have lunch!
DUKE
Righto!
DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.
57.
A "YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS" sign flashes past.
Bob Dylan plays: "Memphis Blues Again -- "Aaww, Mama, can
this really by the end...?"
A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.
DUKE (V/O)
Jesus, bad waves of paranoia,
madness, fear and loathing --
intolerable vibrations in this
place.
Get out!
The weasels were
closing in.
I could smell the ugly
brutes.
Flee!
DUKE drives fast.
DUKE
Do me one last favor Lord: just
give me five more high-speed hours
before you bring the hammer down;
just let me get rid of this goddamn
car and off of this horrible desert.
A sign flashes "YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE."
A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.
DUKE (CONT'D)
You evil bastard!
This is your
work!
You'd better take care of
me, Lord... because if you don't
you're going to have me on your
hands.
The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.
DUKE (V/O)
Few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a Highway Traffic
Cop.
Your normal speeder will
panic and immediately pull over to
the side.
This is wrong.
DUKE floors the gas pedal.
DUKE (V/O)
It arouses contempt in the cop heart.
THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.
58.
DUKE (V/O)
Make the bastard chase you.
He
will follow.
But he won't know
what to make of your blinker signal
that says you're about to turn right.
DUKE signals right.
The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.
DUKE (V/O)
This is to let him know you're
looking for a proper place to pull
off and talk.
AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.
DUKE hits the brakes.
The COP brakes.
DUKE (V/O)
It will take him a moment to
realize that he is about to make
180 degree turn at speed... but you
will be ready for it, braced for
the G's and the fast heel toe work.
The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.
The patrol car comes skidding around the corner.
DUKE
stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.
The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Just what the FUCK did you think
you were doing?!
DUKE smiles.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
May I see your license.
DUKE
Of course, officer.
DUKE reaches for it.
And BOTH MEN look down at a beer
can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.
DUKE (V/O)
I knew I was fucked.
The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for
DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.
59.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Could I have that, please?
DUKE
Why not?
It was getting warm anyway.
The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --
glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.
Amongst the bars
of soap... A case of warm beer.
DUKE smiles back at him.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You realize...
DUKE
Yeah.
I know.
I'm guilty.
I
understand that.
I knew it was a
crime but I did it anyway.
Shit,
why argue?
I'm a fucking criminal.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That's a strange attitude.
He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You know -- I get the feeling you
could use a nap.
There's a rest
area up ahead.
Why don't you pull
over and sleep a few hours?
DUKE
A nap won't help.
I've been awake
for too long -- three or four
nights.
I can't even remember.
If
I go to sleep now, I'm dead for
twenty hours.
The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Okay.
Here's how it is.
What goes
into my book, as of noon, is that I
apprehended you... for driving too
fast, and advised you to proceed no
further than the next rest area...
your stated destination, right?
Where you plan to take a long nap.
Do I make myself clear?
DUKE
How far is Baker?
I was hoping to
stop there for lunch.
60.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Not my jurisdiction.
The city
limits are two point two miles
beyond the rest area.
Can you make
it that far?
DUKE
I'll try.
I've been wanting to go
to Baker for a long time.
I've
heard a lot about it.
The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Excellent seafood.
With a mind
like yours, you'll probably want to
try the land-crab.
Try the Majestic
Diner.
The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.
DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.
DUKE (V/O)
I felt raped.
The Pig had done me
on all fronts, and now he was going
off to chuckle about it -- on the
west side of town, waiting for me
to make a run for L.A.
DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he
signals to turn right into Baker.
As he approaches the turn
he sees the HITCHHIKER!
As DUKE slows to make the turn
their eyes meet.
DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER
drops his thumb.
DUKE
Great Jesus, it's him.
DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE
WAY HE CAME.
DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.
DUKE
They've nailed me!
I'm trapped in
some stinking desert crossroads
called Baker.
I don't have much
time.
The fuckers are closing in.
They'll hunt me down like a beast!
61.
DUKE screams -- sweat pouring.
DUKE
You bastard!
I need a lawyer
immediately!
DUKE
What?
Fuck telegrams.
I'm in
trouble.
You worthless bastard.
I'll cripple your ass for this!
All that shit in the car is yours!
You understand that?
When I finish
testifying out here you'll be
disbarred!
C/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.
DUKE (V/O)
Well.
This is how the world works.
C/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.
DUKE (V/O)
All energy flows according to the
whims of the Great Magnet.
C/U Barrel of the gun.
It fires.
An explosion of desert
dirt.
DUKE (V/O)
What a fool I was to defy Him.
The IGUANA sits unfazed.
DUKE (V/O)
Never cross the Great Magnet.
I
understood this now...
(another blast from
the gun)
... and with understanding came a
sense of almost terminal relief.
DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the
thuds of the explosions echo away.
The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.
63.
DUKE (V/O)
I had to get rid of The Shark.
Too
many people might recognize it...
...especially the Vegas Police.
(tight C/U of DUKE)
Luckily, my credit card was still
technically valid.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE
WHITE WHALE.
DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.
DUKE (V/O)
This was a superior machine -- ten
grand worth of gimmicks and high
price special effects.
The rear
windows leapt up with a touch like
frogs in a dynamited pond.
The
dashboard was full of esoteric
lights and dials and meters that I
would never understand.
A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S
CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.
DUKE (V/O)
If the Pigs were gathering in
Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture
should be represented as well...
and there was a certain bent appeal
in the notion of running a savage
burn on one Las Vegas hotel and
then just wheeling across town and
checking into another.
The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately
attended by impressed MINIONS.
DUKE (V/O)
Me and a thousand ranking cops from
all over America.
Why not?
Move
confidently into their midst.
The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.
GONZO helps
LUCY and her paintings from the car.
DUKE (V/O)
Lucy was a potentially fatal
millstone on both our necks.
There
was absolutely no choice but to cut
her adrift and hope her memory was
fucked.
GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --
waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.
She's starting
to come down...
GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands
together as if washing his hands of the situation.
GONZO
Well that's that.
Take off slowly.
Don't attract attention.
71.
They pull out into traffic.
GONZO
I gave the cabbie an extra ten
bucks to make sure she gets there
safe.
Also, I told him I'd be
there myself in an hour, and if she
wasn't, I'd come back out here and
rip his lungs out.
DUKE
That's good.
You can't be subtle
in this town.
GONZO
As your attorney, I advise you to
tell me where you put the goddamn
mescaline.
DUKE
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
GONZO
Right.
Let's find a good seafood
restaurant and eat some red salmon.
I feel a powerful lust for red
salmon...
The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.
The
sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson
tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.
GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.
In the background, DUKE opens curtains.
Daylight blinds him.
DUKE
Come on, we're going to be late.
GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth
with a towel.
GONZO
This goddamn mescaline.
Why the
fuck can't they make it a little
less pure?
Maybe mix it up with
Rolaids or something.
72.
The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.
DUKE (V/O)
There is a definite obligation,
when you boom around Vegas in a
white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a
certain style.
DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.
They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.
The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.
SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.
DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.
He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.
GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.
A sly look at the gathering
CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!
A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.
DUKE places another coconut.
SMASH!
Milk and white meat
flies everywhere.
SHOPPER #1
Hey!
Is that your car?
DUKE
Sure is.
SMASH!
Coconut fragments fly.
DUKE
Any of you folks want the milk?
We're after the meat.
This is
honest coconut essence.
Real meat.
SMASH!
96.
SHOPPER #2
Meat, hell!
Look what you're doing
to that car!
GONZO
Fuck the car.
They should make
these things with a goddamn FM radio.
SMASH!
DUKE
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is
sucking our dollar balance dry!
SHOPPER #3
Someone should stop them!
SMASH!
DUKE
You poor fools don't understand, do
you?
This car is the property of
the World Bank!
That money goes to
ITALY!
SHOPPER #3
Somebody should call the police!
GONZO
Police?
Are you people crazy?
GONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in
the other.
GONZO (CONT'D)
You folks every heard of ole
Patrick Henry?
Know what he said?!
Silence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE.
GONZO (CONT'D)
(ROARS)
GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!
GONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.
CLANG!
A gasp from the CROWD.
Getting ugly.
GONZO (CONT'D)
In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION!
SHOPPER #3
Bullshit.
97.
The CROWD move in.
SHOPPER #1
Call the goddamn police!
GONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.
CLANG!
SHOPPER #4
Look what they've done to that
beautiful car!
DUKE jumps in behind the wheel.
DUKE
This crowd is not rational.
They
can't relate to us.
Let's go!
A final CLANG!
GONZO jumps in.
DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.
DUKE
You people voted for Hubert Humphrey!
You killed Jesus!
They swerve round and through the CROWD.
DUKE (V/O)
The crowd broke ranks.
Nobody
wants to be run over by a Coupe de
Ville.
RENTAL AGENT
Holy God!, how did this happen?
DUKE
They beat the shit out of it.
RENTAL AGENT
The top's completely jammed!
The CAR RENTAL AGENT wrestles with the trashed car.
DUKE
Yeah, something's wrong with the
motor...
WHACK!
SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD
KICKING.
BRUTAL AND UGLY.
DUKE (V/O)
North Vegas is where you go when
you've fucked up once too often on
The Strip and when you're not even
welcome in the cut-rate Downtown
places.
PAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the
background.
Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the
counter.
The WHITE WHALE, looking like shit -- it's TOP HALF UP,
TORN, SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION
as the light turns red.
DR. GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.
DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach
with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.
GONZO
What are you doing?
You were
supposed to turn back there!
DUKE (V/O)
We had abused every rule that Vegas
lived by -- burning the locals,
abusing the tourists, terrifying
the help.
The only chance now, I
felt, was the possibility that we'd
gone to such excess that nobody in
the position to bring the hammer
down on us could possibility
believe it.
DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
105.
GONZO
Jesus Christ!!!
There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her
paintings under her arm -- looking lost.
SHE LOOKS UP WITH
A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...
DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS
OFF.
THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.
GONZO
looks wildly around.
GONZO
Goddamnit!
We're lost!
What are
we doing out here on this
godforsaken road?
GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT
RUNWAY.
GONZO
The airport is over there!
DUKE
Never missed a plane yet.
DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.
WHEELS CHURNING,
HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight
up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the
RUNWAY.
GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.
He
throws a worried look at DUKE.
DUKE
I'll drop you right next to the
plane.
They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET
ENGINE SCREAM.
GONZO
No!
I can't get out!
They'll
crucify me.
I'll have to take the
blame!
106.
DUKE
(irritatedly)
Ridiculous!
Just say you were
hitchhiking to the airport and I
picked you up.
You never saw me
before.
Shit, this town is full of
white Cadillac convertibles.
I
plan to go through there so fast
that nobody will even glimpse the
goddamn license plate.
You ready?
GONZO
Why not?
But for Christ's sake,
just do it fast!
DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.
GONZO
JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.
DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.
DUKE
Hey!
GONZO stops -- turns.
DUKE
Don't take any guff from those
swine.
Remember, if you have any
trouble you can always send a
telegram to the Right People.
GONZO
Yeah... Explaining my Position.
Some asshole wrote a poem about
that once...
GONZO pauses.
GONZO
Probably good advice, if you have
shit for brains.
GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT
TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND
LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.
DUKE (V/O)
There he goes -- one of God's own
prototypes -- a high powered mutant
of some kind never even considered
for mass production.
Too weird to
live and too rare to die.
107.
DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.
PULL BACK WITH
THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.
A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.
The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.
A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump.
DUKE (V/O)
There was only one road back to L.A.
US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
high speed burn through Baker and
Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
Hollywood Freeway straight into
frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
just another freak in the Freak
Kingdom.
DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer.
DUKE
Ahhh.
Wonderful.
DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.
Gets out and walks in.
A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...
110.
A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.
Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...
DUKE switches on the ignition.
Something rolls off the
trembling dash... DUKE catches it...
ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...
DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.
THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.
DUKE
HOLY SHIT!!!
DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT
THE MARINES.
DUKE
GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!
DUKE ROARS AWAY.
AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.
DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!
DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.
DUKE (V/O)
My heart was filled with joy.
I
felt like a monster reincarnation
of Horatio Alger... a man on the
move... and just sick enough to be
totally confident.
The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
