      The car's DRIVER - a ruggedly HANDSOME MAN in his 30s - is
      being thrown over the side of the car.

                    Oh, Dmitry.  Sorry, lover.

      Then she runs the opposite way -

      over the pavement, blocking the path -

      She looks behind - a good distance back, pushing through
      the crowd, more POLICE on walkie-talkies, hurrying, urgent
      (though not seeing her) - 

      Ahead - the POLICE getting out of the car, looking round -
      led by D.I. MCMILLAN, 40s, grizzled, barking orders -  

      On Christina - trapped!  They're closing in on both sides -

      Opposite, on the other side of the street, more POLICE,
      spreading out, but then - 

      That view's blocked off as a RED DOUBLE DECKER BUS thunders
      in, hisses to a halt!  Right in front of her!  It's the
                  The 
      200 - Victoria, Vauxhall, Oval, Brixton.  

      A lad called NATHAN, 20, white t-shirt & jeans, gets on
      board - Christina looking right and left, trapped - 

      No choice!  Christina follows him -

                    but I think we've gone a little
                    bit further than Brixton.

      PULL BACK...

      REVEAL the BUS - wrecked!  Metal twisted and mangled, PRAC
      SMOKE drifting out of the top.  Pulling out wider...

      The broken bus in the middle of a VAST DESERT.  Standing
      alone in the expanse, wheels half-buried in the sand.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      FX SHOT: three suns, blazing in the sky.

      PRAC SMOKE just dying away from the bus (and ending, in
      this scene).  BARCLAY, NATHAN & ANGELA, spreading out, not
      moving too far from the bus, all taking layers off, because
      of the heat.  DRIVER'S in his seat, trying the engine - it
      revs, but the bus isn't moving.  (THE DOCTOR in b/g, running
      sand through his fingers, CHRISTINA going to join him.)

      to the wheels, which are half-sunk in sand.

                    It's still intact, though!  Not as
                    bad as it looks, the chassis's
                    still holding together.  Oh my

                    Then what are we waiting for?

      And he's yomping across the sand, towards it -

                    No, don't - I said don't - !

      And the Driver yomps forward -

      FX: he hits the WORMHOLE FX, which RIPPLES around him, as
      he becomes a SCREAMING SKELETON!

                                                                            CUT TO:

      forward warily to inspect it - but now both flinching back
      as PRAC LIGHT flares over them -

      FX: THE WORMHOLE RIPPLE around a SCREAMING SKELETON - !

      Then clunk!  A smoking PRAC SKELETON hits the ground.

      The Driver's ID badge clinks across the tarmac.

      Ripple gone.  Grim silence.  Then:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    It was the bus.  Look at the damage,
                    that was the bus protecting us. 
                    Great big box made of metal. 

                                      CHRISTINA
                    Rather like a Faraday cage?

                                      NATHAN
                    Like in a thunderstorm, yeah? 
                    Safest place is inside a car, cos
                    the metal conducts the lightning
                    right through.  We did it in school!

                    But if we can only travel back
                    inside the bus... a Faraday Cage
                    needs to be closed.  That thing's
                    been ripped wide open!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Slightly different dynamics, with
                      a wormhole, there's enough metal
                    to make it work.  I think.  I hope.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    Then we have to drive five tons of
                    bus, which is currently buried in
                    the sand.  And we've got nothing
                    but our bare hands.  Correct?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'd say nine-and-a-half tons, but
                    the point still stands, yes.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    Then we need to apply ourselves to

                    Yes, at last, thank you, so -

                                      CHRISTINA
                    I don't think anything's safe any
                  The 
                    more, but if it's a choice between
                    baking in there, or roasting out
                    here, I'd say baking is slower. 
                    Come on!  All of you!  Right now!

      They all obey, she strides towards the bus.

      Near the tunnel, POLICE CARS dotted about, but -

      ROAR OF VEHICLES, as UNIT arrives!

      ARMY TRUCKS screech to a halt, disgorging SOLDIERS -

                                      CHRISTINA
                    ...what?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I said no.

                                      CHRISTINA
                    But I saved your life.  And you
                    saved mine.

                    So?

                    We're surrounded by police.  I'll

                                      CHRISTINA
                    But you were right, it's not about
                    the money, I only steal things for
                    the adventure, and today, with
                    you...  I want more days like this. 
                    I want every day to be like this. 
                    We're made for each other, you
                    said so yourself.  The perfect
                    team.
                          (pause.  Then, quiet:)
                    Why not?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    People have travelled with me. 
                    And I've lost them.  I lost them
                    all.  Never again.  

      And MCMILLAN & SGT DENNISON are there - Dennison snapping
      cuffs on her wrists - Christina just looking at the Doctor -

                    Lady Christina de Souza!  Oh, I've
                    waited a long time to say this!  I
                    am arresting you on suspicion of
                    theft.  You do not have to say
                    anything, etcetera!  Dennison,
                    take her away! 

      And they frogmarch her away, across the tarmac.

      Christina looking back, at the Doctor.  Imploring.

      But he just stands by the Tardis.  Watching her go.

      And then, quietly...

                                      CARMEN
                  The 
                    Doctor?

      He turns - good distance away, CARMEN & LOU are being led
      away for debriefing by a (friendly) UNIT SOLDIER.  But
      Carmen is staring at the Doctor; haunted, and so wise:

                                      CARMEN (CONT'D)
                    You take care, now.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    And you!  Chops and gravy, lovely!

                                      CARMEN
                    No, but you be careful.  Because
                    your song is ending, sir.

                    ...what do you mean?

                                      CARMEN
                    It is returning.  It is returning
                    through the dark.  And then,
                    Doctor...  Ohh, but then... 
                          (pause)
                    He will knock four times.

      And she turns away, so sad.  Walks away with Lou...

      The Doctor staring. 

      So many things turning in his head, now. 

      And slowly, he turns and looks...

      Good distance away: the POLICE CAR has pulled up.  MCMILLAN
      & DENNISON are putting CHRISTINA in the back seat...

      And the Doctor holds up the sonic.

      CU on Christina's handcuffs, snapping undone -

      As she gets into the car -

      - then gets out of the other side!  Running!!

                                      MCMILLAN
                    Stop that woman!  Stop her!!

      - Christina running - and she's heading for the bus -

      - and she leaps inside!  (The bus stands alone, all the
      passengers & soldiers having been moved away, now.)

      She slams the button -
                  The 

      McMillan and Dennison run up, as the doors hisss closed -
      they bang on the doors -

                                      MCMILLAN (CONT'D)
                    I'll add resisting arrest!

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'd stand back, if I were you.

                                      MCMILLAN
                          (at the Doctor)
                    And I'm charging you, too!  Aiding

                    Yes, I'll just step inside this
                    police box and arrest myself.

      Christina at the wheel, big smile, turns it -

      McMillan and Dennison blasted back by PRAC SMOKE -

      FX: AND THE BUS SLOWLY RISES!  Just a few feet...

      MAGAMBO watching, at a distance, with MALCOLM and JENNER,
      and ANGELA, BARCLAY, NATHAN.  All smiling.  Angela cheering!

      The Doctor loving it!

      Doors hisss open.  Christina looks down at the Doctor.

                    We could've been so good together.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                      Christina.  We were.

      FX: THE BUS lifts into the sky, then ZOOMS AWAY, gone - !

      The Doctor turns away, unlocks the Tardis door, heading
      inside.  And he's laughing!
