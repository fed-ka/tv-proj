      Jane, Lisbon, Rigsby and CHO walk across open desert.  Jane has 
      a paper bag of sandwiches.  Rigsby has a SHOTGUN.

      Cho has a hand-held GPS that he uses to guide them on their way.  
      The Sierra Nevada mountains rise up before them on the horizon.

      Lisbon is grumpy.  Jane is happy to be out and about.     

                                  LISBON
                    How much further?

                                  CHO
                      Forty-nine meters. 

      They walk on a while.  It is beautiful out here.  Jane stops 
      and picks a pebble-size object off the ground. 

                                  JANE 
                    Look at that.  Look what I found.  

                                  LISBON 
                    What is it?

                                  JANE
                    It's a worm.  A fossilized worm.

                                  LISBON
                    I'm happy for you. 

      Jane et al reach a wide circular clearing in the creosote 
      bushes and cactus.

                                  CHO 
                    This is it.  This is the spot.

                      Eleven-oh-four and change.  Right 
                    on time.

                                  LISBON
                    For what?  

      They look around.  Nothing and nobody in sight.

                                  CHO
                    There's still fifteen seconds to go.

                                  JANE 
                    When this worm was alive all of 
                    this desert was the floor of a 
                    great sea, and there were dinosaurs 
                    swimming above us.

                                  RIGSBY
                    That is kind of awesome.

      Jane gives the rock to Cho.

                    Still, there were giant sharks here.

                    Okay.  We've done our job.  Someone 
                    jerked our chain pretty good. Let's go. 

                                  JANE
                    Wait.  We should wait a little.

                    I have no idea.  But it's a pleasant 
                    spot, and we have sandwiches.

                                  LISBON
                    Eat them in the car.  We've wasted

      Jane looks directly up and they all do likewise... 

      THEIR POV -- a MAN PLUMMETS FROM THE SKY directly above them, 
      his face in a rictus of wide-eyed open-mouthed screaming fear.  
      BLAAAM -- He hits the ground right in front of them, raising a 
      cloud of dust.  ON their stunned expressions...

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      The same scene an hour after impact.  Now there's COPS and 
      FORENSICS TECHS, a coroner's truck and a couple of sheriff's 
      vehicles and TWO NEWS CREWS at the roadside, a thousand yards 
      from Whitaker's body.  

      Rigsby takes details from JOYCE TRAN, one of FIVE PEOPLE IN 
      JUMPSUITS toting helmets.  (They are Tran, NADIA SOBELL,    
      DE SHAUN BRAEMAR, HOLDEN PEARY and RAND FAULK.  Those not 
      talking to Rigsby are blackberrying.  I'll describe each of 
      them as they introduce themselves into the story.)

      Cho walks away from the body toward this scene as he breaks 
      it down on the phone...

                                  CHO
                    Our victim's name is David 
                      Whittaker.  One of a party of six 
                    casual sky divers that went up with 
                    an instructor this morning.  
                    All executives of a company called 
                    Carnelian Prime Trust, out here on 
                      a corporate adventure retreat.  Our 
                    victim was VP of human resources.        

      INTERCUT WITH: 


      Cho heads back to the road where all the big vehicles are 
      parked, taking us to...

      ANGLE -- By the CBI VEHICLE, in a personalized jumpsuit, Jane 
      and Lisbon talk with MIKE SPRUELL (40's crew-cut ex-military) 
      as he examines the HARNESS that the dead man was wearing.

                    Yes, see?  Right here?  The master 
                    strap was cut nearly all the way 
                    through.  That has to be 
                      deliberate.  That's evil.  

      INSERT:  On the harness; a tell tale clean-edged cut through 
      most of the strap. 

                                    SPRUELL (CONT'D)
                    The whole shebang would have just 
                    ripped apart when deployed.  The 
                    chute would come clean off.

                                  LISBON
                    Who rigged the chutes?

                                    SPRUELL
                    Me.  I did.  Yesterday evening. 
                    And double-checked every one of 
                    them A-Okay.  I guarantee it.  
                    This, this was done afterwards. 

                                  JANE
                    By someone who knows about 
                      parachutes.

                                    SPRUELL
                    Yes.  I've been rigging chutes for 
                    fifteen years.  Not one accident. 
                    Not one.  Never... This is 
                      unreal....

                          (re: harness)
                    There's a number here.  Is there 
                    any way to identify which chute 
                    would go with which jumper?  Are 
                    they assigned to individuals?

                                    SPRUELL 
                    No.  I have the jumpers pick up the 
                    first one they come to and put it 
                    on.  The rigs are only numbered for 
                      maintenance logs.

                                  LISBON
                    Who had access to the chutes after 
                    you rigged them?

                                    SPRUELL
                    They were in the hangar overnight.  
                    We don't lock it.  So...

                    So anyone with access to the 
                    airport, basically.

      Spruell nods.  Rand Faulk approaches and interrupts with an 
      air of natural command.  He's a big tall handsome man.  

                                  FAULK
                    Agent Lisbon, is it?   We're 
                    leaving.  Keep my office informed.
                          (to Spruell)
                    You'll be hearing from our lawyers.  

      Faulk strides away, talking to his EARPHONE.  He waves his 
      hand in the air and a BLACK LIMO and a BLACK HIGH-END SUV 
      glide to rest at his side. 

                                  FAULK (CONT'D)
                    ...Yes.  Do it now.  But at two 
                    point five...
                          (listens)
                    Tell him I don't care.  

      Lisbon shakes her head, amused rather than angered by Faulk's 
      manner.  Jane looks at her, as to say, are you going to let 
      him get away with that?

                                  LISBON
                    Hush.
                          (beat, raises her voice 
                            just enough)
                    Mr. Faulk.  

      Faulk turns around.   

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    This is a murder investigation.
                    You can't leave until we say you 
                    can leave. 

      Faulk is given pause, he takes a beat before choosing a 
      patronizing smile.

                                  FAULK
                      I apologize.  I thought we'd 
                    answered all your questions.  
                    Do we have your permission to 
                    leave, Agent Lisbon?  

                                  LISBON
                    Yes you do.  But we'll have a lot 
                    of follow-up questions.

                    Yes we do.  See you soon, Mr. 
                    Faulk.

      Beckoning briskly to Sobell, Faulk gets into the limo and 
      Sobell follows.  The other Carnelian execs get into the SUV, 
      and the two cars glide away.  

      Off Lisbon's showdown with Faulk, Jane mimes putting away six 
      guns.  Lisbon waves off the teasing compliment, and addresses 
      Cho and Rigsby as they approach and walk together toward 
      their vehicles.

      The MAIN HOUSE is surrounded by BUNKHOUSES and BARNS and 
      STABLES.  

      MOS Jane and Lisbon pull up in a CBI car.

      They exit the car and walk to the main house.  A skinny old

                    Following Mr. Whittaker's horrific 
                    death, a message was sent, within 
                    the past hour, to the police and 
                    several media outlets, including 
                    Channel 2 News.  It reads, "I have 
                    proved my strength"...


        ESTABLISHING a 60's terminal.  A row of hangars.  One runway. 


      An off the grid, semi-self sufficient homestead in the woods. 
      Angry and hyped, LEE SKELLING comes out the front door in 
      cuffs, held by Rigsby and Cho.  They head for the CBI van.

                                  SKELLING
                      Snivelling lackeys of pigs is what 
                    you are, you know that?  You know 
                    that?  Goddamn lackeys!  Cattle!

      A TEN YEAR OLD BOY, call him TANNER appears in the doorway 
      with a SHOT GUN, cocks it.

                    him right now!

      Cho and Rigsby stop moving, but don't let go of Skelling. 

                                  SKELLING
                    It's not loaded.  Not loaded.

                    But Daddy...

      JESSIE SKELLING emerges from the house carrying a BABY -- 
      She's late 30's, beautiful, but kinda pale and sickly, 
      wearing jeans and a wolf T-shirt, an incongruously lush 
      blonde head of hair.    She snatches the gun out of the boy's 
      hands and cuffs him around the back of the head.

                                  JESSIE SKELLING
                    Get inside, boy.

      The boy obeys.  Jessie gives Cho and Rigsby a defiant look 
      and follows him indoors.  Cho and Rigsby sigh with relief. 
      Skelling scoffs at them as they continue on to the van.

                                  SKELLING
                    Scared the pants off you, didn't

                    Yes he did.

                                  RIGSBY
                    No he didn't.

      FADE IN:


      Jane and Lisbon drive through early morning desert beauty.


      Jane and Lisbon get out of their car, and head for the front 
      door. Jessie Skelling emerges from the house with a BABY on 
      her hip.  Lisbon shows her badge.

                                  JESSIE SKELLING
                    Your friends already took Lee.

      Jessie turns and goes indoors.  Jane and Lisbon follow. 


      Horses running across their paddock to watch Jane's Citroen 
      arrive.  ARMED SECURITY MEN are on guard.


      Faulk, Sobell, Tran, Peary and Braemar in cowboy gear.  
      Horses are being prepped in BG.  Jane and Lisbon approach.

                    Good morning.  I understand that 
                    you released a promising suspect.

                    Meh.  We don't like him for it.

                    Lisbon disagrees with me, I think 
                    that the answer lies with one of 
                    you here.

                    That's absurd.

                    Why?

                    You're saying one of us sabotaged

                                  JANE 
                    Why not?  The chutes were all 
                    clearly numbered.  The saboteur 
                    would simply have to make sure not 
                    to choose the dud.

                                  PEARY
                    But they couldn't know who would 
                    pick the dud.  They'd be killing a 
                    randomly selected colleague.  Why 
                    would anyone want to do that?

                    find out.  Tell us a little about 
                      yourselves.  Let's use this sadness

                    I'll tell you what I think, just to 
                    get the ball rolling.  I think 
                    you've made your way in the world 
                    by concealing your true feelings 
                    under a mask of positivity and 
                    niceness.  Underneath, you're a 
                    seething mass of ugly bitter 
                      resentment. 

      Tran looks sour and opens her mouth to make a caustic reply, 
      but Jane turns to Peary.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You think Faulk is a stupid 
                    buffoon, but you're far too clever 
                    to be brave and tell him so.

                                  PEARY
                    How dare --

      Jane's moved on already.

                    -- And you, Mr. Braemar.  Marine

      Braemar shakes his head in disgust and puzzlement.

                                    BRAEMAR
                    That's baseless and inappropriate.

                      I apologize.  Mr. Jane is a

                    picture of the group dynamic here.

                    Why would anyone resent it?

                    We'll have to remedy that.  Let's 
                    do a trust fall.

      She turns her back to him.  Pauses a moment.  Can't believe 
      she's going through with this.  Closes her eyes and drops 
      backwards straight into Jane's waiting arms.  He peers down 
      at her.

      Jane and Lisbon confer with the Officer, holding the bomb to 
      show them what happened.

                    She's a nasty little girl.  Timed 
                    to blow at midnight.  Anyone inside 
                    twenty feet would have been red

                    here?  It came loose at some point.  
                    Disarmed her.  Silly mistake.

                    Huh.  Lucky.  

      Jane starts to poke at the device, inquisitive as ever. 

                                  BOMB SQUAD OFFICER
                    Don't do that.  Even when it's 
                    disarmed, if you touch the red 
                    terminal, that'll close the

                    sighting of him was mid-morning, at

                    Yes, that's the question.  
                      Whittaker's death was random.  Any
