                                  MR. RAY
                    Well, let s start with soft targets.

    MR. RAY, a cheery Tony Robbins efficiency expert with a power-
      point.  WILL paces at the back, DIANE seated.  No one else.

                                  MR. RAY (CONT D)
                    These are reductions you can make 
                    without further layoffs or 
                    reorganization.

    He clicks a power point.  The screen remains blank.  Oy.

                                  WILL
                    Is one of them I.T.?

                                  DIANE
                    Why don t you just tell us.  

                                  MR. RAY
                    Certainly.  Annually you spend 
                    $10,000 on paper products.  Cups.

                                  WILL
                    You re kidding.

                                  MR. RAY
                    We would suggest moving to a self-
                    policing hydration policy.

                                  WILL
                    What, everybody brings their own 
                    cups?

                                  MR. RAY
                    Yes.  The policy is presented as 
                     Going green -- with fact sheets 
                    posted next to coolers on reducing 
                    land fills. 

      Will and Diane trade a look.  Again oy.

                                  MR. RAY (CONT D)
                    You spend $38,000 on season tickets 
                    to the Chicago Cubs--

                                  MR. RAY
                    We would suggest season tickets for 
                    a less expensive sport franchise.  
                    The Chicago Red Stars.

                                  DIANE
                    We ve got to cut somewhere.

                                  MR. RAY
                    The floral budget for the firm is 
                    $28,000.

                                  WILL
                          (sees Diane s wince)
                    Yep, cut somewhere.   

                                  MR. RAY
                    We suggest moving to perennials or 
                    going artificial.  We also suggest 
                    you no longer validate for parking.  

      Will sighs-- this ll take a while-- dials his cellphone...


      Alicia s cellphone rings.  A hand reaches for it, answers...

                                  PETER
                    Hello.

      INTERCUT with... Will, still in the conference room, confused:

                                  WILL
                    Oh, I...  Is this...? 

                                  PETER
                    No. Alicia left her cellphone at 
                    home.

                                  WILL
                    Oh. 

      Will pauses, knows who it is.  PETER pauses, knows who it is.

                    I ll try him.  Thanks.

    And Will hangs up, considers it: well, that was interesting.  
    He starts to dial again as we CUT TO... 

      ...Peter clicking off the cell, lays it down.  Considers it

      Alicia looks over at Cary, ready to argue, but sees he s got 
      something in his hand over his hand.  His cellphone.  Light 
      blinking.  Alicia stares at him: wide-eyed.  Are you crazy?  
    But Cary just smiles and winks.  And...

                    Dorfman was defending a drug

                    Kelli Gerber Smith-- and Dorfman 
                    supposedly gave her name to his

      Peter entering the kitchen, moving away from his arguing

      Peter changes directions, starts toward the master bedroom.

                    here.  Will phoned.

                    your honor, and I m sorry to hear

                    Thank you; I got your card.  I 
                    imagine you are seeking detention 
                    pending trial?"

      Will looks over at these two.  Excluding him. 

                                  RIVERS
                    Yes, your honor.  Mr. Dorfman, in 
                    our opinion, released a witness list 
                    to a killer, and given that there 
                    will be vulnerable witnesses in this 
                    case, we ask for pretrial detention.   

                                  WILL
                    Your Honor, this is a simple case of 
                      harassment.

      Will pauses.  Alicia looks past him at the judge who uses a 
      hanger to scratch under her irritated cast.

                                  WILL
                    Excuse me.

                    Mr. Gardner is prone to hyperbole, your 
                    Honor.  Kelli Gerber Smith offered to 
                    testify against one of the most 
                    dangerous kingpins in this country, and, 
                    in our opinion, was brutally tortured 
                    and murdered for her troubles.

                                  WILL
                    The prosecution s evidence is thin 
                    at best.  Generic carpet fibers 
                    found on the body and access to a 
                    witness list.  That hardly makes 
                      EricDorfman suspect number one.*

                    Yes, your honor, I thought it was

                    Gardner, your honor.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    It s equally obvious that I m a judge, 
                    and yet you continually refer to me as 
                     your honor.   All I ask is that you 
                    do the same with your opinion, and 
                    remind yourself and the court that it 
                    is in fact your opinion.  

      Will stares at her, stupefied.  Is it hazing or what?

                                  RIVERS
                    Your honor, if I could return to the 
                    facts.  Mr. Dorfman was one of four 
                    people to hold the witness list that was 
                    sealed under a court order.  There were 
                    carpet fibers found on the tarp covering 
                    Ms. Smith s body that came directly from 
                    Mr. Dorfman s law firm.  And he was, in 
                    our opinion, the only one with anything 
                    to gain if her name got out.   

                                  WILL
                    This is a vindictive prosecution 
                    and should be treated as such... 
                          (afterthought)
                    ...in my opinion.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    The court disagrees, Mr. Gardner, and 
                    orders pretrial detention.  I ll see 
                    you both back here on Wednesday at 
                    nine a.m. forpretrial motions. 

    And that s it.  Will frowns at the judge.  Then sees Rivers 
      shooting a cocky look his way as he leaves.


                                  DIANE
                    It s their playground; you play by 
                    their rules.

                    Rivers found the black SUV that 
                    carried this dead witness.  
                      Unfortunately, this SUV was never 
                    meant to be discovered, so it may not 
                    be as...  clean  as one would hope.

                    Was Dorfman ever in this SUV?

      Gurstelle just stares at her.  Not gonna answer that.

                    Again, if there is any attempt to 
                    subpoena or question myself or Mr.

                    but Rivers discovered this SUV two weeks 
                    ago-- right after the murder-- and he has 
                    kept it under wraps ever since.

                                  KALINDA
                    Why?

                                  GURSTELLE
                    To keep it out of your hands.  To 
                    surprise you at trial.  We would 
                    advise you to fight it s inclusion.  

    And that s it: Gurstelle goes.  Kalinda and Alicia watch him.

                                  ALICIA
                    Talk about pacts with the devil: 
                    getting trial advice from the killers.


      Will stands.  In court again:

                                  WILL
                    Objection, your honor.  This SUV was 
                    kept from us intentionally.  The only 
                    reason the court knows about it at 
                    all is because webrought it up!  It 
                    should be thrown out.

      Judge Pam Lester barely looks at him... 

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    I ll give you some leeway, Rivers.  
                    Go ahead.

      Will frowns, sits beside a worried Dorfman in orange 
      jumpsuit, two guards behind him.  Alicia and Cary watching.  
    We glimpse Tammyin the gallery.*

                                  RIVERS
                    In addition, your honor, we 
                    discovered an impression made on 
                    the console from a hastily written 
                    note.   Gerbre.   
                          (offersa photo)
                    This of course was the middle name 
                    of the victim, and as you can see 
                    the last two letters were inverted.  
                    This clearly matches...
                          (another photo)
                    ...the accidental inversion made on 
                    the witness list.  We submit this 
                    into evidence--

                    Objection, your honor.  Again this 
                    evidence has been intentionally withheld 
                    from us, summarily removed from all 
                    exhibit lists, and should be excluded.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER

                          (frowns: fuck her)
                    Yes, in my opinion.

                                  RIVERS
                    While Mr. Gardner and his white shoe 
                    firm may have the resources to process 
                    evidence expeditiously, in our opinion, 
                    the Federal government does not.  

                                  WILL
                    Not according to your own lab s time 
                    stamp.  IN MY OPINION... Mr. Rivers was 
                    holding onto this key discovery evidence 
                    for weeks, your honor, and lying to this 
                    court about its existence--

                                  RIVERS
                    Mr. Gardner is working with old 
                    information, in our opinion.  I 
                    would submit this revision of the 
                    evidence room stamp--

                                  WILL
                    Objection.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    I will accept.  Continue, Rivers.

                                  RIVERS
                    Thank you.  I would-- 

                                  WILL
                    Excuse me, your honor, I objected.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    Yes, I know, Mr. Gardner, and I 
                    accepted Rivers evidence.

                                  WILL
                    Yes, but you failed to rule.

    The judge looks up as... Dorfman tenses: what are you doing?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      28.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    My ruling is implicit, Mr. Gardner.  
                    Now sit down.

                                  WILL
                    No, it isn t, your honor.  And I 
                    will sit down when you rule.

      Silence in the court.  You could hear a pin drop.  Alicia 
      watches this stand-off, a red-faced Judge flabbergasted.  

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    Would you like to be held in 
                    contempt, Mr. Gardner?

                                  WILL
                    No, I wouldn t, your honor.  But I 
                    would like a ruling on my objection.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    You are trying my patience...

                                  WILL
                    I understand that, your honor, but we 
                    both know if you don t use the proper 
                    form of  sustained  or  overruled,  the 
                    matter can t be later appealed; and I was 
                    surprised, in reviewing your past court 
                    cases, how often you encouraged lawyers 
                    to move on without actually ruling, and 
                    therefore avoided having your  non-
                    rulings  overturned on appeal...

      Silence.  The judge ready to explode.  Oh, Will adds:  

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    ...inmy opinion.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    Mr. Gardner, I have never quite 
                    been so... offendedin all my years 
                    on the bench.

                                  WILL
                    I understand that, your honor, but 
                    I still want a ruling.  A ruling I 
                    can appeal.

      Rivers looks over at Will, startled by his balls, but sees 
      Judge Lester s resolve weakening.  Shoring her up:

                                  WILL
                    Well, a conviction is necessary for 
                    your prosecution, but that doesn t 
                    make it a worthy argument.

    An angry Judge Lester sweeps out of court, and Will collects 
    his papers to leave, looks back at Alicia, sees her smiling 
    in awe.  He smiles back, likes the confirmation.

                    What the hell was that?

      Will turns to find Rivers charging up to him.  Calmly:

                    Do you have a map?

                    to derail Peter s campaign, then I 
                    realized, no, it s about you.  
                    We re just collateral damage.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Yes. Ben Smith just linked to it in a 
                    Remainder item, so it might get some 
                    wider play. Please excuse the melodrama, 
                    but does anyone here have it out for you?

      Alicia shoots a look toward Cary.  Eli Gold sees the look.

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    Young guy, twelve o clock?  Would 
                    he know you and Peter are in 
                    separate rooms?

                          (horrified)
                    That s in here?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    He even mentioned the name of the 
                    moving company that put the bed in.

                                  ALICIA
                     Saint Alicia?   It doesn t sound 
                    like him.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    That s the thing about the internet.  
                    Nobody sounds like themselves.


      Courtney eats a sandwich in the small conference room 
      laughing with another assistant when they see Alicia enter.   

                                  ALICIA
                    Hi.

    The other assistant nods, gets up, leaves.  Lunch over.

                                  COURTNEY
                    Want to make a call, Mrs. Florrick?

                                  ALICIA
                    No, no.  Just--  You know the movers 
                    I had out to put the other bed in?

                                  COURTNEY
                    Your apartment?  Yes.

                                  ALICIA
                    Is there any way... Cary could ve 
                    heard about that?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  

      Courtney stares at her.  A bit offended.

                                  COURTNEY
                    No.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t mean, on purpose.

                                  COURTNEY
                    I m discreet, Mrs. Florrick.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, I know, it s not-- It s just, 
                    the blue tooth...
                          (points to her ear)
                    You could say something near...

    But Alicia sees her offended face, and decides to back down.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Forget it.  Nothing.

      Courtney nods.  But isoffended.  Shit--Alicia backs away, 
    out of the conference room, and...


        ...crossestoward her office, eyeing Cary, as she...


      ...goes to her laptop, clicks on a web site, sees another 
      tweet pop up...  Upriser7: No time for more now.  Lter.  
      Alicia looks across toward Cary, typing.  But she pauses, 
      notices something else... on her couch...

      A large brown grocery bag.  She picks up her phone, starts 
      toward the bag... 

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, could you stop Mr. Gold.  He 
                    just left--

    But Alicia PAUSES, seeing the bag is filled with hundred 
      dollar bills.  Blocks of them.  Wrapped in bank tape.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      34.

                    Um, no, my mistake.  

    She hangs up.  Gapes.  The bag.  It s filled with hundreds. 
      $100,000?  More?  Each block marked $5,000.  Holy--!

      Alicia looks up.  Coworkers passing blithely; Courtney, 
      crossing toward her workstation, shooting miffed looks toward 
      her.  Alicia thinks for a second, turning over the 
      possibilities.  She picks up the phone... No.  She goes to her 
      door, looks out... um... where is she?  There.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Kalinda?
                          (her voice too low)
                    Kalinda.

    She waves to Kalinda.  Kalinda waves back parodying.  But 
      Alicia gestures urgently.  Okay, Kalinda approaches...

                                  KALINDA
                    What s up?

                          (a little pinched)
                    Could you come into my office?

                                  KALINDA
                    Why certainly, ma am.

      Kalinda enters.  Alicia closes the door.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Could you look in that bag?

                                  KALINDA
                    That bag?

      Yes.  Kalinda smiles-- why the drama?-- crosses to it, peers 
    in.  Her smile drops.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Money.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

                                  KALINDA
                    A lot of it.

                                  ALICIA
                    It would appear so.

      Kalinda nods, exits, as Alicia looks after her.  Um?  


    The money.  Now in a organized heap on Diane s desk.  

                                  KALINDA
                      Two-hundred thousand dollars.  And 
                    the vague whiff of marijuana.

      Diane, Alicia, Kalinda stare at it.

                    Bishop?  Nothing.  We asked him 
                    about the murder.  

      Will enters, checking his Blackberry.

                                  WILL
                    Yeah, what s up?  And why does it

      Alicia shifts uncomfortably.  Bishop notices this, eyes her.

                                  WILL
                    This is... a bit unorthodox.  We

                                  BISHOP
                    Yes.  My experience is lawyers are good

                    Now who s the sophist?  We re not 
                    in a court of law, Diane.  It s 
                    just you and me.  We represent 
                    murderers.  We get them off.

                    No.  We keep the courts honest.

                    And why shouldn t the courts be 
                    kept honest about Bishop?  

      Diane sits back.  Will knows he has a point...

                    Everybody deserves representation.  
                    Does that stop when we come to--

                    Do you hear the wolves at the door,

                                  DIANE
                    I need to think about this.   

      Diane starts to exit, finds Alicia there.

                                  ALICIA
                    Sorry.  He had a parting... piece 
                    of information about Rivers.

                                  WILL
                    What?

                                  ALICIA
                    Rivers was sleeping with Kelli 
                    Gerber Smith.  The murdered witness.

      Will stares at her, startled.

                                      ACT THREE


                                  WILL
                    Objection, your honor.

      A more cowed Judge Lester on the stand.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                     Overruled.   How s that, Mr. 
                    Gardner?  Do you approve of that?

                                  WILL
                    I do, thank you, your honor.

      Alicia nods, the judge more compliant even while disagreeing.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    So if there are no more pre-trial 
                    motions maybe we can move this 
                    along--

                                  WILL
                    Actually, the defense asks that 
                    AUSA Rivers be disqualified as 
                      prosecution s representative.

      Rivers is stunned, jumps up:

                                  RIVERS
                    On what grounds?

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    That s my question, Mr. Rivers.

                                  RIVERS
                    Yes, Your Honor. 

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    On what grounds, Mr. Gardner?

      Will crosses to the judge with a piece of paper as Alicia 
      eyes Cary typing on his cellphone.  Is he tweeting? 

                                  WILL
                    This is a signed affidavit from a 
                    hotel clerk at Lake Avenue Motel 
                    confirming that Mr. Rivers spent 
                    the night with Kelli Gerber Smith 
                    on nine occasions.

      Rivers horrified.  Dorfman looks up at Will, startled.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      41.

                                  RIVERS
                    I-- Relevance!

                                  WILL
                    Do I even need to respond, Your 
                    Honor?

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    Is this true, counselor?

      Rivers organizes his papers.  Off his pedestal, stalling. 

                                  RIVERS
                    Your honor--

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    Answer the question, Mr. Rivers.

                                  RIVERS
                    Yes.  But, I assure Your Honor that 
                    it will in no way effect my ability 
                    to prosecute this case.


      Bang-- Will exits court: the conquering hero.  Cary high-
      fives him, Alicia smiles, Tammybehind them...*

                                  TAMMY*
                    How d you find that out?

                    How?  Inside source.  

                                  TAMMY*
                    Too bad it didn t disqualify 
                    Rivers.

                                  WILL
                    We didn t want it to.  It undercut 
                    the judge s trust in Rivers, and 
                    got her to kick the SUV.  

      Will starts off as Alicia stops Cary...

                                  ALICIA
                    Cary.  Do you have a second?

                                  CARY
                    Sure.  What?

    But Alicia pulls him away from a crowd.  How to start?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      42.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  Are you Upriser7?

                                  ALICIA
                    There s someone gossiping on-line 
                    about me.

      Cary eyes her.  She s serious.

                                  CARY
                    And you thought it was me?
                          (Alicia shrugs)
                    Well, thanks.  Sure.  Good to be 
                    working with you too.

    And Cary starts off, disgusted.  Alicia watches him go.


      Home.  Alicia comes through the door.  Exhausted.  Drops her 
      briefcase.  Looks around.

                                  ALICIA

    Not the voice she expected.  She enters the kitchen, finds 
    Eli Gold typing on his Blackberry.

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    How was work?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    In the shower.  The kids are in bed.  
                    I let them watch a little TV.  Have 
                    you ever seen WHEN A STRANGER CALLS?

                    We just traced the I.P. address for

                                  ELI GOLD
                    It s coming from inside the house.

      Alicia stares at him.  Damn.


      Will on his cellphone rushes down the hall...

                                  WILL
                    No, just a bit of an emergency.  
                    Rivers found another way to get the 
                    SUV in.  Through the GPS.

    On the other end of the line...


                                  ALICIA
                    Oh.

      Alicia, on her cell, slumps, sitting on her bed.  Peter sits 
    on the other side.  Door closed.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    No, it s alright.  About a half 
                    hour.  No problem.

      Alicia hangs up.  Exhales.  Puts her shoes back on.

                                  PETER
                    Is that Will?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.  I have to go back in.

                    They either don t want me to run.

                                  ALICIA
                    Or me to work.

                                  PETER
                    So, which one?  Zach or Grace?  

                                  ALICIA
                    This is crazy, Peter.  Someone else 
                    must ve used our wifi without us

                    Eli is checking.  But we should

                    I ll do it.  Tomorrow.   

      Alicia gets up to leave.

                                  PETER
                    An all-nighter?

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  A few more hours.

                                  PETER
                    I found condoms in your bedside table.  

      Alicia pauses at the door.  Looks at him.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    I was looking for your letter 
                    opener.  At first I thought they 
                    might belong to Zach: you found 
                    condoms in his room or something.  
                    But then I thought: no, you wouldn t 
                    take them.  You d have a sensible 
                    conversation with him about 
                    responsibility.  Then I thought: 
                    they were yours.  But it didn t make 
                    sense.  You have an I.U.D.  

                                  ALICIA
                    I had it removed.

      Peter looks up at her, surprised.

                                  ALICIA
                    They do.

                    For who?

      Alicia just stares at him.  A long pause.  It could tip 
      either way.  Alicia goes to the bed, turns her purse over, 
      pours the contents out.

                                  ALICIA
                    Go ahead, check.

    her purse.  Drops them in.

      A tiny judge s chamber.  Government issue.  Barely room for 
      Judge Lester, Will, Rivers, two A-USAs, and Alicia, Cary.  
      Yelling.  Everybody hates each other now...

                                  RIVERS
                    The GPS isn t the same as the SUV--  
                    in our opinion.

                                  WILL
                    It s contained inthe SUV-- in my 
                    opinion--

                                  RIVERS
                    But it s data is separate, and it s 
                    tracked through satellite imaging, 
                    in our-- 

                                  WILL
                    Which is only accessed THROUGH THE 
                    SUV which was THROWN OUT!

                                  RIVERS
                    Your honor, the GPS shows this SUV 
                    drove right from Mr. Dorfman s 
                    office to the site where the body 
                    was dumped.  On the night of the 
                    murder.    

      Alicia looks up, startled.  Something gnawing at her.  

                                  WILL
                    You have no proof my client was in 
                    the SUV or at his office at those 
                    times!  

      Alicia sees Cary slipping a note to Will as...

                                  RIVERS
                    This isn t about Mr. Dorfman 
                    pulling the trigger, your honor.  
                    We don t need to prove that-- in 
                    our opinion.  This is about whether 
                    he was complicitin the witnesses  
                    death.  And the inference-- 

                                  WILL
                          (Cary s note)
                    Was the GPS factory installed?

                    What?  I don t know.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    How is that relevant, Mr. Gardner?

                                  WILL
                    If the GPS was installed at the 
                    factory, it should be considered 
                    part of the automobile-- whether or 
                    not the tracking information was 
                    pulled from satellite technology. 

    An aide meanwhile finishes whispering in Rivers  ear.

                                  RIVERS
                    The GPS was manufactured by REI, 
                      Incorporated.  Not by General 
                    Motors.  A separate corporate entity 
                    that uses separate satellites to 
                    gather information.  Therefore, we 
                    should be able to introduce this 
                      information into evidence.

    The Judge looks toward Will who shoots a look toward Alicia 
    and Cary, the two caught up short.

                                  JUDGE LESSNER
                    Overruled, Mr. Gardner.  The GPS 
                    data is allowed into evidence.

      Damn.  Will, Alicia, Cary frown.  Losing.

                    But you didn t talk to or see any

                    This GPS has them at your office? 

                                  ERICDORFMAN*

                    wanted to show Bishop we could

                    No.  He knows if he moves against

      ZACH and GRACE.  They stare at their mom speechless.  Their 
      usual family meeting spot.

                                  ZACH

                    No mothering.  Just... I want to

                    You really think...?  Mom, this is 
                    stupid.

                                  ALICIA

                                  ZACH
                    I can t believe it.  It s like a 
                    police state.  

                                  ALICIA

                                  ZACH
                    That was different!  We didn t tell 
                    you about those pictures because--

                    It was a lie.  And not just one 
                    lie.  It was over and over again.

                                  ZACH
                    But a lie like lying about Jews in 
                    your basement.

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay, so let s trust each other

                    guilty of the murder of Kelli--

      Rivers yanks him to his feet-- the agents cuffing him.

                                  WILL
                    He s surrendering himself freely.  
                    Gentlemen.

                                  GURSTELLE
                    --I acted alone and with no 
                    consultation with anybody else--

                                  RIVERS
                          (to Will)
                    Get out of my way!

                                  GURSTELLE
                    --I had no access to the witness 
                    list or any other information other 
                    than my own.

      Rivers turns to Will, fuming as a cuffed and Mirandized 
      Gurstelle continues in the background...  

                                  RIVERS
                    What kind of deal did you make?

                                  WILL
                    You got the murderer.

                                  RIVERS
                    Come on, what kind of deal with Bishop?!

                                  WILL
                    Do you expect an answer?  Really?!  
                    What kind of deals do you make 
                    every day?!  With killers?!  With 
                    drug dealers?!

                                  RIVERS
                    I am in pursuit of the good!


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      55.

      CONTINUED:3535


                                  WILL
                    You are in pursuit of your own 
                    sanctity!  Take your suspect.  He 
                    killed Kelli Gerber Smith.  You 
                    won.

                                  RIVERS
                    You wake up with fleas, counselor.  
                    You pay your rent, you go to your 
                    restaurants, but you still wake up 
                    with fleas.

    And Rivers escorts Gurstelle out as we find Alicia, forgotten 
    in the tumult.  She eyes Will who sees her look.  They hold 
      each other s stares.


      Laughter.  Diane and Will laugh in her office, beer in his 
      hand, wine in hers.  Dusk.

                                  WILL
                    And so I was pitching our firm to a 
                    drug dealer, telling him we d 
                    validate for parking again...

      Belly laughs.  The two exhausted.   

                                  DIANE
                    They don t teach you that in law school. 

                                  WILL
                    He said, no.  He checked our 
                    financials and thinks we have a 
                    year left.      

      Laughter, but less of it.  Still funny.  Then not.  They take 
      sips of their drinks.  In the silence.

                                  DIANE
                    So what are we going to do?

                                  WILL
                    I don t know.  

                                  DIANE
                    Lay off acquisitions? 

      Will nods, considers it, looks off, sees Alicia working in 
    the conference room with Julius.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      57.

                                  WILL
                    Or split up?

                                  DIANE
                    Do you want that?

                                  WILL
                    It s an option.  I take my people; 
                    you take yours.

                                  DIANE
                    We could shop for another drug dealer.

      Laughter again.  One step from despair laughter.

                                  WILL
                    They re the only ones making money 
                    these days.

                                  DIANE
                    Or find a third partner.

      Silence.  Serious now.

                                  WILL
                    Okay.  How s that work?

                                  DIANE
                    Find a replacement for Stern.  Bring 
                    him in as equal partner.  Someone 
                    with a client list, some equity.

                                  WILL
                    You re willing to give up a third?

                                  DIANE
                    A third of what?  A sinking ship?  
                    Sure.  We re going to kill each 
                    other if we don t find a referee.

                                  WILL
                          (growing on him)
                    A third partner?  Someone neutral, 
                    someone we agree on?

      Diane nods.  Will reaches out a hand.  Diane shakes it.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    And optimism fills the void.

                                  DIANE
                    I think that s alcohol.

                                  WILL
                    Just as good.


      A kiss.  Zach kissing Becca.  The two standing in the 
      elevator door of his apartment landing.  Keeping the elevator 
      door open.  Both with school daypacks.

                                  ZACH
                    You sure?

                                  BECCA
                    Yeah.  Let s go.  Before I change 
                    my mind.

                                  ZACH
                    Wait.

      Zach starts toward his apartment door.

                                  BECCA
                    What re you doing?  Let s go.

                                  ZACH
                    One second.  I have to get 
                    something of mine.

    And Zach quietly opens the apartment door...


      ...slips to Alicia s empty master bedroom, enters, crosses to 
    the bedside table, opens the drawer, finds-- 

      --uh-oh.  Where are they?  He searches, searches.  The 
      condoms, where are they?  He looks up.  Thinks about it a 
      second.  A decision.  

    He leaves the bedroom, goes to the front door.  Exits again, 
      rejoining Becca.  And we stay on the closed door.  


                                      END OF SHOW
