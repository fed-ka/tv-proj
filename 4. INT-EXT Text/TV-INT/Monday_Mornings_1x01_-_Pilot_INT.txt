      DR. DAVID MARTIN, mid-forties, his wife CANDICE, forties,
      daughter ALICIA, fifteen, and son WILLIAM, thirteen.

                                        DAVID
                    What medicals, all I've seen him do
                    is murder.

      DAVID'S PAGER VIBRATES; he gives it a check.  IT READS
      SIMPLY "311.6."  David gives it a good long stare.  He
      knows what it means.  Candice regards him, still staring.

                                        CANDICE
                      Everything okay?

                                        DAVID
                          (covering)
                    What?  Yeah.

                                        CANDICE
                          (unconvinced)
                    You sure?

                    Sure.  Just hospital business.

      ON THE SCREEN, WE SEE DEXTER SLIT THE THROAT OF HIS
      VICTIM.  The irony, subtle as it isn't, can't escape
      David.  Tomorrow, it'll be his throat. 

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

      BLACK.  OVER BLACK: "CHELSEA GENERAL."

      THE SOUNDS OF A HEART-MONITOR, GROWING STRONGER,
      STRONGER... SUDDENLY, WE SMASH INTO:



      AS EMT'S CRASH THROUGH THE SWINGING DOORS OF THE
      EMERGENCY ROOM, THEY MOVE FAST, BOTH CONCERN AND SOOT
      ON THEIR FACES.  THEY PUSH A GURNEY, CARRYING A WOMAN,
        TWENTY-FIVE, UNCONSCIOUS, EYES OPEN.

                                        EMT #1
                    Attempted suicide, single vehicle,
                    telephone pole.

      But his voice gets lost in the CACOPHONY OF OTHER SOUNDS,
      OTHER EMERGENCIES, MEDICAL BABBLE, CHAOS, TUMULT.  Just
      another night at the E.R. OF CHELSEA GENERAL.  WHIP PAN
      TO INCLUDE...  DR. JORGE VILLANUEVA, late forties, known
      as El Gato, a giant of a man, as he charges toward the
      gurney.  A three-hundred-plus pound behemoth and anybody
      in his path is quickly reminded that he used to play
        professional football for The Detroit Lions.  He's also
      perhaps the most celebrated trauma chief in the country,
      and clearly the elephant in this circus.

                                        VILLANUEVA
                          (re: the Woman)
                    Raccoon eyes.  Trauma Bay Eight. 

      As the EMT'S QUICKLY PUSH THE GURNEY OFF, Dr. Villanueva
      takes two steps in the opposite direction, freezes,
      pivots--

                                        VILLANUEVA (CONT'D)
                          (to EMT #1)
                    Wait.  What'd you say happened? 

                                        EMT #1
                    Suicide by car.  Telephone pole, no
                    skid marks.

      Villanueva comes back, a quick glance at the Foley bag,
      he then leans over the patient.  Then--

                                        VILLANUEVA
                    Bullshit. 
                          (on his way back)
                    Turn up her oxygen, increase the
                      ventilator, get her more fluids,
                    and call a neurosurgeon. 

      As he looks closely at the victim--

                                        VILLANUEVA (CONT'D)
                    This was no suicide. 

      NOBODY ARGUES.  El Gato's seat-of-the-pants diagnoses
      are the stuff of legend around Chelsea General. 

                                                              CUT TO:



      DR. TYLER WILSON, thirty-eight, supernova vascular
      neurosurgeon.  Currently undressing DR. TINA RIDGEWAY,
        thirty-five, fellow neurosurgeon, whose pressing
      emergency of the moment is removing Ty's pants.  Two
      extremely busy star doctors getting sex on the fly...
      As BOTH OF THEIR BEEPERS GO OFF--

                                        TY/TINA
                    Shit. 

      They check their respective pagers.  

                                        TY
                    Mine.

      Ty hastily re-dresses, starts to scurry out; as Tina
      sighs.

                                        TINA
                    Ty.

      He looks back; she points to his hand.  Realizing he's
      still holding her skirt, he tosses it back; it whacks
      her in the face; as he rushes out--

                                        TINA (CONT'D)
                    Sweet.

      She sighs, SEES ANOTHER MESSAGE ON HER PAGER: "311.6." 
      Tina considers, wondering who will be the victim.

                                                              CUT TO:      CHELSEA GENERAL-Pilot WRITER'S SECOND DRAFT  11-21-11     4.





      Ty enters.

                                        TY
                          (who called?)
                    Okay.

      Villanueva swivels on his stool, half a candy bar in
      his mouth.  In the far b.g. TWO YOUNG E.R. DOCTORS are
      trying to revive a MAN in his sixties.

                                        VILLANUEVA
                          (to Ty)
                        Twenty-five-year-old female, ruptured
                    cerebral aneurysm, Trauma Bay Eight.

      Ty peels off; Villanueva swivels back to his patient as
      MICHELLE ROBIDAUX, Resident, twenty-eight, African-
      American approaches.

                                        MICHELLE
                    Doctor V?

      He's up and moving now, toward the E.R. doctors.

                                        VILLANUEVA
                    Ma'am?

                                        MICHELLE
                    Would you mind telling me how you
                    knew that was an aneurysm?

                                        VILLANUEVA
                      Experience.

                                        MICHELLE
                    Could you be more specific?

      Villanueva reaches DR. LEE EARLSON, and DR. CODY KNAPP,
      the two young E.R. doctors; they're barking at the
      unconscious MAN.

                                        LEE
                          (shaking the Patient)
                    Sir, can you open your eyes?  Sir?
                          (louder)
                    Can you open your eyes?

                                        VILLANUEVA
                    No.  He can't.




                                                                (CONTINUED)      CHELSEA GENERAL-Pilot WRITER'S SECOND DRAFT  11-21-11     5.

      And he swats the E.R. doctors to the side, forgetting
      his strength.  He grabs a bottle of iodine with his
      left hand, a huge 20-gauge cook-needle in his right.

                                        CODY
                          (to Villanueva)
                    Wait, what--

      But before the doctor can spit out his protest,
      Villanueva rips open the patient's shirt and plunges
      the needle into his chest.

                                        VILLANUEVA
                    Cardiac tamponade.  Five.  Four. 
                    Three.  Two.  One.

      He looks to the MONITOR.  At first, no change.  And
      then: THE BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE BEGIN TO
      NORMALIZE.  And Villanueva heads off.

                                                              CUT TO:



      The chaos and adrenaline of the E.R. contrasts sharply
      with the order and quiet of the Park household.  Dinner
      has just been cleared from the table; PAT PARK, late
      forties, finishes loading the dishwasher.  Not a speck
      of food remains on the counter or elsewhere.  The place
      is so immaculate it seems almost sterile.  The THREE
      CHILDREN, all under the age of six, read to themselves. 
      The only sound comes from the turning of pages.  SUNG
      PARK, late forties, Korean-American, abrupt, socially
      and linguistically-challenged, works at his desk; his
      searing intensity is palpable.  ONE OF THE CHILDREN
      GIGGLES at something she's reading.

                                        PAT
                          (admonishing)
                    Your father is working.

      That's all that ever need be said.  More silence until
      A PAGER VIBRATES ON SUNG'S DESK.  He picks it up.  IT
      READS "311.6."  His eyes narrow with interest... perhaps
      a tinge of schadenfreudism.  It's always a little fun
      to watch the sharks feed on a colleague.

                                                              CUT TO:      CHELSEA GENERAL-Pilot WRITER'S SECOND DRAFT  11-21-11     6.





      TY STANDS OVER THE twenty-five-year-old WOMAN'S EXPOSED
      BRAIN.  The rest of the head is covered by a blue drape. 
      It's surprisingly bloodless, clinical... and seemingly
      routine.  One would never guess that this might be one
      of the most difficult and delicate operations a brain
      surgeon could perform.  The O.R. is cold; EDDIE VEDDER'S
      "JUST BREATHE" PLAYS OUT.  There's no anxiety among THE
      TEAM, there rarely is when Ty is operating.  They work
      in silent precision, until--

                                        TY
                    We have a story?

      Ty looks up.

                    According to Dr. Lichtman.

      DR. GARY LICHTMAN, early thirties, goes a little ashen.

                    I said "attractive."  I never said
                    "hot."

                                                              CUT TO:



      BRIAN TROTTIER, fortyish, coat and tie, sits alone at
      an elegant downtown Portland restaurant, sips his
      Bordeaux, another glass rests across from him.  He takes
      another deep, calming breath.  Pulls out a small box
      from his inside coat pocket, opens it...

      ANGLE THE BOX

      inside is a sparkly, two-carat diamond ring.

      RESUME

      Brian returns the box to his pocket, takes another deep
      breath, as DR. SYDNEY SAXENA, thirty-five, petite, Indian
      descent, returns, cell-phone still in hand.  An Olympic
      multi-tasker, she speaks quickly, seems almost manic at
      times, and absolutely takes no prisoners.

                            cell-phone)
                    Sorry.  That took way longer than I
                    thought.  Little issue with one of
                    my stent replacements which... don't
                    get me started.
                          (before he can protest)
                    Okay, no more calls, I promise. 
                    Where were we?

                                        BRIAN
                          (slightly pointed)
                    We were having a toast.  To us.

                                        SAXENA
                    Right.
                          (with a trickle of
                            flirtation)
                    And as I recall, you had a very
                    hungry look in your eye.  Or was
                    that me?

      He smiles, back in the moment.

                                        BRIAN
                    I love you.

                                        SAXENA
                    I love you too.

      As they clink and drink, HER CELL-PHONE VIBRATES ON THE
      TABLE.  Saxena's eyes instantly laser-lock on the phone,
      which Brian sees.  She tries to just ignore it.  They
      sip their wine... until her compulsion wins out; she
      checks the phone, to the not-so-discrete annoyance of
      Brian.

      ANGLE CELL-PHONE

      It reads "311.6."

                    I read it ahead, online.  I'm
                    guessing it'll be David Martin,

                    is "Double-O-Seven."  License to

                    know with these things.

                    Why would it be you, Sydney, you're
                    probably the most perfect doctor at
                    the place, God knows the most
                      dedicated.

                                        SAXENA
                    That was hostile.

      He looks away.

                                        SAXENA (CONT'D)
                    Look.  Brian.  I'm a doctor, I'm
                    going to get calls sometimes.

                                        BRIAN
                    You know what?  I think we should
                    just call it a night, okay?

                                        SAXENA
                    Are you serious?  Because my pager

      The giant sleeps... next to him, also asleep... the
      Woman he met at the bar.  It's a single bed, and it
      looks ridiculous.  There's barely enough room for the
      Woman, let alone a gargantuan mate.  A beat.  Then...
      while in his sleep, with one arm... WHOOSH, Villanueva 
      launches the woman out of bed; she lands on the floor
      with a thud.  It wakes both of them.

      The Woman, now sitting on the bed, points.  He starts
      off, looks back, befuddled.  He's forgotten her name,
      which she suspects.

                                        WOMAN
                          (with a weak wave)
                    Wanda.

                                                              CUT TO:      CHELSEA GENERAL-Pilot WRITER'S SECOND DRAFT  11-21-11    16.





      A small auditorium.  There's A BANK OF OVERHEAD LIGHTS
      FOCUSED ON THE FRONT; THE REST OF THE ROOM IS DIM, BUT
      NOT DARK.  ON THE CUT, SURGEONS ARE FILING IN; PERHAPS
      FORTY IN ALL, A COLLECTION OF THE FINEST ORTHOPODS,
      CHEST-CUTTERS, SKULL-CRACKERS, AND OTHERS WHO HAVE EVER
      DONNED THE SCRUBS.  There's an undercurrent of
      electricity at this moment, there always is at these
      meetings.  Similar to a big prize fight... or, rather,
      a lion's den.  Where somebody figures to get eaten. 
      HARDING L. HOOTEN, sixtyish, steely-eyed Chief of
      Surgery, settles in near the front; white lab coat, bow-
      tie, nicknamed "Hardly Human" long ago for his exacting,
      punishing, and outwardly-uncaring ways.  As THE OTHERS
      ENTER, some jocular, some less so, Sung catches up to
      Villanueva, who has a donut in his mouth.

                                        SUNG
                    Why not call me for aneurysm?  Better
                    than Ty.  Discriminate.

      Sung is ambitious to his core.  With a serious chip on
      his shoulder.  A beat.

                                        VILLANUEVA
                    Okay, first, Sung baby,
                          (removes donut)
                    nobody is better than Ty.  Second,
                    it was a very high-risk procedure,
                    and should the patient not survive
                    I wanted a surgeon capable of
                    consoling the family with something
                    more eloquent than "daughter dead." 
                      Comprende?

      OFF Sung, bristling--

      ANGLE HOOTEN

      at the front of the room.

                    Dr. Ridgeway, speaking of pacemakers,

                    regarding instrument reps being

                    Moving on...

      And the ROOM SETTLES quickly.  Hooten flips through
      some papers, perhaps for dramatic effect.  Finally--

                    Dr. Martin.  Let's talk about Mary
                      Michaelidos. 

      Some perceptible relief from other surgeons; glad that
      his or her name wasn't called.  David opens his folder. 
      Takes a deep breath.

                                        DAVID
                    Mary Michaelidos, age thirty-nine,
                    presented on August twelfth with
                    soreness of her left hip.  She was
                    an avid runner, thirty miles a week,
                    I thought the hip irritation was
                    due to all the running, I prescribed
                    one thousand milligrams of Extra-
                    Strength Tylenol until the pain
                    subsided.

      Silence.  Until--

                    Did the pain subside?

                    No.  Well, I didn't know.  I didn't
                    hear from her.  The next I saw her
                    was two weeks ago, on October the
                    second -- she was in the E.R. with
                    a broken hip.

                    No, sir.  I ordered an MRI, with
                    contrast, which revealed Stage Four
                    bone cancer.

      Silence.

                    And, Doctor, when you saw her that
                    first time, did you do a full
                    physical exam?  Order any x-rays? 
                    Blood work?

                                        DAVID

                    Did you do anything other than
                    prescribe Extra-Strength Tylenol?

                                        DAVID

                    can happen when you let the runner
                    with the sore hip limp out the door
                    without a second thought.  You let
                      metastatic cancer run amok for two

                    I don't give a horse's ass about

                    the only consequence for this man
                    is he becomes persona non grata
                    around here.  He doesn't get to be
                    "privy." 

      Villanueva then pulls out a rolled-up newspaper, begins
      to read.

      Upon which, Villanueva hurls the paper toward the front. 
      Rises.  Begins to exit, under--

      MAX GOLDMAN, thirtyish, E.R. doctor, is there with QUINN
      McDANIELS, eleven, freckled, the picture of good health,
      lively, even.  Also present is Quinn's mother, ALLISON,
      thirties.

                    This is Quinn McDaniels.  Future

                    He had a head-to-head collision
                    last night.  Had some headaches, so
                    his mother brought him in, just to
                    be safe.

                    night, I was ready to marry you. 
                    But then I realized the painfully
                    obvious.  You're already married. 
                    To this hospital.  And you always
                    will be.  The idea that you could
                    actually be a mother, raise a
                    family... which is something I
                      desperately want...

                    the dedication required of
                      motherhood... something would need
                    to give, Syd.

      AS TINA'S PAGER GOES OFF, she checks it.

      It's even more frantic with Quinn McDaniels's surgery. 
      There are EVEN MORE NURSES AND DOCTORS IN THE ROOM.

                    We've got three transfusions going.

      A TECH IS BARKING OUT VITALS, which are going southward.

                    Why the hell won't he clot?

      Tina charges into the room.

      And suddenly... seemingly with no warning, Ty's cutting
      and splitting the boy's chest... his hands are soon
      inside and he's doing open-heart massage.  The TECH
      BARKS OUT THE PLUNGING NUMBERS.

                                        TY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, Quinn!!  Don't leave me,
                    Quinn, c'mon!

      WE SEE TEARS IN NURSES' EYES... this one is over, or
      soon will be.

                                        TY (CONT'D)
                    Come on!!

      WE HEAR THE FLATLINE, but Ty keeps pumping, he refuses
      to quit.

                          (then)
                    We need to call it.

      But Ty keeps pumping... trying to bring him back from
      the dead.  The OTHER DOCTORS know they can't stop him. 
      Finally... recognizing the truth, Ty backs away... too
      stunned to even call the T.O.D.

                                        TINA (CONT'D)
                    Time of death, eleven forty-seven
                    a.m.

      Silence.  Gloves being pulled off, masks... some tears. 
      Ty just stares... dazed.  There is blood all over him. 
      Finally, he just walks out of the room.



      Ty stands there... still looking stunned.  After a beat, 
      Tina emerges.

                                        TINA

      FLASHBACK

      Thirty years earlier.  A YOUNG BOY, age eight, sits
      with his MOTHER.  A SURGEON approaches.

                                        SURGEON
                    I'm sorry.  He didn't make it through
                    surgery.

      THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY.  His
      face then DISSOLVES INTO:

      BACK TO PRESENT


                                                                (CONTINUED)      CHELSEA GENERAL-Pilot WRITER'S SECOND DRAFT  11-21-11    42.

      Ty looks at the young mother.  Instinctively, Allison's
      eyes find his.  And she knows.  Her face simply
      collapses.  The sight of her hits Ty like a truck.  He
      just wants to turn and flee.  But he wills himself to
      move forward, one foot in front of the other... until
      he arrives.  Then--

                                        TY
                    I'm so sorry.

      Her horror gives way to shock... then weakness; she
      cannot feel her legs beneath her.  For a second, it
      feels like she may go down.  He reaches out, holds her,
      partly for comfort, partly to keep her upright.

      REVERSE ANGLE

      TINA... WATCHING.

      RESUME

      Allison slowly sits back into her chair.  Drops her
      head into her hands.  Ty sits next to her.  Rubs her
      back.  A beat.  Then she looks up at him.

                    I was called to the O.R.

                    Ah.

      Tina opens the refrigerator, looks inside.  Not because
      she wants something, just a place to bury her head.  A
      beat.  She takes a deep sigh, closes the door, exits. 

                                        TINA
                    I think I'll shower.

      She gives him a perfunctory kiss on the top of his head,
      exits.  OFF Mark, we:

      Saxena lies in bed, her eyes STARING almost vacantly AT
      THE TELEVISION AS CRAIG FERGUSON CARRIES ON.  HE'S FUNNY. 
      But Saxena isn't laughing, she looks almost catatonic. 
      Until, suddenly... an idea.  SHE grabs the remote, KILLS
      THE TV.  Sits, wheels spinning.  And then, suddenly,
      she launches out of bed. 



      DR. THOMAS OTTOBRINI, sleep-deprived Resident, catches
      up on a little shut-eye.  Suddenly, Saxena explodes
      into the room.

                          (to Ottobrini)

                    or CT angio for a patient named

                    an embolism if she hasn't thrown
                    one already.

                    Dr. McManus gets very upset when--

      Saxena grabs him by the collar.

      FADE IN:



      Ruth Hostetler, lying flat in an MRI, wearing a large
      curved device on her head, a stereotactic frame.  Sung
      intently manipulates his probe to the target coordinates
      of her brain.  His GAGGLE OF ACOLYTES LOOK ON WITH UTTER
        FASCINATION.  THE MRI BEATS OUT ITS RHYTHM; the magnets
      pull on cells of Ruth's brain.  Now deep in her
      cerebellum, Sung finds what he's looking for.

                                        SUNG
                          (to his Subordinates)
                    Look there.  Vertical intermediate
                    nucleus of thalamus.
                          (then)
                    Okay, know where.  Let's go.



      Ruth Hostetler is wheeled in, her hands still flapping
      about.

                                        RUTH
                          (to Sung)
                    Is this going to be painful, Doctor? 
                    Will it hurt?

                                        SUNG
                    Not hurt.  Immobilize head now.  Be
                    quiet.

      As THE TEAM goes about stabilizing her head, we: 

                                                              CUT TO:



      Saxena on her typical brisk march; always on a mission
      and in a hurry wherever she's going.  Then, from behind--

                                        MCMANUS (O.S.)
                    Dr. Saxena.

      She turns as DR. BILL MCMANUS, general internist,
      fortyish, approaches.

                                        MCMANUS (CONT'D)
                    Bill McManus.  I'm the attending on
                    Joanne Whitman.

                                        SAXENA
                          (not sure what's coming)
                    Uh oh.

                                        MCMANUS
                      I pictured you a lot taller, with a
                    very large wart on your nose.
                          (then)
                    Thank you.  You were right, Mrs.
                    Whitman had a pulmonary embolism. 
                    We've got her on round-the-clock
                    infusions of heparin.  She'd been
                    throwing tiny emboli to her lungs. 
                    I'd been quite stumped, truth be
                    told, you have my gratitude, not to
                    mention Mrs. Whitman's.

                                        SAXENA
                    Oh.

      Saxena is a bit thrown; she's more at home with
      confrontation.  She's also not used to doctors who
      willingly set their egos aside.

                                        SAXENA (CONT'D)
                    You're welcome.  Just... wanted to
                    be helpful.

                                        MCMANUS
                    Yes, and I bet it's refreshing to
                    be received as such, instead of
                    just an obnoxious know-it-all.
                          (off Saxena)
                    Listen, given there's no wart on
                    the nose... how 'bout dinner?  Are
                    you free tonight?

      Just then SAXENA'S BEEPER GOES OFF.  She checks it.

                                        SAXENA
                    Well.  Not anymore.

      She looks back at the pager.  It reads "311.7."

                                                              CUT TO:      CHELSEA GENERAL-Pilot WRITER'S SECOND DRAFT  11-21-11    48.





      Sung is still at work; Ruth's hands are still flapping
      about.  There is a SMALL CROWD of NEUROSURGICAL FELLOWS
      on hand now, a DBS is a bit of an event.  Sung privately
      loves the spotlight, which usually goes to Ty.  Sung
      has the probe inside of Ruth's brain.  He adjusts the
      current slightly.

                                        RUTH
                    Please, God, no.  No, please.

      And with that, SHE LETS OUT A GUTTURAL SCREAM, actually
      scaring some of the Team.  Sung just looks puzzled.  He
      removes the probe.  Ruth stops her crying, just like
      that.  Sung gives the probe a look.  Then--

                                        SUNG
                    Maybe just discover fear center of
                    brain.  Write paper.

      Sung checks his coordinates.

                                        SUNG (CONT'D)
                    Try again.

      The room is packed with SURGEONS, ALL OUR PEOPLE, except
      Sung.  Ty is reading his pager ON THE CUT: it also reads
      "311.7."  He wonders if the bell tolls for him this
      time.  Tina gets ready to face off against Dr. Tierney,
      who stands ramrod-straight, the man can strut standing
      still.

                    Alright, let's get this shoot-out
                    started.  Buck, you have the floor
                    first. 

                                        TIERNEY
                    Thank you. 
                          (oozing condescension)
                    First of all, I realize Dr. Ridgeway
                    isn't the only one here concerned
                    about instrument reps being present
                    at surgery.  And let it be said, I
                    happen to have great respect for
                    Dr. Ridgeway, who I know to be an
                      outstanding surgeon.

      SOME LAUGHTER; as Tierney reddens.

                                        TIERNEY
                    The fact is, these instrument reps
                    know as much if not more about the
                    devices we implant than we do.  And
                    it only helps us to have their
                    expertise in the room if needed. 

                                        TINA
                    The problem is, we're being
                      influenced by them, which is a very
                      dangerous--

                                        TIERNEY
                    Who?  I have no idea which doctors
                    you're talking about, but--

                                        SAXENA
                    I do, I can name some right in this
                    room, and the idea that doctors are
                    deferring their considered judgment
                    to equipment whores--

                                        TIERNEY
                    Seems we have a tag-team today.  

                                        SAXENA
                    We had a case last year where one
                    rep told the surgeon during a TKA
                    to shave a little more bone off the
                    tibia so his prosthetic would fit;
                    the surgeon listened to him and
                    that patient limped into court a
                    year later with his lawyer to sue.

                                        TIERNEY
                    Look, if you want to cherry-pick,--

                                        TINA
                    I had a rep sell me on a neural
                    implant which, if I hadn't gone
                    back in to remove, the patient would
                    be dead.   

                                        TIERNEY
                    Well, I don't know about you, Dr.
                    Ridgeway, but I wouldn't allow myself
                    to be pushed around by some sales
                    rep.

                    You know what, Buck?

      THE ROOM REACTS, IT'S A PLAYGROUND FIGHT NOW.

                    That is not true.

                                        SAXENA
                    How would you feel about a detailer
                    being in an examination room while
                    a doctor considers what drug to
                      prescribe?

                                        TIERNEY
                    That's different.

                                        SAXENA
                    Why?

                                        TIERNEY
                    Because that's medicine.  Internists
                    need protection, they're spineless
                    worms.

      BIG LAUGHTER.

                    Well, not to demean present company,
                    but a lot of surgeons do get swayed,
                    and just as doctors sometimes take 
                    kickbacks from pharmaceutical
                    companies for prescribing certain
                    drugs,--

                    Yes.  And I know I have you to thank. 
                    I also want to say I'm sorry.  For
                    being so gruff.  I get that way

                                        SAXENA
                    No need to apologize.  I've been
                    known to get a little gruff myself.

                                        HOOTEN
                    Okay.  I didn't insinuate you,
                    Doctor.  And if I insulted you,
                    that wasn't my intent.  It's
                    just we doctors are human.  We
                    can all get caught up sometimes
                    in the excitement to explore our
                    craft.  The chance to do a deep
                    brain stimulation I'm sure was
                    very tantalizing. 
                          (then)
                    Now.  Accepting your word that
                    you were indeed between a rock
                    and an eight-ball, can we talk
                    about your language skills, Dr.
                    Park?

      Sung just glares.  He clearly feels this is out of
      bounds.

                          (to Sung)
                    Doctor, you may very well be the
                    smartest person in this room. 
                    You're certainly the only doctor
                    who went to medical school twice,
                    once in Korea and once here.  But
                    as surgeons we often have less
                    than a minute to impress the
                    patient with both our intelligence
                    and our credibility, and to best
                    succeed we need strong
                      communication skills.    

      Sung stares.  A beat.

                    Moving on.  We lost a patient
                      yesterday.  Which brings us to the
                    matter of Quinn McDaniels. 
                          (to Ty)
                    Dr. Wilson, would you care to take
                    us through it, please.

      A beat.  Not the moment a surgeon loves to relive. 
      Then--

                                        TY
                    At approximately seven-thirty in
                    the morning I was called to the
                    emergency room to evaluate an
                      eleven-year-old boy, Quinn
                      McDaniels.  His mother brought
                    him in as a precaution after a
                      head-on-head collision in a soccer
                    game.  He presented in excellent
                    health, BP, heart rate, respiration
                    all normal, the boy was even in
                    good spirits.  His CT scan,
                    however, revealed a massive
                      temporal-lobe tumor, which appeared
                      malignant, obviously life-
                      threatening.  The decision to
                    operate was made immediately.

                    No, as none were necessary, this
                    was a no-brainer.

                    Did you consult with any esteemed
                      colleagues?

      Ty shoots a look at Sung: "Let's not make this about
      the king-size chip on your shoulder."

      As Ty glares at Sung--

                                        HOOTEN
                    Why not ask for any help, Dr.
                    Wilson?  You're surrounded by a
                    lot of talent here, why not seek
                    a second opinion?

                                        TY
                    I didn't think I needed one.

      Hooten now looks up from his notes.  A beat.

                                        HOOTEN
                      Potentially life-threatening
                    surgery, and you don't even bother
                      discussing it with a colleague in
                      neurosurgery.

      Sung straightens in his chair again.  "Exactly.  He's
      arrogant."  Ty glares back at Hooten.  These sessions
      may be about teaching, but they need not be abusive.

      Surely Hooten knows Ty is still devastated over the
      result.

                    The father was not in the picture,
                    the boy had never even met him.

                                        TY
                    I mapped out a left-sided craniotomy
                    with awake-speech mapping.  After
                    placing immobilization pins in the
                    right frontal area and the left
                    occiput, we woke the boy up.  I
                    then made an incision from his zygoma
                    in front of his left ear, all the
                    way to the midline.  The bone was
                    removed without incident.

                    The patient was doing okay at this

                                        TY
                    Yes.  He felt a little pressure as
                    I drilled through the skull, but
                    that was all.

                      cauterizing and clips.

                    Then... well, as soon as I saw the
                    tumor, I knew we were in trouble. 
                    It was malignant.  It had tentacles
                    reaching into the normal-appearing
                    brain, and it had a very angry
                    reddish color.

      Silence.  They all know what that means.

                    I began to remove it as best I could. 
                    And it started to bleed way more
                    than I ever expected.
                          (his mind transported
                            back)
                    There was just so... so much
                    bleeding.  And uh...
                          (devastated all over
                            again)
                      I couldn't stop it.  I just... I
                    couldn't stop it.

      His pain is raw again, and the whole room can feel it. 
      Tina would just love to go hold him.  Saxena is watching
      Tina, she's totally on to them.  Silence.  Finally--

                                        HOOTEN
                    The boy died.

                                        TY
                    Yes.

                    You never thought to.

      Eyes are darting about the room.  Has Hooten actually
      got something here, did the great Ty Wilson actually
      fuck up?  Or is The Boss just making him sweat some?  A
      long beat.  Then--

      The handout is passed back to Ty, as the suspense in
      the room begins to rapidly multiply.  Ty receives the
      document, reads.  He's immediately sickened.

      Hooten needs say no more.  The room is frozen, you could
      hear a pin drop.  Ty appears... well, in shock.  Tina
      watches, him; Saxena's eyes dart back and forth between

                    I have a comment.  This boy was
                    likely going to die soon.  He died
                    yesterday because of a doctor's
                      arrogance.  His unwillingness to
                    seek a consult, his neglecting to
                    get a thorough history.  Arrogance. 
                          (a beat)
                    We are clinicians, scientists, we
                    follow time-honored procedures and
                    analyses.  That's how we are trained. 
                    This is what happens when we
                    subjugate that training to arrogance.

      THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON TY.  IT FINALLY PULLS BACK TO
      REVEAL TY, SITTING IN--



      He's still stunned.  Finally, the door opens.  It's
      Tina.

                                        TINA
                          (softly)
                    Ty. 

                                        TY
                    Don't.  Just don't.

      Tina's heart is breaking for him.  She approaches, sits
      in front of him.

                                        TINA
                    Look at me.

      He doesn't.  A beat.  Then--

                                        TY
                          (then)
                    Y'know, she never even asked, the
                    mother, "what makes you... why should
                    I trust my son's life to you?"  She
                    never even asked. 

                                        TINA
                    They never do.

      A beat.

                                        TINA (CONT'D)
                    What did she say to you after?  I
                    saw her say something.

      A beat.

                                        TY
                          (looking at Tina)
                    She said, "This must be so hard for
                    you."  She was... consoling me.

      A beat.  Then-- 

                                        VILLANUEVA (O.S.)
                    Beat it, Tina.

      Tina turns to SEE the giant.  God, he looks even larger.

                                        VILLANUEVA (CONT'D)
                    I need a minute.

      She exits.  Villanueva approaches, sits opposite Ty.

                                        VILLANUEVA (CONT'D)
                    First, we got a teenage boy being
                      heli-vac-ed in from Bend.  Severed
                    spinal cord, due to arrive in two
                    minutes.

                                        TY
                    Call Sung, or Tina--

                                        VILLANUEVA
                    I'm calling you.  Second.

                                        VILLANUEVA (CONT'D)
                    What makes Chelsea General Chelsea
                      General... is that when you fuck
                    up, you hear about it from your
                      colleagues.  That's why most of us
                    chose this place.  You fucked up,
                    Ty.  We all do. 

      Villanueva rises, checks his watch.

                                        VILLANUEVA (CONT'D)
                    You got about thirty seconds to
                    pull your sorry ass together and
                    get to the E.R.

      And the giant exits.  Ty just sits there, looks almost
      numb.  THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT.  He doesn't even
      blink an eye for fifteen seconds.  Then, his eyes close. 
      Then open.  And he stands.  On to the next case.  He's
      got no other choice.  He exits; as we:

                                                              CUT TO:



      TY WALKS AWAY FROM CAMERA, and as he does, we eventually:

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                      END OF SHOW
