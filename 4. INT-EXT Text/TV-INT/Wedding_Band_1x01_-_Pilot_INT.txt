        Sun-drenched suite with panoramic views of Lake Washington, Mt. 
      Rainier and the Seattle skyline.  More stunning in Vera Wang is 
      the bride SARA (30).  Emotionally, she s a friggin  wreck.  

                                  SARA
                    What was I thinking??  This is the 
                    biggest mistake of my life!

      REVEAL a GUY S HAND fondling Sara s BREAST.  Meet TOMMY (32), a 
      BRADLEY COOPER-type, handsome in a tux but rough around the edges. 

                                  TOMMY
                    I think you re letting the circumstances 
                    influence your emotions right now.

                                  SARA
                    My fianc  is outside!

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah, you have a valid point there.

      She still panics.  Tommy drops his sarcasm for sincerity.  

                                  TOMMY
                    I m gonna get you through this.  You ll 
                    go down there, exchange a few vows.  
                    Eat some shrimp cocktail.  Do that cute 
                    dance with the niece.  Play the moment 
                    of suspense with the cake.  Do you go 
                    with the  romantic finger feed ?  Or 
                    the fan favorite  wedding cake smash ?  
                    I know I m dying to find out. 
                          (that gets her to smile)
                    Then you two will go off and live 
                    happily ever after. 

      Sara relaxes.  Then a GUY IN TUX bangs on the BEVELED WINDOW.  

                                  GUY IN TUX
                    Tommy!  That better not be you in there!

                                  TOMMY
                    Maybe we should get that shrimp 
                    cocktail to go.

                                                                    MAIN CREDITS.

      Fingers perform a chaotic solo recalling Eddie Van Halen.  PULL 
      BACK TO REVEAL a Ryan Reynolds type --


      EDDIE (32), in a button down, jams a hard rock cover of WHEELS ON 
      THE BUS.  His 1-year old BRAHM claps.  Eddie does the  orgasmic 
      solo face  when WUMP! Brahm falls off the CHANGING TABLE.  

                                  INGRID (O.S.)
                    Was that Brahm??

                                  EDDIE
                    No, hon.  The uh, wipes fell.  

      Eddie tosses down wipes to cover up the scene.  Crying baby 
      over one shoulder, guitar strapped over the other.  


      A clothing trail leads over the bed up to a closet.  Door slides 
      revealing TOMMY with a HOT BRUNETTE (not Sara).  He wakes her.

                                  HOT BRUNETTE
                    Does that say 5 PM??  I m late for 
                      Mother-Daughter Weekend!

                    You wouldn t happen to be the 
                    mother in that scenario, would you?

      Reveal our guys are a wedding band Mother Of The Bride.  They re 
      dressed in matching suits.  It s the last song we expect these 
      dudes to play, but they rock it.  Tommy sings in the mic --

                                  TOMMY
                    All the girls stomp your feet like this!

      He joins lead guitarist and life-long best friend Eddie.  The 
      two mimic Stefani s complex choreography.  GUESTS eat it up.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Few times I ve been around that track / 
                    So it s not just gonna happen like that.

      BRIDESMAIDS can no longer restrain themselves.  They hop on 
      stage and dance behind Tommy like Gwen s HARAJUKU GIRLS. 

                                  TOMMY

      SUPER: Tommy. Lead Singer. Horoscope Columnist.


      Modest wedding.  Guests are seated for appetizers.  The band s on 
      break, sitting at the Bride and Groom s table.  Tommy and Eddie 
      are in a giddy mood feasting on shrimp cocktail and crab cakes.

                                  EDDIE
                    Feel all that love in the air?  Nothing 
                    beats the Seattle Wedding Scene in June.                                                                                        4.


                                  TOMMY
                    It s shaping up to be our biggest 
                    yet.  I ve got us booked for 4 
                    weddings and a Bar Mitzvah.

                                  EDDIE
                    We better brush up on our Hava Nagila.  
                    Get it real tight this time. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Remember guys.  Pace yourselves during 
                    the work week.  These people count on 
                    us to bring our A-game on the weekends.

                                  EDDIE
                    Already on it.  Told my secretary 
                    no meetings Friday afternoons.  And 
                    none before lunch on Mondays. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Like the way you re thinking.  No one 
                    wants to be stuck in an 8 am Power 
                    Point with a  Category 5  hangover.  

      Listening in disbelief is the band s new bassist STEVIE (42 and 
        African-American).  Imagine Johnny Drama as a rocker.  His 
      leather pants indicate he hails from the late-80 s music scene.

                                  STEVIE
                    You guys are joking, right?  How 
                    crazy can playing weddings be?

                                  BARRY
                    Listen, rook...

      Barry, using his DRUMSTICKS as chopsticks, drops his shrimp 
      in mock-disgust.

                                  BARRY
                    I m sure years of recording in 
                    studios with Wang Chung and Ricky 
                      Springfield was  rad.   But it s 
                    nothing compared to life on the road.

                                  TOMMY
                    This is your first wedding, Stevie.  
                    There are a few trade secrets we 
                    should catch you up on.  

                                  EDDIE
                          (re: Barry)
                    First is ignore my younger brother.                                                                                      5.


                                  STEVIE
                    I didn t know you guys were brothers.

                                  BARRY
                    He s only 5 months older.  Big whoop.

      As Stevie does the math, Tommy gets back to point.

                                  TOMMY
                    Our Golden Rule as a wedding band is to 
                    make it the  Big Day  not just for the 
                    bride and groom.  But for everyone. 

                                  STEVIE
                    Everyone?  C mon, even her?

      Stevie points to an OVERWEIGHT WOMAN (20 s) eating alone.

                                  EDDIE
                      Especially her.  

                                  TOMMY
                    I m guessing she s the bride s fat 
                    cousin.  Probably flew in just for 
                    the bouquet toss...  


      The FAT COUSIN blocks out WOMEN like Joakim Noah in the paint. 

                                  TOMMY (V.O.)
                    After two connecting flights and a 
                    layover, we gotta make sure she 
                      shoestring catches that thing. 

      The Bride shanks the BOUQUET TOSS.  Tommy tips it to the FAT 
      COUSIN.  She makes a great sliding catch.  Her night s made. 
      Stevie watches, impressed.  As Eddie nudges him -- 

                                  EDDIE
                    There s also that one guy at every 
                    wedding who s not gonna hook up...


      The band (now in green ties and cumberbunds) rocks on stage. 
      A JOE LO TRUGLIO-type guest pumps his fist so hard, he could 
      tear his rotator cuff.  Eddie points him out to Stevie.

                                  EDDIE (V.O.)
                    Don t ask why, but 82% of the time 
                    his name s  Derek.                                                                                         6.


       Derek  turns to a Dancing Bridesmaid and mouths  I m Derek!   
      She turns her back to dance with another Bridesmaid.  

                                  EDDIE (V.O.)
                    Come Monday  Derek  needs a story 
                    to tell the office.  

                                  TOMMY (V.O.)
                    So we give him one.

                                  EDDIE (V.O.)
                    He s also our way around the  No 
                    Booze For The Band  policy...

      ZOOM IN on DEREK S TIE.  As he moves to loosen the knot --

                                  EDDIE (V.O.)
                    Key is to wait for his Windsor knot to 
                    drop down to the second button.  Then 
                    we make him honorary band member.

      Eddie does that knee-slide across the stage up to Derek and 
      launches into a solo that sends his target into a frenzy. 

                                  EDDIE (V.O.)
                    After that, he ll slip us drinks all night.

                    There are some songs we have to play 
                    every wedding.

                                  STEVIE
                    If we have to play that song every 
                    weekend I m gonna kill myself.

                                  TOMMY
                    I felt the same way the first 50 
                    times we played it.  Now I see the 
                    true healing power it possesses...                                                                                      7.



      The band rocks a Chili Peppers version of  I WILL SURVIVE. 

                                  TOMMY (V.O.)
                    It s the anthem for any woman who s 
                    ever had her heart broken.

      WOMEN of all generations dance to the song for therapy.

                                  TOMMY (V.O.)
                    There s also no better sonar for

      QUICK CUTS FROM ALL THE JUNE EVENTS: 4 WEDDINGS & A BAR MITZVAH

      Our Band plays the first great wedding song of the millennium.  
      Guests sing and jump along.  We watch our guys go from providing 
      the soundtrack for each party to becoming the life of the party.

      - Bride & Groom #1 pull Tommy and Eddie into a photo.

      - The band pounds shots with  DEREK #1 .

      - A drunk BEST MAN turns his speech into a roast.  The BRIDE s 
      horrified.  Eddie grabs the mic, his speech wins everyone back.

      - The BAR MITZVAH BOY is hoisted up on a chair...  

      - Now Tommy and Eddie hoisted on chairs.

      - The band pounds shots with a pack of groomsmen from wedding #2. 

      - Outdoor Country-Western Wedding.  Pouring RAIN.  The band keeps 
      playing.  Despite getting drenched, the guests dance on.

      - MOTEL ROOM. The  I WILL SURVIVE  Cougar sleeps like a baby.  
      But Stevie barely survived.  He sets his CORSAGE on the pillow.

      - Tommy unzips VARIOUS BRIDESMAIDS dresses.  INTERCUT with Eddie s 
      solos getting VARIOUS DEREKS to lower their ties (and bolo).

      SEQUENCE ENDS as the Jet song ends - a big, 4-count rock finish: 
          BOMP-BOMP-BOMP-BOMP!  Each BOMP! a snapshot from each June 
      wedding.  End with our guys jumping up and landing with a BOMP!


      Windows down.  Music blasts.  The guys head home, pumped with 
      euphoria from their final June performance.  We gather from 
      their KILTS and SPORRANS it was a formal Scottish Wedding. 

                                  STEVIE

                    Month s not over yet.  There s still time 
                    to squeeze in one more round of shots.

                                  DEREK #4 (O.S.)
                    Then let s get tattoos together!

      Reveal DEREK #4 in the third row between two car seats.                                                                                        9.


                                  EDDIE
                    No can do, Derek.  
                          (to Tommy)
                      I promised Ingrid I d head straight 
                    home after we dropped him off.

                                  TOMMY
                    Why, you got another scheduled sex date?

      The guys laugh at Eddie s expense.

                                  EDDIE
                    Laugh all you want.  But things in the 
                    bedroom still get pret-ty, pret-ty hot.

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah?  You talk dirty to her through 
                    the baby monitor?

                                  EDDIE
                    It may not be as wild as one of your 
                       Two-for-Tuesdays.   But it s still 
                    exciting.  It s just, y know, different.

                                  STEVIE
                    How different?

                                  EDDIE
                    When you start dating, sex is like 
                    that long sushi menu.  Filled with 
                    exotic items like Rainbow Rolls, 
                    Shimaji and Omakase - where the chef 
                    surprises you.  After you re married?  
                    Lots of stuff comes off the menu.

                                  TOMMY
                    Even the Omakase?

                                  EDDIE
                    You re basically down to the California 
                    and Tuna roll.  After a few Sake bombs, 
                    maybe the Spicy Tuna.  But it s still 
                    sushi.  You enjoy it whenever you get it.  

                                  TOMMY
                    C mon.  One round.  Ingrid won t know.

                                  EDDIE
                    Dude.  She was a Crime Scene 
                      Investigator before we had kids.  
                    This is the same woman who found 
                    fibers on my Dockers.  Then traced 
                     em back to that stripper s tassel.                                                                                    10.



      As Ingrid pulls away from the Police Station, Eddie expects a 
      chew out.  INSTEAD SHE WHISPERS.                                                                                    12.


                                  INGRID
                    I think it s time we have  that 
                      conversation. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Which one?  We ve banked a few.  
                    Where it s my turn to be responsible 
                    for the birth control?

                                  INGRID
                    The one where you re responsible period.

                                  EDDIE
                    Hey, why are we whispering?

      REVEAL their kids JANIE (3) and BRAHM (1) asleep in the back seat.

                                  INGRID
                    Because it s a little hard finding 
                      a babysitter at 2 in the morning so 
                    you can go bail your husband out.

                                  EDDIE
                    I m thinking we should always have our 
                    arguments while the kids are asleep.


      Stressed STAFFERS perk up as Tommy strolls in.  Especially the 
      FEMALES.  He slaloms cubicles and adlibs hellos when his editor 
      DAWN (40) cuts him off.  Think Rene Russo - classy, smart, sexy. 

                                  DAWN
                    You guys really made my son s Bar 
                    Mitzvah.  Thanks for helping Greg 
                    through his Haftorah portion.

                                  TOMMY
                          (modest)
                    I picked up a little Hebrew playing 
                    some shows at the JCC.  

                                  DAWN
                    If only you showed that dedication 
                    with your column.

      Tommy enters his CUBICLE - a mess of TAROT CARDS, ASTROLOGY 
      CHARTS and INCENSE.  He daylights as HOROSCOPE WRITER SANJAY 
      MOON.  Sharing the cubicle is GLENN (36).  He s the guy in 
      the office who s always experimenting with facial hair.

                                  TOMMY
                    Geez Glenn, don t you have a razor? 

                                  GLENN
                    It s a  chin curtain.   Lebron has one.

                                  TOMMY
                    But you don t have an outside jump 
                    shot and you write the Sudoku column.  

                                  GLENN
                    Almost forgot.  You got two calls 
                    from a Sara.  I thought you never 
                    gave ladies this number.

      Tommy eyes the messages like a rearview to his past.

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah, well, I made an exception once. 


      Packed with wine buffs.  So not Tommy s scene.  He waits as 
      the Maitre D double checks the computer for reservations.                                                                                    16.


                                  MAITRE D
                    No, nothing under  Sara  or  Tommy. 

                                  TOMMY
                          (nostalgic smile)
                    How about  Sanjay ?

      Bingo.  He leads Tommy to SARA s table.  The two ex s light up 
      seeing each other.  It registers she s more of a woman since 
      he last saw her.  To her, Tommy s pretty much the same.

                                  SARA
                    How many guesses did it take?  My 
                      over-under was two.

                                  TOMMY
                    You and the over-under thing... 
                    Answer s three, by the way.  

      He eyes her TIGHT TOP and does a DOUBLE-TAKE over her breasts.

                                  TOMMY
                    You look different.  Have you 
                    changed anything? 

                                  SARA
                    For some bizarre reason, lawyers don t 
                    take you as seriously with purple hair.

                                  TOMMY
                          (looks around the bar)
                    Can t believe this is the place we d 
                    come see bands play.  It s not the 
                    same without that sticky layer of 
                      perma-beer on the floor.

                                  SARA
                    And the mosh pit where you broke 
                    your collarbone?  Now a Tapas bar.  

      They laugh.  Then soak in the moment.  He misses this with her.

                                  TOMMY
                    I m glad you called.

                                  SARA
                    I m glad you called back.
                          (gulps wine for courage)
                    This is gonna sound desperate.  But 
                    my clock s ticking and it would 
                    mean so much more if it were you.                                                                                    17.


                                  TOMMY
                    Clock?  Whoa.  I m flattered.  But 
                    let s not rush.  Lots of women hit the 
                    panic button.  This one girl at the 
                    paper even blogged about her clock.  
                    Got so bad, her eggs  Friended  me.  
                    Let s take this in baby steps - forget 
                    baby!  Baby s the wrong word.

      She laughs.  Hysterically.  Then he laughs, but not sure why.  

                                  SARA
                    Same old Tommy.  Don t worry, I 
                    learned the hard way not to ask you 
                    for any commitment.

                                  TOMMY
                    I deserve that.  But we were still 
                    trying to get signed.  Besides, it s a 
                    rock badge of honor when a guy has to 
                    choose between the girl and the band. 

                                  SARA
                    I ran into Carly.  She mentioned you 
                    played her wedding.

                                  TOMMY
                          (genuine)
                    Yeah, we play tons of weddings now.  
                    They re actually more fun than playing 
                    clubs.  Every night s a sell-out.  And 
                    believe me, it s a lot better when the 
                    crowd knows the lyrics.

                                  SARA
                    That s actually why I called.  I was 
                    hoping you d play my wedding.  

      The shock causes Tommy to snap his breadstick in half.  He s 
      completely thrown by the news - but Sara waits for an answer.

                                  TOMMY
                    Wouldn t that be awkward?

                                  SARA
                    God no!  I m completely over you.

                                  TOMMY
                          (ouch)
                    I meant for your mom.

                                  SARA
                    It s my big day.  I think I can get 
                    her to lift the restraining order. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Has she filed one against your fianc ?                                                                                    18.


                                  SARA
                    Mom loves Matthew.  He s not a 
                    musician, which she s ecstatic about.  
                    He s in the artificial plant business.

                                  TOMMY
                    You?  Marrying  fake plant guy ?  

                                  SARA
                    First time he sent me fake roses I 
                    thought it was a joke.  But at 
                    least he sends me flowers.

                                  TOMMY
                    Hey, who sent you hidden messages 
                    in his horoscope column?

      Sara s look says their  secret  was special.  For both of 
      them.  He s not ready to give her up without a fight. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Of course we ll do it.

                                  SARA
                    Ah, thank you!

      She kisses his cheek.  It s working already.  He just wants to 
      gauge the time table he s working with to win her back. 

                                  TOMMY
                    What are we working with here?  You 
                    two had a chance to set a date yet?

                                  SARA
                    Next Saturday.

                                  TOMMY
                    Uh, that doesn t give me much time.  Us.  
                    The band.  There s set lists, rehearsals. 

                                  SARA
                    That s why I was so desperate.  The  
                    wedding band we booked a year ago 
                    just checked into rehab.  Our 
                    wedding planner was pushing this 
                    cheesy band Def Repplica.

                                  TOMMY
                    Wait, Rutherford s doing your wedding?

                                  SARA
                    Yeah.  Is that a problem?

                                  TOMMY
                    Not for me.                                                                                    19.



      Eddie, still wearing Brahm in the Bjorn, sits with the guys 
      at a MUSHROOM TABLE set for tea party.  Barry stares at the 
      Princess Murals on the walls in disgust.

                                  BARRY
                    What kind of irresponsible person 
                    turns his band s rehearsal studio 
                    into his kids  playroom??

                                  EDDIE
                    We re thinking of re-doing the kitchen.  
                    Do I have to run that by you too?                                                                                      21.


                                  BARRY
                      Considering how much time I spend in 
                    there?  I think it s only fair!

                                  TOMMY
                    Can we table the sibling spat?  I 
                    went out the other night with Sara.  

                        EDDIEBARRY
      You re kidding?  That s Tell me you re kidding!  
      awesome!That s awful!

                                  STEVIE
                    Who s Sara?

                                  BARRY
                    The girl that almost broke up the band.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Every girl I date you think is gonna 
                    break up the band.  

                                  EDDIE
                    You did write 2 songs about her.

                                  TOMMY
                    So?  I wrote 8 songs about drinking.

                                  EDDIE
                    None of  em was a ballad.

      Tommy s look reveals Sara meant more than he s letting on. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Me and Ingrid never understood why 
                    you guys broke up.

                                  TOMMY
                    Sara and I split before you two met.

                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah well, I tell her everything. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Well you can tell Ingrid the reason 
                    I broke up with Sara was...
                          (we expect deep confession)
                    She had cross-eyed nipples.

                                  STEVIE
                    How wonky we talking here?  Stuart 
                    Scott?  Or Lucy Liu?

      Stevie uses fingers to illustrate wonky nipple configurations.                                                                                     22.


                                  TOMMY
                    Can we put a pin in the nipples?  
                    Sara s getting married.

                                  EDDIE
                    Oh honey, that sucks.
                          (catches himself)
                    Did not mean to call you  honey.   It s an 
                    automated husband response to bad news. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Actually, this is good news.  She 
                    hired us to play her wedding.

                                  EDDIE
                    Sure that s a good idea?  You re gonna 
                    be cool playing  Every I Do I Do For 
                    You  as your ex walks down the aisle?

                                  STEVIE
                    Did she request that song??  I 
                    played on that song! 

                                  TOMMY
                    Guys.  Nothing to worry about.  I m 
                    over Sara.  I wouldn t have agreed to 
                    do this next Saturday if I wasn t.

                                  EDDIE
                    Next Saturday?  I can t do it.  I 
                    booked Ingrid a Spa Night.

                                  TOMMY
                    This may sound radical, but can t 
                    you move it a day?

                                  EDDIE
                    First rule of Spa Night is you don t 
                    move Spa Night.  Especially this time.  
                    Ingrid needs a break.  So I promised 
                    her I d take one Saturday off.

                                  TOMMY
                    Trust me.  You won t wanna take this 
                    Saturday off.  It s a Rutherford wedding.

      That gets Eddie s attention.

                                  TOMMY
                    Know how huge this could be for us!  
                    We d make more money in one night 
                    than we did all of June.

                                  EDDIE
                    That would make a dent in the Green 
                    Dolphins  tuition...Which would 
                    make me a hero with Ingrid.                                                                                      23.


      Tommy stands up on the mushroom chair to make the big sale.

                                  TOMMY
                    Think bigger.  No more playing Red 
                    Roof Inns.  Or The Tractor Tavern.  
                    We get in with them, we re in a 
                    whole new league.  I m talking 5-
                    star events the rest of the way.

                                  BARRY
                    Since we re selling out, let s go 
                    get Yankees hats and lease some 
                      Priuses... We re an indie wedding 
                    band!  We re anti-establishment!  

                                  TOMMY
                    Fine.  I ll tell Sara to go with her 
                    second choice.  Def Repplica.

                                  BARRY
                    Well that s a game changer...If we 
                    do this, we go all the way.  I m 
                    talking brass section, 6 costume 
                    changes.  Cage dancers.  Two 60-foot 
                    Video screens so the guests way back 
                    at Table 14...

      As Barry waxes on, Tommy looks to Eddie -- Well?

                                  EDDIE
                    You don t understand.  I swore on 
                    our wedding album.  Know how sacred 
                    that is to a woman?

                                  TOMMY
                    What about our dream as a band?  
                    Isn t that sacred?  We finally have 
                    a shot with Rutherford.  Are you 
                    really gonna let it pass us by?

      Eddie looks out at Janie playing with TODD S DAUGHTER.  He can 
      justify breaking his promise to Ingrid if he can be the hero to 
      his family.  

                                  EDDIE
                    On second thought, I will have that beer...

      Then Eddie s resolve fades.  He dumps out a juice box.

                                  EDDIE
                    But pour it in this juice box so 
                    Ingrid doesn t find out.  

                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    24.


                                          ACT THREE


      The guys (dressed in day job attire) enter the lobby of 
      Seattle s premiere Events Firm.  FRAMED COVERS of Bride, O, 
      People, etc. flaunt their work.  Eddie reacts like it s Oz.  

                                  EDDIE
                    Get a load of this.  They have a 
                    latt  machine.  In the lobby.  

                                  STEVIE
                          (feeling walnut oak)
                    Built right into the wall, too.  
                    Paisley Park doesn t even have that.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Check out what s hanging above it. 

      A giant POSTER of DEF REPPLICA posing at STONEHENGE.  It s a 
      recreation of that famous Def Leppard poster from the 80 s.

                                  BARRY
                    These doucheballs even do tribute posters?

                                  EDDIE
                    They actually flew to Stonehenge for that 
                    shot.  This is officially disturbing.

                                  RACHEL (O.S.)
                    For the record, I tried talking Sara 
                    out of hiring you guys.

      They re interrupted by RACHEL (27), who always carries a 8  
      BINDER stuffed with 9  of paper (and that s just the Miller 
      Wedding).  Rachel s bright, cute, and the type of girl who has 
      her shit together.  But the more you get to know her?  Dude...

                                  RACHEL
                    It s never a good idea for the 
                    bride s ex to be the entertainment 
                    on the biggest day of her life.

                                  TOMMY
                    Love the honesty, but who are you?

                                  RACHEL
                    Rachel.  Sara s Wedding Planner.


      Sara catches up with Eddie, stunned by his new look.                                                                                    25.


                                  SARA
                    Eddie!?  Where are all your tattoos??

                                  EDDIE
                    Had  em lasered off for my wedding.

      Barry and Stevie hover at the muffin and bagel spread, not so 
      discreetly staring at Sara s nipples.  

                                  STEVIE
                    Nothing wonky about those Lucy Liu s.

                                  TOMMY
                    Little less obvious, guys.  Barry, 
                    you spread cream cheese on your hand.

      Barry sees he schmeared his hand.  His bagel still on the plate.  
      MATTHEW (30), Sara s super sweet, super rich fianc , surprises 
      Tommy with a hug.  We gather Tommy s not much of a hugger.

                                  TOMMY
                    You must be Matthew.

                                    MATTHEW
                    And probably your band s biggest fan.

                                  TOMMY
                    Oh, so you attended a wedding we played.

                                    MATTHEW
                    No.  Sara turned me on to your 
                    original music.  My favorite track 
                    is  Love Pi ata.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Really?  Sara played you the ballad?

                                    MATTHEW
                          (totally sincere)
                    That is one great song to make love to.

      A THROAT CLEARS like fingers down a chalkboard.  It s the mother 
      of the bride BETHENNY (50 s), the female version of Szell from 
      Marathon Man: shrill, cold as ice, and as obsessed with diamonds. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Bethenny, I know we ve had our 
                      differences, but I wanna say congrats 
                    on the wedding.  And the botox.

                                  BETHENNY
                    Cut the shit, Tommy.  You screw 
                    this up, I will cut off your balls 
                    and wear them as earrings.                                                                                      26.


                                  TOMMY
                    Not sure they d go with your necklace.

                                  BETHENNY
                          (barking at Rachel)
                    We re already running 3 minutes behind.  
                    Where s Rutherford so we can start?

                                  RACHEL
                    She wanted to be here, but she s 
                    working 24/7 on Bill Gates  birthday 
                    party.  It s an Island theme.  He s 
                    having sand shipped in from Fiji.  

                                  BETHENNY
                    After all the business I ve given her, 
                    she sticks me with some trainee.

      Rachel feels undermined, but never shows it.  

                                  SARA
                    Mom.  Rachel s great.  She s so 
                    detail oriented, it s like she s 
                    planning her own wedding.

      Rachel shows a slight nervous tick.  Then covers and starts her 
      PRESENTATION.  KEYNOTE:  Role of Wedding Band.   

                                  RACHEL
                    The band s job is more than playing 
                    music.  Your role is to emcee.  Make 
                    sure the night moves along smoothly 
                    according to  The Run Sheet. 
                          (waves thick Run Sheet)
                    This is your Bible.

                                  EDDIE
                    Not sure if Sara mentioned this, but 
                    we ve played our share of weddings...

      Eddie pulls collated copies of the band s resume.

                                  EDDIE
                    Brought extra copies if you wanna 
                    pass them around the office.

                                  RACHEL
                    The perfect wedding has no surprises.

                                  BARRY
                    Raging party with no surprises.  Got it.                                                                                    27.


                                  RACHEL
                    I hope so.  Because we pride ourselves 
                    on professionalism.  Which means we 
                    won t tolerate incidents like the one 
                    you had in The Westin parking lot.   

      That draws curious looks from Sara and suspicion from Bethenny. 

                                  BARRY
                    Repplica picked that fight!

                                  EDDIE
                          (quickly covering)
                    But we should ve known better.  
                    Isn t that right, Barry? 

                                  TOMMY
                    You don t have to worry.  It won t 
                    happen again.

                                  RACHEL
                    Great.  Let s move on to the Set-List.

      KEYNOTE SLIDE: ALL-80 s MUSIC SET-LIST.

                                  RACHEL
                    It s an all 80 s theme.  

      Stevie breaks into a wide grin.  Barry bites his tongue.

                                  RACHEL
                    For the First Dance, Sara and 
                    Matthew have selected Making Love 
                    Out Of Nothing At All.

                                  TOMMY
                    What??

                                  BARRY
                    I know.  They can probably get Air 
                    Supply to play the wedding.  

                                  TOMMY
                          (pointed to Sara)
                    That s an interesting choice for your 
                    first dance.

                                  SARA
                    Yeah, well, it s our song, right honey?

      She affectionately puts her hand on Matthew s.  Then shares a 
      glance with Tommy that says the song meant something to them too.                                                                                     28.



      Stevie lets them in to see it s wall-to-wall GOLD RECORDS & 
      CASSETTES.  All 80 s acts.  Only Barry s not impressed.

                                  BARRY
                    Who decorated your house?  K-Tel?

      From Wang Chung s Warmer Side Of Cool to Huey Lewis  Small 
      World to Duran Duran s Liberty, even Don Johnson s Heartbeat.                                                                                      30.


                                  TOMMY
                    You said you played on a few 
                    records.  Not a few thousand.

      Barry goes all Beautiful Mind as he goes down the albums and 
      sees a pattern.  Each gold record is the band s most popular 
      album - just their final one.

                                  BARRY
                    Don t you see the connection here?  
                    These are all  contract  albums.  
                    Stevie s the band killer.

                                  EDDIE
                    Hell he is, Barry.  Stevie walked 
                    on the moon as far as the three of 
                    us are concerned.  

                                  BARRY
                    Did he fake his landing, too?  I 
                    don t see him on any of the covers.

                                  STEVIE
                          (sore spot)
                    Life of a studio musician. 


      A killer studio and a kick-ass MAN-CAVE.  Couches, Kegerator, 
      plasmas and mementos from his glory days.  Most impressive is 
      the vintage recording equipment.  Barry runs his fingers 
      along a mixing board as if it was the Holy Grail. 

                                  BARRY
                      A restored Neve 8048!?  Soundgarden 
                    mixed LOUDER THAN LOVE on one of these.

                                  STEVIE
                    Yeah, that exact one.  Paid for it 
                    with my Rick Springfield royalties.  

      That earned Barry s begrudging respect.  Tommy and Eddie are 
      gobsmacked.  It s the studio they ve always dreamed of.

                                  TOMMY
                          (sarcastic)
                    I think we can make this work.

      CUE: Opening PIANO BARS of REO s  KEEP ON LOVING YOU . 


      CLOSE ON STEVIE S FINGERS playing Casio ivories.  Tommy cups 
      the mic and out-croons Kevin Cronin --                                                                                    31.


                                  TOMMY
                    You should ve seen by the look in my eyes, 
                    ba-by / There was somethin  missin . 

      BARRY double-pounds the cymbals - CH-CHSSHhhhhh. 

                                  TOMMY
                    You should ve known by the tone of my 
                    voice, maybe / But you didn t listen.

      Like a sonic blast, the band kicks it up from SPEEDWAGON to 
        SOUNDGARDEN.  Tommy s vocals go from Cronin to Chris Cornell wail. 

                                  TOMMY
                    You played dead / But you never bled 
                    / Instead you lay in still in the 
                    grass / All coiled up and hissin .

      Eddie launches into solo that soars like a kite to wind. 

                                  TOMMY
                    And I m gonna keep on lovin  you!
                    It s the only thing I wanna do!

      Four grown men rockin  out.  On a work day.  They re like 15 year-
      old boys back in their parents  garage.  Eddie rips open his 
      button down.  It hasn t even been two weeks and it s clear he s 
      missed having this release...then Eddie s iPHONE alarm SOUNDS.  

                                  EDDIE
                    I gotta meet Ingrid at the 
                      preschool.  I better towel off or 
                    she ll know something s up.  

                                  TOMMY
                    You have told her about the wedding?  

                                  EDDIE
                          (laughs at the naivete)
                    Why would I do that to myself?  What 
                    she doesn t know, we can t argue about.  
                    I hope you re recording this take, 
                    Stevie.  Cuz that, my single friends, 
                    is the key to a healthy marriage. 

                                  TOMMY
                    What about her background in forensics?  
                    Suddenly that doesn t concern you?

                                  EDDIE
                    I told you, she ll be at her Spa Night.  
                    Relaxing.

                                  EDDIE (CONT'D)
                    While she s getting Shiatsu d, she 
                    thinks I m  taking the kids to Yo Gabba 
                    Gabba.   Already ordered concert shirts 
                    on-line.

                                  STEVIE
                    Heists don t require that much planning.  

                                  TOMMY
                    I gotta bolt too.  I m meeting Sara 
                    to pick out our tuxes. 

                                  EDDIE
                            (suspicious)
                    We already have six kinds of tuxes.

                                  TOMMY
                    This is Rutherford.  Don t you 
                    wanna impress them by dressing to 
                    the nines?  Sara s gonna know what 
                    blends in with her wedding.

                                  EDDIE
                    What you said in the Playroom?  You 
                    meant that, right?  We are doing 
                    this to get in with Rutherford?  
                    Not so you can get Sara back.

      A PALL falls over the room as the guys wait for Tommy s answer.

                                  TOMMY
                    If I was, I wouldn t do it by going 
                    shopping.  I ve ended relationships 
                    just to get out of shopping.

                                  EDDIE
                    Good.  Cuz our rule s always been we 
                    love to make weddings.  Not ruin them.


      As Tommy puts on his Tux jacket, Sara asks from outside -- 

                                  SARA (O.S.)
                    So how are rehearsals coming?

                                  TOMMY
                    We re really clicking.  Especially 
                    with that Air Supply song...

      As he exits the dressing room, Sara s mindful of the TAILOR.

                                  SARA
                    12 minutes.  Yes.  My  over-under  was 15.                                                                                     33.


                                  TOMMY
                    First you ask me to play your wedding.  
                    Now you want me to play our song. 
                          (to tailor)
                    Does that sound like she s over me?

                                  SARA
                    For starters, Matthew chose it.  And 
                    it was never  our  song.  
                          (explains to tailor)
                    He put it on a mix tape as a joke.

                                  TOMMY
                    We were making out when the song 
                    came on.  She did a spit take...

                                  SARA
                    Tommy!

                                  TOMMY
                    In my mouth.  How s that not our song?

                                  SARA
                    Because that Sirius  80 s channel?  It s 
                    Matthew s go-to station.  We re driving 
                    to that critical  Third Date  when Air 
                    Supply came on.  Matthew says,  This 
                    reminds me of you.   My first thought 
                    was  If I jump out of the car, how bad 
                    would my injuries be?   Then I realized 
                    I never listened to the lyrics.  They re 
                    pretty powerful.  Let s just say we 
                    didn t make our 8:00 reservation.

                                  TOMMY
                    So you did jump out the car and suffer 
                    a major head injury.  Poor thing.

                                  SARA
                          (laughs; then sweet)
                    What s the rest of your afternoon like?  
                    Do you have anywhere you have to be? 

      Tommy grins.  Feels like he finally broke through. 


      Sara enters.  Tommy follows carrying bags and boxes from a dozen 
      stores.  Honeymoon stuff, Bridesmaid gifts, altered dress.

                                  SARA
                    Thanks for helping with my last 
                    minute wedding errands.                                                                                    34.


      Not what Tommy had in mind for their afternoon.  He puts stuff 
      down and eyes the  adult  pad: Furniture that doesn t fold out.  
      Paintings by artists he should know.  Tommy feels the FAKE FICUS. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Nice  fake-us.   
                          (gestures to her breasts)
                    Is anything in here real?

                                  SARA
                    Fine, yes, they re fake...and they re 
                    real.  They re 100% bio-degradable 
                    implants.

                                  TOMMY
                    So every time Matthew goes motorboating, 
                    he s helping the environment.  
                          (she can t help laugh)
                    Are your cans recyclable? 

                                  SARA
                    Ask Matthew s dad.  He did them. 

                                  TOMMY
                    And you don t find that creepy?

                                  SARA
                    No, he introduced us after final payment.

      They share a laugh.  Tommy sees an opening.

                                  TOMMY
                    Did your band really check into rehab?

                                  SARA
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  TOMMY
                    I didn t go to the wine bar to sample 
                    Cabs and cheeses.  I went because you 
                    were the one that got away.

                                  SARA
                    Don t do this to me.  I m in love 
                    with Matthew.  I only reached out to 
                    you because you re  Tommy Pan.   The 
                    boy who ll never grow up. 

                                  TOMMY
                    I have grown up.  Last week I had a 
                    craving to buy one of those big, 
                      wood-framed mirrors.
                          (off her glare; sincere)
                    I also should ve never let you go.

                                  TOMMY (CONT'D)
                    It takes a grown up to admit that 
                    stuff too, right?

      Before Sara can process his declaration, they hear a KEY IN 
      THE FRONT DOOR.  Sara quickly steps away from Tommy as MATTHEW 
      ENTERS with a big bouquet of fake flowers.  As he kisses Sara: 

                                    MATTHEW
                    Hey Tommy.  You coming to the 
                    rehearsal dinner?  

                                  TOMMY
                    That sounds cool --

                                  SARA
                    But he has band rehearsal. 

      Tommy gets the hint.  On his way to the door, he looks back 
      at Sara, who is starting have cold feet.

                                  TOMMY
                    Guess next time I see you, you ll 
                    be walking down the aisle.



                                        END ACT THREE                                                                                    36.


                                          ACT FOUR

      SERIES OF SHOTS as the band gets ready for their BIG WEDDING:

      -- TOMMY s on time, dressed.  He even shaved.  On his way 
      out, he grabs a GIFT BOX addressed  To Sara, From Sanjay . 

      -- BARRY is Ocean s 11 sharp in a tux as he exits the Mall pet 
      store (opposite Guitar Center) carrying a PLASTIC BAG of GOLDFISH.

      -- STEVIE eyes his tux.  Something s not right.  Goes to his 
      closet and pulls a pair of leather pants.  Now it s right. 

      -- EDDIE waves to Ingrid as she leaves for SPA NIGHT.  A beat.  
      He pulls his DOUBLE-NECK GUITAR CASE stashed in the boxwoods.


      Rachel reasons with a DELIVERY GUY over the WEDDING CAKE.

                                  RACHEL
                    I know what the slip says, but this 
                    is still the wrong cake.  Does that 
                    look like a bride and groom to you?

      Reveal the FIGURINES are TWO GROOMS.  Bethenny marches up --

                                  BETHENNY
                    I want my own headset.  This is 
                    your first wedding and I m really 
                    not feeling comfortable.

                                  RACHEL
                          (bristling inside)
                    Well, we want you to feel comfortable.


      Bridesmaids buzz as they do their make-up.  Sara bites her nails 
      when Bethenny enters and takes in the image of her daughter. 

                                  BETHENNY
                    If only your father could be here. 

                                  SARA
                    He could ve, Mom.  Instead I have 
                    to have another wedding with Dad s 
                    side of the family. 

                                  BETHENNY
                          (hands Sara gift box)
                    This is from a Sanjay?  Must be one 
                    of Dr. Miller s partners.  

      Sara plays it cool til her mom leaves.  She stares at the box - 
      debating, struggling to open it or not.  She sets it down, 
      happy with her decision.  Then grabs it.  Opens it to find 
      TODAY S SEATTLE TIMES.  Reads HER HOROSCOPE, her eyes go wide.                                                                                    39.


                                  RACHEL
                          (entering; upbeat)
                    Who s ready to get married?


      Rachel waits for Tommy when Bethenny comes over the headset --

                                  BETHENNY (O.S.)
                    Rachel!  Do something about these 
                    planes!  They ll ruin the ceremony!

                                  RACHEL
                    Yeah, I ll speed-dial the FAA.  Have 
                    them re-route flights to Vancouver.

      Tommy walks up, opens his jacket to say  not armed. 

                                  RACHEL
                      5 minutes.  Then I m coming in.


      Tommy enters to find Sara by herself.  He can t help notice 
      how beautiful she looks.  And angry.  She waves the paper. 

                                  SARA
                    You realize how many Capricorn s 
                    lives you ruined today??

                                  TOMMY
                    Hm, I always thought you were a Leo.

                                  SARA
                    I can t be getting cold feet now!  Not 
                    while I m wearing $1800 Christian 
                    Louboutin bow-topped slingbacks!  

                                  TOMMY
                    $1800?  Tell me you re wearing those 
                    more than once.

                                  SARA
                          (waving horoscope)
                    Why didn t you say this five years ago?? 

                                  TOMMY
                    I guess playing all these weddings 
                    finally rubbed off on me.                                                                                     42.



      Eddie darts to beat Bethenny, but she s already inside.  He runs 
      around the building, through valet, directly in front of --


      The perfect couple, in black tie, bicker over being late. 

                                  TODD
                      I couldn t just leave in the middle 
                    of overtime.  I m the soccer coach.  

                                    HEATHER
                    It s not World Cup.  They re 3.  
                    Any dad can hand out orange slices.
                    Why can t you be more like Oliver?

      Then Todd BRAKES HARD to avoid EDDIE (who doesn t notice them).

                                  TODD
                    You see that idiot?!?

                                    HEATHER
                    I think that idiot s Eddie.


      Icicles melting play on CD.  Ingrid in massage coma when her 
      cell rings.  Thru the headrest she sees CALLER ID reads HEATHER.  

                                  INGRID
                          (answers; then)
                    HE S WHAT?!?!

      She jolts up, knocking the burly MASSEUSE into the oils rack.


      Sara s teetering, but can t nail down what percentage is 
      typical jitters, and what percentage is feelings for Tommy.                                                                                    43.


                                  SARA
                    It wasn t supposed to be this way!  
                    I wasn t supposed to be thinking 
                    about you on my wedding day.  I 
                    finally found a great guy.  Maybe 
                    the only guy in the world who knows 
                    how to put a woman first.  You 
                    realize what a big deal that is?!  

      It occurs to Tommy that in the anticipation of trying to win 
      Sara back, he d forgotten about Matthew.  He never considered 
      how much  the other guy  means to Sara - or Sara means to him.  

                                  TOMMY
                    It is rare, isn t it.

                                  SARA
                    What am I clinging on to?  Was what 
                    we had even real??

      It s the moment Tommy can kiss her with a few words.  He 
      takes her hand, looks deep into her eyes.  

                                  TOMMY
                    It was definitely real...  
                          (we expect a kiss; then)
                    It was also in the past.  Now beat it.  
                    Go out there and marry the right guy.  
                          (off her stunned look)
                    After all, he is a fan of our music.  

      Sara smiles, elated.  Kisses Tommy.  On the cheek.

                                  SARA
                    You re a good guy, Tommy.  You may be late 
                    getting there, but you are growing up.

                                  TOMMY
                    It s the tux.  They say it adds 10 
                    years to your maturity level.
                          (sees champagne bucket)
                    How about some Dom to calm the nerves?  

                                  SARA
                    It certainly couldn t hurt. 

      Tommy pulls the Dom.  Undoes the foil. POP!  SLO-MO as the 
      CORK SHOOTS directly INTO SARA S BREAST.  Another POP!  

                                  SARA
                    Ohmigod!  I think you popped my breast!                                                                                    44.



      Rachel hears the commotion.  Knocks frantically.

                                  RACHEL
                    Sara!  We re gonna miss Golden Hour!


      Sara clutches her breast, panicked.  Tommy talks in a calm tone.

                                  TOMMY
                    I m sure it s fine.  Those things are 
                    meant to be played with.  Besides, I 
                    read somewhere they can handle pressure 
                    up to 500 meters below sea level.

                                  SARA
                    I dunno.  It doesn t feel fine. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Lower your dress.  I gotta get in there. 

                                  SARA
                    I m about to be walk down the aisle!  
                    Now s NOT the time to feel me up!

                                  TOMMY
                    It s purely medical.  I promise.

      She gives in.  Lowers her top.  He puts his hand on her breast.  
      NOTE: This is where we pick up with THE TEASER.

                                  SARA
                    What was I thinking??  This is the 
                    biggest mistake of my life!

                                  TOMMY
                    I think you re letting the circumstances 
                    influence your emotions right now.

                                  SARA
                    My fianc  s outside!


      Bethenny tracks BEEPS to what looks like the Bridal Suite.  She 
      barges in revealing the MEN S ROOM.  Guys zip up.  She goes to a 
      locked stall.  KICKS it in.  SCRAM BRACELET tied to the flusher.

                                  BETHENNY
                      TOM-MYyyyyy!!!


      Tommy s EAR is on Sara s breast like he s cracking a safe.  
      His face goes from hopeful to despair to apologetic.

                                  TOMMY
                      I definitely hear a whistle.  
                          (sincere regret)
                    I m so sorry.

                                  SARA
                    How am I gonna explain this to Matthew?!

      Rachel bursts in and reacts like she caught them in the act.

                                  RACHEL
                    O! M! G!

                                  SARA
                    It s not what it looks like.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Actually, it s worse.  I popped her 
                    implant.

                                  BETHENNY (O.S.)
                          (on Rachel s headset)

                    You re not getting fired, okay.  No 
                    one has to go to Seattle Grace.  
                    This is my fault.  I m gonna make 
                    sure Sara gets her dream wedding.                                                                                    46.


                                  RACHEL
                    She needs to get to a doctor.

                                  TOMMY
                    We already got one down at the 
                    altar.  Sara s father-in-law is the 
                    best boob guy in the Pacific 
                      Northwest.

                                  RACHEL
                    Isn t that a bit creepy?


      Rachel leads Dr. Miller inside.  This is what he sees: Sara, 
      her unzipped dress, two glasses of champagne.  And Tommy.

                                  TOMMY
                    We haven t met yet.  I m Tom--

      POW!  Dr. Miller PUNCHES him in the face, sending him 
      crashing through the standing mirror.



                                        END ACT FOUR                                                                                    47.


                                          ACT FIVE


      Eddie runs in.  As he stops Dr. Miller from hitting Tommy again --

                                  EDDIE
                    Hey HEY!  That s my frontman!

      CRACK! Dr. Miller s elbow connects with Eddie s nose.  SLO-MO 
      as EDDIE S BLOOD sprays toward SARA S VERA WANG.  Rachel does 
      that John Woo-style action dive, taking the  blood bullet. 

                                  TOMMY
                          (helping Eddie up)
                    Dude??  You okay?  

                                  EDDIE
                    I got this.

                                  TOMMY
                    Nothing to get here, pal.

                                  EDDIE
                          (waves him off; to Dr. Miller)
                    I don t approve the way this went 
                    down either.  Tommy can be a real 
                    pain in the ass.  But he s my best 
                    friend.  If he says they re in love, 
                    then these two belong together. 

                                  TOMMY
                    We re not in love.  

                                  SARA
                    Nothing happened.

                                  EDDIE
                    But I saw you with your hand all 
                    over her Justin Biebers.

                                  RACHEL
                    Cuz he broke it.

                                  DR. MILLER
                    Broke what?

      Sara removes her hand.  Dr. Miller jumps back --

                  DR. MILLER EDDIE
      OH MY LORD!Jesus, Tommy.

                                  TOMMY
                    Think you can plug it?                                                                                    48.


                                  DR. MILLER
                    It s not a tire.  I need to get her 
                    to my office.  Run some X-rays...

      POUNDING ON THE DOOR cranks the stress levels.

                                  BETHENNY (O.S.)
                    I know you re in there Tommy!  The 
                    State Police are on the way!  

      Tommy looks around.  What should be a joyous occasion is a huge 
      mess because of him.  He mans up and turns to Dr. Miller --

                                  TOMMY
                    Way I see it Doc, we can open that 
                    door and tell Bethenny what happened.  
                    Which means the wedding s off.  I m 
                    already on that woman s shit list.  
                    But you re not.

                                  EDDIE
                    Think Toyota had a PR nightmare with 
                    the Prius?  Bethenny won t stop til all 
                    of Seattle knows your funbags may blow. 

                                  DR. MILLER 
                          (convinced; to Rachel)
                    Buy me some time.


      Rachel slips out so Bethenny can t see inside.  But before she 
      can get a word in, Bethenny notices blood on Rachel s blouse.

                                  BETHENNY
                    Is that Sara s blood?!

                                  RACHEL
                    Don t be ridiculous...it s Eddie s.

                                  BETHENNY
                    I knew you were too green to pull 
                    this off.  Something I ll take up 
                    with Rutherford Monday.  But right 
                    now, step aside. 

                                  RACHEL
                    I can t let you go in there.  

                                  BETHENNY
                    How fired do you wanna be on Monday?                                                                                    49.


                                  RACHEL
                    It s your daughter s wedding.  You 
                    may be paying me, but today I work 
                    for Sara.  That gives me the 
                    authority to tell you to BACK OFF.

      Tense beat.  Neither can believe what Rachel just said.

                                  BETHENNY
                          (grabs Rachel s headset)
                    On second thought, why put it off 
                    til Monday? 


      Zoe s bored.  Her Saturday night spent watching two kids and a 
      BOOTLEG GABBA SHOW when INGRID MARCHES PAST.  Then doubles back.

                                  ZOE
                    I said  no.   But your husband 
                    tripled my quote. 

                                  JANIE
                    And I m getting a pony!


      Pressure as Dr. Miller works against the clock examining Sara s 
      breast.  Tommy catches his married friend sneak a peek. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Dude, you made  em cross-eyed again.

                                  DR. MILLER
                    They re organic so there s no 
                    immediate danger.  You should be 
                    able to get through the wedding.  
                    Problem is I need to make a brace.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Like a boob sling?

                                  DR. MILLER
                      Basically.  But I need some wire.

      As everyone scours, EDDIE remembers the GUITAR on his back...


      As Matthew shows up, the groom s concern spikes when he sees 
      the STATE POLICE mediate between Bethenny and Rachel.

                                    MATTHEW
                    What s going on??  Is Sara okay??                                                                                    50.


                                  BETHENNY
                    She s locked in there with Tommy!

                                  INGRID (O.S.)
                    Is Eddie with him?!

      All turn to see INGRID.  The STATE POLICEMEN recognize her.

                                  STATE POLICEMAN
                    Detective Warrick?

                                  INGRID
                    It s Grabowski now.  But after tonight, 
                    I may go back to my maiden name.

                                    MATTHEW
                    Rachel.  I need you to open the door.

      Rachel relents.  Unlocks the door.  Bethenny barges past to see:


      Sara in the doorway looking radiant like nothing s happened.  

                                  SARA
                    Hi Mom.  Ready to walk me down the aisle?

      Bethenny s confused.  Matthew beams.  Rachel relaxes.  Eddie 
      straps on his GUITAR, which is missing it s G-STRING.

                                  EDDIE
                          (re: boob sling)
                    Well that s the first G-string to 
                    be used above the waist.
                          (Tommy doesn t laugh)
                    Did I force it?  Felt like I did.

      Then Eddie follows Tommy s eye line to see INGRID.

                                  EDDIE
                    What was the tell?

                                  INGRID
                    Todd and Matthew are cousins.

                                  TOMMY
                    I put Eddie up to this.  If anyone 
                    deserves blame here, it s me.

                                  INGRID
                    That s like having Tiger Woods vouch 
                    for where you were last night.

      Tommy tried.  Pats Eddie on the back, then heads off.                                                                                      51.


                                  INGRID
                    I feel like I m married to Jason 
                    Bourne!  Why all the phony concert 
                    tickets?  What s next?  Fake passports?  

                                  EDDIE
                    No.  I wouldn t even know where to 
                    find a good forger...

                                  INGRID
                    I just wanted a break.  One night.

                                  EDDIE
                    You re right.  I should ve said 
                      something.  It s just, I wanted to 
                    be the hero.  If we impress this 
                    wedding planner and they keep 
                    booking us?  We can send Janie to 
                    Green Dolphins.
                          (pulls the ace)
                    Maybe even have enough for that dream 
                      kitchen...We re talking Viking.
                          (making peace)
                    Zoe s paid for.  Stay.  You haven t 
                    seen us play since we had kids.

      Eddie smiles.  A beat as they look into each other s eyes.

                                  INGRID
                    It s close to their bedtime.  I 
                    should take the kids home.

      Eddie s face falls.  As he watches her leave, APPLAUSE fades in.


      Tommy on stage at the mic.  Band behind him.  Eddie searches 
      the crowd for Ingrid, hoping she changed her mind.

                                  TOMMY
                    Let s welcome the bride and groom 
                    for the First Dance. 

      As Matthew leads Sara to the dance floor, Rachel prepares the 
      worst.  BARRY lifts a SHEET revealing GOLDFISH inside an AQUARIUM 
      TOM-TOM.  He clacks in Making Love Out of Nothing At All.                                                                                    52.


                                  TOMMY
                    I know just how to fake it / And I 
                    know just how to scheme --

      Tommy sings with a crazy passion.  Guests are into it.  Eddie 
      recognizes his friend s using the song as a personal confession.  

                                  TOMMY
                    I know just when to face the truth, 
                    Then I know just when to dream --

      Sara looks up from Matthew s shoulder.  Locks eyes with Tommy.

                                  TOMMY
                    I know just where to touch you / 
                    And I know just what to prove.  I 
                    know when to pull you closer / And 
                    I know when to let you loose --

      With that, Tommy lets Sara go. 

                                  TOMMY
                    And I know the night is fading / 
                    And I know the time s gonna fly --

      Eddie crosses the stage to be there for his friend Tommy.  

                                  TOMMY
                    But I don t know how to leave you / 
                    And I ll never let you fall / 

      Tommy jumps off the stage to get each table to join in --

                                  TOMMY
                    And I don t know how you do it --

      He holds the mic out to the BRIDESMAIDS TABLE --

                                  HOT BRIDESMAIDS
                    Making love out of nothing at all!

      Then to DR. MILLER S TABLE --

                                  DR. MILLER & CLIENTS
                    Making love out of nothing at all!

      Tommy can t resist surprising Bethenny, who s reluctant --

                                  BETHENNY
                    Making love out of nothing at all... 

      Tommy jumps on stage.  The band kicks Air Supply into 6th gear, 
      which til now was scientifically impossible.  GUESTS RUSH THE 
      DANCE FLOOR.  Fake boobs bounce like it s a superball convention.                                                                                      53.


        A Bridesmaid gets on a guy s shoulders and pumps her fist.  The 
      Band brought their indie spirit to a 5-star country club.

      ON INGRID

      Leaving with Zoe and the kids (in PJs).  As they pass RECEPTION 
      HALL, Janie sees Eddie on stage and runs in the crowd --

                                  JANIE
                    Daddy!!!

      Ingrid huffs then follows.  Zoe and Brahm in tow.  They find 
      Janie at the stage, in time for EDDIE S SOLO.  Seeing her husband 
      in his element reminds Ingrid why she fell in love with him. 

                                  ZOE
                    Your old man kinda rocks..for an old man.

                                  INGRID
                    He sure does...

      She smiles at Eddie, who flicks her his guitar pick.  As Ingrid 
      reaches up, ANOTHER HAND catches it.  It s TODD s.  He lowers 
      his WINDSOR KNOT.  Eddie s stunned Todd s the new Derek. 

      ON RACHEL

      The band s a hit!  She looks around: Sara dances like nothing 
      happened; Matthew  churns the butter  like he knows nothing; Even 
      Dr. Miller pops open champagne in the middle of the dance floor 
      forgetting the potential cork hazard.  Rachel scans for Bethenny 
      assuming she has to be pleased.  Her face drops when she sees --

      STEVIE

      Standing on Bethenny s table.  Thrusting his bass like a sexual 
      snake charmer.  The more Bethenny resists, the more he works it.

      BACK ON STAGE

      Eddie passes the solo torch to Barry, who pounds the skins 
      like a Tazmanian Devil.  And keeps pounding.  And pounding. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Shit.  The nitrous tanks!

      EDDIE sees TWO TANKS at the foot of Barry s DRUMS.  They re 
      rigged to TWO long PYROTECHNIC TUBES.  The kind rock bands 
      use to shoot flames into the air - at OUTDOOR STADIUM SHOWS. 

                                  EDDIE
                    He s gonna blow our shot with Rutherford!                                                                                    54.


      Before they can stop him - KABOOM!  Only instead of flames, 
        HEART-SHAPED CONFETTI rains on the guests.  They love it.

                                  CROWD OF GUESTS
                    Bar-ry!  Bar-ry!  

      ON TOMMY & EDDIE, who can t believe Barry s stolen the show.

                                  EDDIE
                    Think that ll get him laid tonight?

                                  TOMMY
                    Dude, c mon.  It s Barry.  

      They laugh.  As they resume the next verse, WE PULL BACK to a 
      WIDE SHOT.  A sea of wedding guests party their asses off like 
      it s a Black Tie Coachella.



                                        END ACT FIVE                                                                                    55.


                                            ACT SIX


      The aftermath of a kick-ass party: Bra hangs from a chandelier, 
      two ice sculptures made to look like they re humping, Broom 
      Crews sweep confetti and empty bottles.  Clearly things 
      escalated after the First Dance.  Barry talks to a VIDEOGRAPHER.

                                  BARRY
                    Burn me a copy of the wedding DVD.  But 
                    edit out all the Bride and Groom crap.

      Tommy finds Rachel at the bar.  He sips her cocktail and gags.

                                  RACHEL
                    Should ve warned you, I don t drink.  
                    But Bethenny almost got me to start.  
                    To think you almost had to deal with 
                    her the rest of your life.

                                  TOMMY
                    I really dodged a bullet there.

                                  RACHEL
                    I think you mean  cork. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Did you just?...You did.  You made a 
                      spontaneous joke.  Here I thought the 
                    key to weddings was  no surprises.   

                                  RACHEL
                    Hey, take away this 30-pound binder.  
                    I ve got a ribald sense of humor.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Yeah?  Why don t we go somewhere and 
                    not grab a drink?  You can tell me 
                    what  ribald  means.

                                  RACHEL
                    Tommy.  I m getting married.

      She flashes her ring.  Ooph.  Sara and Matthew come over. 

                                    MATTHEW
                    Well we re off to my dad s office.

                                  SARA
                    Seen my mom anywhere?

                                  RACHEL
                          (holds up headset)
                    Would you believe there s been 
                    radio silence for the last hour?                                                                                    56.


      As Sara and Matthew head off, STEVIE ENTERS through the door 
      to the golf course.  His PANTS and SHOES COVERED IN SAND.  

                                  TOMMY
                    What happened?  You fall in a sandtrap?

      Then BETHENNY enters from the fairway.  Talks to Rachel, eyes the 
      band.  Talks more.  Then leaves.  Rachel approaches the guys.

                                  RACHEL
                    She panned the catering.  Didn t tip 
                    the staff.  But she had some good 
                    things to say about you guys.

                                  STEVIE
                          (off the guys  looks)
                    What can I say?  I took one for the team.

                                  BARRY
                    That means you re no longer a pledge.  
                    You re officially a member of the band.   

      Stevie s psyched.  After 26 years, he s a member of a band. 

                                  RACHEL
                    We still need a band for Bill Gates  
                    55th next Saturday.  If you want, I 
                    can float the idea by Rutherford.

      The band got their  big break.   Tommy looks to Eddie.

                                  EDDIE
                    I can t.  I promised Ingrid a make-up 
                    Spa Night Saturday.  2nd rule of Spa 
                    Night.  You don t move Spa Night twice. 

                                  INGRID
                    I ll do Spa Night Friday.  But I wanna  
                    re-do more than just the kitchen.  I got 
                    my eyes set on the bathrooms now.

                                  BARRY
                    Not so fast.  I have a few  riders  
                    I want written into our deal Memo.

                                  RACHEL
                    Riders?

      Barry pulls a LIST from his pocket.  On closer look, the 
      upper corner reads Mrs. Blake - Math Class - 10th Grade.                                                                                      57.

                    It s a standard deal, Barry.  But 
                    how about I throw in a stage hand?


      Stevie s Man Cave is now the BAND CAVE - their hide-out from 
      growing up.  Tommy enters with Eddie, who wears that  Dad 
      Soccer Coach  jersey.  He clearly came from Janie s practice.  

                                  TOMMY
                    Rachel just forwarded the Set List 
                    for the Bill Gates  bash. 

                                  BARRY
                    I want my pain now.  What s he 
                    into?  Neil Diamond?  Manilow?

                                  EDDIE
                    Hip-hop.

      CUE: Opening SPANISH HORN of Black Eyed Peas   MY HUMPS . 


      Stevie s on brass.  Tommy channels Will.I.Am s choreography. 

                                  TOMMY
                    What you gonna do with all that junk?  
                    All that junk inside your trunk?

      Eddie mimics the Fergie butt-shimmy.  But instead of her 
      tight True Religion jeans, he wears Umbro soccer shorts. 

                                  EDDIE
