They are snuggled together, asleep. All is quiet. Then:

'If you build it, he will come.'
Ray's eyes pop open. He looks at Annie, who does not stir.
Without moving, he looks around the room. There is no one
there. Very quietly, he crosses to the window and looks
out. He whispers out toward the cornfield:

breakfast. Ray enters, looking like he had very little
sleep, and promptly turns the TV set off.
KARIN
Why'd you do that? It was funny.
RAY
Trust me, Karin, it's not funny. The
man is sick. He's very sick.
Annie enters, putting on her coat.
ANNIE
Karin, if you're finished, get your coat
and school bag. Let's go.
Karin bolts from the table.
RAY
Uh honey, I'll take her today. I'v-e got

Ray is plugged into some weird-looking contraption, having
his hearing examined. Then the Doctor shines a penlight
into his eyes, shrugs, and starts putting his gear away.
DOCTOR
Well, I can't find anything wrong. I

people hear things all the time. I
heard a voice once. I was still living
with my parents, 'then. They worked in
the circus, so I was raised in the
circus, and I was training to be a
clown. This one day, I'm putting on my

No. It's just that I heard some farmers

Ray is out in the fields again, hard at work. A breeze

He throws his tools down angrily and looks all around, but

All he hears is a faraway echo.
THE VOICE
'If you build it, he will come.'
This is serious. Ray shakes his head and repeats the words
to himself.
RAY
If you build it...
As he thinks about these words,,some unexplained impulse
causes Ray to turn his head deliberately toward a portion
of the cornfield between him and the house.

13 A BASEBALL FIELD L3
For the briefest of moments, the dreamlike image of a
baseball field at night, illuminated by floodlights, flares
in over the lawn. Standing on the edge of the field, is
the figure of a man with his back to us. Before we can see
anything else, the image disappears.

Ray's eyes widen.

The dream image flares in again, this time closer to the

lights, and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind.
He starts to turn slowly towards us, but before we can see
his face, the image disappears.

this shows real personal growth, Ray.
RAY
Thank you.
Annie smiles, but sees that Ray is troubled. She hugs him.

Oh, sweetie. I hope you know that even
though I make jokes, I'm going to visit
you every month wherever they put you.
He offers her a weak smile and exits.

It is dark. For a few seconds it is quiet. Then:

If I did, I'd forgotten it.
Ray sits up in the dark.

I always felt cheated I never got to see
him play. He was supposed to be so
graceful, and agile. So to actually get
to see him play again...to let him play

I'm thirty-eight years old, I have a
wife, a child, and a mortgage, and I'm
scared to death I'm turning into my
father.
ANNIE
What's your father got to do with this?
Ray tries to picture his father in his mind. He speaks
softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of
meaning for him.
RAY
I never forgave him for getting old.
By the time he'was as old as I am now,
he was ancient. He must have had
dreams, but he never did anything about
them. For all I know, he may have even
heard voices, too, but he sure didn't
listen to them. The man never did one
spontaneous thing in all the years I
knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's
what growing up means. I'm afraid of
that happening to me. And something
tells me this may be my last chance to
do something about it.
(looks at her)
I want to build that field. Do you
think I'm crazy?
She looks at him with great understanding.
ANNIE
Yes.
He smiles wanly. She touches his face lovingly.
ANNIE
I also think that if you feel you really
have to do this... then you should do it.
They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when
he has loved her so much. He takes her in his arms.
Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting.

26 THE CORNFIELD - DAY

Stalks of corn wave slowly in the breeze. A bee buzzes
near one. The light is yellow. Suddenly, the stalks bend
violently to the ground as Ray's tractor plows them under.
27 ON THE TRACTOR 27
Ray drives, Karin rides shotgun, holding the large detailed
diagram Ray has drawn of the ballpark's dimensions.
RAY
Ty Cobb called him the greatest left
fielder of all time. His glove was
called 'the place where triples go to
die.'
28 HIGH ANGLE 28
The tractor turns to plow under more corn, and we can see
the size of the area Ray has staked off with marker sticks.
KARIN (V.0.)
Could he hit?
RAY (V.O.)
Lifetime 356 average. Third highest
in history.
Karin whistles.
29 ANOTHER ANGLE 29
By the side of the road, an old man and woman stand and
watch these neighbors-plow under their. corn. They look at
each other as if to say "Could it be Communists?"
KARIN (V.0.)
Why'd they called him Shoeless Joe?
30 SEEDING THE FIELD - DAY 30
It is days later, an area the size of a baseball field has
been plowed under, and Ray is seeding it.
RAY (V.O.)
When he was still in the minors, he
bought a new pair of spikes and they
hurt his feet. About the sixth inning
he took them off and played the outfield
in just his socks. The other players
kidded him, called him Shoeless Joe, and
the name stuck.

31 WATERING THE GRASS - NIGHT- 31
We can see roughly where the grass has been planted, and
where the dirt will be smoothed out for the base paths.
Ray stands stock-still in the moonlight, water hose in
hand, patiently misting the baby grass, little Karin at his
side.
RAY (V.0.)
Then in 1919, his team, the Chicago
White Sox, threw the World Series.
KARIN (V.0.)
What's 'threw'?
RAY (V.0.)
They lost it on purpose. Gamblers paid
them to.
32 SIDE OF THE ROAD
32
Now, dozens of families stand to watch silent and
dumb-eyed, at what has obviously become a daily spectacle
among the townspeople. Some snap photos.
RAY (V.0.)
Except Shoeless Joe.
33 SMOOTHING OUT THE FIELD - DAY
Ray smooths out the base paths with a large roller, as
Annie and Karin follow behind with rakes. On either side
of the base paths, the infield and outfield grass is
growing.
RAY (V.0.)
Nobody could prove anything one way or
another, but he was the one guy who
probably wasn't in on it.
34
Ray, Annie and Karin wait as the cashier totals up their
load of lumber and hardware.
RAY
I mean if he was supposed to be throwing
it, how do you explain the fact he hit
375 for the series and didn't commit
one error? Huh?
KARIN
I can't.

Twelve hits, including the series' only
home run. And they said he was trying
to lose!
KARIN
It's ridiculous.
CASHIER
That's 855 dollars, sixty-four cents.
From O.S., we hear oooh. Ray turns and notices for the
first time that a crowd of spectators -- employees and
customers -- has been watching him and whispering among
themselves. They look at him as if he had two heads.
Ray turns his attention back to writing a check for his
purchases. He deadpans to Annie:
RAY
We'd better notify Mars to send us more
money.
ANNIE
(EQUALLY DEADPAN)
Remlak won't like that.
RAY
That's his problem. And tell him to
make it in Earth dollars this time.
Ray hands over the check to the open-mouthed cashier.
RAY

Ray and Annie turn and leave with Karin. The farmers
watch, obviously trying hard to figure this one out.

35 BUILDING THE OUTFIELD WALL - DAY 35
Ray hammers the braces that will support the outfield wall.
Karin hands him nails from a bag she wears around her neck.
RAY (V.O.)
There's a famous story about when he

great Shoeless Joe Jackson -- for life.
KARIN
What's suspend?
RAY
They never let him play the game again.
They continue to work in silence.
CUT TO
Ray writes a check for his purchases: bats, balls, bases
pitcher's rubber, home plate, etc. He appears slightly
annoyed that once again, he is being stared at by all the
uniformed employees of the store. He turns to catch the
Store Owner staring at him the most intently.
RAY
What. What!
STORE OWNER
You're the fella that plowed under your
corn and built a baseball diamond,
right?
RAY
Yeah. What about it?
STORE OWNER

Greatest damn thing I ever heard.
The other employees beam their agreement.
RAY
At these prices, I'm not surprised.

38 THE LIGHT STANDARD - NIGHT 38
Atop the aluminum-painted poles, an array of store-bought
floodlights switch on, flaring against the blue-black sky.
In this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green,
cool as mint, soft as a cashmere blanket. Annie and Karin
watch as Ray puts down the clean white bases, which pick
up the light like little moons on a cold, clear night.
RAY
My father said he saw him years later
playing under a made-up name in some
tenth-rate league in Carolina. He'd put
on fifty pounds, and the spring was gone
from his step, but he could still hit.
Dad used to say no one could hit like
Shoeless Joe.
Ray is smiling wistfully.
ANNIE
That's the first time I've ever seen you
smile as you mentioned your father.
Ray considers that.
KARIN
How come?
ANNIE
Come on, you. Bed time.
Annie hoists Karin on her shoulders with a grunt, and the
three climb their way down the bleachers. Ray's hand
steadies Annie as she takes one of the steps.

floodlights over the field.

Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while
Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice. (Three,
including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in
the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats.)
The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the
sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five
years to the game they love.
Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder.
RAY
Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the
pitcher gets the sign and starts to
pitch. A good left fielder knows what
pitch is coming, and he can tell from
the.angle of the bat where the ball's
going to be hit.
At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes
five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches
up, and the ball smacks into his glove.

The se-called novels of Terence Mann
endorse promiscuity, godlessness, the
mongrelization of races, and disrespect
to high-ranking officers of the United
States Army. And that's why right-

ANNIE
(VERY REASONABLY)
Excuse me, madam, but you're speaking
of something about which you don't know
squat. Terence Mann was a warm and
gentle voice of.reason during a time of
great madness. He coined the phrase
'Make Love, Not War.' When others were
chanting 'Burn, baby, burn,' he was
writing about love, and peace, and
understanding. He helped define an era.
And a generation. And he helped us
laugh at ourselves. I cherished every
one of his books, and I dearly wish he'd
write more. And if you had experienced
even a little bit of the Sixties, you
might feel the same way, too.

IRATE MOTHER
I experienced the sixties.
ANNIE
No. I think you had two Fifties, and
moved right on to the Seventies.
IRATE MOTHER
Oh yeah? Well your husband plowed under
his corn and built a baseball field!
The crowd "oohs" and "aahs."
ANNIE
Now there's an intelligent response.
IRATE MOTHER
The weirdo.
Ray is so excited at his revelation that he really wants
to leave immediately. He tugs Annie's sleeve.
RAY
Annie...
But Annie mistakes her husband's intentions. She thinks
he is cautioning her not to get embroiled in trouble.
ANNIE
(TO RAY)
It's okay, I'll be cool.
(aloud, to the
PARENT)
At least he's not a book burner, you
Nazi cow!
Now the crowd erupts.
IRATE PARENT
You're both a bunch of weirdos!
Annie pulls herself up to her full 5'4" and thrusts an
angry finger at. the woman.
ANNIE
All right Beulah, you wanna step
outside?!? Huh?
The other woman takes a half-step backward. No one has
ever seen sweet Annie like this.
ANNIE
I got a better idea. Let's put it to
a vote. Come on! Who's for Eva Braun

here? Who wants to burn books? Who
wants to piss on the Constitution of the
United Sates? Anybody?
The majority who had sided with the book-banner wants to
vote for censorship, but under these terms just can't raise
their arms. Little Annie is on a roll, now.
ANNIE
All right. Now: who's for The Bill of
Rights? Come on...who thinks freedom's
a pretty good thing? Let's see those
hands.
Some people start raising their hands.
ANNIE
Who thinks we have to stand up to the
kind of censorship they have in Russia?
Reluctantly, just about everyone raises their hands. Annie
is thrilled.
ANNIE
There you go. All right, America! I'm
proud of you. I mean it. You're
beautiful!
RAY
(RISING)
Annie, we gotta go.
ANNIE
(to the crowd)
We gotta go.
Ray pulls her from the room. Each is proud as hell, each
for a different reason.
A montage of Ray at the library: checking indices, reading
old magazines, finding newspaper interviews on microfilm,
s couring old anthologies, and taking copious notes.
Some of the articles include: "Where is Terence Mann Now
That We Really Need Him?". ."20 Rumors About America's
Greatest Living Ex-Writer" ... and , "Terence Mann: Still
Ignoring Us After All These Years ". The photographs show
Mann to be a large black man with gentle eyes.
RAY (V.O.)
Annie, it's incredible.

Annie drives as Ray excitedly consults his notes.
RAY
Okay. The last interview-he ever gave
was in 1973. Guess what it's about.
ANNIE
Mmm. Some kind of team sport?
RAY
Annie, he was a baseball fanatic!
Listen to this:
He finds a page and reads from it:
RAY
'As a child, my earliest recurring dream
was to play at Ebbets Field with Jackie
Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers. Of
course, it never happened, and the
Dodgers left Brooklyn, and they torn
down Ebbets Field. But even now, I
still dream that dream.'

Ray, this is nuttier than building the

RAY
No it's not. It's pretty weird, I grant
you, but building the field was weirder.
Five, ten percent weirder.
ANNIE
I'm sorry, pal, but I have to nip this
one in the bud. We are having moderate
to heavy financial difficulties here.
You cannot take off for Boston while
you're going broke in Iowa.
RAY
Annie, this is really new territory for
both of us, I know, but we're dealing
with primal forces of nature, here.
When primal forces of nature tell you
to do something, the prudent thing is
not to quibble over details and ---
ANNIE
(starting to get
PISSED)
But why do you have to go? Why can't
the voice send someone else? What's
wrong with Shirley MacLaine, she too
busy? What does this have to do with
you???
Ray hears her anger and sits her down.
RAY
That's what I need to find out.
ANNIE
Ray, we're behind on the mortgage. That
field ate up our savings. We could lose
the farm.
RAY
I won't even stay in motels. I'll sleep
in the car, and I'll beg for food.
ANNIE
No. This is too much.- I understand
your need to prove to the world you're

done it! You believed in the magic, and
it came true. Isn't that enough?

RAY
Annie, it's more than that. I know this-
is nuts, but there's another reason I'm
supposed to do it. I feel it. I feel
it as strongly as I've ever felt
anything in my life. There's a reason.
ANNIE
What. Just tell me what it is.
RAY
I think something's going to happen at
the game. I don't know what,
but...there's something at Fenway Park
in Boston, and I have to be there with
Terence Mann to find it.
Something he just said changes Annie's mood.
ANNIE
Fenway Park... Is that the one with the
big green wall in left field?
RAY
Yeah.
ANNIE
I dreamt last night you were at Fenway.
RAY
Uh, was I sitting on the first base
side?
ANNIE
Yes...
RAY

Ray is throwing clothes into a suitcase as fast as he can.
Annie reads from a road map she has marked for him.
ANNIE
.you take that to 93, and then it gets
all squiggly, and after that you're on
your own. How are you going to find
him, anyway? He won't exactly be in the
phone book, you know.
RAY
The article says he has a storefront on
Harvard Street next to some place that
sells Kosher food. Shouldn't be too
hard to find. I don't need a tie, do
I?
ANNIE
No, dear. Not for a kidnapping.
He rehearses as he drives.

Good.
78 HARVARD STREET - BROOKLINE - DAY 78
Ray drives slowly, looking for a store that sells Kosher
food. But in this old newish neighborhood, there are
dozens: butcher shops, delis, bakeries, groceries.
50
Ray is asking the spritely Jewish Butcher for directions.
RAY
He lives right around here. Do you know
him? I'm a friend of his.
The Butcher just stares back, with suspicion.
RAY
He's sort of a tall, black man.
BUTCHER
If you was much of a friend, he'd of
give you the directions himself.
Ray nods. He knows this is useless.
RAY
That's a good point. Thank you.
Ray exits.
CUT TO
80 ON THE STREET 80
Ray has stopped an Ancient Jewish Woman on the street. She
looks from Ray's Iowa license plate to Ray's face.
ANCIENT WOMAN
I don't know where he lives.
But by her raised eyebrows and the tone of her voice, it
is clear that if she did know -- which she probably does
-- she certainly wouldn't tell him.
CUT TO
81 GAS STATION 81
Ray has pulled his car to the edge of the gas station --
he is not buying gas -- and slips a five dollar bill to the
ruddy-faced, teenaged Irish Pump Jockey.
PUMP JOCKEY
Two blocks down. Right hand side.
First store that don't have a chicken

It is hardly fashionable, but it's roomy and comfortable.
There are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and
a postage scale. A few workbenches have software and
spread sheets strewn across them. In the back are a couple
of personal computers.
On a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos
in cheap frames: pictures of Mann with Martin Luther
King...with Bob Dylan...with Timothy Leary...rann being
arrested at some demonstration.. .Mann at Woodstock...
Mann's gruff voice pulls Ray's attention away from these
relics.
MANN
Your minute ain't getting bigger.
RAY
Okay. I understand your desire for
privacy, and i wouldn't dream of
intruding if this weren't extremely
important.

MANN
Oh my God.
RAY
What.
MANN
You're from the Sixties!
RAY
Well, actually ---
MANN
Out! Out!
RAY
Just wait a second ---
Mann picks up an old-fashioned bug sprayer -- the kind with
a long arm that pumps in and out -- and starts spraying it
at Ray as if he were an unwanted insect.
MANN
Back to the Sixties! Back!
He is backing Ray out the door.
RAY
If you'd just ---
MANN
There's no place for you here in the

He gets Ray just past the door and slams it shut.
Ray slams it open. He's pissed.

Mann stops fuming and considers that. He sighs, sadly.
MANN
Yes. I suppose I have. How's this?
(smiles and makes
the peace sign)
'Peace, love, dope.'
(ROARS)
Now get the fuck out of here!!!
And he slams the door shut again. Ray is flabbergasted.
He is thinking furiously. Then he notices that in slamming
the door, the latch has not locked in place. He thinks,
makes up his mind, and quietly opens the door.
Mann has returned to work, his back to the door.
Ray enters the loft, his left hand in his jacket pocket.
When he is halfway across the loft, he clears his throat.
Mann spins around.
MANN
Now you've pissed me off.
RAY
Okay, hold it right there.
He juts his pocketed hand forward, as if he had a gun in
his jacket.
RAY
I was hoping I wouldn't have to do it
this way...
MANN
What the fuck is that?
RAY
It's a gun. What'd you think it is?
MANN
It's your finger.
RAY
No it's not. It's a gun.

Mann has found a crowbar among his tools, and is advancing
toward Ray.
MANN
I'm going to beat you with a crowbar
till you go away.
Understandably, this makes Ray nervous.
RAY
Whoa! Wait! You can't do that.
MANN
(STILL ADVANCING)
What, are there rules? There's no
rules.
Mann is almost to him, now, the crowbar raised above his
head.
RAY
You're a pacifist!
Mann stops. He thinks. He lowers the crowbar.
MANN
Shit.
Ray breathes a sigh of relief.
RAY
Thank you.
MANN
All right, are you kidnapping me?
What's the deal here?
RAY
I'm sorry. I was hoping I could-just
convince you to come with me.

Tonight's game. Red.Sox, Twins.
MANN
Why?
RAY
Something will happen there. I don't
know what, but we'll find out when it
does.
Mann now has no idea what to make of all this, so he just
looks Ray over for a few seconds.
RAY
My name is Ray Kinsella. You used my
father's name for a character in one of
your stories. John Kinsella.
MANN
You're seeing a team of psychiatrists,
aren't you?
RAY
(LAUGHS)
I don't blame you for thinking that, but
no, I'm not. I swear to God I'm the
least crazy person I've ever known.
MANN
Then why are you kidnapping me to a
baseball game?
RAY
I read an interview you gave a long time
ago about how you always dreamed of
playing at Ebbets Field, and how sad you
felt when they tore it down.
MANN
(shakes head no)
I never said that.
RAY
You didn't?

Mann picks up a hat,

door.

86 CITY STREETS

Mann sits tensely beside Ray, who drives with his right
hand, while his left hand remains in his pocket,
substituting for a gun.
MANN
You do this often?
RAY
No. It's my first time. So be gentle.
Ray laughs nervously, and is embarrassed to see Mann not
sharing the humor.
RAY
You used to have a sense of humor.
MANN
Things used to be funny.
Ray pulls up at an intersection. He has to choose between
left and right. Behind him, cars are honking. Ray doesn't
have a clue which way to go. He sighs.
RAY
I'm sorry. This is really humiliating.
Which way is-Eenway?
Mann shakes his head, then tilts it to the left.
RAY
Thank you.

Ray makes the turn, and heads off down the street.

Ray grins sheepishly and nods. Mann laughs.

I mean you're like a total bumbler.
Ray chuckles his reluctant acceptance of the truth.
MANN
'Bozo the Kidnapper.
RAY
(no longer so
AMUSED)
Okay, okay...
After a few moments, Ray decidesto break the ice.
RAY
Can I ask you a question? Something
I've always wanted to know.
Mann nods. He's been asked this question a million times.
MANN
No, I never slept with her.
RAY
You never slept with who?
MANN
Whoever you were going to ask me about.
If I'd been with one-tenth the famous
women they said I was with, I'd be in

Ray knows now to shut up. He returns his attention to his

something that causes his eyes to widen in horror.
87 REAR-VIEW MIRROR
87
A Boston police car on his tail, red lights flashing.
RAY (O.S.)
Oh no.
Mann looks behind him, sees the police car, and turns back
to Ray. Ray wears a look of resignation as he pulls the
car over to the side of the road, and shuts off the
ignition. Mann just looks at him, and starts to chuckle.
MANN
Nice going, Boze.
RAY
Okay. I don't really have a gun. So
don't say anything to this guy, okay?
I swear to God there's a reason we're
supposed to be at this game.
Mann gives him a "Give me a break" look.
Ray sees the Policeman is getting out of his cruiser and
walking towards them. Ray is desperate.
RAY
If I get arrested, the press'll be all
over you, you'll have to appear in open
court, you'll be the lead story on
Entertainment Tonight, and your
picture'll be on the front page of every
tabloid in America.
The Policeman knocks on Ray's window. He is young,
fresh-scrubbed and earnest. Ray holds up one hand to him.
RAY
Just a second.
(-CO MANN)
'Terence-Mann Kidnapped... Also seen in
UFO with Elvis.'
Mann's eyes narrow. The cop knocks again, more
insistently. Ray rolls down-the window."

POLICEMAN
License and registration.
Nervously, Ray complies. Mann turns his face toward the
passenger side window. Ray's mouth dries up. He has no
idea what Mann will do.
The Policeman scrutinizes the license, turns it over to
look for convictions, and checks Ray's face against the
felonlike photo. Then he looks at Mann.
POLICEMAN
And what's your name,-sir?
Mann keeps his face averted.
MANN
Terry.
POLICEMAN
Where is it that you and Raymond are
going, Terry?
RAY
Fenway Park! We're going to the ball
game.

Actually, Officer, I'm being kidnapped.
Discreetly, under his breath, Ray sings the "Entertainment

RAY
'Entertainment Tonight,

Mann winces. The officer looks at him questioningly.
MANN,
What I mean by that is, I don't care

I envy you your craziness, Ray. It's
been years since I did something
completely crazy.
RAY
Well, you want to hear something really
crazy?
MANN
Do I have a choice?
RAY
Nope. I live on a farm in Iowa. One
day, out in the cornfield, I heard a
voice...
They walk through the indoor portion of the grandstand
toward their section.
RAY
So what do you do with yourself these
days?

I take walks. I watch sunsets.

miserable that I'm not involved anymore.
Well, I've got news for you: I spent all
my misery years ago. I have no more
pain for any of you. I gave at the
office.
They approach the refreshment stand.
RAY
So...what do you want?

I want them to stop looking to me for
answers. Begging me to speak again,
write again, be a leader. I want them
to start thinking for themselves. And
I want my privacy!
Ray looks slightly embarrassed.
RAY
No, I meant what do you want from...
Ray points to the hot dog vendor, as they have reached the
front of the line.
MANN
Oh.

HIMSELF)
A dog and a beer.
RAY

Okay, I agree, you should be entitled
to as much privacy as you wane. But why
stop writing?

Ray and Mann emerge into the sunlight and walk down the
aisle toward the field.
RAY
God, this place is so beautiful.
The grass is so green you can almost smell it. Looking
around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or
thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice;
a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage
as one player hits to several others in the field. A few
sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts.
Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red
Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk.
RAY
It could be 1912 out there, for all this
place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on
that very mound as a pitcher long before
anyone knew he could hit home runs.
Same mound.
MANN
Why are we here, Ray?
RAY
Something.. about the game.
CUT TO
93 THE GAME - NIGHT
93
The game is in progress. Ray and Mann are in their fifth
row seats. They do not speak.
At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that
something is about to happen. He looks at Mann who is just
watching the game. Then he looks at the scoreboard.
94 THE SCOREBOARD 94
Fenway Park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes
pictures of the batter and pitcher, and can show instant
replays of some of the action.

65
94 CONTINUED
94
Right now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing
message. The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the
crowd fade out.
There is only the message:
ARCHIBALD "MOONLIGHT" GRAHAM
Chisholm, Minn.
New York Giants
LIFETIME STATISTICS:
1 Game, 0 At Bats
The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks
almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike
anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard.
95 RAY AND MANN
95
Ray looks around him. The sounds of the game return, and
from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he
realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens
his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this,
but cannot see what Ray is writing.
Then Ray hears The Voice.
THE VOICE
'Go the distance.'
RAY
Oh my God.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

attitude.
MANN
Then let's go.
Mann rises and heads up the aisle. Ray looks down at the
program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham,
who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get
to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark.

RAY

I've taken up too much of your time.

You'll think I'm crazy.
MANN
I already think you're crazy. What did
it say?
After a little thought, Ray smiles sadly.
RAY
It said 'The man's done enough. Leave
him alone.'
Ray puts the car in gear, makes a wide turn, and starts to
head back up the street. But he stops short when Mann's
form looks out of the darkness into the glare of the
headlights..
Ray does not know why Mann is blocking his path. Or why
he appears tense, almost frightened.
MANN
'Moonlight' Graham.
Ray's jaw drops.
RAY
You saw it.
MANN
Saw what?
RAY
New York Giants, 1922. He played one
game, never got to bat.
Mann looks spectrial in the high-contrast glare on the
headlights.

Mann glances at Ray, then looks away.

The two men look happy as kids with bats over shoulders,
gloves dangling, on their way to a sandlot.

102 ON THE ROAD - MINNESOTA

They are north of Duluth,andthelandscape hasgrown
harsher, the trees shorterandmore gnarled, thegrass
tougher and wirier.
After Virginia, Minnesota, all the land is scarred. Above
the town the mines sit like sand-colored bunkers in the
cliffs,- stern and silent.
Near Chisholm, the land is getting ever weirder. It looks
like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs. It has
been split and gutted; greenery has grown back, but at
weird and unnatural angles.
But as they swing into town; the highway divides and they
cross a beautiful and tranquil lake, so smooth and shiny
it might be a scene painted on a glass plate. A sign reads
WELCOME TO CHISHOLM.

Ray and Mann are talking with the paper's publisher, Veda

innocent smile, and eyeglasses hanging from a fine chain
around her neck.
MANN
We're trying to find an ex-baseball
player named Archibald Graham.
VEDA
You mean 'Doc' Graham.
RAY
No, I think his nickname was
'Moonlight.'
VEDA
Yes, that's Doctor Graham.
MANN
Doctor Graham.
This is interesting news to Ray and Mann.
VEDA
His baseball career never amounted to
much, so he went back to school. His
father was a doctor.

Do you know where we can find him?

It's nothing bad. We're not from the

106 NEWSPAPER BACK ROOM 106
Ray and Mann sit at a table in the newspaper's back room,
the "morgue" file on Doc Graham -- a collection of
clippings, pictures, and the obituary -- strewn before
them.
Right now, their attention is on Veda, who has put her
glasses on, and is reading from an editorial.
VEDA
.'And there were times when children
could not afford eyeglasses or milk, or
clothing. Yet no child was ever denied
these essentials, because in the
background, there was always Doctor
Graham. Without any fanfare or
publicity, the glasses or the milk or
the ticket to the ball game found their
way into the child's pocket.'
MANN
You wrote that.
VEDA
The day he died.
MANN
You're a good writer.
The compliment is just right, and she smiles warmly.
VEDA
Excuse me.
She exits. Mann spreads out the clippings and shakes his
head.
MANN
Something's missing.
Ray is looking at a photo of Doc Graham as a man in his
late sixties.

Half the towns in North America has a

Two old Codgers on a park bench.
FIRST CODGER
Oh, that man had an arm on him. One day
over at the ballpark, he said 'Lemme see
that ball', and one of the boys threw
him the ball, and he walked over behind
home plate, reared back, and fired that
ball over the left field fence.
SECOND CODGER
And he was at least fifty years old when
he did it.
FIRST CODGER
It was still rising when it disappeared.

And I know that wasn't the only time he
did something like that.
109 COUNTRY KITCHEN RESTAURANT - DAY 109
Several tables have been pushed together, and Mann sits
surrounded by townspeople, mostly men past retirement age.
BALDING MAN
He didn't smoke or drink, .but he used
to chew up paper and spit it out
wherever he went. If you were around
Doc very long, you learned to duck.
MOUSTACHED MAN
He'd even chew up his prescription
slips, so sometimes we'd have to dig
into our pockets for a piece of paper
so Doc could write us prescriptions.
WHITE-HAIRED MAN
He always wore a black overcoat, even
in the summer, and it was always
flapping open, even in the winter and
it was fifty below. And he had white
hair, like me, and he always carried an
umbrella.
SMOKER
'Cept he was always, I mean always,
losing them. Stores 'round town would
just lean his umbrella somewhere near
the door, and if anybody asked, they'd
just say 'Oh, that's Doc's umbrella'.
MANN
What was the umbrella for?
WHITE-HAIRED MAN
Oh, I think it got to be a habit,
something to hang onto. But if you'd
ask him, he'd say it was to beat away
all his lady admirers.
This, as much as the other remembrances, brings warm
chuckles to the old men.

The woman Manager of the motel is having a'cup of coffee
with Ray.
MOTEL MANAGER
You know, everybody's talking about you
two. Our neighbors came over last night
and we just told Doc'Graham stories
until after midnight. I even wrote some
of them down.
She takes out a piece of paper.
RAY
That's very nice of you.
MOTEL MANAGER
Well, it's funny. It's like all these
memories we have of Doc had gone to
sleep and sunk way down inside us. But
once you started asking about him, and
started us talking about him, why they
swum back up to the surface again.
Ray smiles.

Suddenly, Ray straightens with a start.
RAY
Oh, My God.
Ray hurries over to Mann, offering the opened newspaper,
and points out an article to Mann. It is headlined:
TERENCE MANN MISSING.
MANN
Damn.
(READS)
'His son, who lives in New York City,
notified police after receiving no
answer to repeated telephone calls...'
Shit. I'd better call him.
He pulls the phone onto the bed and dials
MANN
What the hell do I tell him.
RAY
You want me to...?
He motions outside with his head.
MANN
Thanks.
Ray exits.
CUT TO
They enter the hallway of the old school, the smell of
varnish and chalk almost palpable.
DOC GRAHAM
It was the last day of the season.
Bottom of the eighth, and we were way
ahead. I'd been up with the club for
most of a month, but hadn't seen any
action. Just then old John McGraw
points a bony finger at me and says
'Right field.' Well sir, I jumped up
like I was sitting on a spring, grabbed
my glove, and ran out onto the field.
They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and
enter. Doc Graham's office.
Doc seats himself behind a cluttered desk, and motions Ray
to the black-leather sofa a few feet away.
RAY
Did you get to make a play?
Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an
inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins
chewing.

DOC GRAHAM
Nope. They never hit the ball out of
the infield.
Ray chuckles, but then flinches as Doc shoots his little
spitball towards him.
DOC GRAHAM
Heads up.
It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray, and hangs
there, like a white fly.
RAY
I was warned about you.
DOC GRAHAM
Anyway, one inning later the game was
over, and so was I.
RAY
And what was that like?
DOC GRAHAM
It was like coming this close to your
dreams, and then watching them brush
past you like a stranger in a crowd.
Ray nods, and a look of understanding begins to appear on
his face. He looks out the window, focused on faraway.
DOC GRAHAM
Except, at the time, you don't think
much of it. Hardly anybody recognizes
the most significant moment of their
life when they're happening. Back then
I just figured there'd be plenty more
days. I didn't know that would be the
only one.
Doc Graham notices that Ray is looking very serious.
DOC GRAHAM
Now, let me ask you a question, Ray
Kinsella. What makes that half-inning
so interesting that you come all the way
from Iowa to ask me about it sixty-five
years later?
Ray chooses his words carefully.
CONTINUED
81
124 CONTINUED (2) 124
RAY
I didn't really know till just now. But
I think it's to ask you if you could do
anything you wanted to...if you could
have a wish...
DOC GRAHAM
Ahh...
Doc nods. his understanding. He smiles wryly, takes a new
piece of paper, and bites off a little section.
DOC GRAHAM
And are you the kind of man who could
grant me that wish?
RAY
I don't know. I'm just asking...
Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead
thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that
could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the
Polo Grounds in New York.
DOC GRAHAM
I never got to bat in the major leagues.
I'd have liked the chance -- just once
-- to stare down a big league pitcher.
Stare him down and then just as he goes
into the windup -- wink! Make him
wonder if I know something he doesn't.
That's what I wish for. The chance to
squint my eyes when the sky is so blue
it hurts to look at it, and to feel the
'tingle that runs up your arms when you
connect dead-on. The chance to run the
bases, stretch a double to a triple, and
flop race-first into third, wrapping my
arm around the bag. That's my wish, Ray
Kinsella... that's my wish.
Ray begins to smile. Graham is staring intently at him.
DOC GRAHAM
Is there enough magic floating around
in the night out there for you to make
that wish come true?
RAY
What would you do if I said 'Yes'?
DOC GRAHAM
I think I might actually believe you.

124 CONTINUED (3)
RAY
There is a place where things like that
happen. And if you want to go there,
I can take you.
Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed
smile as he wipes away a tear.
DOC GRAHAM
If it means leaving Chisholm...
He shakes his head.no. Ray is surprised.
RAY
I understand, but I think you're
supposed to come with us.
DOC GRAHAM
This is my most special place in the
world, Ray. Once a place touches you
like this, the wind never blows so cold
again. You feel for it like it was your
child. I can't leave here.
Ray cannot believe the man won't leave Chisholm for his
dream.
RAY
But your wish...
DOC GRAHAM
It'll stay one. I was born here, lived
here, and I'll die here. That's okay.
I'll have no regrets.
RAY
But sixty-five years ago -- for five
minutes -- you came this close.
(holds up two
FINGERS)
It would kill some men to get that close
to their dream and never touch it.
They'd consider it a tragedy.
DOC GRAHAM
Son...if I'd only gotten to be a doctor
for five minutes. .now that would have
been a tragedy.
Those words fill up the room, and Ray sinks back against
the couch.

It is later that same night, and Ray has been recounting
his experience with Doc Graham to Mann, who appears quietly
troubled.
RAY
And then I figured maybe we're not
supposed to take him with us. So now
I don't know why the hell we were
supposed to come here.
MANN
Maybe it was to find out if one inning
can change the world.
RAY
Did it?
MANN
It did for these people. If he'd gotten
a hit, he might've stayed there.

TEENAGER
Well, if it's okay with you, I'll ride

Ray and Mann exchange brief smiles.
TEENAGER
I'm looking for a place to play, and I
heard that all through the Midwest,
towns have teams, and in some places
they'll find you a day job so you can
play ball nights and weekends.

This is your lucky day, kid. We're
going someplace kind of like that.

Maybe we can give it to him.
RAY
Funny, the way he described towns,
finding you a job so you can play on
their team...they haven't done that for
years. My Dad did that for a while.
But that was in the Twenties.
MANN
What happened to your father?
RAY
He never made it as ball player, so he
tried to get his son to make it for him.
By the time I was ten, playing baseball
got to be like eating vegetables or
taking out the garbage, so when I was
fourteen, I started to refuse. Can you
believe that? An American boy refusing
to have a catch with his father.
MANN
Why at fourteen?
RAY
That's when I read The Boat Rocker, by
Terence Mann.
MANN
Oh God.
RAY

funeral.

from escaping to the roadway.
He eases the car to a stop in front of the house, and as
the three men unfold themselves from the car, Karin bolts
from the back door of the house, a blur of white blouse and
pink pedal pushers. She flings herself into Ray's arms,
