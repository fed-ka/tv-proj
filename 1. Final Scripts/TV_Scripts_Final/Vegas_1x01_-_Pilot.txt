                                    TEASER

      EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT - DAY

      The sun is a ball of fire in the Western sky. At the crest of 
      a hill, a lone man sits on his horse.

      RALPH LAMB. 32. Deep set eyes. A handsome loner. Quiet and 
      still. 4th generation Nevada rancher. This land is his home. 
      A place where he's at peace. But right now, he's on edge. He 
      gazes down the canyon, where we hear HOOTS and HOLLERS --

      THREE HUNDRED HEAD OF ANGUS driving across the mesa. Expertly 
      shepherded by Lamb's brothers. DIXON and FRANK. The Lambs and 
      their dogs guide the surging herd of beef toward a corral on 
      the horizon. It's sweaty, dusty work, each bull weighs at 
      least a ton and they are not all cooperative.

      Frank (28, middle-child diplomat, even-keeled) SPURS his 
      horse, EDGING a long horn back in line. But TWO OTHER BULLS 
      BOLT into the open.

                                    FRANK
                    Dix!

      Dixon (24, reckless) races his mare after the breakaway 
      bulls. The snorting bulls feel him closing in and suddenly 
      CUT right-- Dixon YANKS the reins hard to avoid colliding 
      with some other beef. His horse SKIDS to a stop. Dixon goes 
        AIRBORNE...

      ... and CRASHES hard on the dirt. As he gets up, one of their  
      dogs runs up to him. Dixon limps a bit as he stands and 
      watches the two stray bulls head into a canyon. Then his eyes 
      find --

      LAMB. On his horse. Barrelling down into the canyon at full 
      speed. The dog looks to Dixon.

                                    DIXON
                      I ain't stopping you.

      The dog turns and digs in, racing toward --

      THE CANYON, helping to box in the runaway bulls.

      ON LAMB: At a full gallop over rough terrain.

      ON THE BULLS: Nostrils flared, veins pulsing. Wild eyes. 

      Lamb closes in. His mare rising to the challenge. Lamb GRIPS 
      his rope. SWINGS it...                                                                                      2.


      ... and LASSOS the lead Bull, a longhorn. It THRASHES wildly, 
      but Lamb holds on, rodeo-style, leaping from the horse, 
      gloved hands CLUTCHING THE GREAT HORNS AND BRINGING THE BEAST 
      INTO SUBMISSION. The dog comes back with the second Bull and 
      we --

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      The Lambs are moving the herd the last quarter mile into 
      their corral. An ease settles in. We see a small Ranch house 
      and barn just beyond. From horseback, Frank surveys the herd.

                                    FRANK
                      When'rethe trucks coming?

                                    DIXON
                    Five thirty tomorrow. Six carriers 
                    out of Reno.

      Lamb pulls up on his mare, watching the Angus. He senses 
        something's wrong -- he notices the lead bulls' ears PRICK. 
      The other bulls get JITTERY. Dixon notices it too --

                                    FRANK
                    'The hell's going on?

      A LOW RUMBLE emanates from behind the mountains. Like a storm 
        approaching. It gets LOUDER. LAMB LOOKS to the sky, the SOUND 
      coming closer... Dixon looks to Lamb.

                                    DIXON
                    No, Dammit!

      The whole landscape SHAKES. A terrifying ROAR.

      THE HERD OF BULLS SPOOK AND BOLT loose, tearing off in all 
      directions back into the flatland as --

        A DC-6AIRLINER ROCKETS overhead, low, screaming, wheels 
      down, coming in for landing somewhere beyond the ridge.

      HOLD ON LAMB. He watches the herd scatter and DASH to 
      freedom. All the hard work gone. His expression DARKENS. He 
      SWINGS his horse around.

                                    FRANK
                    Ralph --

      And GALLOPS off in the direction of the landing jet plane.                                                                                      3.


                                    DIXON
                    Let him go. We're losing time. We 
                    gotta try to get them in before 
                      nightfall.

      EXT. MCCARRENFIELD - LAS VEGAS - DAY

      A dusty desert airstrip. The welcoming BAND OOM-PAHSa tune. 
      Passengers -- men in suits and hats and women in heels, 
      jewels and furs -- stream out of the DC-6from Chicago.

      An immaculately dressed man steps out. JOHNNY SAVINO (35). 
      Unlike the rest of the awe-struck tourists, Savino moves like 
      he owns the place. A dangerous mix of confidence and menace. 
      Savino looks past the airport, to --

      The Las Vegas skyline, circa 1960.

      A city bursts out of the desert. A rapid expansion -- hotels 
      and casinos push out at all sides, the city transforming into 
      the gleaming, twinkling jewel we know today.

      RESUME SAVINO

      A man eyeing his destiny. A beat, then descends the stairs, 
      passing...

      A BAGGAGE HANDLER

      Unloading luggage. The Handler stares at the horizon --

      HIS POV

      A CLOUD OF DUST rises from the desert. Barely visible, a 
      single horseman galloping at full speed.

      EXT. MCCARRENFIELD - LAS VEGAS - DAY - A MOMENT LATER

      An AIRPORT SECURITY Mechanic shifts his weight on the tarmac. 
      Hating his job right now. Sweat DRIPS down his face. And not 
      because it's hot --

      LAMB

      On horseback, approaches on the tarmac, sitting tall in his 
      saddle. His expression tight. The Mechanic steps out to stop 
      him.

                                    SECURITY MECHANIC
                      Ralph, I need to ask you --

      Lamb rides past him.  The hooves CLOMPon the runway...

      -- Past the silver DC-6...                                                                                      4.


      -- Past the PILOTS and STEWARDESSES, awed by the twelve feet 
      of man and horse passing them...

      -- Past the gaping TOURISTS who stare in amazement -- this is 
      the first time some of them have ever seen a cowboy.

      Lamb continues over to the baggage area, where...

      ... DON BLANCHFORD, the Terminal Manager (45, well-fed 
        bureaucrat) stands filling out time cards. Next to him, three 
      MECHANICS.

      Lamb dismounts and walks over to Blanchford.

                                    LAMB
                    You gave me your word.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                      I told you I'd do my best.

      Lamb gestures to the DC-6outside.

                                    LAMB
                    That plane just scattered my herd 
                      across eighteen hundred acres of 
                      Federal grazing.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                    And what am I supposed to do about 
                    that, Ralph?

                                    LAMB
                    You can pay me for the six tractor 
                      trailers I am gonnahave to turn 
                      around empty tomorrow.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                          (to his mechanics)
                      I don't know boys, instead of 
                      talking to us, sounds to me like he 
                      should be rounding up his heifers.

                                    LAMB
                      I can't round up two hundred ton of 
                    Angus with thirty minutes of 
                      daylight.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                    Well, I can't land three hundred 
                    ton of northbound DC-6 with gusts 
                    of thirty knots.

        Blanchard's mechanics laugh.                                                                                      5.


                                    LAMB
                    Sure you can.  You can bring them 
                    in from the East.  Right over the 
                      strip.

      Blanchard looks at Lamb. Smiles. 

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                      I guess Frank was right.  The 
                      casinos got you on the dole, now.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                    Where this town is headed Ralph, 
                    you take the money or you get the 
                      shaft.  I ain't stupid.  I made my 
                      choice.  You should wise up and 
                    make yours before they make it for 
                    you.
                            (gathers his papers)
                    Eight million people gonna land 
                    here this year.  Wallets full of 
                    cash.  That's double last year's 
                      traffic.  And they all want steaks.  
                    You don t like it, move your ranch.

      Blanchford starts to walk away. Lamb doesn't move.

                                    LAMB
                      That s not going to happen.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                    Then get your nag out of here 
                      before I have you arrested for 
                      trespassing.

      Blanchford nods to a Mechanic who steps over, grabs Lamb.

                                    MECHANIC #1
                    You heard the man. Move.

      Lamb looks down at the man's hand on his arm. Slow to boil. 
      He looks back up. Stares at him. A scary look.

      The Mechanic hesitates.  Just as Lamb senses movement in the 
      corner of his eye.  He TURNS --

      Mechanic #2 s wrench FLYING at his face.  

      Lamb DUCKS.  He s never one to throw the first punch.  But 
      now that it s started...

      Lamb SLAMS his fist into Mechanic #1 s CHIN.  Lamb ELBOWS 
      Mechanic #2, folding him in half.  Mechanic #3 rushes and 
        BLINDSIDESLamb with a punch to the jaw.                                                                                        6.


      Lamb stands still -- the impact not fazing him.  Mechanic #3 
      is amazed.  The other Mechanics are still struggling to their 
      feet.  Lamb pauses and hits Mechanic #3 who falls in a heap.

      And FURTHER BACK:

      JOHNNY SAVINO  

      Watching, amused.  An appraiser of violence and men.   Two 
      CASINO EMPLOYEES stand waiting by a black car parked out on 
      the tarmac -- RICKY  BEANSY  COTA and VITO BORELLI.  Casino 
      muscle.  After a beat, Savino turns to the car.  Borelli 
      opens the door.  

                                    SAVINO
                    You see that?

                                    BORELLI
                    Yeah.  The cowboy can dish it out.

                                    SAVINO
                    Not that.  The guy didn t blink 
                    when he got hit. 

      Savino gets in, the doors close and the car pulls away, past 
      POLICE CARS streaming in...

      EXT. LAS VEGAS CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT

      The setting sun glints off the domed rotunda of the just-
      opened Convention Center.  

      INT. LAS VEGAS CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT

      THWACK!  A boxing glove CRACKS into a Heavyweight s jaw.  The 
      mouthpiece goes FLYING.  The fighter staggers. It is a lop-
      sided match. Fans ROAR...

      IN THE SEATS

        Well-dressed clientele thirsty for the blood.  MAYOR BENNETT
      (45, a nervous mien) sits ringside, paying little attention 
      to the fight, focused instead on the empty seat to his left, 
      scanning the crowd for the occupant. He turns to his right, 
      facing D.A. REYNOLDS (42) and shouts over the crowd...

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      Something s wrong.  Clyde would 
                    never miss this.  Where the hell is 
                    he? 

      A BLONDE passes in front of them on her way to her seat. 
      Reynolds  eyes TWINKLE at the Blonde. She SMILESback, sexy.                                                                                      7.


                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                            (winking)
                      Sheriff s in Reno with his 
                      paramour, Mr. Mayor.  That s French 
                    for girlfriend.  You need one.  

                                    MAYOR BENNET
                      I need a Sheriff. That s what I 
                    need. I got ten years comping high 
                      rollers and pension managers, ten 
                    years fighting blue laws, Indians, 
                      permits for this goddamn arena. All 
                      that s left is presenting the new 
                    plan for the Strip Monday night.  
                    Is it too much to expect that my 
                      Sheriff doesn t go AWOL again?! 

      The bell rings and Reynolds finally looks at Bennett.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    Ted. I understand you ve got a lot 
                    on the line.  We all do.

      He stops short -- as a woman approaches, KATHERINE 
        O CONNELL(29). Assistant District Attorney. Pretty, whip 
      smart. A woman playing a man s game.  Dressed more Eastern 
      than Western, partly because she can afford to, partly to 
      hide her ranching roots.

                                    KATHERINE
                    Mr. Mayor, District Attorney.  
                    Sorry to interrupt --

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                      -- We re off the clock, Katherine.

                                    KATHERINE
                      There s something you need to see.  
                    They found a girl, murdered, out on 
                    the N.T.S. 

      This gets their attention.  

                                    KATHERINE (CONT D)
                    The Governor s niece.

      Mayor Bennett meets eyes with Reynolds. Dread.

      EXT. LAS VEGAS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      A few blocks off the Strip.  Where the service industry for 
      Vegas works.  Two cars are parked in the otherwise vacant 
      lot.                                                                                       8.


      Savino walks up to the warehouse, talking with ANTHONY  BIG 
      TUNA  CERVELLI, 52, who runs Vegas for Chicago.  A middle 
      manager gangster. 

                                    TUNA
                    You can keep the summer, but 
                      Christmas, that s heaven.  
                      Everybody back in Chicago s eating 
                    ice cubes and I m grilling sausage 
                    in the backyard. 
                          (for effect)
                    In my bathing suit.
                          (then)
                    How s your mother?

                                    SAVINO
                    She s good, thanks.  

                                    TUNA
                    Good. Good. Remember you only got 
                    one mother.

      Tuna leads Savino to the warehouse.  All business.

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                    Mr. Al tell you about the Shangri 
                    La?

                                    SAVINO
                    He said you want me to start there.

                                    TUNA
                    Yeah.  Keep an eye on the place.  
                    Make sure we re getting a straight 
                      count.  Walk around. Say hello to 
                      people.  You know what to do.  Just 
                    keep those suitcases going home 
                    fat.

      Tuna stops at the door.  Holds Savino s gaze a beat. 

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                    We brought you here because of what 
                    you did in Cuba.  Nobody knows 
                      casinos like you.  We re sitting on 
                    gold here -- you play this smart, 
                      there s no limit what you can do. 

      Tuna pushes open the door and they enter...                                                                                      9.


      INT. LAS VEGAS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      Rows of SLOT MACHINES are stacked along the sides.  Metal 
      working tables are empty -- the workers have been cleared 
      out.  Tuna and Savino round a corner...

      A DEALER (20s), sits on the floor, tied around the chest with 
      a metal chain to a slot machine.   The man bleeds from the 
      mouth and lip. Cota and Borelli stand off to the side. 

                                    COTA
                    Says he doesn t know nothing.

                                    TUNA
                          (to dealer, reasonable)
                    All we want to know is where we can 
                    find that miserable Sheriff.  
                      Thinks he can take our money and 
                    then turn on us. 

                                    DEALER
                      I don t know where he is. Honest. 

                                    TUNA
                            (okay...)
                    You deal cards. Don t make us do 
                    this. 

      Cota steps up with a pair of METAL SHEARS.  The Dealer looks 
      up in terror. Cota puts the shears  blades around his thumb --

                                    DEALER
                      Noooo!

                                    TUNA
                    He s not worth it.  Where is he?

                                    DEALER
                    -- His sister s house!  In 
                      Henderson.  On Edna Street.  

                                    TUNA
                    You sure?

                                    DEALER
                            (panicked)
                    I saw him this morning.  

                                    TUNA
                    See, that was easy.  

      Cota SNAPS the chain.  It falls to the floor.  Cota and 
      Borelli help the man to his feet.                                                                                      10.


      Savino reaches inside his jacket, pulls out a gun and FIRES 
      at the man s forehead.    He drops to the floor, dead.

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                    Go dig a hole.

                                    BORELLI
                    We already did.

      As they leave, HOLD on the slot machine behind the fallen 
      man, as blood trickles down a jackpot.

      EXT. THE NEVADA TEST SITE - NIGHT

      A vast flatland dotted with military signs warning--

      DANGER. RESTRICTED AREA. BOMBING RANGE. NO TRESPASSING.

      A few police cars parked on the edge of the access road 
      beside some Military Police. A couple of Vegas deputies stand 
      around looking lost as Katherine leads D.A. Reynolds and 
      Mayor Bennett to a ravine.  

                                    KATHERINE
                      Name s Anna Meade.  She had been 
                      working last six months in 
                      accounting at the Shangri La. She 
                    left last night, never made it 
                    home. Car s still in the lot. Two 
                    hours ago, an Air Force driver 
                      spotted her body from the road. 
                      They re planning a blast next week, 
                    doing sweeps. 

      They arrive at the edge of the ravine.  

      At the bottom, a DEAD WOMAN, 25, lies sprawled. Face bruised.  
      Blood caked in her hair, skin raw from being dragged.  Her 
      arms and limbs at odd angles, tossed in the middle of the 
      desert like a rag doll.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                      Where s her family?

                                    KATHERINE
                      Mother s flying in from Reno.

      The Mayor processes. Shit. Shit.  He faces Reynolds.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      Katherine, take a squad car and get 
                    to the airport.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT(CONT'D)
                    Meet her the second she gets off 
                    the flight, hold her hand, don t 
                    let her out of earshot. Go. Now.

      Katherine looks to Reynolds, who nods. She exits.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                          (to Reynolds)
                    I m done waiting for Clyde to come 
                    up for air. You find a phone and 
                    call the Governor. You grovel, 
                      express our condolences and outrage 
                    and sorrow for his niece. You tell 
                    him we re on top of the 
                        investigation. You tell him we 
                    won t rest till we find Anna s 
                      killer. 

      Reynolds walks off. The Mayor stares down at the body. He 
      takes a moment, trying to figure out what to do... He looks 
      over, sees a lone Deputy standing a few feet away. Young, 
      green.

                                    MAYOR
                    You.  What s your name, Deputy?

                                    DEPUTY
                      Armstrong, sir.

      The Mayor pulls out a business card and starts to write on 
      the back of it.

                                    MAYOR
                    Okay, Armstrong. Call your dispatch 
                    and send a car to this man s ranch. 
                      I want him brought here. Name s 
                    Lamb. Ralph Lamb. Got it?

      He hands him the card.  The Deputy runs off.

      EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

      A POLICE CRUISER speeds down the Strip...

      From one end to the other, two miles of explosive energy.  
      NEON SIGNS sparkle with the latest entertainers: ELVIS, 
      SINATRA, DEAN MARTIN.HOTELSand CASINOSline the street: 
      The Sahara, the Sands, the Riviera.  A mass of humanity 
      spills out onto the sidewalks. 

      INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

      Lamb sits in the back, quiet.  Cuffed.  His face scratched.  
      A Deputy drives.                                                                                    12.


      A call comes on the Deputy s radio.  He reaches over, 
      ANSWERS.  Lamb can t hear what s being said.  After a moment, 
      the Deputy cradles the mic.  His expression changed -- now 
      tight, disturbed.  He flips on his ROOF LIGHTS and pulls a U-
      turn.  

      Off Lamb, not sure where they re heading --

      EXT. DESERT RAVINE - NIGHT

      The cruiser approaches the crime scene. The Mayor stands on 
      the road.  Waiting for Lamb.  The Deputy  gets out, walks 
      over and OPENSthe door.  Lamb -- still cuffed -- STEPS out.  
      The Mayor moves over fast.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Get him out of those!

      The Deputy uncuffs Lamb and the Mayor pulls him away.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                    For Chrissakes, Ralph.  Next time 
                    you have a problem with the planes, 
                    come to me.  

                                    LAMB
                    It didn t concern you.

                                    MAYOR
                    This does.

      He walks Lamb over to the edge of the ravine.  Lamb looks 
      down, sees Anna Meade s body.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      Governor s niece.  Sheriff s MIA.  
                    The rest of them...
                          (looks out at deputies)
                      ...are useless. 

      Takes Lamb to the side.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT'D)
                      That s why I brought you here.  The 
                      Governor will be in my office first 
                    thing in the morning.
                          (beat)
                      I need to find this killer. 

                                    LAMB
                    I m a rancher.  Not a cop.                                                                                      13.


                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    You were one in Korea.  An M.P.  
                    And a damn good one.

      Lamb considers.  The Mayor sees his hesitation.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                      I don t expect you to work for 
                    free.  Name your price.

                                    LAMB
                      I don t want your money.  
                          (a beat, then)
                    You get those planes to stop flying 
                    over my cattle, that s a different 
                      story.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Maybe I can talk to Blanchford.  

                                    LAMB
                    Take away the maybe.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Done.

      Lamb turns, stares down at the body.  Processes.  There s 
      something about seeing a dead girl s body that stirs up a 
      deep memory.  Lamb keeps his eyes on the corpse, alone down 
      in the ravine.

                                    LAMB
                      What s her name?

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Anna Meade.

      Lamb starts to walk away.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                          (a flash of worry)
                    Where are you going?

                                    LAMB
                    To get that body out of here before 
                    the coyotes come.

      The Mayor reacts, relieved.  Sees Lamb walk down into the 
      ravine. GO HIGH over the crime scene... and ENDTEASER.                                                                                    14.


                                            ACT ONE

      EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY HALL - MORNING

        Businessmen and politicians crowd the steps.

      INT. LAS VEGAS CITY HALL - MAYOR S OFFICE  - MORNING

      The Mayor reads the morning paper while Reynolds stands over 
      his desk, pressing his point.  Katherine stands a safe 
      distance away, observing the men go at it.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    We don t tie this up fast, the 
                      Governor s gonna aim that shiny new 
                      gaming Commission at us like a 
                      goddamn bazooka.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT 
                      That s why I want Lamb to handle 
                    it.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    Why?  The Deputies can report to 
                    me.  I m a bit more qualified than 
                      a cattle rancher.

      The Mayor looks up at Reynolds a beat, hangs on his last 
      words.  He stands and walks over to his window: a view of the 
      casinos, the lights sparkling even though it s 8 in the 
      morning.  As he looks out...

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Back in Korea, Lamb and I were 
                      assigned to a unit based in 
                      Ryongkang, a little village ten 
                      clicks from the DMZ.  We were out 
                    on maneuvers and found a girl in 
                    the woods with her throat slit.  
                    Then more dead girls turn up, seven 
                    in all.  Lamb took over the 
                        investigation.  Didn t sleep for a 
                    week.  The locals had fingered a 
                      village kid for the killings and 
                    they were about to put a bullet in 
                    his head when Lamb finds an order 
                    of morphine coming into the 
                        Quartermaster.  We hadn t seen any 
                      action for a few weeks, so he 
                      wonders why we re running low.  He 
                    looks at the victims  bodies and 
                    finds marks in their necks.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT(CONT'D)
                    Lamb figured out our Medic was 
                      knocking the girls cold with the 
                    drug, raping them and slicing them 
                    up. 
                          (turns to Reynolds)
                    You find me a man like that, I ll 
                    send Lamb back to his ranch.  But 
                      you re not that man.  

      It sits there.  Reynolds can t say anything.  The Mayor 
      punches his INTERCOM.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                    Send them in.

      He looks up at Reynolds.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                      That s French for we re done.

      A beat, then the door OPENS.  The Secretary ushers in four 
      powerful looking men.  The Old Guard, the original Casino 
      elite.  Their leader: BENNY CASH (53, slick and tough.)  The 
      Mayor steps out to greet them --

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                      Gentlemen.  Coffee?  Whisky?

      The Mayor steps forward and shakes hands.  Off Reynolds, 
      watching the cabal, on the outside looking in --  

      INT. LAS VEGAS CITY HALL - DAY

      Reynolds and Katherine exit the office, out into the hallway. 
      As they move down the hall --

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    He wants to sink his career, fine.  
                    But I m not going down with him.  
                    What do you know about Lamb?

                                    KATHERINE
                      I grew up with him and his 
                      brothers. His ranch is next to 
                    ours.  They ve been out there since 
                    the Indian wars.  

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    He s got two brothers, what else?  
                    Wife, kids?

                                    KATHERINE
                    No.  His wife passed away when he 
                    was in Korea.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    16.

                                    KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    From what I ve heard, he s stayed 
                    on his ranch since he came home.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    So what s he in it for?  A piece of 
                      a casino?  Property rights on the 
                      Strip? 

                                    KATHERINE
                            (shrugs)
                    If I had to guess, I think he just 
                    wants to run his ranch.

      Reynolds seems amused.  The notions seems... quaint.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                          (we ll see)
                    Keep an eye on him.  I want to know 
                    what he s up to before I read about 
                    it in the papers.

      Reynolds walks off.  Leaving Katherine watching him...

      EXT. LAMB RANCH - DAY

      A working ranch: barns, a corral, and 5,000 acres of land. 
      Hands lead cattle in the coral, horses graze in the pasture.  
        A cottonwood tree gives shade to a simple ranch house. 

      INT. LAMB RANCH - DAY

      Inside the kitchen, Lamb pulls two shotguns off a rack.  
      Frank trails behind...

                                    FRANK
                    And who s supposed to round up the 
                      twelve hundred head going to market 
                    next week --

                                    LAMB
                      Francisco and the boys can handle 
                    it.  

                                    FRANK
                      -- there s a half ton of feed due 
                    to be dropped off this afternoon --

      Lamb stops him.  He pockets a box of shotgun shells.  

                                    LAMB
                      I already told you.  You re coming 
                    with me.  You re good with numbers 
                    and you re better with people than 
                    I am.                                                                                    17.


                                    FRANK
                    The bar is fairly low. 
                          (then)
                    What do I know about catching 
                      criminals?

                                    LAMB
                    Ask a few questions, listen to what 
                      people say.  What they don t is 
                    just as important.  

                                    FRANK 
                      Should I be writing this down?

      Lamb ignores him, pushes out the screen door to --

      EXT. LAMB RANCH - DAY

      Lamb takes the shotguns to his truck, a  54 Ford.  Frank 
      dodges a few stray chickens.

                                    FRANK
                    Who are we taking with us?

                                    LAMB
                    You, me, Dixon...

                                    FRANK
                      Dixon?

                                    LAMB
                    He can charm a bird off a tree.   
                    And the last time you left him 
                    alone we found the herd wandering 
                    on the I-41.  

                                    FRANK
                          (good point)
                      Dixon s in.

                                    LAMB
                      Where s Lon Simmons these days?

                                    FRANK
                    Fresh out of the pen.  Did eleven 
                      months for running bootleg smokes 
                    out of Utah.  

      Lamb puts the shotguns on the truck s rack.

                                    LAMB
                    We could use a good tracker.

      He closes the truck door.  As the engine TURNS over....                                                                                    18.


      INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY

      LON SIMMONS, Pauite Indian, 25, linebacker big, sits in the 
      cab.  His supervisor, ACKERS, 38 and angry, steers the truck 
      down an alley.  A horse race plays on the radio.  As Ackers 
      grinds the truck to a stop...

                                    ACKERS
                        Probationarywage is a buck twenty 
                    five and hour.  Bumps up a dime 
                    after a month.  

      He jumps out.  Lon follows...

      EXT. LAS VEGAS ALLEY - DAY

      They walk to the cans.  

                                    ACKERS
                      Instruction fee s twenty five bucks 
                    each week.  

                                  LON
                      Instruction fee?

                                    ACKERS
                    You don t like it I ll have you 
                      violated and sent back upstate.  
                    All clear, Red? 

      Ackers glares at Lon.  Daring him to lift a finger.  Lon 
      could throw him through a cinder block wall if he wanted to.  
      But he s a man without choices. 

                                    ACKERS (CONT D)
                    I ll be in the truck when you re 
                    done.

      Ackers climbs back in the cab.  We can hear him TURN UPthe 
      horse race on the radio.  

      Lon gazes down the block -- the alley is lined with 
        overflowing cans.  A shitjob.  He starts in, lifts a can and 
      dumps the stinking mess into the truck.  He puts his big 
      hands around another can --

                                    LAMB
                    Lon.

      Lon turns.  Sees the Lambs, leaning on their truck at the 
      mouth of the alley.  ON Lon, a grin growing...

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:                                                                                    19.


      INT. LAMB S TRUCK - DAY

      Lamb drives, with Frank between him and Lon, down a wide 
      street with manicured lawns and sprawling ranch houses set on 
      a golf course.  As Lamb slows in front of the circular 
        driveway... 

      ... Lamb sees a BUSINESS MAN picking up the mail and walking 
      inside...

                                    LAMB
                    That could be a problem.

      Lamb GUNS the truck past the driveway, makes a hard right --

      EXT. LAS VEGAS NATIONAL GOLF COURSE - DAY

      Lamb speeds the truck down the golf course, past a few 
      confused GOLFERS.  He drives up to the back of the house as --

      DIXON scrambles out a back window, pulls on his boots as he 
      runs past a pool, hurdles a fence and JUMPS in the back of 
      the truck, hitting it in stride.  Lamb speeds ahead --

      The Business Man CHASES after Dixon, his bath-robed wife 
      running out behind.  He levies a SHOTGUN at the truck and 
      FIRES, the kick nearly dropping him in the pool.  

      As Lamb s truck ROCKETSdown the fairway, CUT TO:

      EXT. HENDERSON, NV - DAY

      A quiet neighborhood of mid-century homes.

      INT. MID-CENTURY HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

      The refrigerator is open. Big Tuna eats a sandwich, reads the 
      paper.  Mayo, mustard and cold cuts lie on a cutting board.  
      A radio plays a tinny version of Elvis s  Big Hunk of Love.  

      Savino comes in from the back.  The screen door CLATTERS
      shut.

                                    SAVINO
                      Sister was right.  Sheriff must ve 
                    just left.  Oil stains in the 
                      garage are fresh.

                                    TUNA
                    Our friend at the Gambling 
                      Commission says he hasn t ratted 
                    yet.  He s out there somewhere.   
                    He could make it hard on us if he 
                      talks.                                                                                     20.


      Savino washes his hands in the basin.  Shakes them dry.  

                                    SAVINO
                    He won t.

      Tuna glances over -- sees Savino s calm, measured manner.   A 
      dangerous confidence.

                                    TUNA
                    You hungry?

                                    SAVINO
                    Nah, I m fine.

      Savino picks up the paper.  A HEADLINE details the Anna Meade 
      murder, with a PHOTO of her above the fold.  Shows Tuna.

                                    SAVINO (CONT D)
                    I see she worked for us.  Anything 
                      I need to know?  

                                    TUNA
                    No problem.  Just keep an eye on 
                    the cops.  You never know what they 
                    may be looking for.

      Tuna casually reaches into the refrigerator for a beer.

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                      Imported!  You want one?  

                                    SAVINO
                    I m okay.

      Tuna grabs two beers anyway.

                                    TUNA
                    Let s go.

      They walk out of the kitchen.  As they pass through the front 
      room and out the door, TILT DOWN to... 

      ... a DEAD WOMAN -- the Sheriff s sister -- half on the 
      couch, half-off on the floor.  HOLD ON her as we HEAR the car 
      START and drive away.  Off her face, frozen in horror --

      INT. LAS VEGAS HOTEL - DAY

      A suite of a top of the Sahara.  A view of the Strip.  

      Lamb and Frank stand across DORIS MEADE, Anna s mother, 
      dressed in black, seated on the couch.  Emotionally removed: 
      a moneyed bearing.  She takes in the news, brittle.                                                                                    21.


                                    DORIS 
                    ... at a casino?

                                    LAMB
                    Yes.  She s been there about six 
                      months.  

                                    DORIS
                    And what was she doing there?

                                    LAMB
                    She worked in the credit 
                      department.

                                    DORIS
                      I see.

        Lamb observes Doris process.  This is all news to her.

                                    FRANK
                    You mind me asking why you don t 
                    know this? 

                                    DORIS
                    My daughter and I hadn t spoken for 
                      a year.  I didn t know where she 
                    was living.  I assumed it was with 
                    that young man.

      She leaves it there, a forced politeness.

                                    LAMB
                    Who?

                                    DORIS
                    A day laborer on our ranch.  His 
                    name was Cale Green.  Anna had 
                      become smitten with him -- he was 
                    quite handy with the horses.  She 
                    knew how I felt, but continued to 
                    see him anyway.  When she was away 
                    at school, I ceased his employment.  
                    Anna found out, and she ran off to 
                    be with him.  That was the last we 
                      spoke. 
                          (then)
                    My daughter was very headstrong.  
                    She insisted she do things her own 
                    way.  Even if it was beneath her.  

      She looks up at Lamb, cold.  

                                    DORIS (CONT D)
                    I m sure you understand.                                                                                    22.


      She locks eyes with Lamb and leaves it there.   A grim 
      certainty to her prediction.  Lamb registers it.

      A tall, broad-shouldered MANin a dark overcoat walks in, 
      trailed by a coterie of officials.  GOVERNOR ALLEN KERN.  Two-
      term iron-fisted politician from Northern Nevada.  

                                    GOVERNOR KERN
                      Doris.

      He walks to his sister.  She steps forward and meets his open 
      arms.  Her head collapses into his chest.  Off Lamb, 
        registering the loss --

      EXT. DESERT RAVINE - DAY

      Sun bakes the craggy landscape.  Lamb walks from the road 
      down to the bottom of the ravine, where Anna s body was 
      found.  Frank and Lon trail behind.  

      Rough, red-stained dirt stretches for miles.  Not a living 
      thing in sight.

                                    FRANK
                    Looks just like it did when we were 
                    kids.

                                  LON
                    No dead bodies then.

                                    LAMB
                    That we knew about.

      Lamb scrutinizesthe topography like a rancher.  Listening 
      all the time.  An internal processing.  

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                      Whoever did it had to come at 
                      night.  Too exposed by day.  

                                  LON
                    He parked off the road.  Brush is 
                      broken along the path -- looks like 
                    he dragged the body from the car.   

      Something doesn t feel right to Lamb.  

                                    LAMB
                    Why here?  He could put the body 
                      anywhere for twenty miles.                                                                                    23.


                                    FRANK
                      Probably figured they were going to 
                    blow this place to pieces in a few 
                    weeks and nobody would find her. 

      Lamb s eyes set on a patch of thorny desert brush.  He WALKS 
      over, leans down.  The desert sand seems to have been 
      disturbed. Some brush has been broken off.    

      Lamb pulls back the brush, revealing a PILEof fresh sand.   
      Underneath it, the edges of a PLYWOOD BOARD.  

                                    LAMB
                    Give me a hand.

      He and Lon HAUL up the plywood, to reveal a makeshift grave.  
      The men looks down.  

                                  LON
                      That s where he wanted to put her.

                                    LAMB
                    So why didn t he?

      Lamb GAZES out into the open desert.  He WANDERSoff...

      Up on the road, Dixon DRIVESup in a POLICE CRUISER.  Lights 
      flashing.  Dixon scrambles with the controls, about every 
      BELL and WHISTLE goes off.  A beat then the siren goes 
      SILENT.  Dixon gets out.  Waves to them.

                                    FRANK
                      A natural.

      ANGLE ON LAMB

      Out in the desert flats.  He STOPS.  KNEELSdown.  TRACES his 
      hand along the red-sand soil, BRUSHINGaway the windblown 
      silt... 

      ... to reveal a single TIRE TRACK.  The tread IMPRINTEDin 
      the dirt.  He brushes off more silt... finds MORE TRACKS.

      Frank and Lon walk over.  Sees what Lamb has found.

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                      Motorcycles.

                                    LAMB
                    Three different treads. 
                          (to Lon)
                    How long do you think they ve been 
                    out here?                                                                                     24.


                                  LON
                            (inspects the tracks)
                      Couple days at least.  

                                    FRANK
                    Hard to carry a dead body out on a 
                    bike. 

                                    LAMB
                    And the body was dragged down from 
                    the road.  But these tracks come 
                    from out in the desert.

      Lamb considers as Dixon huffs over. 

                                    DIXON
                      I tracked down Anna s boyfriend.  
                    He s been working out at the rodeo 
                      grounds last couple months.  He and 
                    Anna lived in an Airstream out 
                      there.    

                                    FRANK
                      Where s he now?

                                    DIXON
                    At work.  He heard about Anna.  
                    Boss said he s a mess.

      Off Lamb, PRELAP:

                                    CALE (O.S.)
                      A city full of derelicts and you re 
                      pointing at me?...

      EXT. RODEO ARENA - DAY

      In the ring, a rodeo rider is violently BUCKEDby a gelding. 

      INT. RODEO BARN - DAY

      CALE GREEN (26, raw-boned) sits on a bail of hay.  Bleary-
      eyed and distraught.  Frank and Lamb across from him. 

                                    LAMB
                    We re not pointing at anybody.  
                    Just tell us what you were doing 
                      Friday night.

                                    CALE
                      Drinking.  In my trailer.
                          (then, knows it s coming)
                      Alone.                                                                                     25.


                                    FRANK
                    Bad answer.

                                    CALE
                    It s the truth.

                                    LAMB
                    Find a better one.  Your girl s 
                    dead.  

      Cale feels their eyes on him.  A beat.

                                    CALE
                    I was due to ride saddle bronc that 
                      night, then Anna calls, says she  
                    had to work late again.  I let my 
                      thoughts get away from me, started 
                      thinking maybe she was seeing some 
                    other guy.  

                                    LAMB
                    Why?

                                    CALE
                      I barely saw her last couple weeks -
                      - she s working days, I m here 
                      nights -- we d both been putting in 
                    the hours so we could save up and 
                    buy a place.  But lately she closed 
                    down on me, wasn t talking much.  
                    Kept staying late at work. 

                                    FRANK
                    Had to make you pretty angry, 
                      thinking she d been cheating on 
                    you. 

      Cale reacts -- knows where he s going.   

                                    CALE
                    I d never lay a finger on her.  She 
                    gave up everything to be with me.  
                      Money, college, her own family.  
                    Never could make sense why she did 
                    it all for me.  But she did.
                          (beat, lost)
                    Maybe she finally listened to her 
                      mother.  Found herself some suit to 
                      marry. 

      Lamb looks skeptical.

                                    LAMB
                    She doesn t seem the type.                                                                                    26.


                                    CALE
                      I don t know what to think. 

      Lamb looks at him a long beat.

                                    LAMB
                    What did you do after the rodeo?

                                    CALE
                    Went to the trailer, drank anything 
                    that was wet, then figured I d go 
                    track down this guy and tune him 
                    up.  Next thing I know, I m waking 
                    up in my truck. That s all I 
                      remember.

      Lamb nods to Frank.  

                                    LAMB
                    Next time we come back, you better 
                      remember more.  

      Lamb and Frank exit.  Off Cale, broken -- 

      EXT. RODEO GROUNDS - DAY

      Lamb and Frank exit.  Katherine O Connell approaches.   Lamb 
      nods to her.

                                    LAMB
                      Morning, Katherine. 

                                    KATHERINE
                      Ralph.  Frank.

                                    FRANK
                      I haven t seen you since you left 
                    for law school.  I thought we lost 
                    you for good.

                                    KATHERINE
                    You got me back.  New York firms 
                      aren t much for hiring women. 
                          (to Lamb)
                    Heard about your skirmish at the 
                      airport.  Reminds me of the old 
                    days.  Didn t you and my father 
                      square off once over some water 
                      rights?

      Franks cuts in --                                                                                    27.


                                    FRANK
                    You mean the water your daddy 
                      stole?

                                    KATHERINE
                      Funny, he remembers it differently.
                          (to Lamb)
                    As far as those planes go, I don t 
                    think that s a fight you re going 
                    to win.

                                    LAMB
                    Who says it s about winning?

                                    KATHERINE
                    If it s about what s right, that 
                    bus left this town a while ago.
                          (then, to Lamb)
                      I assume you talked to Anna Meade s 
                      boyfriend?

                                    LAMB
                    We did.  He s short an alibi.

                                    FRANK
                    And he was blind drunk Friday 
                      night.

                                    KATHERINE
                      A drunk boyfriend without an alibi.  
                      Nevada juries convict on less.

                                    LAMB
                    All that s missing is proof. 

      Lamb keeps walking to his truck. 

                                    KATHERINE
                    The D.A. will want to press 
                      charges.  What do you want me to 
                    tell him?

                                    LAMB
                    To wait until I find some proof.

                                    KATHERINE
                    Can I ask where?

                                    LAMB
                    The hotel where she worked.  He 
                      thinks she was seeing somebody 
                    else.                                                                                    28.


                                    KATHERINE
                    Don t they all.

      Lamb smiles, gets in his truck.  Katherine watches him as he 
      drives away.  CUT TO: 


      EXT. DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS - DAY

      A 12-foot high NEON COWBOY waves from his side, strapped onto 
      a flatbed truck. The flatbed RUMBLES off.  The cowboy WIPES 
      frame, WAVES GOODBYE, revealing across the street - 

      Johnny Savino directs WORKERS as a new NEON SIGN is CRANED 
      into place.. elegant cursive letters read:  The Shangri La.   

      Across the street, Benny Cash watches in front of his casino, 
      the EL RANCHO.  Cowgirl waitresses and sawdust floors.  Lamb, 
      Frank, Dixon and Lon walk up to Benny.  Benny looks dismayed.

                                    BENNY
                    New operators muscling in, boys.  
                      Buying up every casino they can.  

                                    FRANK
                    What about you, Benny?

                                    BENNY
                      I don t wanna say they ll have to 
                    carry me out dead first, because 
                    these guys would do it. 

      He retreats to his casino.  Lamb turns to his brothers and 
      Lon.

                                    LAMB
                          (to Lon)
                      There s a biker bar off in Warm 
                      Springs.  See if anybody knows who 
                    was riding out in the desert Friday 
                      night.
                          (to Frank)
                    You and I will talk to Anna s co-
                      workers.  Dixon, play nice with 
                      security and see when they last saw 
                    Anna.

                                    DIXON
                    My talents are being under-
                      utilized.

      Savino glances across the street and his eyes land on Lamb.  
      Off Savino --

      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - DAY

      COWBOY BOOTS leave dusty footprints on the plush carpet.  
      Followed by a pair a jet black ALLIGATOR LOAFERS. 

      Savino leads Lamb and Frank into the CASINO.  

                                    SAVINO
                    You said you were Sheriff s 
                      Deputies?  

                                    LAMB
                    For now.  We re helping out the 
                      Mayor.

                                    SAVINO
                    It s just, I m from Chicago.  Our 
                    cops got beer bellies and holes in 
                    their shoes.

      Savino stops, eyes Lamb.  Curious.

                                    SAVINO (CONT D)
                      I think I saw you at the airport 
                      yesterday.   You were very 
                      effective.

                                    LAMB
                    It was a misunderstanding.

                                    SAVINO
                    I m sure it was.  
                          (then)
                    Let me introduce you to Bob Perrin. 
                    Our credit manager. He supervised 
                    Miss Meade in the credit 
                      department.  Mr. Perrin?

      A few feet away, a man breaks away from a colleague.  BOB 
      PERRIN.  Credit Manager. 

                                    SAVINO (CONT D)
                    He ll answer any questions you 
                    have.
                          (pause)
                    Oh, by the way, the mayor and city 
                      commissioners are having a party 
                    here tomorrow night.  I d like you 
                    to be my guest.  Bring your wife 
                    and family.                                                                                    30.


                                    LAMB
                      I wouldn t know what to do with all 
                    that fun.

      Savino nods, walking them toward Perrin.

                                    SAVINO
                    If you change your mind, you and 
                    your brothers are all welcome.  

      Off Lamb, watching as Savino slices though the crowd. 

      INT. SHANGRILA CASINO/HOTEL - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Lamb and Frank walk with Perrin.  Perrin san accountant at 
      heart: reserved, minimal display of emotion.

                                    PERRIN
                      ...Anna was responsible for 
                      determining the credit line for our 
                      guests.  The job requires a great 
                    deal of discretion. 

                                    FRANK
                    You saw her at work Friday?

                                    PERRIN
                    She was there when I left.  Jodie  
                    Kent stayed later.  When she 
                      returned from her break, Anna was 
                    gone.

                                    LAMB
                    Her boyfriend thinks she was seeing 
                      someone here.  Talked about late 
                      nights at work.

                                    PERRIN
                    That part s true.  We promoted her 
                    to our high-roller accounts a few 
                      months ago.  It s a very demanding 
                      position.

      He stops at the entrance to the LUNCHEONETTE.  

                                    PERRIN(CONT D)
                    As far as her romantic life, I d be 
                    the last to know.  You ll probably 
                    have better luck asking them...  

        Perrinpulls open the heavy door.  Three of Anna s CO-WORKERS 
      sit at a booth.  DABBINGtheir eyes with tissues.                                                                                      31.


      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - LUNCHEONETTE - LATER

        A CO-WORKER cries on Frank s shoulder.  He HANDS her his 
        handkerchief.  She takes it and BLOWS her nose loudly.   

      Lamb sits with JODIE KENT, 27.  Taking Anna s death hard. 

                                    JODIE
                    Most of the girls work here to find 
                      a husband... but Anna was 
                      different..  She had already found 
                    her man.  She decided she wanted to 
                    run this place some day.  There s a 
                      million details to remember and 
                    she d write them all down in her 
                      datebook.  Every line, neat and 
                      perfect.  It drove me crazy.  

                                    LAMB
                    Her boyfriend thinks she might have 
                    been seeing someone else.  

                                    JODIE
                    Anna?  No.  She loved Cale.  I 
                    don t think that was her problem.

      Lamb watches her stop short, her thoughts turning inward.

                                    LAMB
                    You want to tell me what was?

                                    JODIE
                    I saw her crying in the powder room 
                      Friday.  She seemed scared.  I 
                    asked if she wanted to talk, but 
                    she said no.  

                                    LAMB
                    You don t have any idea what was 
                      bothering her?

                                    JODIE
                    If I had to guess, it was this 
                      place.  These high-rollers can wear 
                    you down.  They think all that 
                    money gives them a right to push 
                    you around.  And Anna didn t take 
                    to being pushed.

      Off Lamb --

      FIND Lamb and Frank walking out towards the casino.                                                                                     32.


                                    FRANK
                      I checked into Doris Meade.  
                      Family s loaded -- father hit it 
                    big with gold in Ely back in the 
                    20s.  Anna could whistle and her 
                      family d buy her out of any 
                      trouble. 

                                    LAMB
                      Sounds like she wanted to do it her 
                    way.  

      Is sits there with Lamb -- a connection to Anna emerging.  
      Dixon appears in the hallway walking towards them.

                                    DIXON
                      Security last saw Anna in an 
                      elevator around seven.  No one saw 
                    her leave any of the main exits.  

                                    FRANK
                    How else could she get out?

                                    DIXON

                          (to Frank)
                    Check her accounts, see if she was 
                      having problems with any of the 
                    high rollers. I m going to have a 
                    look around. 

      He turns and walks back in the direction they came. 

                                    FRANK
                    Why?

                                    LAMB
                    She had to get out of here somehow.  

      Lamb PUSHESthrough a swinging door.  As it SWINGS back, we 
      see a  Casino Employees Only  sign.

      Dank.  Underlit.  This is 1960 -- no eyes in the sky back 
      here.  Pipes run along the ceiling.  Lamb walks deeper...
      past a bathroom with a  WHITES ONLY  sign, down the hall...                                                                                    33.

      Lamb walks down the hallway.  Looks down.  Sees a droplet on 
      the floor.  Leans down.  Looks closer.  Blood.  

      HOLD on Lamb.  Stares down the hallway.  Hears a SOUND. 

      He moves down the hallway.  Sees a utility closet.  He steps 
      forward, twists the handle and pulls the door open --

      INSIDE THE UTILITY CLOSET

      A BELLMAN and a MAID in a frenzied tryst.  Clothes half 
      undone.  They look up, surprised.

                                    BELLMAN
                    Take a picture!

      He SLAMS the door shut.  Lamb s about to leave, stops.  He 
      hears a LOW RUMBLE.  Coming from above.  As he looks up...

      Lamb gets up from the bed.  Reaches for his shirt.  Not 
      staying overnight.

                    when they found you on the floor.  

                                    LAMB
                      I think I got hit because whoever 
                      killed Anna took her out the 
                      service entrance and they were 
                      afraid I d find something.   

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    Did you?
                            (dubious)
                    We went over the area and didn t 
                    find anything.  

                                    LAMB
                    Of course not.  That s why I got 
                    hit.                                                                                    36.


      The Mayor interrupts. 

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    It doesn t matter.  You found 
                      motorcycle tracks by the body.
                    It means those bikers were out 
                      there.  They tore up Barstow, 
                      Boulder City, and now here.

                                    LAMB
                      Tracks don t mean they killed her. 

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    No, but it makes the bikers good 
                      suspects. 

                                    LAMB
                    Cale Green was one, too.  And I m 
                    not sure he did it either. 

      It sits there.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    If we don t do something the 
                      Governor s going to authorize the 
                      National Guard to get those bikers 
                    off the streets. 

      Lamb WINCES as he puts on his boots.

                                    LAMB
                    Not a good idea.  Soldiers marching 
                      outside your casinos with their 
                      rifles can t be good for business.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      I don t suppose you have a better 
                    one?

                                    LAMB
                            (shrugs)
                    I was thinking of a roundup.

      Off Lamb, a twinkle in his eye --

      EXT. DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS - PARKING LOT - DAY

      The bikers have encamped in an empty tire store parking lot.  
      Drinking, smoking, working on their bikes.                                                                                    37.


      INT. DOWNTOWN VEGAS LIQUOR STORE - DAY

      Broken bottles litter the floor.  Lamb walks in.  SURVEYS the 
      damage.  He steps up to the counter.   Grabs a pack of Juicy 
      Fruit gum off the rack and tosses it on the counter.  

                                    LAMB
                    And a fifth of Cabin Still.

      The frightened CLERKgrabs the bottle off the shelf.  Lamb 
      tries to pay.   He PUSHESthe bottle to Lamb, his hand 
      shaking.  Lamb sees the fear in his eyes.  Leaves a five-
      dollar bill in the counter.  

      EXT. DOWNTOWN VEGAS LIQUOR STORE - DAY

      The Clerk LOCKS the door as Lamb exits.  Lamb joins Frank and 
      Lon.  Across the street, the bikers. 

      An eerie calm has descended.  In the stores, Merchants peer 
      out doors.  Others PULL down shades.  Everyone terrified.  
      Lamb unwraps a stick of gum and puts it in his mouth.  

                                    LAMB
                    You talk to Dixon?

                                    FRANK
                    He s getting the boys together.

      The three men cross the street.   

      IN THE PARKING LOT

      All the bikers eye Lamb as he approaches the Lead Biker, 
      MONTY, looking up from wiping down his bike. 

                                    MONTY
                      Lookiehere... The Lone Ranger and 
                      Tonto.  What can I do for you boys?

                                    LAMB
                          (tosses bottle)
                    It s what we can do for you.

      Monty CATCHES it.  Checks out the label.  Cabin Still.  
      Approves.  He opens it and takes a pull.  A beat.

                                    MONTY
                    And what s that?  

                                    LAMB
                      Twenty miles out of town is Mt. 
                      Charleston.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    38.

                                  LAMB (CONT'D)
                      There s a campsite big enough for 
                    you and all your bikes.  No one 
                    will bother you up there.

                                    MONTY
                      Nobody s bothering us here.

                                    LAMB
                    For now, but the Mayor is calling 
                    in the National Guard and they re 
                    going to bother everybody.  

                                    MONTY
                    Why do you care?

                                    FRANK
                    We don t want soldiers shooting 
                      bikers on the street. It s bad for 
                      business.

      Monty gauges Lamb.  

                                    MONTY
                      What s your name?

                                    LAMB
                    Ralph Lamb.

                                    MONTY
                    If I see any law up there, you and 
                      I will talk again.

                                    LAMB
                    You know where to find me.

      Lamb, Frank and Lon walk away.  Off Monty --

      EXT. MT. CHARLESTON PARK - NIGHT

      Stars dot the moonless sky.  The SOUND of Choppers 
        reverberates up the mountain road. 

      The bikers STREAM in.  Bottles CRASH against trees.   Signs 
      and benches are SMASHED.   They SPIN out on the grass and 
      gather in the center of the park.

      IN THE TREES

      Suddenly, horses BURST through the pines... the Lamb brothers 
      and a dozen cowboys from the ranch, FLYINGthrough the woods 
      on horseback.  Raw-boned, ranch tough men.  Armed with 
      shotguns.                                                                                      39.


      Lamb is the lead.  He rides into the opening, FIRES his 
      shotgun in the air.  The bikers freeze.  Sees cowboys on 
      horses coming from all directions, surrounding them.  Monty 
      looks up, in panic, GUNS his bike.  Tries to FLEE, speeds 
      right towards a horse --

      Lon FLIPS his shotgun, SWINGS it like a baseball bat.  
        CLOTHESLINES Monty --

      Monty is LAUNCHED off his bike, crumbles in a heap on the 
      grass.  The other bikers slowly LIFT their arms in 
        surrender...

      INT. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT - MONTAGE

      -- Bolt cutters SNAP off the Angels  chain bracelets. 

      -- Bikers in underwear are HOSEDdown with disinfectant.

      -- A Deputy SHAVES Monty s head.  One by one, the other 
      bikers get SHORNlike sheep.  CUT TO:

      INT. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING

      Monty s SHAVED HEAD.  As shiny as a cue ball.  He s cuffed 
      and clad in Clark County jailwear.  Lamb enters.  

                                    MONTY
                    You didn t say you were the law.

                                    LAMB
                    You didn t ask.

                                    MONTY
                      I want my lawyer.

      Lamb slides a PHOTOof Anna Meade across the table.

                                    LAMB
                    She was found dead next to some 
                      motorcycle tracks.  I got a man out 
                    there checking to see if those 
                      tracks match your tires.  Which 
                    they will.

      Monty remains unfazed.

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                    If one of you killed her, I don t 
                      expect you to say a word.  But if 
                    you saw something, that s a 
                      different story.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  LAMB (CONT D)
                    You got a lot of charges against 
                    you and your friends that might 
                      disappear if you want to help.

      Monty eyeballs him, defiant. 

                                    MONTY
                      I think I asked for my lawyer.

      INT. COUNTY JAIL - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

      Lamb steps out to find Lon Simmons waiting.  A troubled look.

                                  LON
                    The tracks match.

                                    LAMB
                    So what s the problem?

                                  LON
                      Flowers.

      He turns and walks down the hallway. 

      EXT. DESERT RAVINE - MORNING

      Lon, Frank and Lamb approach the makeshift grave.  The desert 
      is now carpeted with SMALL GREEN PLANTS, white FLOWERS 
      forming at the tips.  

                                  LON 
                      Sprouted up yesterday.  Cryptantha
                      flower.  My uncles used it for 
                      rashes.

                                    FRANK 
                    Good to know, come rash season.  
                    Can we go back now? 

      Lon ignores him.  Makes his point to Lamb. 

                                  LON
                    The flowers pop up like this, it 
                    means it rained a few days ago.  I 
                      confirmed with the Park Rangers 
                    that it rained the night before 
                    Anna was killed.

      Lon SHOVES his hand into the hole, comes up with a fistful of 
      still damp soil.

                                  LON (CONT D)
                    It s still wet.  Means the hole was 
                    dug the night it rained.                                                                                      41.


      Lamb reacts -- sees where Lon is going.

                                  LON (CONT D)
                    When the Angels were in Barstow.  
                    150 miles away.  

      Lamb considers.

                                    LAMB
                    Not their style anyway. 
                          (off Frank s look)
                    You dig a grave in advance so you 
                    don t have lug a dead body out here 
                    and then spend a couple hours 
                      digging.  It takes planning.  
                      That s not the way these bikers 
                    work.   

                                  LON
                    But the tracks match. They were out 
                    here at some point.   

                                    LAMB
                    Just not dumping Anna s body.

      A beat.  Lamb tries to make sense of it.

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                      Somebody else brought her out here 
                    that night.  This wasn t a random 
                      killing,  Whoever did it, planned 
                    it. They wanted her dead.
                          (turns to Frank)
                    You ever get those files on the 
                      high-rollers?

                                    FRANK
                      I asked yesterday.  Nothing yet.

                                    LAMB
                    Maybe there s a reason. 

      He starts back up the hill.  Frank looks after him, confused.

                                    FRANK
                    Where are you going now?

                                    LAMB
                    To a party.

      EXT. SHANGRILA CASINO/HOTEL - NIGHT

      Klieg lights.  The latest cars.  Crowds jam the entrance.                                                                                    42.


      INT. SHANGRILA CASINO/HOTEL - NIGHT

      The gala event.  B-list movie stars and high-rollers.  
      Tuxedoed waiters carry trays of cocktails and canapes.  

      Lamb enters with Frank and Dixon.  The Lambs are dressed in 
      pressed shirts, Sunday boots.  Dixon grabs two flutes of 
      champagne off the tray of a passing waiter.  He hands them to 
      Frank and Lamb.

                                    DIXON
                      You re here to have fun.  Act like 
                    you belong.

                                    FRANK
                      Except we don t.

                                    DIXON
                    They don t know that.  

      Dixon targets a pair of pretty women approaching.  He flashes 
      his best smile.  Tips his hat.

                                    DIXON (CONT D)
                    Is there an airport nearby or is 
                    that just my heart taking off?

      The women react, charmed.  Dixon takes the champagne from 
      Frank and Lamb and hands it to them.  

                                    DIXON (CONT D)
                    Care to show two very lonely oilmen 
                    from Texas the way around this 
                      soiree?

      He yanks Frank away and the foursome move off into the crowd.  
      Lamb stands alone.  He scans the crowd.  

      ACROSS THE ROOM

      Johnny Savino entertains a small group of guests.  Among 
      them, D.A. Reynolds.  Savino animatedly tells a joke.  The 
      guests laugh.  Savino leans over and whispers to Reynolds, 
      who listens closely.  Lamb notes it as --

                                    KATHERINE (O.S.)
                      Amazing what running water can do. 

      He turns and sees -- Katherine O Connell.  She s dressed for 
      the evening, beautiful in a sinewy dress and heels, a 
        transformation that Lamb can t help but notice.                                                                                      43.


                                    KATHERINE (CONT D)
                      Here s where you tell me I look 
                    nice.

                                    LAMB
                    You look nice.

                                    KATHERINE
                    Well, thank you.  That s very kind.

      There s a tension here, an unspoken attraction.  As they scan 
      the crowd, avoiding talking directly to each other...

                                    KATHERINE (CONT D)
                      Shouldn t you be extracting a 
                      confession from one of our 
                      suspects?

                                    LAMB
                      I would, if I thought any of them 
                    did it.

      Lamb keeps an eye on Savino.  Savino looks over, sees Lamb 
      and Katherine.  So does Reynolds.  Reynolds forces a smile 
      and waves.   A beat, then Savino walks over.

                                    SAVINO
                      Deputy Lamb.  Delighted to see you 
                    could make it. 
                            (winces)
                    Sorry to hear about your incident 
                      earlier.  How s the head?

                                    LAMB
                    Still hard, I ve been told.

                                    KATHERINE
                    I ll second that.

      Savino s eyes drift to Katherine.  He s taken aback by her as 
      well.  Lamb introduces them.

                                    LAMB
                    Mr. Savino.  Assistant District 
                      Attorney Katherine O Connell.

      Savino takes her hand.

                                    SAVINO
                    Big night for law enforcement.  I 
                      better be on my best behavior.  
                          (nods)
                    Miss O Connell.  Deputy Lamb.                                                                                      44.


      He steps to the side, merges with an arriving guest. 

                                    KATHERINE
                    The new boss?

                                    LAMB
                    Fresh from Chicago.

      Lamb takes a stick of chewing gum out of his shirt pocket.  
      Katherine notes it.

                                    KATHERINE
                      Really, Lamb?  Gum?  It s a 
                      terrible habit. 

                                    LAMB
                    I ve heard.

      Lamb slips away.  Off Katherine, speechless, watching him cut 
      through the crowd, FIND --

      SAVINO

      He looks over.  He sees Katherine standing alone.  He turns 
      to Cota and Borelli.  Motions to them.  They move off in 
      pursuit of Lamb... 

      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      The hallways are deserted.  Everyone is at the party.  Lamb 
      approaches an office. On the door: CREDIT DEPARTMENT.

      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - CREDIT DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

      Lamb enters.  An OFFICE WORKER looks up.

                                    WORKER
                      Office is closed.

                                    LAMB
                      Sorry.  

      Lamb heads to the door. As he steps out, he takes the gum out 
      of his mouth and shoves it into the door jamb.   

      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT - A BEAT LATER

      FIND Lamb watching from behind a corner.  The worker locks up 
      and walks off. 

      Lamb goes back, PUSHES open the door -- the gum has stopped 
      it from locking.  He removes the gum and enters.                                                                                      45.


      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - CREDIT DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Lamb steps over to Anna s desk.  Neat and orderly.  On the 
      desktop: a framed PHOTO.  Anna and Cale, in an embrace out 
      front of their Airstream.  Miles of raw ranch land behind 
      them.

      HOLD ON LAMB:  Taking in the couple.  A connection to a 
      shared past.  The sense of Anna coming to life for him.  

      A beat, then Lamb sets down the photo and RUMMAGESthrough 
      Anna s desk.  PULLSout Anna s datebook.  On the last date -- 
      9/1 -- three account numbers are written down.  Lamb grabs 
      the datebook.  CUT TO: 

      AN OPEN FILE CABINET: 

      Lamb pulls the files listed in the datebook.  He finds the 
      first file and tosses it on the desk behind him. He opens 
      another drawer and finds the second.  He moves on to the 
      third file, goes to the right section in the cabinet.   It s 
      not there.   Lamb goes back and re-checks the number.  He 
      searches again -- the file is missing.

      Lamb goes back to Anna s datebook.  

      TIGHT ON DATEBOOK:  The account number -- 117423.

      Lamb flips pages in the datebook, looking for another entry.  
      Each day, there s an entry for 117423.  He flips to the week 
      before... looks for the day when the account number was first 
      entered.  Finds it:  Tuesday.  Next to the account, Anna has 
        handwritten the word: MONACO.  Off Lamb, registering it --

      The drinking and partying rise to a fever pitch.  Up on

      Cota and Borelli heavy-foot their way down the hall.  

      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - CREDIT DEPARTMENT 

      Lamb FLIPS off the light.  He stops as --

      The handle TWISTS.  Then stops.  The door s locked.  Lamb 
      stands in the dark, frozen.  He watches SILHOUETTES of Cota 
      and Borelli pass across the smoked glass...                                                                                      46.

      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - BALLROOM

      The Showgirls unveil a scale-model of the new Vegas: 
      glittering hotels, sparkling palaces of high class 
        entertainment.  The audience explodes into APPLAUSE.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Let s give a big hand to our

                    There he is!  Johnny, take a bow! 

      To boisterous APPLAUSE, Savino does a half bow.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                    Now join me in welcoming the one

      The curtain RISES and... Jackie Wilson bounds out.  A 20 
      piece BAND kicks in.  It s high octane 60 s Vegas.  

      Savino watches the event unfold.  Then he eyes Lamb emerging 
      from the hallway.  

      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

      Lamb arrives at the front desk.  The CLERK knows Lamb.

                                    CLERK
                    How are you, Ralph?                                                                                    47.


                                    LAMB
                    Hey, Ken.  I m looking for a guest, 
                    last name of Monaco.  Can you check 
                    to see where he s staying?

                                    CLERK
                            (glances at registry)
                    No one by that name.  We have a 
                      Monaco suite up on the third floor.

                                    LAMB
                    Who was staying there Friday night?

                                    CLERK
                            (checks, finds it)
                      Stuart Mills.  Lives in St. Louis.  
                    He s a regular, big-tipper. 
                          (looks again)
                    He left Saturday morning.  Must 
                    have been in a hurry.  Forgot his 
                      wallet and I.D. in the room.  We ve 
                    been calling, but his wife says 
                    he s not home yet. 

      Lamb considers.  A new lead.  He turns --

      Savino stands a few feet away.  A cold smile.

                                    SAVINO
                      Deputy Lamb.  I noticed you stepped 
                    away.  

                                    LAMB
                    I m not much for crowds.

      Savino takes it in.  Smiles.

                                    SAVINO
                    Go back home.  Leave the business 
                    to the real cops. 

                                    LAMB
                      I tend to finish what I start.

      Lamb leaves it there.  Savino s expression darkens.

                                    SAVINO
                    So do I.  I hope you re not gonna  
                    get in my way.

                                    LAMB
                      I can t guarantee I won t.

      A stare down.  Savino sees Lamb isn t going to back down.                                                                                      48.


                                    SAVINO
                    We ll see how that works out.

      Savino turns and walks back to the ballroom.  Off Lamb, 
      resolved, tracking Savino, we CUT TO: 

      EXT. DESERT GAS STATION - NIGHT

      A roadside BILLBOARD reads:  LAST CHANCE FOR GAS, 200 MILES.   
      Beyond the sign... endless dark desert.

        A jet-black sedan pulls up to the pumps.  The headlight beams 
      reveal the  CLOSED  sign hanging in the window.  The door 
      opens... and D.A. Reynolds gets out.  

      A figure emerges from the shadows... SHERIFF CLYDE OLSON (45)  
      Unshaven, sallow-eyed.  Desperate.   Reynolds takes him in.

                      Clyde, are you okay?

                                    OLSON
                    Hell no, Rich.  I m in a jam.   You 
                    heard what they did to my sister?  
                            (confesses)
                    Those mob boys think I m a rat.   I 
                    need your help.  They ll kill me.

      Reynolds looks at Olson -- a broken man, on the verge of 
      losing it.   

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    Meet me at Hoover Dam, tomorrow 
                      afternoon.  I ll bring the Feds.  
                      They ve been dying to clamp down on 
                    these Chicago grease balls.

                                    OLSON
                    And no jail?

                    DOJ will re-locate you.

                      Name s Stuart Mills.  He was one of

                      checked out in a hurry the morning

      suit.  Fantastic tan.

                    Get up, boys.  Cavalry s here.

      Lamb UNLOCKS the cell door.  Jeffries walks in.  Then Lamb

      Lamb walks away.  An astonished Katherine follows.                                                                                    50.

                    Why not?  The man wants to talk to 
                    his clients.  He s got thirty 
                      bikers in there. Bound to take him 
                    all day.

      EXT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - DAY

      Lapis blue water SHIMMERS.  Tanned, chubby men in bathing 
      suits smoke cigars and play blackjack at a floating card 
      table.  The Dealer is also in a swimsuit, but he s wearing a 
      black bow tie. He s handing out the cards.  Savino leads 
      Benny Cash through the pool area. 

                                    SAVINO
                    I m glad you re letting me show you 
                      around.

                    My pleasure.

      Attendants OPENdoors as Savino and Benny walk in.  

      INT. SHANGRI LA CASINO/HOTEL - DAY

      Savino STOPSin view of the jammed casino floor.  Gamblers -- 
        well-dressed and young -- crowd the craps and blackjack 
      tables and roulette wheel.  Screams and groans fill the air.   
      An auditorium with theater seats watch a tote board and TV 
      screens of horse races broadcast from all over the world.    

                                    SAVINO
                    We fly half of our good customers 
                    in on charters every week. It s 
                    worth it. Believe me.  The rest 
                    come in on their own, but they all 
                    leave us something...
                          (tweaks fingers)
                      ...toremember them by. 

                                    BENNY
                    Very nice. Very impressive.

                                    SAVINO
                    You could be a part of this. 

                                    BENNY
                    Me?                                                                                    51.


                                    SAVINO
                    You want to expand?  You want to 
                    sell? You want a partner? You want 
                      a little advice?  I m here.   

      Benny sizes up Savino.  

                                    BENNY
                      Thanks, but you could use some 
                      yourself.

                                    SAVINO
                    Huh?

      Benny walks over to a BLACKJACK TABLE.  A lavish arrangement 
      of FLOWERSis displayed.

                    those flowers there and fire them

      He hands the flowers to Savino.  Benny leaves.  Off Savino, 
      clutching the flowers --

      INT. DINER - DAY

      Off-strip.  Rodeo posters on the wall.  Lamb slides into the 
      booth, joining Dixon and Frank.  A waitress POURS coffee.                                                                                     52.


                                    FRANK
                      Stuart Mills isn t heading back to 
                    his job anytime soon.  

      He takes a sip of coffee. 

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                      I spoke to a switchboard operator 
                    at the Shangri La -- 

                                    DIXON
                    Candy or Lou Anne?

                                    FRANK
                            (ignores, to Lamb)
                    She tells me Anna made five calls 
                    last week to the bank in St. Louis 
                    where Mills worked.  I checked with 
                    the bank, and it turns out Anna 
                      called to verify Mills  income, 
                    since he s taking so many markers 
                    while his income was listed at 15 
                    grand a year.  The manager looks 
                    into it --

                                    DIXON
                          (jumps in)
                    Mills was stealing.

      Frank shoots a look -- 

                                    FRANK
                    Can I finish?

                                    DIXON
                    Am I right?

                                    LAMB
                    I m listening.

                                    FRANK
                          (back to Lamb)
                    Mills was stealing from his job to 
                    pay off his markers over here. No 
                    one had any idea until Anna called.   

                                    DIXON
                      Explains how he paid off his 
                      markers so he could gamble some 
                    more. 

                                    FRANK
                    One of the pit bosses said he was a 
                    real sicko. 
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    53.

                                    FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Once he showed up and started 
                      shooting craps before even checking 
                    into his room.  Twenty four hours 
                    later he was still at the table and 
                    had lost it all. He picked up his 
                      suitcase and went home. He never 
                    even checked into his room. 

                                    LAMB
                    And this time he had a room, but 
                    took off without his wallet or 
                    cash. What does a guy like this 
                    need most?

                                    DIXON
                    Go home money.

      Lamb peels some bills on the table.  As they slide out...

      INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

      Lamb stands by ARTHUR SPEZIALI as he (part-time barber/pawn 
      broker) shaves a customer. Frank thumbs a magazine while 
      Dixon browses the pawned items scattered around the back.  
      Speziali moves the blade slowly.  An artist.  

                                    SPEZIALI
                      Everybody appreciates you getting 
                    those bikes off the street, Ralph. 

      Behind him, Dixon holds up a fly rod. 

                                    DIXON
                    How much?

                                    SPEZIALI
                    Not for sale.  Guys coming back 
                    later today... 
                          (a realist)
                    Or maybe tomorrow. 

                                    LAMB
                    We re looking for a guy. Might be 
                    out of St. Louis.  Flat busted 
                      broke.  He may have been reaching 
                    out for money.

                                    SPEZIALI
                    Is it serious?

                                    LAMB
                    It ll be serious if we don t find 
                    him.                                                                                    54.


                                    SPEZIALI
                          (looks over at Lamb)
                    You got a dollar?

                                    LAMB
                      A dollar?

                                    SPEZIALI
                      I need it to open the register. I m 
                        superstitious.

      Lamb fishes in his pocket for a dollar.

      Speziali takes it to the register and rings up  NO SALE .  
      The cash drawer pops open.  He reaches into the drawer and 
      pulls out a GOLD POCKET WATCH.  He dangles it in front of 
      Lamb. 

                                    SPEZIALI (CONT D)
                    He pawned it for a hundred and 
                      twenty bucks earlier today. 

      Lamb opens the watch.  Engraved inside:  To Stuart, with all 
      my love, Gloria.   

                                    LAMB
                    And?

                                    SPEZIALI
                          (checks pawn tag)
                    He s staying at the Golden Spur.

      Lamb tosses $2 at Speziali.

                                    LAMB
                    Think of the first buck as a tip. 

      Out the door.

                      Thanks. 

      EXT. HOOVER DAM - DAY

      The monolith.  Immense concrete walls jut up from the river 
      basin.  A car pulls up and Clyde Olson exits.  

      Out on the rim, D.A. Reynolds peers down the 700 ft. drop to 
      the river below.  Olson walks up, looks around.  

                                    OLSON
                    Where are the Feds?                                                                                    55.

                    Four billionkilowatt hours each

                    This town is just going to keep 
                      growing.  There s no end in sight.

                                    OLSON
                    You can keep it.  The whole 
                      stinking place is rotten.  I m done

                    It seems so.

      Reynolds steps back and walks toward the entrance.  

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS (CONT D)
                      Goodbye, Clyde.

      Olson watches him, confused.  Then he sees Savino appear.

                                    OLSON
                    Who the hell are you?  

      He looks, sees Cota and Borelli approach from the opposite 
      end.   Olson backpedals and Savino grabs him.  As he drags 
      Olson to the rim of the dam --

      FIND Reynolds, getting in his car at the entrance.  Business 
      as usual.  He pulls away.  Revealing a SIGN --

      ON SIGN.  A tribute to the workers killed while building the 
      dam.  The text reads:  THEY DIED TO MAKE THE DESERT BLOOM .

      HOLD on the sign.  We hear the Sheriff s SCREAM as he 
      plummets off the edge, and  CUT TO --

      A neon sign fizzles.  A dead end flea bag.

      INT. GOLDEN SPUR MOTEL - DAY

      STUART MILLS (pasty, 37) hastily packs his suitcase.  He 
      hears a KNOCK on the door.  HARD CUT TO:

      EXT. GOLDEN SPUR MOTEL - DAY

      Mills TUMBLES out the back window.  LANDS hard on the ground, 
      starts to SCAMPER away.  A boot TRIPS him --                                                                                    56.


      Mills FALLS.  Rolls over -- a GUN in his hand.  The boot 
      STOMPS down on his wrist.  Mills YELPS in pain.  Looks up, 
        terrified...

      Lamb looms over him.  Off Mills, terrified --

                                    MILLS (O.S.)
                    I m not lying to you.  I didn t 
                    touch that girl...

      INT. GOLDEN SPUR MOTEL - DAY

      Mills sits on the bed, head in hands.  In shambles.  Lamb 
      reclines in a chair.  Boots up on the bed.  Frank leans 
      against the wall.  

                                    LAMB
                    Then why are you hiding?

                                    MILLS
                      Because I know how the hell it 
                      looks.   That girl shows up dead 
                    after asking me about the cash in 
                    my account --

                                    FRANK
                    The cash you stole.

      Mills looks up.  They know.  He slumps.  In misery.

                                    LAMB
                    What happened with Anna?

      Mills exhales, in a world of hurt...

                                    MILLS
                    Like I said, she came to my room 
                    last week.  Wanted a source of 
                      income for the money I laid off at 
                    the casino.  I told her I had a 
                    deal with management.  

                                    FRANK
                      Savino.

                                    MILLS
                    Who?  My deal was with Perrin.  

      The brothers exchange a look.

                                    LAMB
                    What kind of deal?                                                                                    57.


                                    MILLS
                    I got into a jam about a year ago.  
                    Got under water big time shooting 
                      craps.  Perrin comes to me, starts 
                      talking about the money. Says they 
                    might have to go to my bank. Tell 
                      everybody about my debts. I ve got 
                      a wife. Kids. 
                          (memory sickens him)
                    ... He said if I wanted to get 
                      straight, I d better start 
                      borrowing from my bank.  

                                    FRANK
                      Sounds more like stealin  than 
                      borrowin .

                                    MILLS
                            (desperate)
                      I didn t have a choice.  

                                    LAMB
                    Who else knew about your 
                      arrangement?

                                    MILLS
                      Nobody.  Perrin wanted to keep it 
                      between us.  He said I could keep 
                      gambling after he got his cut. 
                          (then)
                    It was working out fine. He made my 
                      markers disappear -- 

                                    LAMB
                    Then Anna starts asking questions.    
                    And you didn t like it.

                                    MILLS
                      I didn t touch her.  I swear.  

                                    LAMB
                        A hard-working girl who took pride 
                    in doing her job right.   Must ve 
                      rubbed you the wrong way.  You had 
                    to kill her.

      Mills can t hear it --

                                    MILLS
                    It was Perrin.  He told her to back 
                    off after I complained.  She 
                      wouldn t listen.  She made an 
                      appointment with the top brass.                                                                                     58.


                                    FRANK
                      Perrin couldn t let that happen.  
                      They d know he cooked the books.

                                    MILLS
                      That s when he told me he d take 
                    care of it.  I figured he d make 
                    the problem go away.  Buy the girl 
                    off.  Get her another job.  
                          (a beat)
                    Then I saw the papers.  

      The life drains out of him.  Lamb rises.

                                    LAMB
                      Remember everything you said.  
                    We re gonna go tell it to the D.A.

      He grabs Mills starts to head for the door...

      EXT. GOLDEN SPUR MOTEL - ACROSS THE STREET POV - DAY

      Lamb and Frank take Mills out of the motel room and to their 
      truck.  Dixon jumps in.  As they pull out...

      REVERSE ON POV

      Hidden from view, a man in a car -- red Pontiac convertible -- 
      watches from across the street.  Bob Perrin.  He sees the 
      Lambs drive off with Mills.  Perrin floors the pedal and 
      hauls out in the opposite direction.  Off this --

      INT. SHANGRILA CASINO/HOTEL - DAY

      Etched glass doors SWING open.  Lamb and his brothers move 
      swiftly through the Casino.  Gamblers look up, alarmed -- not 
      sure what to make of the cowboy invasion.   

      INT. SHANGRILA CASINO/HOTEL - PERRIN SOFFICE - DAY

      Papers strewn everywhere.  A safe is open.  Savino and a team 
      of ACCOUNTANTS frantically search through documents. Lamb 
      breaches the office door.  Pushes past Cota and Borelli.  

                                    LAMB
                      Where s Perrin?

                      I don t know.

                    A lot of your money s missing.

                                    SAVINO
                    How do you know?

                                    LAMB
                      Because we re looking for the guy 
                    who took it.

      He moves past Savino and picks up a photo on Perrin s desk. 
      TOSSESit to Frank --

      A plane sits idle.  The engine panel open.  Mechanics tweak 
      the engine.  Perrin finishes loading the plane.  In a hurry, 
      trying not to sound nervous.

                                    PERRIN
                    How are we... doing?

        PerrinGLANCES out at the road.  A CLOUD of DUST rises...  

      Lamb and his brothers approach the airport -- not on horses 
      this time.  In Lamb s truck, followed by the FLASHING LIGHTS 
      of the Deputies  cars.                                                                                    60.


      Perrin YANKS his bags out of the plane.  Takes off running... 
      towards his car.  Parked at the edge of the runway.

      Lamb s truck stops at the plane.  He steps out, rifle in 
      hand.  Looks up as --

        Perrinruns, fifty yards away.  Sees Lamb.  Stabs his hand in 
      his waistband and pulls out a gun.  FIRES --

      Bullets PLINK-PLINK into the plane, narrowly missing Lamb.  
      Lamb STEADIES.  Raises the rifle.  AIMS.  

      IN HIS SIGHTS

      Perrin.  Dead to rights.

      Lamb hesitates, then LOWERSthe barrel -- he can t shoot a 
      man in the back.  Frank speeds up in his truck.

        Perrincasts a nervous glance to the approaching truck.  
      Reaches back and FIRES --

      The truck s windshield SHATTERS.  Frank SWERVES then SPEEDS 
      ahead.  Lamb BALANCESon the running board as Frank ANGLES 
      the wheel and the truck flies closes in on Perrin.  

      Lamb RAISES the rifle.  AIMS.  FIRES.

        Perrin sfront tire EXPLODES.   SHARDS of rubber fly.  SPARKS 
      fly off the rim as it bounces off the rocks -- 

      Lamb SWINGS the rifle.  Resets his aim.  FIRES again.  

        Perrin sback tire EXPLODES.   Perrinloses control... and 
      the car FLIPS, taking out a fence, coming to rest a few yards 
      from a HERD OF CATTLE.  Frank pulls up.  Lamb jumps out.  
      Reaches down into the wreckage and DRAGS out Perrin.  As the 
      car SMOKESand FLAMES, we CUT TO:

      INT. CLARK COUNTY JAIL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE INTERROGATION - DAY

      Through the two-way glass, Lamb watches Reynolds interrogate 
        a now-conscious Perrin.                                                                                      61.


      From what Lamb can see, Reynolds is saying a lot and Perrin 
      very little.  Reynolds circles Perrin, frustrated.

      Katherine approaches Lamb.

                      A Shangri La maid saw Perrin go in 
                      a second floor room the same time 
                    Anna was in the elevator.  It looks 
                    like he killed her in the room, 
                    then took her body out a service 
                      entrance.  That s why he didn t 
                    want you poking around.

                                    LAMB
                    But nobody saw him with the body?

                    see that dead girl.  Then we got

      Back past the cooks and the stoves, a small table.  A small 
        grey-haired woman works over a steaming pot.  Tuna sits 
      reading the Las Vegas Sun.  Splashed across the front page: a

                    Not that much. Accounting can

                    What about this one?                                                                                    64.


                                    SAVINO
                    I ve got people inside who can 
                      handle him.  

      Tuna nods.  One problem taken care of.  Savino s eyes drift 
      to Lamb.  Tuna reads him.

                                    TUNA
                    And the cowboy?  Is he going to be 
                      a problem.

                                    SAVINO
                      Forget him.  I m gonna enjoy 
                      handling him on my own.

                                    TUNA
                    Good boy.  That s all I gotta know.

      Savino readies to leave.  Tuna stops him.

                                    TUNA (CONT'D)
                    Where you going?   My mom s been 
                      cooking all day.  Sit down.

      Tuna pulls out chair.  The grey-haired lady -- MRS. TUNA -- 
      prepares a dish.  Savino sits.  Mrs. Tuna brings over the 
      plate of pasta.

                                    MRS. TUNA
                      Careful, it s hot.

      She sets down the plate.

                                    SAVINO
                      Thanks, Mrs. T.

                                    TUNA
                      I told you you d like it out here.  

      As Tuna and Savino dig in, we CUT TO --

      EXT. LAS VEGAS HIGHWAY - DAY 

      The unhappy BIKERS roll past the LEAVING LAS VEGAS sign.

      Leading the pack is Monty.  Shaved and scrubbed clean.  
      Clothes laundered and freshly pressed.  Like he could be 
      heading to church.  As the procession moves forward...

      INT. RANCH TRUCK - DAY

      Frank drives, Lamb next to him.  Following the bikers.  The 
      highway stretches ahead of them, out into endless desert.                                                                                      65.


                                    LAMB 
                    Here.

      EXT. LAS VEGAS HIGHWAY - DAY

      Lamb steps out to the middle of the road.  RAISESthe shotgun 
      and FIRES a blast over the bikers  heads --

      Monty STARTLES at the BLAST.  His bike SWERVES.  The bikers 
      SCRAMBLEto avoid hitting each other.  It s chaos.

      Lamb watches the bikers recover and recede into the desert. 

      INT. RANCH TRUCK - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Frank drives back to town.  

                                    FRANK
                    Doc Andrews is coming over to 
                      vaccinate the new calves Tuesday.  

      Lamb s gaze falls out the window. A herd of lazy cattle sun 
        themselves.  Life getting back to normal.  

      A few cars pass by, HONK horns.  The drivers WAVE.  Then pull 
      U-turns.

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                    We ll need to add some hands.  I m 
                      thinking Teddy, Lupek --
                            (looking out)
                    What the hell?

      More carsdrive out.  Passengers WAVEoutstretched arms, 
      saluting them.  They WHIP into U-turns and follow the truck.  
      Frank peers into the rear-view.  

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                      Brother Lamb, I believe we got 
                      ourselves a parade.

      EXT. LAS VEGAS HIGHWAY - DAY

      At least twenty cars trail the Lambs now, FLASHING lights, 
      BEEPING horns.  

      EXT. DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS - DAY

      Mayor Bennett has assembled a handful of local PRESS.  
      Merchants stream out of businesses -- their terrified faces 
      replaced with wide smiles.  As Lamb s truck approaches, the 
      crowd surges towards the street.                                                                                    66.


      INT. RANCH TRUCK - DAY

      Frank stops.  He reaches over Lamb and throws OPENthe door.  

                                    FRANK
                    You going to stay in here all day? 

      EXT. DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS - DAY

      Lamb gets out.  Applause.  Flashbulbs POP.  The Mayor WRAPS 
      his arm around Lamb and POSESfor the photographers.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                          (sotto)
                    The Governor sends his thanks.
                          (then to press)
                    And make sure you write that Las 
                    Vegas is the safest town in 
                      America. 

      Off the Mayor, soaking it in and Lamb, the man of the moment, 
        uncomfortable in the spotlight.  His eyes drift across the 
      street --

      SAVINO.  Stands in front of the Shangri La, watching Lamb.  
      Their eyes meet.  A moment.  Two foes, acknowledging each 
      other.  Savino nods to Lamb, then walks inside.  Off Lamb, 
      sensing it s not the last time they ll cross paths --  

      EXT. RODEO GROUNDS - DAY

      The sun starts to dip behind the foothills.  Lamb pulls up in 
      his truck.  Ranch hands wrangle horses in the corral.  Cale 
      leans on the fence.  Lamb walks over.  Cale sees him.  

                                    CALE
                      I heard you caught the guy.  

      Cale s eyes moisten, turns back to watching the horses.

                                    LAMB
                    She wasn t cheating on you.  I 
                      thought you should know.

      A beat.  Cale tries to shake it off.  

                                    CALE
                    We didn t want much.  Just our own 
                      little piece of it.  

                                    LAMB
                      I would ve like to have met her.  
                      Sounded like the real deal.                                                                                    67.


      Cale nods.  She was.  After a beat...

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                    If you need work, I m always 
                      looking for a good hand.   

                                    CALE
                    May be good to put some miles 
                      between me and this town.  

      Lamb nods.  Cale faces him.  The men shake hands.  A look of 
        understanding between them.  Lamb walks back to his truck. 

      A DC-6 airliner flies overhead.  Lamb stops, watches as it 
      approaches McCarren, the lights of the Vegas skyline 
      twinkling in the distance.  Both magical and ominous.

      As the plane descends, a car drives up to the barn.  
      Katherine gets out.  Somber.  Off her --

      EXT. NEVADA RIVER - NIGHT

      Headlights ILLUMINATEthe choppy surface.  In the distance, 
      HOOVER DAM looms, the massive monolith lit by floodlights.  
      Lamb s truck pulls up.  Followed by Katherine s car.  They 
      get out and make their way down to the river.

      Mayor Bennett and D.A. Reynolds wait as Fish and Game workers 
      gaff an object floating in the reeds -- a body, lying face 
      down.

      The workers haul the sodden corpse onto the bank...

      SHERIFF CLYDE OLSON  

      Katherine and Reynolds stand in shock.  Lamb s eyes pan down 
      to his shirt.  Under Olson s jacket, a BADGE is pinned to his 
      shirt pocket.

      TIGHT ON the words, pressed into brass:  SHERIFF, CITY OF LAS 
      VEGAS. 

      BACK ON LAMB.  The Mayor slaps him on the back.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    You got yourself a new job. 

      He walks back up the bank.  Off Lamb, his future unfolding, 
      we --
