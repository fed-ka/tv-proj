               The school bus drops the boys off at their bus stop. Cartman 
               is STILL singing the same song.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Singing)
                         I'm gonna be on television! I'm gonna 
                         be on television!

               Stan gets in Cartman's face.

                                     STAN
                         We don't believe for a minute that 
                         you won that contest fairly, fat 
                         boy!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey, stop defending your little 
                         girlfriend for writing about some 
                         stupid fish.

                                     STAN
                         Dude, dolphins are intelligent and 
                         friendly!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Intelligent and friendly on rye bread 
                         with some mayonnaise.

                                     STAN
                         Dolphins are way smarter than YOU!

                                     CARTMAN
                         If they're so smart, why do they 
                         live in igloos?!

                                     STAN
                         DOLPHINS DON'T LIVE IN IGLOOS! THAT'S 
                         ESKIMOS!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares? It's 
                         all a bunch of tree-hugging hippie 
                         crap!

                                     STAN
                         Tell me what you wrote about!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Uh, I can't, I have to go home and 
                         get in shape!

               Cartman walks away.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah right, you'll go sit in front 
                         of the T.V. and eat Cheesy Poofs, 
                         assmaster!

                                     CARTMAN (OFFSCREEN)
                         Screw you, hippie!!


               The sun rises over South Park.


               Townspeople are busy painting the buildings on the main drag 
               and hanging banners reading 'South Park Welcomes Kathie Lee 
               Gifford!!!' The mayor is directing townspeople with a 
               megaphone.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         C'mon people! We've got to turn this 
                         place around!! Hang up the lights! 
                         String up the banners! Castrate the 
                         cows!!

               The cows look up with concern.


               Mr. Garrison's class stands around on the stage all dressed 
               in cute little historical outfits. Half the children are 
               dressed as pioneers, and the other half are dressed as 
               Indians. The Mayor walks up.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Well, Mr. Garrison, how is the little 
                         play going?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Huh? Oh... Fine, we were just about 
                         to run it from the top.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Oh, please do! I'm dying to see it!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, All the little pioneers on 
                         this side of the stage.

               All the kids who are dressed in pioneer outfits go to one 
               side of the stage.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Good, and all the little Indians go 
                         to the center of the stage.

               A little boy named CLYDE steps forward.

                                     CLYDE
                         Am I a Indian or a pioneer?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Do you have a feather on your head?

                                     CLYDE
                         Yes.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Then you're an Indian.

                                     CLYDE
                         Oh.

               The Mayor sighs as Clyde walks to join the group of kids 
               dressed as Indians. Kenny is just wearing what he always 
               wears with a little red feather sticking out of his hood. 

               Now Garrison moves in front of the curtain and stands next 
               to the Mayor.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, BeBe this is your line.

               BEBE stands in front of the curtain in a little dress.

                                     BEBE
                              (Reciting loudly)
                         This is the story of South Park... 
                         It begins over a hundred years ago 
                         when the noble and hardy Ute Indians 
                         lived on the land.

               Now the curtain opens revealing all the children dressed as 
               Indians sitting in around a little fake teepee.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Oh, don't they look adorable?

                                     BEBE
                         Then, from the east, came the great 
                         white pioneers...

               Suddenly, all the children who were dressed as pioneers come 
               CHARGING onto the stage and immediately start beating the 
               crap out of the kids dressed as Indians.

               The Mayor watches in horror as the Indians are pummeled 
               senseless by the pioneers.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Oh my God!!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         They did it a lot better this morning. 
                         They had more energy.

                                     BEBE
                         The pioneers met with the Indians, 
                         and negotiated for their fertile 
                         lands...

               The children continue to fight. All the little Indian kids 
               are thrown off stage and beaten to a pulp.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Mr. Garrison! We cannot have our 
                         children beating each other senseless 
                         in front of Kathie Lee Gifford!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well, what do you want? This is how 
                         it happened in those days.

               Stan kicks Clyde in the ribs repeatedly.

                                     STAN
                         Take THAT you stupid Indian!

                                     CLYDE
                         Ow!

               Now the kids are really into it, the Mayor and Mr. Garrison 
               have to shout over the growing moans and cries.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         MR. GARRISON! THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE! 
                         DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT Kathie 
                         LEE GIFFORD WOULD ENJOY THIS?!?!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         TO HELL WITH Kathie LEE 
                         GIFFORD!!!!!!!!

               Silence...

               Everybody stops... The kids quit fighting and stare at Mr. 
               Garrison with disbelief. You could hear a pin drop.

               Garrison covers his mouth and looks around as if to say he 
               himself can't even believe what he just said.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh my God... What have I said?

               South Park residents gather around looking astounded. A 
               ominous silence spreads throughout the square as all eyes 
               rest on Mr. Garrison.

                                     TOWNSWOMAN
                              (gasping)
                         He said 'to HELL with Kathie Lee 
                         Gifford'!

               The whole town continues to stare in absolute shock. Shamed, 
               Mr. Garrison hangs his head.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you 
                         from directing our play.

               Mr. Garrison steps down from the stage.


               The sign at the town square reads 'Days until Kathie Lee 
               Arrives'. Dress rehearsal for the big event. Everyone in 
               South Park is making final preparations. The Mayor is 
               directing where everybody goes. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stand 
               on stage in little pioneer and Indian costumes. Cartman heaves 
               himself up onto the platform. The platform bulges and CREEKS 
               under his enormous weight.

                                     KYLE
                         Whoa Cartman, talk about wide load!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, I'm really starting to fill 
                         out nicely.

               Cartman flexes his arms.

                                     KYLE
                         You're not 'filling out nicely', 
                         you're fatter than ever!

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm not fat, I'm getting in shape!

                                     KYLE
                         Cartman, you're SUCH a fat ass, that 
                         when you walk down the street people 
                         go 'GOD DAMN IT, THAT'S A BIG FAT 
                         ASS!'

                                     CARTMAN
                         No they don't, you jealous weakling!

               A RANDOM TOWNSPERSON walks by and sees Cartman.

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         God Damn, that is a big fat ass!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey!

               Wendy walks in.

                                     WENDY
                         Hi guys.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, look, another hippie. Peace, 
                         Wendy.

                                     STAN
                         Shut up, Cartman!

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Singing)
                         Oh, two little hippies sittin' in a 
                         tree......!

               Wendy pulls Stan aside.

                                     WENDY
                         I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and 
                         get to the bottom of this!


               Establishing.


               The sign now reads 'Days Until Kathie Lee Arrives' and a 
               hand removes the '1' so that it reads 'TODAY!!'. 

               The sun rises over South Park as the whole town fills the 
               town square on the big day.

               Kyle stands with his little brother IKE, who bounces in and 
               out of frame wearing a blue jumpsuit with 'I LOVE Kathie 
               LEE' sewed on the front.


               Garrison walks down the street holding his large, black rifle. 
               Some townspeople notice him, but simply smile and wave hello.

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         Howdy, Mr. Garrison, nice gun!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Thank you.

                         Nice gun, Mr. Garrison!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Thanks. Hello Officer Barbrady.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Nice gun.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Thanks. Is there somewhere in town 
                         where I can get a good, clear shot-a-
                         view of Kathie Lee?

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Hmm... You know, I think the book 
                         depository would be a good bet.

               The depository, a two story, wooden building, stands utterly 
               empty on the other side of the street. Two vultures fly in a 
               circle around it.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Yes... Yes, that might do quite 
                         nicely. Thank you, Officer Barbrady.

               In a trance, Garrison slowly walks towards the depository.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         No problem.

               Suddenly, Barbrady rips a camera out of the hands of another 
               townsperson.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Ha! Caught you red handed! NO PICTURES 
                         OF Kathie LEE!!

               Barbrady grabs the guy and whisks him off.


               The Mayor stands on the stage nervously awaiting Kathie Lee's 
               arrival. She checks her watch.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Where is she?

               Meanwhile, the kids are backstage, getting ready for their 
               performance.

                                     CARTMAN
                         This is sweet. The camera crews are 
                         setting up, and I'm looking totally 
                         ripped. Beefcake BEEFCAKE!

               Cartman slurps down some more Weight Gain 4000.

                                     KYLE
                         I don't think they're gonna be able 
                         to get all of you in frame, Cartman.

               Suddenly, Wendy comes running up.

                                     WENDY
                         You guys! We have to stop him!!

                                     KYLE
                         Stop who?

                                     WENDY
                         Mr. Garrison! He's going to try to 
                         KILL Kathie Lee Gifford!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh no you don't! You're not gonna 
                         ruin MY moment of fame!

                                     WENDY
                         He's got a gun!

                                     CARTMAN
                         You gotta get over this whole jealousy 
                         thing alright. Seriously, just face 
                         it, I wrote a better paper than you.

                                     WENDY
                         It just so happens that I HAVE your 
                         paper and I KNOW why you won!

               Cartman panics.

                                     WENDY
                         There's something more important 
                         right now. Let's go!

                                     STAN
                         Wendy, you've got to Prioritize!! 
                         What's more IMPORTANT? Being on TV, 
                         or some stupid assassination?!

                                     WENDY
                         Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?

               Wendy makes a sad face at Stan. Stan's eyes droop.

                                     KYLE
                         Uh-oh, we're losing him.


                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         HERE SHE COMES!!!


               The townspeople all cheer and wave 'Welcome' flags. The lame 
               South Park marching band marches down the street.

               Following close behind is a vehicle that has been modified 
               with bullet-proof glass - just like the famous 'POPE MOBILE'. 
               Inside the glass bubble, waving happily is Kathie Lee Gifford. 

               The vehicle is also surrounded by several suited guards who 
               look like secret service. They are all looking around with 
               their fingers in their ears.


               The Pope-mobile continues down the street.

                                     TOWNSWOMAN
                         WE LOVE YOU Kathie LEE!!

               Kathie Lee responds, maybe she says 'I love you too', but 
               she is inaudible through the thick glass.


               The pope-mobile rides past them and finally reaches the stage. 
               The Mayor steps up to the microphone.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         It is with great pride and honor 
                         that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie 
                         Lee Gifford to South Park!

               The townspeople all cheer.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         And now, our very own South Park 
                         Elementary Chef will sing a special 
                         song in honor of Mrs. Lee-Gifford! 

               Kathie Lee rolls her eyes, and then tries desperately to 
               look thrilled, as Chef steps up to the mic.

                                     CHEF
                         Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know... 
                         Kathie-Lee, you are a very special 
                         woman...

               Groovy Isaac Hayes music starts to fade in. The BAND MEMBERS 
               are in the background getting funky.

                                     CHEF
                         I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler-
                         Moore way... Or special in a extra 
                         value meal at Happy Burger way... No 
                         no no no-

               Kathie Lee looks confused.

                                     CHEF
                         I mean SPECIAL... Like... The song 
                         of a hummingbird as it gets ready 
                         to... to find that female hummingbird, 
                         and -- make sweet love to it -- all 
                         night long. Just two hummingbirds 
                         moanin' and groanin' and letting 
                         their bodies caress and touch each 
                         other in ecstasy...

               Now the groove breaks into a full-fledged soul song.

                                     CHEF
                              (Singing)
                         Ooh Kathie Lee 
                         How I'd love to lay you down 
                         And lick every inch of your body 
                         with my tongue.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         What???

                                     CHEF
                         Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy. 
                         How 'bout you and me?

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         What???

               Kathie Lee is in absolute shock. The Mayor tries to stop 
               Chef.

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                              (Grabbing the mic)
                         Uh, thank you Chef for that 
                         heartwarming song-

                                     CHEF
                              (Still singing)
                         Make sweet love.....

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                              (in total shock)
                         THANK YOU, CHEF!!

               The music stops. A few people applaud. Chef is hurried off 
               the stage.

                                     CHEF
                         God bless you Kathie Lee!!

               Kathie Lee waves from inside her bubble, again, trying to 
               look happy, but visibly uncomfortable.


               Wendy and Stan frantically run through the crowd. They spot 
               Officer Barbrady.

                                     WENDY TESTABURGER
                         Officer Barbrady! Mr. Garrison is 
                         about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to 
                         find him!

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         What? You mean the teacher? Wait a 
                         minute...

               Barbrady thinks. A thought bubble appears above him, replaying 
               the scene from earlier.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Thanks. Is there somewhere in town 
                         where I can get a good, clear shot-a-
                         view of Kathie Lee?

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Hmm... You know, I think the book 
                         depository would be a good bet.

               Barbrady keeps thinking. Wendy patiently waits. Again the 
               same scene plays.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         I think the book depository would be 
                         a good bet. 
                         Book depository would be a good bet. 
                         Book depository good bet 
                         Book depository

               Finally, Barbrady stops thinking.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Damn! He could be anywhere! I'll 
                         send out an A.P.B.! 

               Barbrady dashes off. Wendy sighs.

                                     STAN
                         Wendy, look!

               Stan points up to the book depository where Mr. Hat is peeping 
               over a gun barrel that is sticking out of the second story 
               window. Wendy gasps and runs toward it.


                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         And now, Here to present the award 
                         for the Environmental essay to our 
                         own Eric Kaufman-

                                     CARTMAN
                         Cartman, God Dammit!!!

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         -Is your favorite celebrity and mine; 
                         Kathie LEE GIFFORD!!!

               The townspeople go nuts. Kathie Lee, still in her large 
               bubble, is hoisted onto the stage. The glass holder falls 
               over at first, but the servicemen are right there to pick 
               her back up.

               Now Kathie Lee speaks, but the glass is so thick that we 
               still can't quite hear what she is saying.

                                     KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
                         Thank you! How I love you all!


                                     KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
                              (Still mostly inaudible)
                         It is with great honor and pride 
                         that I present the winner this trophy.

               Now Kathie Lee bends down and picks up the trophy. She opens 
               the door hatch in her bubble and takes a step out.

                                     KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
                         Eric, would you please come up here.

               Cartman walks slowly up the stairs to the stage, fat literally 
               dragging behind him.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Here it is! My big moment of fame!


               Cartman steps off of the stairs and puts his weight on the 
               stage. The stage immediately collapses on his side, firing 
               Kathie Lee up into the air like a rocket.

                                     KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
                         AAAAGGHH!!!

               Cartman falls underneath the stage as the bullet flies past 
               where Kathie Lee was standing - and heads directly for Kenny.

                                     KENNY
                         Mm Nmm!

               The bullet hits Kenny, whose poor little body goes flying 
               across the stage, then he lands upside down in a large barrel 
               of water, which immediately turns blood red.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh my God! they killed Kenny!
                              (Shaking his fist)
                         You bastard!

               The Secret Servicemen take action and jump all over Kathie 
               Lee, protecting her body from any more bullets.

                                     SERVICEMEN
                         GUN!! GUN!!

               The men then quickly shove Kathie Lee in her bubble and drive 
               away.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey!! Come back!! We didn't even get 
                         to do our play!!

               But within seconds Kathie Lee is gone. Her entire entourage 
               disappears over the horizon.

                                     T.V. CREW DIRECTOR
                         I guess that's it guys. Wrap it up.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey, wait a minute! When do I get to 
                         be on television?!

                                     T.V. CREW DIRECTOR
                         Forget it, kid. No Kathie Lee, no 
                         public interest.

                                     CARTMAN
                         But I won the environmental essay 
                         contest!!

               Wendy Testaburger jumps onto the stage.

                                     WENDY TESTABURGER
                         You don't DESERVE to win, Cartman, 
                         and YOU know it!

               Wendy steps up to the microphone and holds up a VERY thick 
               stack of papers.

                                     WENDY TESTABURGER
                         I'm holding Cartman's award winning 
                         paper! It's actually nothing more 
                         than 'Walden' with Henry David 
                         Thoreau's name crossed out and 
                         Cartman's name written in its place!

               The townspeople all look at each other. Cartman gulps.

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         Who cares?

                                     TOWNSPERSON #2
                         Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

               The townspeople all concur and begin to disperse.

                                     STAN
                         What about not holding anything 
                         against the person who wins?

                                     WENDY TESTABURGER
                         Well not if it's CARTMAN!! Hey where 
                         are you all going?!

               The townspeople all disappear, leaving the kids alone.

                                     WENDY TESTABURGER
                              (Vanquished)
                         They don't even know what Walden is.
                              (Shouting again)
                         I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd 
                         all know what it was!!!

                                     STAN
                         Come on, Wendy. Kyle's mom'll make 
                         us tuna fish sandwiches.

                                     WENDY TESTABURGER
                         Oh, what the hell.

                                     MAYOR
                              (Sobbing)
                         NO!! NO!! Now I'll be stuck in this 
                         podunk town forever with all these 
                         stupid, hick, redneck, jobless, truck 
                         driving idiots!!

                                     AIDE
                         Uh, mayor, the mic is on.

               Suddenly, the doors to the book depository open, and Officer 
               Barbrady appears holding Mr. Garrison's left arm.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         Thought you could get away with it, 
                         eh Mr. Hat?!

                                     MR. HAT
                         Well, I would have gotten away with 
                         it if it weren't for those meddling 
                         kids.

                                     OFFICER BARBRADY
                         You're lucky you missed Kathie Lee 
                         Gifford and that nobody got hurt.

               Barbrady throws Garrison in the back seat, gets in the car 
               and speeds away past Kenny's little bleeding body.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:


               The white mental hospital sits pleasantly between two mountain 
               peaks.
