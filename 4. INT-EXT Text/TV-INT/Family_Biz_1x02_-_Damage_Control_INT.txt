      1:00 AM.  ELI KELLER (16, gaming demi-god) plays SILT, a
      first person shooter PC game.  Its sandy-blue colors wash
      across his face in the darkened room.  Eli rocks.

      We hear CHA-BOOM from the screen.  Victory for Eli!

                                    ELI
                          (to the screen)
                    You just got owned.  You enter my
                    realm you... ah... wipe your feet! 
                    For... I!  Am!  Eli!

      And we hear alien warriors GASP, CRY their last.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      AVALON KELLER (15, social striver) ignores the alien death
      CRIES.  Cell glued to her ear, she chats with a gal pal.

                                      AVALON
                          (into phone)
                    No, that's just Eli.  Hormones,
                    aliens... he's going through that
                    boy phase.

      RONNIE KELLER (11, sensible) is in her bed watching the ALL
      NIGHT SHOPPING CHANNEL on a small TV.

                                      RONNIE
                    Shhhh!  This is important.

      There's a BEEP BEEP on Avalon's line.

                                      AVALON
                          (into phone)
                    Oh.  One sec.  Another call.

      DAVE KELLER (early 40s, sleep deprived, former corporate
      gunslinger) stumbles in...half asleep.

                                    DAVE
                    Wha... what's going on?      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08              2.
  

                                      AVALON
                    Nothing, Dad.  Go back to sleep.
                          (into phone)
                    No, Trace did not snub me.

                    That's just a rumor.  I'm sure she'll
                    return my calls.  Some time.

      From the living room below we hear more ALIENS DIE.

                                    ELI (O.S.)
                            (triumphant)

                    Eli.  Downstairs.

                                    DAVE
                    Eli's in trouble..?

                          (head clears)
                    Oh yeah, riiight. Eli is in trouble.
                          (to Ronnie)

                    I am.

                                    DAVE
                    Get to sleep.

                    I don't have a bedtime.

                    That's just my Dad. It's like he's
                    always around now.  Yeah, we're
                      adjusting.

      Dave shoots Avalon the classic Dad glare. LULLABY MUSIC plays.

      And Dave kills the light.  From the darkness...

                    Hey!

      Eli wins.  Eli pumps his fist in victory.

                                    ELI
                    Okay!  Bring on the Seventh Level!

      Eli leans back in his chair.  Content.  At peace.  Falls
      instantly asleep.

      A moment later, Dave pads into the room.

                                    DAVE
                    Eli do you have any idea what time..?

      Dave reaches to turn off the computer.

                                    ELI
                          (eyes closed)
                    Don't. 

      Dave reaches again.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                          (eyes closed)
                    No.  Seventh level.

      Dave reaches forward one last time.

                          (eyes still closed)
                    No.  What did I say? 

                                    DAVE
                    How does he do that?

      Defeated, Dave takes off.

      HOLD ON Eli blissfully snoring as we -

      FADE IN:


      Eli and his best bud DAKOTA TOYOTA walk and talk.

                                    ELI
                    Last night, I took it to the next
                    level.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    With Caitlin?  'Bout time, man.

                                    ELI
                    What are you talking about?

      Dakota Toyota realizes that he may have said too much.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Dunno.  What are you talking about?

                                    ELI
                    Silt.  Seventh Level.  I qualified 
                    for the International Silt Tourney.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    You're a lock.  There is no gamer or
                    shut-in alive who can take you.  Dude!

                                    ELI
                    Dude!

      Like jungle beasts, they bump chests.  Dakota falls back
      against the locker.

                                      DAKOTA TOYOTA
                    Owwwww!  That hurt.

                                    ELI
                    In more ways than one. 

      Eli extracts a mashed chocolate bar from his breast pocket...
      shrugs... unwraps and eats.

                                    ELI (CONT'D)
                    Later, man.

      They split off and Eli shambles to -


      - where he sees his bud CAITLIN (16, gamer chick).  Caitlin
      tries to play it cool... but she's smitten.  As they pass -      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08              5.

                    Hi... Eli.

                                    ELI
                          (oblivious)
                    Hey, Caitlin.

      And Eli moves on.  Avalon falls into step with him.

                                      AVALON
                    Hey, big brother.

                                    ELI
                    Oooookay, what do you want?

                                      AVALON
                    Yellow Stayne.

                                    ELI
                    Man, I really hope you are talking
                    about the band.

      Eli peels off into a class trying to end their talk but --

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


      -- Avalon sits at Eli's table to continue their conversation.

                                      AVALON
                    You are going to book Yellow Stayne
                    for our house party.

                                    ELI
                    Didn't Dad say no more unsupervised
                    parties?  No more late nights?  No
                    more fun... of any kind?

                                      AVALON
                    Exactly.  This is a major crisis.  I
                    heard that my social status has
                    slipped.

                                    ELI
                    If you're still hanging with me it's
                    not just a rumour.

                                      AVALON
                    We have to do something.  We need to
                    do some serious damage control.

                                    ELI
                    "Damage control?"  Who talks like
                    that?

                                                                                WIPE TO:      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08              6.

                    Why do we have to throw a party?

                                      AVALON
                    Not just a party.  The biggest bash
                    ever.  Damage control, remember. 
                    How do we turn this around?  We need
                    to boost my - I mean our - social
                    standing.
                          (off his confusion)
                    Let me put this in terms you
                      understand.  Basketball.

                                                                                FLASH TO:      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08              7.
  


      ...where Avalon strides through the gym decked out in her
      Team Avalon Basketball jersey. 

      Her jersey falls right to the hardwood.  She passes...

      STUDENTS wear a mix of basketball uniforms and regular street
      wear.  They flirt with each other on the benches or dribble
      their balls to class.

                                      AVALON
                          (narrating)
                    High school is just like basketball. 
                    And I am a star player.  I can see
                    every social play before it happens.

      Avalon tosses the ball.  It rolls to...

      ELI AND HIS BUDS.

      Eli stops the ball with his foot.  He sits with Caitlin and
      Dakota Toyota completely "nerded out" playing computer games. 

                                      AVALON (CONT'D)
                    Okay, Eli, there's you and your "buds"
                    trapped in your own zone.

      ANGLE ON THE BENCH -

      Eyes never leaving his game, Eli kicks the ball to - 

                                      AVALON (CONT'D)
                    The Drama Club.  Warming the bench.

      Black clad THESPIANS stare out in teen despair.

                    They're dying to get in the game but
                    don't know how.  And at Center Court,
                    holding court...

      TRACY DUPONT-ROYMONT (16, sleek, powerful, African Canadian). 
      Self-absorbed and self-assured, Trace spins a basketball on
      her finger and glitters in the silvery spot light. 

      She is attended by her POSSE: glam girls OCEAN, RIVER & BROOKE
      guard her.  Trace tosses the ball away.

      BACK TO ELI.  He looks up from his video game.

      Avalon tries to get through to Trace but the Posse play the
      man (Avalon) and blocks her out.

                    Trace is the center of the universe.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    If the universe had bleachers and
                    smelled like old socks. 

                                      AVALON
                    So I need to throw a great party to
                    impress Trace.  How can I impress
                    her if she won't come to my party? 
                    So I make my play.  I get the word
                    out.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    Today is Friday.

                                    ELI
                    That's a problem.      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08             23.

                      Challenge.

                                    ELI
                    Problem.  Problem.  Problem. 

                                      AVALON
                    You can do it.  Yes, you can.
                          (claps, a cheerleader)
                    Okay!  Team!  Let's go!  Go!  Go! 
                    Okay.  Team.

      Eli just stares at her.

                                      AVALON (CONT'D)
                    A little spirit here? 
                          (pointed)
                    Okay.  Who wants to dance with Trace?

                                    ELI
                          (claps)
                    Let's go.  Go, go, go!  Okay.  Team.

                                      AVALON
                    Gooooo ELI!  Whooooo!

                                    ELI
                    Yeah.

      OFF Eli, thinking things through -

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Dave stares out the window.

      Eli stares at Dave staring out the window.  KNOCKS lightly
      on the door jamb.

      Dave turns...

                                    DAVE
                    Hey.  Shouldn't you be heading to
                    school?

                                    ELI
                    Yeah.  I just wanted to talk.

                                    DAVE
                    Do I have this in my book?

                                    ELI
                    No.  Dad, this is that spontaneous
                    talk thing.      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08             24.
  

                                    DAVE
                    Okay.  I'm good with that.  What's
                    up?

                                    ELI
                    I've been thinking.  A lot.  About
                    this week.  About something you once
                    told me.

                                    DAVE
                          (quoting Dave-isms)
                    The customer is always right except
                    when they're wrong?

                                    ELI
                    No.

                                    DAVE
                    Keep to your knitting?

                                    ELI
                    No.

                                    DAVE
                    Always tighten the lid on the mayo?

                                                                                FLASH TO:


      Avalon struggles to uncap the mayonnaise.

                                      AVALON
                    Dad!

                                                                                FLASH TO:


      Back to Eli and Dave.  Dave looks around, trying to place
      the scream of anguish.

                                    ELI
                    No, Dad.  About you getting back out
                    there.  Out of the attic.  You told
                    me that there are no problems in
                    life, only challenges.

                                    DAVE
                    Well that was a stupid thing to say. 
                    You're sixteen and I wouldn't tell
                    your sisters this but we have a real
                    honking big problem.

                                    ELI
                    Uh... really?      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08             25.
  

                                    DAVE
                    I am out of a job.

                                    ELI
                    You know in many ways I'm like still
                    a kid so...

                                    DAVE
                    You know how hard it is for someone
                    my age to get his career moving again?

                                    ELI
                    ...so you don't have to tell me
                      everything.

                                    DAVE
                    I'm a guy who solves problems and I
                    don't know how to solve this.

                                    ELI
                          (flailing)
                    But.  But.  But you could try.  Right?

                                    DAVE
                          (beat, realization)
                    Yeah.  I could.

      Eli realizes he has an opening and runs with it.

                                    ELI
                    And, and you're going to go out there
                    and try, try all day - out there -
                    at least until ten p.m. That would
                    make us ah... so proud of you, Dad.

                                    DAVE
                    I'm turning this around, Eli.  I am
                    turning this ship around.  I am.

                                    ELI
                    Yeah!

                                    DAVE
                    Come here you inspirational little
                    Dude.

      Dave crushes Eli in a bear hug.

                                    ELI
                    Dad?  Oxygen?

                                    DAVE
                    We're gonna do this.

                                    ELI
                    Yes, we are!

      OFF Dave, misting up -      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08             26.
  


      ON STAGE and without missing a beat, Yellow Stain WAILS
      through their three chord teen angst punk ballad.  The room
      ROCKS.  A mosh pit of Teens pogo, swarm, collide to the music.

      Trace arrives.  Avalon yells a greeting (overwhelmed by the
      music).      FAMILY BIZ:      DAMAGE CONTROL               20  May 08             28.
  

      Trace nods with excitement.  She approves.

      Avalon smiles, heads her way through the throng -

      ELI JOINS TRACE -

                                    ELI
                    Hey!

                                      TRACE
                    Hi!  This is - !  This is...

                                    ELI
                    I know!

      Yellow Stayne hits their power chorus.

                                      TRACE
                    Come on, let's dance!

      Eli can't believe his luck.  Eli and Trace (and everyone)
      dances.

      The song, teens, lights build to a frenzy. 

      Trace and Eli share a smile, look in each other's eyes and -

        BHHHHSSSSVVVVVMMMMM

      The lights and sound die.  Just.  Like.  That.

      REVEAL DAVID KELLER

      He holds up the plug he just pulled. 

                                    DAVE
                    I'm back.

                    I can't believe this. He did it again.  
                          (protest)
                    Dad.  Poor timing.  Could we discuss
                    this...

                    Oh we'll discuss this.  Later.

                    That's it, folks.  Wrap it up.

                                      AVALON
                    No.

      Teens ROAR back.

                                    DAVE

                    Hey, that's my guacamole!

      Dave grabs back a bowl from a passing TEEN.

      And as Trace leaves she passes -

                    Later, Avalon.  Much later, Eli.

      Mick Yellow is post-performance pumped, sweaty.  Stayne, way
      cooler, wears his cap low over his eyes.

                    We ROCKED.  Just like in '83.

                    Back to the roots, man.  Whooooooooo! 
                          (beat)
                    And you what's even better, Stayne? 
                    I think we brought a little light to
                    the lives of the Keller family.  I
                    heard that their pa is unemployed. 
                    Lives in the attic.  Sad.  We should
                    sit back, collect our royalties and
                    count our blessings.  Right, Stayne? 
                    Stayne?

      No response.  Mick Yellow lifts Stayne's cap.  Stayne is
      asleep.  As the LULLABY THEME PLAYS:
