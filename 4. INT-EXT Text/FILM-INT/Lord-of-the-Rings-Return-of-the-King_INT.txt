Oh, you can search - up and down
As many lands as can be found

Comes from the Green Dragon!

MERRY (cont'd)
Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?
With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...
MERRY (cont'd)
Pippin, are you mad?
PIPPIN
I just want to look at it. Just one more
time.
MERRY
Put it back! Put - it - back!

Pippin!
As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his

Pippin!
PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .
THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.
PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.
MERRY
Help! Someone help him!
GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .
GANDALF

enemy's plan.
GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.
GANDALF (cont'd)
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
our enemy one thing.
The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .
GANDALF (cont'd)
The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
not as weak as he supposed. There is

How far is Minas Tirith?

Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and

MERRY
Here - something for the road.
PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.
PIPPIN
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.
At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.
GANDALF
Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
Steward of Gondor.
DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

Pippin!
PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD . . .
PIPPIN
I offer you my service, such as it is, in
payment of this debt.
DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:
GANDALF

Get up!

My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming

You still have friends - you are not alone

Rohan. Light the beacons.
DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.
DENETHOR
(softly)
You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
you think the eyes of the White Tower are
blind? I have seen more than you know. With
your left hand you would use me as a shield
against Mordor and with your right you
would seek to supplant me.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW.
DENETHOR (cont'd)
(contemptuous)
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
yes. Word has reached my ears of this
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
North - last of a ragged house, long bereft
of Lordship.

I do not think we should so lightly abandon

FARAMIR
What would you have me do?
DENETHOR
I will not yield the River and Pelennor
unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.
FARAMIR
My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
DENETHOR
Much must be risked in war. Is there a
Captain here who still has the courage to
do his Lord's will?
CLOSE ON: FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth.
FARAMIR

Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
PIPPIN
(uneasy)
Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
own people ... but we have no songs for
great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
sing of anything more terrible than wind or
rain.
DENETHOR
And why should your songs be unfit for my
halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
sing me a song!
PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.
PIPPIN V/0
Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread.

Until the stars are all alight.
