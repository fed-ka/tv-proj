      INT. GLASS-WALLED OFFICE -- DAY

      ANGLE ON A MAN IN A BLACK SUIT SITTING BEHIND A DESK

      Smarmy gym-and-suntan disciple with a conservative haircut. 
      This is DALE BARNES (38). 

      SOMEONE FACES HIM

      Standing. JOE MACMILLAN (34). A man these black suits were 
      made for. But despite the jawline, the executive contour 
      hair, he s a million miles away right now.

                                  BARNES
                    C mon, Joe. It s just business. 

      Without a word, MacMillan turns and leaves through the glass 
      door.

      INT. PRISTINE HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

      HIS BLACK WINGTIPS

      Walking at a swift clip, toes glancing against the bottom of 
      the frame as they move forward in rhythm. 

      A BLACK BRIEFCASE

      Suspended by the grip of MacMillan s hand. White shirt cuff 
      exposed a flawless quarter inch from a black suit sleeve. 

      EXT. HEADQUARTERS ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS 

      MacMillan steps outside to a cement walkway leading out to a 
      vast employee parking lot. 

      He reaches the walkway s end. Stops. 

      Just stands there. 

      FADE UP SUPER:  Armonk, New York. 1981. 

      EXT. PARKING LOT -- LATER

      SLAMMING closed the trunk of a black 1980 Audi Quattro. 

      HIS HAND REACHES INSIDE THE SUIT BREAST POCKET

      Pulls out a pair of Serengeti sunglasses. 

      Places them over his eyes.                                                                                      2.


      EXT. NEW ORCHARD ROAD -- LATER

      The Audi ROARS past the company entrance sign: IBM.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. RURAL NEW YORK HIGHWAY -- LATER

      The GROWING ROAR of the Audi. It appears, rockets down a two-
      line asphalt in a matter of seconds, kicking up dead leaves. 

      INT. AUDI QUATTRO -- CONTINUOUS

      ANGLE ON MacMillan s hand, pulling the floor shifter down 
      into fourth gear, the road s reflection in his glasses.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. COASTAL HIGHWAY -- LATER

      The Audi traverses a wooded lane that opens onto the rocky 
      coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Going faster.

      INT. AUDI QUATTRO -- CONTINUOUS

      MacMillan is blank as he throws the car into fifth. The blur 
      of water stretches to the horizon outside his window.

      THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, an approaching hard bank turn. 
      Nothing but guard rail. Not a problem at normal speed.

      ANGLE ON the speedometer climbing...

      EXT. COASTAL HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS

      The Audi SMASHES through the guard rail somewhere around 110. 

      A direct hit. No swerve. Intentional. 

      The rail gives like paper and the Audi is now a missile being 
      shot out over the white water of the coastline. 

      It sails high, engine REVVED and floored before...

      THE FRONT END HITS THE WATERLINE LIKE A BRICK WALL

      DESTROYING half of the car with a THUNDER CLAP. 

      A few seconds pass before lapping waves begin to fold around 
      the vehicle and its driver. No movement within. Completely 
      arrested.


                                      END TEASER                                                                                      3.


                                        ACT I

      INT. HONKY TONK BAR -- NIGHT

      SUPER: TEN MONTHS LATER

      An honest to God COWBOY drops in a quarter, makes his punch 
      button selections on a jukebox. Two seconds pass until the 
      machine lets loose with STEEL GUITAR and MERLE HAGGARD. 

      The cowboy takes his mug of beer from atop the juke and 
      actually moseys through a late night crowd of legitimate and 
      gregarious country western folk spanning generations.

      ANGLE ON the bar itself, tracking across its patrons--all 
      tough men in hats, jeans--ladies with perms, chewing gum, 
      heavy eyeshadow.

      THE LAST MAN AT THE BAR sticks out like a sore thumb. He 
      isn t country; hell, he ain t much of anything. Ragged hair, 
      big glasses, thick unkempt mustache. Lots of empty mugs. 

      This is GORDON CLARK (31). 

                                  CLARK
                          (to bartender)
                    Can I get another Shiner?

      A fresh mug of beer slides his way but it doesn t seem to 
      cheer him up any. A YOUNG BUCK (early 20 s) sallies up next 
      to him, square head in a wide-brimmed hat. 

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                          (calling back)
                    HEY, WHATCHOO WANT?

      A chubby YOUNG GIRL (same age) appears next to him, jostling 
      Clark as she squeezes in. 

                                  YOUNG GIRL
                          (thick accent)
                    I dunno, gimme a beer or somethin .

      The young buck holds up two fingers for the bartender. Then 
      glances over at Clark. He has to talk over the music:

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                    You down an  out, friend?

                                  CLARK
                    Guess you could say that.                                                                                      4.


                                  YOUNG GIRL
                          (gross)
                    What s wrong, sugar?

                                  CLARK
                    I hate my job.

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                    WHAT S THAT?

                                  CLARK
                    I HATE MY JOB.

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                    Yeah? Whatchoo do?

      Clark shakes his head, trying to return to his solitary beer.

                                  YOUNG BUCK (CONT D)
                          (to girl)
                    What d he say?

                                  YOUNG GIRL
                    He didn t say nothin .

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                          (to Clark, louder)
                    Hey, whatchoo do?

                                  CLARK
                    I m a systems programmer.

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                    What?

                                  CLARK
                      Computers.

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                    Oh man, that s some future shit. 

      Lull in the conversation as the two youngins get their beers.

                                  YOUNG BUCK (CONT D)
                    So whatchoo sad about? Computers, 
                    man, I tell you what. You gon  make 
                    some big ol  money with that. 

                                  CLARK
                          (turning to them more)
                    I ll tell you what I m sad about. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      5.

                                  CLARK (CONT'D)
                    I m sad because right now I d 
                    rather be in Northern California 
                    living the sweet life, as opposed 
                    to sitting in some Hee Haw rerun. 
                          (pause)
                    No offense. I m having a bad night.

                                  YOUNG GIRL
                      California! Ain t Reagan from 
                      California? That s one good thing 
                    come out of the Left Coast.

                                  CLARK
                    Reagan? You know he opposed equal 
                    rights for women, right? That s 
                    real enlightened.
                          (swigs beer, to girl)
                    You are a woman, aren t you?

      The young buck s face drops, as does the girl s. Clark takes 
      another gulp of beer as the buck steps toward him, ready. 

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                    You wanna apologize to the lady?

                                  CLARK
                    Would it make a difference?

      The buck seizes Clark by the shirt, pulls him to his feet.

                                  YOUNG BUCK
                    Not for you.

                                  CLARK
                    Then no. 

      And the buck BELTS HIM ACROSS THE FACE HARD, sending Clark to 
      the sawdust floor. 

      The crowd MURMURS as Clark rises, his nose badly bloodied. 
      But he grins a little bit as he steadies himself on a chair. 
      Then...

      HE SMASHES THE CHAIR ACROSS THE YOUNG BUCK S BACK

      Knocking him to the floor. Male patrons tackle Clark back 
      down and proceed to kick the shit out of him. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DALLAS COUNTY LOCK-UP -- LATER

      A heavy metal door swings open with a BUZZ.                                                                                      6.


                                  DALLAS DEPUTY
                    Gordon Clark.

      THE DALLAS DEPUTY waits, then leads Clark out of the holding 
      area, tight grip on the programmer s arm. 

                                  CLARK
                    Hi, honey.

      REVEAL DONNA CLARK (30), facing him, arms crossed. She s got 
      the pretty face of a high school sweetheart, but the grim 
      frown of someone who s put up with a lot of shit. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DONNA S STATION WAGON -- LATER

      Donna drives in silence, Clark next to her, his nose taped. 

                                  CLARK
                    You didn t have to bring the kids 
                    with you. 

      ANGLE ON their two daughters belted in the backseat, HALEY 
      (4) and JOANIE (6), spitting images of their mother, blonde 
      hair and all. They re in pajamas, out cold.

                                  DONNA
                          (without looking at him)
                    I figured they d never been to 
                    Dallas County Jail before, so why 
                    not bring them along. 

                                  CLARK
                    C mon, Donna.

                                  DONNA
                    You re right, I should ve asked the 
                    neighbors to watch them at 2 a.m. 
                     Hey, can you take Haley and Joanie 
                    for a bit, Gordon got in a bar 
                    fight again. 

                                  CLARK
                    Look, I m sorry--

                                  DONNA
                    I get that you re unhappy, Gordon.

                                  CLARK
                    It s the job, it s this whole 
                    place, it s this whole situation--                                                                                      7.


                                  DONNA
                    Things didn t turn out how we 
                    planned. So what? 

                                  CLARK
                    Don t you miss it?

                                  DONNA
                    What do you want me to say? I ll 
                    say it again, like I always do, 
                    Gordon. We can move back to Palo 
                    Alto tomorrow. What I can t do is 
                    build a time machine and get us 
                    back to Palo Alto six years ago.

                                  CLARK
                    Donna, the choice was stay or have 
                    Joanie. I took the job at Cardiff 
                    Giant so we wouldn t have to-- 

                                  DONNA
                          ( keep your voice down )
                    Joanie was coming no matter what. 
                          (pause)
                    You know what I think? I think you 
                    were scared, because in California 
                    it was just a bunch of us smoking 
                    dope and fiddling with circuit 
                    boards in Steve s garage. So we 
                    left.

                                  CLARK
                          (too loud)
                    Right, and then Steve shaved his 
                    beard and made a hundred million 
                    dollars. Is that your point? 

      Haley wakes up in the back seat.

                                  HALEY
                    Daddy?

      Donna glares at her husband. Are you happy now? 

                                  DONNA
                    Sorry, girls. Daddy s pretty tired.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT S OFFICE -- DAY

      The room where your dad s boss held court. Enviously big. 
      Credenzas with framed family pictures (wife, two young boys) 
      shadowed behind prominently displayed sales awards.                                                                                       8.


      But this isn t IBM. The windows look out onto a flat and 
      seemingly endless horizon of low-rise buildings and prairie.

      We re a long way from New York. 

      ANGLE ON JOHN BOSWORTH (48), an eagle resting in permanent 
      judgment, comfortably in power behind his desk. When he 
      speaks, it s equal parts brass tacks and Texas drawl. 

      But right now, he s listening. 

                                  MACMILLAN (O.S.)
                    Eight weeks inpatient, six months 
                    physical therapy. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    So why d you do it?

      ANGLE ON Joe MacMillan seated across from him, somehow back 
      from the dead. In his black suit, but with a vivid red tie. A 
      small scar runs along the outside of his eye.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I don t recall putting my car 
                    accident on the resume.

      Bosworth picks up a single sheet of paper from his desk.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Let s talk about what I do see on 
                    it. Three bold letters. I. B. M.
                          (tosses paper down)
                    I know what IBM is. I also know 
                    what IBM ain t. And anything that 
                    ain t IBM is cheaper, better, 
                    faster. That s what this company 
                    lives by. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Well, John, that s what General 
                    Electric thought. And RCA. And 
                    UNIVAC--

                                  BOSWORTH
                    And Burroughs, and NCR, and 
                    Honeywell and Control Data, and 
                    blah, blah, blah. I know all the 
                    companies that IBM has chased out 
                    of this business or out of business 
                    entirely. Cardiff Giant is not one 
                    of them, and it won t be. 
                          (pause)
                    Look at you; same suit, different 
                    tie. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      9.

                                  BOSWORTH (CONT'D)
                    Dallas is pretty far from Armonk, 
                    New York, son, and that s no 
                    accident. You think I m gonna see 
                    something other than a dyed-in-the-
                    wool company stooge? 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    There is one thing IBM knows how to 
                    do.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    An  what s that?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Make money. That s what I did for 
                    them. And I did it very well.

      Bosworth sits back in his chair, evaluating him.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    ...I know. 
                          (pause)
                    Look, you wouldn t even be sittin  
                    in front of me if Al didn t like 
                    you. And he liked you. I m just 
                    tryin  to figure out why. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I m a heavy hitter. You bring me 
                    on, you legitimize your sales 
                    force, this company, this town. 
                    Maybe Silicon Prairie takes the 
                    stage with Silicon Valley. Maybe 
                    the suits back east will sit up and 
                    pay attention. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    I ll be honest with you, Joe. 
                      Personally, I think you might be a 
                    basket case. 
                          (pause)
                    But at the end of the day, I need 
                    someone who can come in here and 
                    blow the balls off the numbers.
                          (pause)
                    An  I will tell you this is systems 
                    software, straight up. Scheduling, 
                    database, doc management, who does 
                    it go to, when, how many copies, 
                      everything that makes a mainframe 
                    purr. It ain t sexy, but it sure as 
                    hell makes us some serious money.                                                                                    10.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    What about PC s? That s the real 
                    way to get at IBM. Somebody could 
                    pull the rug right out from under 
                    them--

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Did you not hear me? Cardiff Giant 
                    doesn t tussle around with any PC 
                    crap. As a cardinal damn rule we 
                    are strictly disinterested in 
                    throwing rocks at the IBM hornet s 
                    nest. That s how we get our name 
                    added to that list of companies KIA 
                    against Big Blue. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    PC s are anybody s game to grab if 
                    you do it right.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Why do you even want this job, you 
                    were pullin  300 back east.

      MacMillan is without an immediate answer for the first time.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Don t worry, I ll break numbers. I 
                    always do.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Yeah, yeah, and I ve got an in-
                    ground swimming pool. Why are you 
                    really here?  

      A beat. Some honesty seeps through MacMillan s veneer. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I need... something different. 

      Bosworth takes that in. Then stands up, as does MacMillan. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    You answer to Al and Al answers to 
                    me. And I m the SVP of Sales so 
                    you re dogshit until you close a 
                    deal. Understand?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I do.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Good. We re married. You may now go 
                    make your numbers.                                                                                    11.


      They shake hands, purely professional. A battle of direct and 
      challenging eye contact. MacMillan begins to leave. 

                                  BOSWORTH (CONT D)
                      MacMillan.

      MacMillan stops at the door, turns.

                                  BOSWORTH (CONT D)
                    Are you better?

      Long beat.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I am.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CLARK S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT

      Familiar dark wood cabinets and earth-tone countertops of a 
      1980s American middle-class home. 

      ANGLE ON Clark as he closes the fridge, six-pack in hand. 
      Wrinkled dress shirt untucked, tie loose, barefoot in brown 
      polyester pants. Bridge of his nose badly black & blue. 

      DONNA ENTERS--the DIN of the living room suggests that she 
      and the kids are watching prime time. 

                                  DONNA
                    How was work?

                                  CLARK
                          (heading for garage)
                    Hmph...

                                  DONNA
                    Hey.

      He stops. Turns. 

                                  DONNA (CONT D)
                    You gonna be all right?

                                  CLARK
                    I m sorry, I m just... look, I m 
                    gonna duck into the garage for 
                    awhile. 

      His face is a tired  please let me go.  She nods, and he 
      disappears through the darkness of the back door. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    12.


      INT. CLARK S GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

      ANGLE ON a record player, sitting atop a 1970s receiver with 
      a blue lit-up dash. Nothing digital here as the needle hits 
      the groove on Supertramp s  Crime of the Century. 

       BLOODY WELL RIGHT  LOUDLY PLAYS THROUGH THE SPEAKERS

      ANGLE ON Clark as he cracks a beer and lets loud stoner rock 
      wash over him. He closes his eyes... 

      ANGLE ON the garage space. The family cars never come in 
      here. This is a Silicon Valley DIY workshop right out of 
      1975. A sanctuary and homage to the life Clark once led. 

      Mixed in with the landscaping tools and power drills are 
      pristine circuit boards, monitors, monstrosities of 
        electronics. Apple II s, Atari 2600 s, Altairs, TI-99 s in 
      various states of functionality, assembly. 

      The MUSIC continues as we...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MACMILLAN S CONDO -- LATE NIGHT

      Sleek, all-business housing of the new Reagan-era. This unit 
      is sprawling, but has hardly any furniture. A handful of 
      cardboard moving boxes lie on the floor unopened. A tube TV 
      on the floor has silver-haired Johnny Carson on mute. 

      ANGLE ON one moving box as MacMillan--in suit pants and a 
      white undershirt--rips open the top. He pulls out a back 
      issue of Byte magazine. 

      CLOSE ON the vicious scars down his left arm. Far worse than 
      the superficial glance near his eye. 

      INTERCUT -- MACMILLAN S CONDO / CLARK S GARAGE

      -- Clark sits at a fold-out card table, working on an 
      original Apple I hooked to an old tube TV...

      -- ANGLE ON the screen, almost all the light in the room 
      coming from the glow of BASIC as it scrawls across the 
      screen, Clark rapidly typing out the programming language...

      -- ANGLE ON MacMillan sitting at small table eating a peanut 
      butter and jelly sandwich, drinking a glass of milk as he 
      reads under a single overhead light, Byte next to him...

      -- LATER, Clark pulls apart a Commodore computer box in his 
      lap, his face betraying the joy of a kid opening a Christmas 
      present...                                                                                    13.


      -- CLOSER ON the article MacMillan reads. Entitled:

      IBM S TROJAN HORSE: HOW OPEN ARCHITECTURE WILL UNDO BIG BLUE

      The phone RINGS. A cordless plugged in on the floor. 
      MacMillan looks up. Goes to it, answers.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Hello?
                          (long pause)
                    Yes, I cancelled the prescriptions. 
                          (long pause)
                    Because I don t need them anymore.

      -- ANGLE ON a big brimming tool box as Clark looks for just 
      the right screwdriver. He checks a few drawers, finds one, 
      then finds a rolled-up bag of choice pot...

      -- ANGLE ON MacMillan as he hangs up. Returns to the table.  
      Stares off for a moment. Then comes back to the magazine. 

      -- ANGLE ON Clark now grooving more easily to the music as he 
      furiously types more lines of BASIC into the Apple I...

      -- ANGLE ON Donna, reading in bed. She puts her book on the 
      night stand, turns the lamp off. The digital clock reads 1:35 
      a.m. She rolls over. No one there. Only MUFFLED SUPERTRAMP 
      still coming from the garage. 

      -- ANGLE ON MacMillan as he continues to read. CLOSER ON the 
      magazine byline. MacMillan takes a red pen and underlines the 
      name until the paper grows wet and soft with ink. It reads...

       By Gordon Clark. 


                                      END ACT I                                                                                    14.


                                        ACT II

      INT. CARDIFF GIANT OFFICES -- DAY

      Fluorescent lights, cubicles, retro colors. Just like the 
      Post in All the President s Men, The Daily Planet in Donner s 
      Superman. 

      ANGLE ON Clark at the break counter. He s wearing the same 
      shirt, tie, pants as last night. Looking like he just rolled 
      out of bed. He pours WAY too much sugar into his coffee. 

      AL KOWALSKI (45) nears--a man who s parked it in management, 
      a bit bloated from booze and food and glory days.  

                                  AL
                    Jesus, Gordon, you look like 
                    garbage.

                                  CLARK
                    Thanks, Al, duly noted. 

                                  AL
                          (withering)
                    I m not asking you.  Pajamas at 
                    work  might ve flown back in 
                    Frisco, but this is a professional 
                      workplace. When I see you again, 
                    you better be wearing at least a 
                    clean shirt. Understand?

      Clark lowers his eyes to his coffee as Al walks away.

      ANGLE ON MacMillan, in his black suit, a perfect contrast as 
      he approaches Clark. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Gordon Clark.

                                  CLARK
                    That s me. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    You re my SE for this sales call.

                                  CLARK
                    Oh... I am? With, uh...

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Applied Data. 

                                  CLARK
                    That s not my account.                                                                                    15.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    I made some changes and now it is. 

      Clark looks up at him with confusion, which quickly turns to 
      anger. He walks to his cubicle, grabs his bag as MacMillan 
      follows. 

                                  CLARK
                    Oh, right, right. Great. Of course 
                    you did. Should be pretty quick.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Why s that?

                                  CLARK
                     Cause they never buy anything.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Well... we ll just go in there and 
                    both do our best, how s that sound?

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- LATER

      MacMillan sits at one end of the table, locked in. Clark sits 
      next to him, half-engaged.                                                                                     16.


      ANGLE ON the other end of the table. A VP at the head flanked 
      by four of his top DIRECTORS and MANAGERS. 

                                  DIRECTOR 1
                    It s just that efficiency is 
                    kicking us in the ass right now. If 
                    we can t speed up, then we re dead 
                    in the water. 

                                  CLARK
                    A recent analytics pass we did 
                    showed our product out-performing 
                    most of the top-sellers by an 
                    average of 16%.  

                                  DIRECTOR 1
                    What about IBM?

                                  CLARK
                    IBM is IBM. But we re neck and 
                    neck. And we re cheaper.

                                  DIRECTOR 2
                      Technically. The difference in cost 
                    is negligible. It seems you guys at 
                    Cardiff think you ve built a pretty 
                    fancy race car that deserves an 
                      outrageous price tag. 

                                    MANAGER 1
                    And we get no Big Blue guarantee. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    There s no such thing as a Big Blue 
                      guarantee. 

                                  DIRECTOR 2
                    Well, they had me fooled.

      The execs chuckle. MacMillan conspicuously does not.  

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Me, too. That s why when the floor 
                    dropped out, I was caught unaware. 

      The execs quiet, listening. 

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    When you re sailing along with the 
                    best of the best, it s as if you re 
                      invincible. When I worked for IBM, 
                      I excelled at IBM. And let me be 
                    clear, they make a good product. 
                    And they are a good company.                                                                                     17.


      His tone is confident and matter-of-fact, devoid of artifice, 
      just a man relaying facts.  

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    But one day, I turned a corner, and 
                    I got blind-sided. It was because 
                    the confidence I had, my 
                      convictions, what I believed to be 
                    true, the very foundation I was 
                    standing on--it was a lie. When 
                    that happens, you re left with 
                    nothing. And when that moment comes 
                    for Applied Data, who are you going 
                    to blame?

      MacMillan lowers his voice now, causing the execs to lean 
      forward almost imperceptibly. Here, he drifts off just a bit.

      ANGLE ON Clark, paying attention perhaps for the first time. 

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Will you blame IBM? They don t 
                    care. You re an account number to 
                    them. Your entire mainframe could 
                    halt and catch fire, but their name 
                    isn t sullied. They go on. That s 
                    when you cease to exist. At least 
                    to them. And to the world, if it 
                    costs you your entire business. And 
                    it s your fault. 

      And now MacMillan returns to the room from wherever he was. 
      He locks eyes with the rapt VP, going in for the close.

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Cardiff Giant will white label all 
                    its products and sell them to you 
                    outright. No licensing renewal. And 
                    we will place an IT position at 
                    your location on our payroll. We 
                    will not leave you. We will be 
                    there. It s simple, honest, and 
                    real. It s why I work for them. 
                          (pause)
                    So. Are we ready to do business? 

      A long silence. The managers and directors turn to look at 
      the VP, who has said nothing up until this point. The silence 
      goes on for some time. A stand-off. 

      Clark s adrenaline is going--are we really closing?                                                                                    18.

                    There s also free install of any 
                    updates to the product--

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Gordon, please.

      As he says it, MacMillan never takes his eyes off the VP. 

      Waiting. Then:

                                  VP
                    Yeah, I definitely think we can put 
                    something together. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. CARDIFF GIANT PARKING LOT -- LATER

      Clark gets out of the car, as does MacMillan. They walk 
      toward the office. 

                                  CLARK
                    Wow, I ve gotta say I m impressed. 
                    That was like...  JFK staring down 
                    the Cuban Missile Crisis. Applied 
                    Data hasn t bought jack-all from 
                    anyone in years. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    We did good. You did a solid job 
                      explaining the software.

                                  CLARK
                    Good... I mean, I should ve, I 
                    wrote the--

      MacMillan spins on him. Clark stops, caught off-guard.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    But I need you to do me one favor. 

                                  CLARK
                    Okay. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Next time I move to close. This is 
                    what you do.

                                  CLARK
                          (eager for a pro tip)
                    Okay, what?                                                                                    19.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    You SHUT. THE FUCK. UP. 

      It echoes out over the entire parking lot. Clark stands 
      there, stunned, speechless. MacMillan steps closer, extremely 
      intimidating.

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Do you understand me?

      Clark can only nod somewhat. MacMillan walks off, leaving 
      Clark alone in the lot. 

      A wave of several different emotions cross over Clark s face 
      as he stares after him. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      evaluates MacMillan, who s back in his seat across from him. 

      Behind MacMillan s chair stands Al.

                    I thought you d be enthused.

                                  AL
                    That you actually did what you said 
                    you could?

                    the rest of your quota for this 
                    quarter. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Which I ve noticed is higher than

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Oh, God.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    About extremely high quotas?

                    And you know what? I never lost one 
                    man. Not one. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Look, I ve been here two days and I 
                    already brought a deal onto the

      Clark sits at his desk suffering from wounded pride. 
      MacMillan appears over the divider. Tosses a magazine down

      IBM S TROJAN HORSE: HOW OPEN ARCHITECTURE WILL UNDO BIG BLUE

      The same article MacMillan was reading at home. The issue of 
      Byte he brought with him from New York in a moving box.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Ever read that?

      Clark stares blankly at the pages. 

                                  CLARK
                    Yeah... I wrote it. A while ago...

      CLOSER ON the article. We see the by-line:  By Gordon Clark. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    What do you think?

                                  CLARK
                    What do you mean? It s, uh... yeah. 
                    IBM s PC is just off-the-shelf 
                    parts. They rushed it to market, 
                    used generic hardware, put it in a 
                    box labeled IBM. Everybody knows 
                    that. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Not everybody.

                    It means...well, it means anyone 
                    could build an IBM PC. Tweak it, 
                    make it better. Call it their own.

                                  CLARK

                    The money.

                    a project I want to discuss with 
                    him. 

      MacMillan walks away. Clark stands up from his cube.

                                  CLARK
                    Hey, what are you trying to do?

                                        ACT III

      INT. CLARK S GARAGE -- NIGHT

      ANGLE ON Clark, in a t-shirt and jeans, sitting with his 
      older daughter Joanie on his lap. On the card table lies a 
      Speak & Spell toy that has been almost totally dismantled.

                                  JOANIE
                          (unhappy)
                    You broke my Speak & Spell!

                                  CLARK
                    No, no, no, no, baby, don t worry, 
                    I m gonna put it back together. 
                    Just like new. But I want to show 
                    you how it works--

                                  JOANIE
                    Fix it!

                                  CLARK
                    Look at this first... See, here are 
                    the batteries, okay, the power 
                    source... see these wires here? 
                    That makes the circuit board work. 
                    On the board you ve got the 128 
                    kilobit ROM chip... 

      DONNA ENTERS from the house door but Clark doesn t notice 
      her. She continues to watch the interaction...

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    ...and this is your logic here... 
                    and this is your speech synthesizer 
                    chip, which Mommy helped make at 
                    her job. This chip makes it talk, 
                    just like you and me--

                                  JOANIE
                    Make it talk.

                                  CLARK
                    You make it talk, here.

      He hands her the keyboard portion of the Speak & Spell. She 
      presses the  On  button and the device s FAMILIAR CHIRPS echo 
      loudly through Gordon s stereo speakers. Joanie is amazed.

                                  SPEAK N  SPELL
                    Now. Spell. Courage.

      Joanie carefully taps the keys, looking to Clark for 
      assurance on some of the harder letters.                                                                                     24.

                          (she presses  Enter )
                    Correct.

      Clark notices Donna behind him. 

                                  CLARK
                          (to Joanie)
                    Go get ready for E.T.

      Clark kisses her on the head, she darts off into the house.

                                  DONNA
                    Six years of voice synthesis 
                      technology at Texas Instruments, 
                    all for a plastic red toy. 

                                  CLARK
                    It s a brilliant product. 

      He tiredly turns to an Apple II also on the fold-out card 
      table. Not dismantling this computer, simply using it. His 
      checkbook is open next to it. 

                                  DONNA
                          (looking at screen)
                    What s this?

                                  CLARK
                    I m figuring out how we can make it 
                    through August given our two 
                    mortgages and two car payments.

                                  DONNA
                    On the computer?

                                  CLARK
                    Yeah, I wrote this little program 
                    last night, since the calculator s 
                    broken. And look...
                          (tapping a few keys)
                    I can project expenses here and see 
                    how we do. It runs the whole 
                    scenario of our finances. At this 
                    rate...
                          (reading screen)
                    We can retire in 2045.

                                  DONNA
                    You re a genius.                                                                                     25.


                                  CLARK
                    I still have some good ideas once 
                    in a while.

                                  DONNA
                    Oh, uh... a Joe MacMillan called. 
                    From work. 

      Clark falls back in his chair, sighing with frustration. 

                                  DONNA (CONT D)
                    I said we were going to see E.T. 
                    tonight and you were done work for 
                    the day. What does he want?

      Clark turns off the computer. 

                                  CLARK
                    He wants to pick a fight he can t 
                    win. Not in Texas, at least. And he 
                    thinks I m some innovator and 
                      revolutionary. 

                                  DONNA
                    Well, aren t you?
                          (pause)
                    Maybe he has something you can sink 
                    your teeth into for once.

                                  CLARK
                    Donna, if I need a hobby, I ll take 
                    up golf. I m not about to cross 
                    wires with a guy like John Bosworth 
                    just because I m bored. Not when we 
                    have--

                CLARK (CONT D)DONNA
      Two mortgages and two car Two mortgages and two car 
        payments.payments.

      Clark sighs.

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    C mon, let s just go to the movie. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. MOVIE THEATER -- LATER

      The lights are up at the movie s end, the signature JOHN 
      WILLIAMS FANFARE playing over the end credits.  

      CLARK AND HIS FAMILY slowly walk out with the rest of the 
      audience. His daughters are overjoyed.                                                                                     26.


                                  CLARK
                          (to daughters)
                    You guys like that?

                                  HALEY
                    Yeah!

                                  CLARK
                          (to Donna)
                    I ll also point out that Elliot had 
                    a Speak & Spell and not a Cardiff 
                    Giant systems mainframe. 

      Clark stops unexpectedly.

      ANGLE ON Joe MacMillan in his shirt and tie, sleeves rolled 
      up, sitting in the back row with a bag of popcorn. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Gordon, is that you?

      He stands, offers his hand to Donna.  

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Hi, Joe MacMillan. We spoke on the 
                    phone earlier. 

                                  DONNA
                    Oh, right...

                                  MACMILLAN
                    You guys couldn t wait to see this, 
                    either? Very affecting movie.

                                  DONNA
                    The girls have been crazy to--

                                  CLARK
                    Did you follow me here?

      MacMillan steps out of the aisle, leads Clark away.

                                  MACMILLAN
                          (to kids)
                    You mind if I borrow your dad for a 
                    second?

                                  CLARK
                          (to Donna)
                    Work stuff.

      Donna ushers the children out of the theater, eyeing 
      MacMillan, unsure.                                                                                     27.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    Reverse engineer an IBM PC with me.

      A beat. Clark lightly kicks one of the seat legs.

                                  CLARK
                    Why do you want to reverse engineer 
                    an IBM PC?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I told you. It s where everything 
                    is headed.

                                  CLARK
                    I know.
                          (pause)
                    But why are you doing this?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Why do you think I picked Cardiff 
                    Giant? With my resume, I could ve 
                    gone to work for any other company 
                    in the country. Maybe the world. 
                    But I came to Texas. You think I 
                    did it for the BBQ? I came to where 
                    you were. And as luck would have 
                    it, you re extremely unhappy. 

                                  CLARK
                    I think you make a lot of 
                      assumptions. 
                          (pause)
                    Look, thanks for seeing something I 
                    used to be, but...

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I don t take no for an answer.

                                  CLARK
                    I m gonna have to respectfully 
                    decline, Joe. I just... can t put 
                    my job in jeopardy when I ve got 
                    two kids and...
                          (hating himself)
                    Two mortgages and two car payments.

      Clark leaves the theater, his face conflicted. He looks back 
      toward MacMillan a couple of times on his way out. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    28.


      INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL -- DAY

      An older PROFESSOR (58) stands in front of a large class of 
      about 75 students. Their vibrant 80 s youth clashes with 
      boredom as the professor clears his throat. 

                                  PROFESSOR
                    We will be postponing today s
                      discussion on vacuum tubes, as we
                    have a special guest who s in town 
                    on business for today only. He 
                    contacted the Department of 
                      Electrical & Computer Engineering
                    this morning and requested to stop 
                    by and speak to some of our best 
                    and brightest about the current 
                    state of the computer industry... 

      Students have started to take notice. One is CAMERON HOWE 
      (22), a young woman with ice blonde hair cut very short. Big 
        black-rimmed glasses and exposed collar bone, fashionable, 
      post-punk. 

      She has a pattern of rubber bands currently wrapped around 
      her fingers. 

                                  PROFESSOR (CONT D)
                    So without further ado, please 
                    welcome Joseph MacMillan from 
                    Cardiff Giant Computer Systems. 

      MacMillan, looking his shaved and showered best, trots into 
      the room amidst half-hearted applause.  

      ANGLE ON Cameron as she immediately tosses the rubber bands 
      off her fingers, very interested in what this man might say. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Good afternoon, UT. Let me start 
                    off with a question: How many of 
                    you desire to be professional 
                    computer engineers?

      About 50 hands go up in the class. 

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Now I m going to list off several 
                      categories. When you hear a 
                    category that you don t have hands-
                    on experience in, put your hand 
                    down. 
                          (pause)
                      Electrical engineering. Software 
                    design. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    29.

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                      Hardware-software integration. 
                    Circuit design. Microprocessing. 

      Already, half the class has their hands down. 

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Firmware design. Very Large Scale 
                      Integration. Operating systems.

      Down to about eight people now. 

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    FPGA configuration. Hardware 
                      description languages. Personal 
                    computer design. 

      Three people have their hands raised. One is Cameron.

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Reverse engineering.

      Cameron s hand goes down, as does another, leaving only one 
      smiling, cocky male student. 

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Okay, let s go back one.

      Both hands go up again and the cocky kid loses his grin. 
      MacMillan points to a FAT BALDING GUY first. 

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    Tell me one thing that will be true 
                    about computers 10 years from now.

                                  FAT BALDING GUY
                            (mouth-breathing)
                    Computers will exist as ocular 
                    headsets that plug into the back of 
                    our cerebral cortexes--

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Okay, thanks.
                          (pointing to Cameron)
                    You?

                                    CAMERON
                    Um... Computers will likely be 
                    connected together over a vast 
                    network and able to communicate 
                    with each other by alternately 
                      modulating and demodulating digital 
                    data over an electric system of 
                    some kind--                                                                                    30.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    Like phone lines.

                                    CAMERON
                    Probably phone lines.  

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Can you see me after class, Miss. 
                    uh...?

                                    CAMERON
                    Yes. Cameron Howe, yes.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. ARCADE -- LATER

      A hallmark of the early 80 s coin-op craze. Hazy from smoke 
      and the crowd s a bit older, college drinkers.

      Cameron and MacMillan have stationed themselves before a 
      Frogger cabinet. MacMillan, tie loose and suit sleeves pushed 
      up short, deftly carries four tequila shots over to the 
      controls. 

                                    CAMERON
                    I m great at this game, I ll whoop 
                    your ass.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    But there are rules. Every time you 
                    lose a frog...
                          (holding out a glass)
                    You take a shot. 

                                    CAMERON
                    I can handle that. 

      She goes for the joystick, but he stops her.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    And one to kick us off.

      They both down a shot. He never takes his eyes off her. 

      LATER

      She plays intently while he interviews her.

                                    CAMERON
                    I don t know, but if I had to 
                    choose now, I d say personal 
                      computing, software, video games. 
                    Something like that.                                                                                    31.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    There are a lot of companies that 
                    already do those things.

                                    CAMERON
                    Not like I would. 

      ANGLE ON the screen as she jumps too soon and her frog gets 
      killed against a car: POW. 

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                          (turning to him)
                    Look, this is an entire industry 
                    built on people ripping each other 
                    off. SEC rips off CPM, Microsoft 
                    rips off SEC, IBM rips off 
                      everybody. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Some people would say this isn t 
                    about money, but about making your 
                    mark in the world.
                          (holds up a glass)
                    My turn.
                          (pause)
                    You ever worked with the IBM PC?

                                    CAMERON
                          (coy)
                    I ve worked with a lot of hardware 
                    in my time.

      She downs the shot. Starting to get to her. MacMillan cracks 
      a smile. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Forfeit?

                                    CAMERON
                    You need to win don t you?

      MacMillan takes his shot, looks at her. Something changes in 
      his eyes.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      INT. CLARK S HOUSE - BATHROOM -- LATER

      Gordon flips on the light, stares into the mirror. He s in a 
      white t-shirt, boxers. Looks at himself, a tired mess. 

                                  DONNA (O.S.)
                    What s wrong?                                                                                    32.


      He looks to the hallway. Donna stands in the shadows, 
      squinting in her robe. 

                                  CLARK
                    Can t sleep. 

      She lingers, then disappears. Clark leans in, examines his 
      face closely. Runs his hand over his unkempt mustache. 

      He turns on the sink. Swings the mirror open, pulls a razor, 
      shaving cream out of the medicine cabinet. 

      QUICK SHOTS: CLARK SHAVES OFF HIS MUSTACHE

      Rinses off. His face immediately fresher. His youth, hidden 
      until now, returns somewhat, as well as a bit of masculinity. 

                                  DONNA (O.S.)
                    What are you doing in here?

      Clark turns to her. She s taken aback. 

                                  DONNA (CONT D)
                    Oh my God.

      She steps closer to him, sleepy-eyed, but smiling. Runs her 
      hand across his face.

                                  DONNA (CONT D)
                    You re a new man. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CAMERON S BEDROOM -- LATER

      MacMillan gets dressed, having trouble not knocking over the 
      clutter in her tiny college apartment as he puts on his 
      wingtips. It draws her awake. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Where you going?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    This wasn t part of the plan. 

                                    CAMERON
                          (incredulous)
                    What plan?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I m sorry, Cameron. It s Cameron, 
                    right?                                                                                    33.


                                    CAMERON
                    Okay, now you re being a jerk.

      MacMillan throws his suit coat on. 

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Are you really just leaving?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    ...yes. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Well, what about the project?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    ...don t worry about it. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Don t worry about it? You dump this 
                      opportunity in my lap and then say 
                     don t worry about it ?

      She stands, wraps the sheet around herself. 

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Maybe I don t need you. Maybe I ll 
                    just do it myself. I don t remember 
                    signing any non-disclosure 
                      agreements before we got into bed.

      He turns, looks at her, his face pushing back the regret. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Maybe you will.

      He walks out of the apartment, SLAMS the door.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MACMILLAN S CONDO -- DAWN

      With the lights off, the whole place is lit only by a dim and 
      hazy blue of pre-morning. 

      ANGLE ON MacMillan, sitting in a chair blankly. Clearly been 
      up all night. He rises, goes to a moving box...

      ...opens it up. Pulls out a wooden Louisville slugger worn at 
      the grip. He s silhouetted against his condo s panoramic view 
      of cosmopolitan flatlands. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    34.


      INT. GLASS-WALLED OFFICE -- DAY (FLASHBACK)

      Barnes  office. This is the first scene we saw. Joe is there, 
      livid. Barnes hides all emotion, plays it cool.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    You told me it wasn t worth 
                    anything. 

                                  BARNES
                    It wasn t worth anything, Joe, what 
                    do you want me to say? It s a wire 
                    path about the size of a period, 
                    for God s sake. 

      White hot silence.

                                  MACMILLAN
                          (trembling)
                    Two days later... we patent it. Two 
                    days later. 

                                  BARNES
                    We have to protect our interests. 
                    That s our technology. It was 
                    developed on company time.

      We rejoin the opening shot. A long pause. 

                                  BARNES (CONT D)
                    C mon, Joe. It s just business.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MACMILLAN S CONDO -- PRESENT

      MacMillan reaches back into the moving box. Pulls out a 
      baseball. Examines it for a moment. Then he tosses it up...

      SWINGS THE BAT AND CONNECTS

      Sending a line drive into the wall opposite him with a CRACK. 
      The ball dents the dry wall, then rolls back across the floor 
      to MacMillan s feet. He picks it up again, tosses it...

      SWINGS THE BAT AND SMASHES THE BALL THROUGH A LAMP

      Destroying the shade and blowing the light bulb apart as the 
      base falls off another moving box. He picks the ball up 
      again...

      SWINGS THE BAT, SENDS THE BALL OUT THROUGH HIS BALCONY WINDOW

      With an EXPLOSION of glass.                                                                                     35.


      The cool morning air flutters over his loose tie as he gazes 
      out onto the horizon. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CARDIFF GIANT OFFICES - MACMILLAN S OFFICE -- DAY

      MacMillan sits at his terminal in an office that hasn t even 
      been set up yet. He types methodically, focused. 

      ON THE SCREEN

      We see what he s working on. In green letters against black, 
      it begins:

       To: John Bosworth, Cardiff Giant Executive Team, et al

      It is with sadness that I submit my formal resignation to the 
      company... 

      MacMillan s finger hovers over the  Print  button. 

      GORDON CLARK ENTERS wearing beat up Ray-Ban Wayfarers, 
      carrying a large box adorned with the IBM logo. He sets it 
      down on MacMillan s desk. 

                                  CLARK
                          (taking glasses off)
                    Do you know how much one of these 
                    things costs?
                          (pause)
                    Monday s a holiday, so we can spend 
                    the three-day weekend in my garage.
                          (pause)
                    What do you say?

      MacMillan stands. Opens the box, revealing a brand new IBM 
      PC. A small smile appears on his face, perhaps for the first 
      time. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    This isn t just about Cardiff. 
                    We ll wake a sleeping giant at IBM. 
                    They ll come at us with everything 
                    they have. 

      Clark nods. Then looks back up at MacMillan. 

                                  CLARK
                    Let s turn this thing inside out. 


                                      END ACT III                                                                                    36.


                                        ACT IV

      INT. CLARK S GARAGE -- NIGHT

      MacMillan and Clark, still in their work clothes, stand over 
      the IBM PC, removed from its packaging and vulnerable under 
      the light. MacMillan works a screwdriver on its sides...

      SLIDES OFF THE METAL BOX, REVEALING ITS INSIDES

                                  MACMILLAN
                    From here, you re in the driver s 
                    seat.

                                  CLARK
                      A personal computer--like any 
                    computer, really--is just a nothing 
                    box full of electronic switches; 
                    hardware. The IBM, Apple II, the 
                    Altair, it s all the same junk.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Get to the good part.

      BEGIN MONTAGE -- REVERSE ENGINEERING

      Clark and MacMillan slave over the machine, pulling it apart, 
      examining it...

      -- Clark carefully unscrews circuit boards and slides them 
      out of the PC, laying them next to each other. 

                                  CLARK (V.O.)
                    You can buy all this stuff off the 
                    shelf right now. That s how IBM 
                    built this thing so fast.

                                  MACMILLAN (V.O.)
                    I said the good part, not the part 
                    I already know.

      -- Clark carefully pries a black rectangular chip the size of 
      half a match book off one of the circuit boards.

                                  CLARK (V.O.)
                    Well, if you re so smart, tell me 
                    what connects the hardware to the 
                    software?

                                  MACMILLAN (V.O.)
                    The chip.

      -- Clark holds up  the chip  under the light.                                                                                     37.


                                  CLARK (V.O.)
                    Ding, ding, ding, and this chip, 
                    the ROM BIOS, is the only part of 
                    the whole machine IBM actually 
                    designed. It is the brain. It is 
                    the magic. Bad news is they 
                      copyrighted it and own how it 
                    works. Good news is, there s a way 
                    around that. Sort of. 

                                  MACMILLAN (V.O.)
                    Reverse engineering. 

      -- Days later. MacMillan and Clark in different clothes, 
      tired. Clark has the chip and its board jerry-rigged to an 
      output monitor, working.

                                  CLARK (V.O.)
                    I sit down with the code and 
                    through trial and error we create a 
                      specification manual, a list of the 
                    things a chip has to be able to do.

      -- Days later, different clothes. Clark documents with pencil 
      on paper everything he does. Downing retro cans of Coke. 

      -- MacMillan transfers the notes into a typed version, prints 
      them out on Cardiff Giant letterhead.

                                  MACMILLAN (V.O.)
                    How long do you think it ll take?

      -- MacMillan nods off as Clark works late into the night. 

                                  CLARK (V.O.)
                    I have no idea.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      CUT IN:

      INT. CLARK S GARAGE -- NIGHT

      CLOSE ON MacMillan with his head resting on a work table 
      amidst scattered circuit boards, screwdrivers. Asleep. 

                                  CLARK (O.S.)
                    That s it.

      A heavy binder lands next to MacMillan s head with a SMACK, 
      jarring him awake. He rubs his eyes, takes the binder, begins 
      to flip through it. He looks over to...                                                                                    38.


      CLARK, in a Texas Rangers t-shirt and looking very sleep-
      deprived. He sits forward in a metal fold-out chair, heavy-
      eyed but focused. Almost dreading their recent revelation.

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    The entire layout of the IBM PC ROM 
                    BIOS chip. The system map, 
                      everything. 

      A beat. They look to each other. 

                                  MACMILLAN 
                    Now we just make our own chip.  

                                  CLARK
                      Correction: We make an even better 
                    chip.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. WHATABURGER -- LATER

      MacMillan and Clark sit in a booth, uneaten burgers unwrapped 
      in front of them. The place done up in those three fast-food 
      shades of brown. Both men seem distant, contemplative. 

                                  CLARK
                    I feel like we just figured out who 
                    killed Kennedy. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I feel like we re 16 and we just 
                    got the keys to Dad s car.

                                  CLARK
                    So what now?

      MacMillan flips through the book of precious research. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    We go to the marketplace with a 
                    better product. Cheaper, better, 
                    faster.

                                  CLARK
                    This is dangerous territory, man. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    This entire industry is built on 
                    people ripping each other off.

                    It trades on a remarkable idea that 
                    from the moment something is 
                    created, every second something new 
                    is made that does more, and costs 
                    less.  

                                  CLARK
                          (hanging head down)
                    I feel a little sick.

                    We did good. I m gonna use the 
                    phone.

      INT. DALE BARNES  OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

      Dale Barnes. He s tanner. His office is bigger. Life has 
      improved.

                          (on speaker phone)
                    John. It s Dale Barnes.

                            (half-interested)
                    Well good for you, Dale. 

                                  BARNES
                    At IBM. 

      This is enough to give Bosworth pause.                                                                                     40.

                    there.

                    Yes, we do. MacMillan. Interesting 
                    fellow.

                    Probably should ve warned you, but

      REBECCA TAYLOR (41) a shrewd bitch in a business suit, 
      shoulder pads and all, steps closer to Barnes  desk. 

                                  TAYLOR
                    Hi, John. We ve got a problem.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT S OFFICE -- LATER

      Bosworth is now up out of his desk, pacing. Fuming. Al is 
      also standing, angry, but more imitative, like a child 
      pretending to be his father. 

      ANGLE ON NATHAN CARDIFF (60), relaxed in chair near the 
      window, worn cowboy hat in his hand. He puts his snakeskin 
      boots up on John s desk, whistling  Red River Valley. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    I m sorry we had to pull you away 
                    from the ranch, Nathan.

                                    CARDIFF
                    Don t mind. I wanna meet the two 
                    boys who put my company in the 
                    ground. 

      The door opens. MacMillan walks in fairly grim, carrying the 
      binder, followed by a trepidatious and slow-moving Gordon 
      Clark. Al closes the door behind them.

                                  AL
                    You guys screwed the pooch.                                                                                    41.

                          (to MacMillan, Clark)
                    You two sit down. 

      MacMillan and Clark obey. Al slinks back toward the corner, a 
      wounded animal.

                                  BOSWORTH (CONT D)
                          (gesturing)
                    This is Nathan Cardiff. He started 
                    the company you destroyed. 

      Clark starts to rise, Cardiff holds him in place with a hand.

                                    CARDIFF
                    I d rather not shake your hands 
                    right now, gentlemen.

      Bosworth leans against the front edge of his desk, crosses 
      his arms. Glowers down at both men. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    We just had a two and a half hour 
                    jaw with IBM s legal team, 
                    including your old boss Dale 
                    Barnes.

                    Oh yeah? How s he doing?

                                  BOSWORTH
                    He s doing pretty splendid, given 
                    the fact that Big Blue is gonna 
                    liquidate this place to the tune of 
                    several dozen million dollars in 
                    legal damages because two retards 
                    in our employ decided to rip off 
                    their flagship product.

                                  CLARK
                    We didn t do this as Cardiff Giant. 
                    That wasn t the idea, we did it 
                    rogue--

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Rogue, huh? On your own? Like 
                    whatever Silicon Valley rat hole 
                    you crawled from, right, Gordon? 
                          (pause)
                    Turns out, doesn t matter. And 
                    trust me, we tried to throw you to 
                    the wolves.

                                  BOSWORTH (CONT'D)
                    But since MacMillan here worked for 
                    IBM, and you two were ours at the 
                    time of your little project, the 
                    project is ours now, for better or 
                    worse.

                                    CARDIFF
                    Worse, in this case.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Barnes and this woman Taylor are 
                    headed down here tomorrow.

                          (in MacMillan s face)
                    So did you just not understand when 
                    I said we do systems software and 
                    don t TOUCH PC s?

                    How the hell did IBM find out?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I told them. 

      Silence in the room. All eyes on MacMillan now. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. CARDIFF GIANT PARKING LOT -- LATER

      MacMillan walks to his car, putting on his sunglasses. Clark 
      follows, almost chasing after him.

                                  CLARK
                    Hey. Hey! HEY!

      MacMillan turns around. 

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    You called them the other night, 
                    didn t you? The moment we finished. 
                    What happened, Big Blue kill your 
                    dog? 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Just let everybody cool off.

                                  CLARK
                    Let them cool off? 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Gordon. It s gonna be fine.                                                                                    43.


      Clark DECKS HIM across the face without a word, knocking 
      MacMillan s sunglasses to the concrete. Despite the violence, 
      MacMillan remains calm as he retrieves them, puts them on. 

                                  CLARK
                    I don t know who you think you are. 
                    But you re wrong. You can t just 
                    walk into this company, walk into 
                    my life and start rearranging shit. 
                    You might be some hot shot swinging 
                    dick without a care in the world 
                    but I got a family, man. 
                          (pause)
                    I got a family.

      Clark walks away. MacMillan wipes blood from the corner of 
      his mouth. Then:

                                  MACMILLAN
                          (calling after)
                    Just tell me one thing.

      Clark stops, turns around. Waits.

                                  MACMILLAN (CONT D)
                    When we were working in that 
                    garage. Where you work like you 
                    used to work, I mean really work. 
                    Tell me that didn t feel good. Tell 
                    me that didn t wake something up 
                    inside you that s been dormant for 
                    a long time. 

                                  CLARK
                    Look. I see the future. I ve been 
                    seeing it since 1975. And as weird 
                    as you are, I can tell you see it, 
                    too. All right? I m not a betting 
                    man, but I d put money on where I 
                    think things are going. Do you know 
                    how hard that is? To wake up every 
                    morning and know in your gut? And 
                    watch everyone around you walk off 
                    a cliff? Watch yourself walk off 
                    it, too? 
                          (pause)
                    We can t make them see it. You 
                    can t make someone see it. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I believe you can.                                                                                    44.


      Clark just shakes his head. Walks away. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      INT. MACMILLAN S QUATTRO -- MOMENTS LATER

      MacMillan SLAMS his door closed. Sits in silence in the car. 

      ANGLE ON the rearview mirror. Joe catches his own eyes. Can t 
      look away. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CLARK S GARAGE -- NIGHT

      Clark sits at his makeshift workstation, looking off into the 
      distance. His eyes come to rest on the mess of different 
      computers in front of him. He picks up the Apple II...

      HEAVES IT TO THE PAVEMENT AND IT SHATTERS

      An ugly BLAST of plastic, circuitry, keys. 

      DONNA ENTERS from the side door moments later.

                                  DONNA
                    What the hell was that?

                                  CLARK
                    Nothing.

                                  DONNA
                    What s going on, Gordon? You re up 
                    one minute, on five hours of sleep 
                    a week, then you re brooding around 
                    the house, won t even talk to the 
                    children. Won t even look me in the 
                    eye--

                                  CLARK
                    I m in TROUBLE, Donna.

                                  DONNA
                          (quieter)
                    What kind of trouble?

                                  CLARK
                    We pissed off IBM. 

      On her reaction. She knows it s serious.                                                                                     45.


      He walks toward the door. He turns back, can barely look at 
      her.

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    We should ve never left California.

      INT. CARDIFF GIANT OFFICES - MACMILLAN S OFFICE -- MORNING

      MacMillan faces away from his computer, looking out onto the 
      parking lot. A man awaiting execution. 

      A KNOCK draws his attention. He turns around to see... 

      Dale Barnes. Smug, mock-friendly, sharp where MacMillan has 
      begun to blur. Barnes enters, drops himself into a chair 
        comfortably. 

                                  BARNES
                    Long time, no see, huh? You get the 
                    flowers I sent? 

      No answer.

                                  BARNES (CONT D)
                      Unexpected business trip. Had to 
                    come down here with our legal 
                    group, put out the little firestorm 
                    you started. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Right. 

                                  BARNES
                    I was on the phone with Applied 
                    Data this morning. They love you, 
                    but I told them that Cardiff Giant 
                    might not be around much longer, so 
                    hey, IBM would love to step in and 
                    fulfill on their mainframe 
                    solution.
                          (pause)
                    I know you just closed that deal, 
                    but... you know, way of the world. 
                    Funnily enough, they also want a PC 
                    solution, too. All in a day s work, 
                    right? 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Would ve loved to have been on the 
                    phone. I haven t seen you close a 
                    deal in years.

                    Usually you just take credit for 
                    whatever your guys bring in. 

                                  BARNES
                    Eh, it felt good to put on my spurs 
                    again, what can I say? I figure as 
                    long as I m out in this backwater, 
                    there might be a little bit of 
                    business to be won while we clean 
                    up the mess.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Sounds like you ve got it all 
                    figured out.

      MacMillan shows no signs of cracking, letting this prick get 
      to him. Barnes stands up, moves to go. Stops, turns.

                                  BARNES
                    What are you trying to prove with 
                    all this? 
                          (pause)
                    IBM doesn t lose, remember?

      MacMillan grips the back of his chair, knuckles white. Dale 
      shrugs, leaves.

      Office bathroom at Cardiff. 

      ANGLE ON Clark puking his guts out into one of the toilets. 
      MacMillan stands behind him, shaken. Uneasy. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    They re ready for us.

                                  CLARK
                    There is no  us. 

      Clark wipes his mouth, brusquely brushes past MacMillan to 
      the door. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT S OFFICE -- MORNING

      Bosworth, Cardiff. Fresh clothes but weary. MacMillan, Clark 
      sit in their respective chairs.

      They re joined by lawyer BARRY SHIELDS (50)   good suit, if a 
      bit small. The man himself is small, balding, worried. He 
      carries Clark and MacMillan s report.  

                                    CARDIFF
                    An  why the hell can t we just fire 
                    these pecker heads?

                                    SHIELDS
                    Because then we re gonna lose this 
                    lawsuit. If you fire them and 
                    shelve their work, we re 
                      essentially admitting guilt. 
                          (pause)
                    We do that, we tell IBM  You re 
                    right, we re wrong.  But the damage 
                    is already done. We ve got the 
                    entire IBM ROM BIOS layout on 150 
                    pages of Cardiff Giant letterhead. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    So what s the solution, Barry?

      Barry takes off his glasses, rubs the bridge of his nose.

                                    SHIELDS
                    We legitimize the project. We go 
                    the other way.

                                    SHIELDS (CONT'D)
                    We say that Cardiff Giant, as a 
                    company, was pursuing PC 
                      development all along.

                                    CARDIFF
                    I sure as hell don t see how that 
                    clears away the hornet s nest. 

                                    SHIELDS
                    We take Clark s findings on the 
                    BIOS chip. The performance, the 
                    system map, all of it. We hand over 
                    the report to an engineer and tell 
                    them to build something that 
                    operates and performs in the exact 
                    same way. We don t tell them how to 
                    do it, and we certainly don t tell 
                    them we learned how by pulling 
                    apart an IBM machine and looking 
                    inside with a flashlight, but-- 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    I don t think we have one engineer 
                    capable of building a BIOS from 
                    scratch other than 
                          (pointing to Clark)
                    Sonny Bono over here.

                                    SHIELDS
                    We can t use him. Or any other 
                    engineer we currently employ.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    So we have to hire.

                                    SHIELDS
                    Yes. Someone who knows nothing 
                    about us or IBM, and has never seen 
                    the contents of this binder. At 
                    this point, we re all dirty and 
                    have to walk away. Especially these 
                    two. They ve got to be as far away 
                    from this as humanly possible, and 
                    this report has to go in a locked 
                    drawer until the end of time. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    But we can t fire them.

                                    SHIELDS
                    No. At least not right now.                                                                                     49.


                                  BOSWORTH
                    We get out of this by actually 
                    building a PC clone. 

                                    SHIELDS
                    As Cardiff Giant. 

                                    CARDIFF
                    So we basically have to open a 
                    whole new line of business. 

                                    SHIELDS
                    To legally be in the clear, yes. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    This is your brilliant idea to save 
                    our hides?

                                    SHIELDS
                    No, actually... it was MacMillan s. 

      Again, all eyes on Joe MacMillan. Calmly sitting there. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    You son of a bitch.

      Cardiff stands, approaches MacMillan. Eyeballs him with a 
      West Texas stare for a moment. 

                                    CARDIFF
                    You know how many futures you re 
                    toyin  with, son?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    You said it yourself. This is a 
                    systems software company. But 
                    before that, what was it? Missile 
                    guidance systems. Before that, 
                      short-wave radios. It s not about 
                    what it is today, it s about what 
                    it s going to be tomorrow.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    This is our BUSINESS--

                                  CLARK
                          (interrupting)
                    It may be your business, but Joe is 
                    talking about the future. Selling 
                    systems software, he probably 
                    would ve made you a couple hundred 
                    thousand dollars this year. 
                          (pause)
                    We just made you several million.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    50.

                                  CLARK (CONT'D)
                          (Bosworth eyes him)
                    ...Sir. 

      Everyone turns to Clark, his voice surprising in this room. 
      MacMillan even looks over. Bosworth appears as if he s about 
      to bite through his own teeth.

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Several million, huh? 
                          (to MacMillan)
                    You are a basketcase. 

      Deathly silence in the room. Then: 

                                    CARDIFF
                    I don t know  bout you boys, but 
                    this is best sales pitch I ever 
                    heard.
                          (to MacMillan)
                    I admire your tenacity, son. 
                          (sober)
                    Now don t screw it up. Because in 
                    Texas, you put a man s livelihood 
                    on the line and don t come 
                      through...
                          (pause)
                    You won t be gettin  any new job, 
                     cause ain t nobody gonna able to 
                    find where you buried. 

      MacMillan stands. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    So put me in charge of the PC 
                    division. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    Excuse me? 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    VP-level. If you want this to 
                    succeed, then I m in charge. I 
                    frankly don t trust anyone else to 
                    see it through and it was my idea 
                    to--

                                  CLARK
                    Our idea. 

      Again, everyone looks to Clark. He stands.

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Our idea.                                                                                     51.


                                  BOSWORTH
                    What are you saying, Gordon?

                                  CLARK
                    I m saying... sir...
                          (pause)
                    I m saying you get both of us. We 
                    both run this. Because this is no 
                    longer a business of numbers, 
                    quota, or revenue. This is the 
                    business of imagination. I cracked 
                    that ROM BIOS chip like it was the 
                    morning crossword. You point out 
                    another engineer who can do that 
                    and I ll let them ride the horse, 
                    but so far? I m all you ve got.   
                          (pause)
                    This is the future. We both made 
                    you see it. Now we run it for you. 

      Bosworth looks to MacMillan, who seems caught off guard. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                          (disgusted)
                    Vice presidents. Good God. 

      Cardiff heads for the door. 

                                    CARDIFF
                    Hell with it. Let s make it happen, 
                    boys. 
                          (on his way out, 
                            indicating Gordon)
                    An  get this one a separate office 
                    for his balls. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    So where the hell are we gonna find 
                    this engineer?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. TEXAS CHILI PARLOR -- AFTERNOON

      MacMillan and Clark sit in a wooden booth amidst this 
      landmark.

      ACROSS FROM THEM sits Cameron Howe. Her face skeptical. 

                                    CAMERON
                    No. Absolutely not.                                                                                     52.


                                  MACMILLAN
                      I understand there s a lot for you 
                    to be upset about. 

                                    CAMERON
                    You re a complete jackass, you know 
                    that? I thought you invited me here 
                    to apologize. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    So we bring you on, you build the 
                    chip--

                                  CLARK
                    Under my guidance.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    And away we go.

                                    CAMERON
                    You re not getting it. Even if, IF, 
                    I was to consider doing this, I d 
                    have to leave the university.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I m sure you can defer for a 
                    semester or... more.

      She laughs, incredulous. 

                                  CLARK
                    Listen to me. This is real. You 
                    want to change the game as we know 
                    it? Or you wanna hang around here 
                    and learn about transistors?

      She sobers, sees how serious Clark is. 

                                    CAMERON
                    All right. I ll do it.  

                                  MACMILLAN
                    We ll see you in Dallas.

      MacMillan, Clark get out of the booth. 

                                    CAMERON
                    One more question.

      They turn. 

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Why d you drive your car off a 
                    cliff at a hundred miles an hour?                                                                                    53.


      Clark looks to MacMillan, confused. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MACMILLAN S QUATTRO -- LATER

      MacMillan drives, sunglasses on. Clark sits next to him. 
      Silence for a moment, until:

                                  CLARK
                    The hell s she talking about, man?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Nothing.

                                  CLARK
                    Who are you? Really? Because I m 
                    staking a lot on this. I need to 
                    know.  

      MacMillan doesn t answer him. Clark mulls it over. 

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Do you want me to drive?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    No.

                                        ACT VI

      INT. CARDIFF GIANT OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

      Barry Shields sits across from Cameron Howe at the corner of 
      the conference room table, questioning her.

                                    SHIELDS
                    I need your answers to be honest, 
                    as they re being recorded for legal 
                    record. If you answer falsely, you 
                    risk perjuring yourself. Do you 
                      understand?

                                    CAMERON
                    Yep.

                                    SHIELDS
                    Please say  yes  or  I do. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Yes. I do.

      INT. CARDIFF GIANT OFFICES -- CONTINUOUS

      MacMillan and Clark stand outside the conference room, 
      watching Shields question Cameron. None of what they re 
      saying can be heard. Bosworth stands next to them. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    You better pray we come outta this 
                    with more than our asses intact. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I ve already got a line on a deal I 
                    can put together. Applied Data is 
                    looking to outfit with PC s. 

                                  BOSWORTH
                    It s gonna take a lot more than

                    No. I have not.

      INT. CARDIFF GIANT OFFICES - MACMILLAN S OFFICE -- LATER

      MacMillan sits down at his desk, anxious. He still hasn t 
      even really unpacked in here. He reaches into a small 
      carboard box, pulls out a Rolodex, puts it on his desk. 

      Pulls the phone closer, picks up, starts dialing.

                                  BOSWORTH (V.O.)
                    I had some numbers run and the PC 
                    business will cost us upwards of a 
                    couple million just to get in the 
                    door. So if we reach that perfect 
                    world where we actually start 
                    sellin  these things instead of 
                    runnin  from the boogie man, your 
                    quota s gonna be from here to the 
                    goddamn Moon.
                          (pause)
                      MacMillan, I suggest you start cold-
                    calling. Clark, I m gonna need a 
                    product we can actually sell. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                          (into phone)
                    Greg, how are you, it s Joe 
                      MacMillan.
                          (pause)

                    Have you ever attempted to reverse 
                    engineer any IBM equipment or 
                    products?                                                                                     56.


                                    CAMERON
                    No. I have not.

      MacMillan on the phone, later:

                                  MACMILLAN
                    It s where everything is headed. 
                    And Cardiff is doing it cheaper, 
                    better, faster. Trust me.

                    No. I have not.

      -- MacMillan s calls begin to overlap, faster and faster:                                                                                    57.

                    Bottom line is, it s the difference 
                    between Now and Then...

                                  CLARK
                    I ll do it. 

      Clark turns, walks off. 

      DOWN THE HALLWAY stands Al, watching them uneasily. His eyes 
      focus on Clark, quickly coming towards him. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. APPLIED DATA OFFICES -- DAY

      MacMillan walks in toward the conference room, stops when he 
      sees Barnes and fellow IBM black suits there, smiling and 
      shaking the hands of executives we met previously. 

                                  BARNES
                      MacMillan.                                                                                    58.


      MacMillan shakes a couple of hands as the execs leave.

                                  BARNES (CONT D)
                    Trying to win back your systems 
                    account? I think you just lost it.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I m here to talk about a PC 
                    solution.

                                  BARNES
                    You and I both know Cardiff s  pre-
                    existing  PC program is bullshit.  
                          (pause)
                    I bet Cardiff loves you for that, 
                    too, right? Making him waste 
                    several million so he doesn t lose 
                      everything? It s so bold, Joe. Very 
                    bold. I guess it s because this is 
                    personal for you.

      MacMillan says nothing.

                                  BARNES (CONT D)
                    It s okay. It s personal for me, 
                    too, now.
                          (closer to MacMillan)
                    You just became a pet project of 
                    mine. I ll be surprised if you move 
                      a thousand of whatever Frankenstein 
                    box you end up squeezing out. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I ve got another 25 calls lined up 
                    in this region and beyond. 
                    Everybody wants a PC, especially 
                    one that s shaping up to be better 
                    than yours. They re starting to 
                    call me now. 

                                  BARNES
                    Good for you. I m opening up a 
                    satellite office out here. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Then I guess I ll be seeing more of 
                    you. 

                                  BARNES
                      Everywhere you look. All those 
                    calls? They ll gladly pay a million 
                    dollars more just for that Big Blue 
                    logo.                                                                                     59.


      They part, MacMillan headed into the conference room, Barnes 
      returning to his cadre of black suits. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MACMILLAN S CONDO -- LATE NIGHT

      He s up late, like always. A KNOCK. He turns the TV off, goes 
      to the door and opens it, revealing Cameron standing there. 
      Pretty worn out, but still guarded in front of him. 

                                    CAMERON
                      I finished it.

      She holds up a small rectangular black chip. Drops it in his 
      hand. He regards it, stunned. Is it real?

                                  MACMILLAN
                    I can t believe it.

                                    CAMERON
                    Believe it. And it s clocking 
                    faster than the IBM BIOS by almost 
                    a full second.

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Do you want to... how are you?

                                    CAMERON
                    Dead as disco. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    Why don t you come in?

      A beat. 

                                    CAMERON
                    No. I m not coming in. Because this 
                    is my shot. I m here for me. So I m 
                    never coming in. 
                          (pause)
                      Understand?

      MacMillan can only nod.

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                          (pointing)
                    What happened there?

      MacMillan looks to where she points. The patio window that he 
      blasted a baseball through is now horribly patched with a 
      flat cardboard box and duct tape. He turns back to her.                                                                                     60.


                                  MACMILLAN
                    What do you say we go wake up 
                    Gordon?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CLARK S GARAGE -- LATER

      Clark, in a bathrobe, sits at his work station. MacMillan and 
      Cameron stand behind him. Even Donna is there in a bathrobe 
      of her own, interest piqued. On the table sits...

      A CARDIFF GIANT PC PROTOTYPE

      Kind of a monstrosity at the moment. Circuitry boards 
      exposed, a lot of wiring, all hooked up to a bulky old 
      monitor. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    We re getting a better box for it, 
                    right?

                                  CLARK
                    Without a doubt.

                                  DONNA
                    Well... boot it up.

      Clark, MacMillan exchange looks. Clark reaches over, locks a 
      floppy disk in the drive. Hits the power switch...

      The machine powers on, a series of HARSH ELECTRIC CATCHES, 
      the exhaust fan WHIRS to life.

      They wait. 

                                  HALEY (O.S.)
                    Mommy?

      The adults turn around. Haley stands in her pajamas by the 
      door, holding a stuffed lamb by the arm. 

      ANGLE ON MacMillan watching the little girl. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                          (softly)
                    Should she be up?

      Donna is already moving toward the child.

                                  DONNA
                    Go back to bed, everything s fine. 
                    We re just looking at Daddy s 
                    secret project, okay?                                                                                    61.


      Haley lingers as Cameron and Gordon direct their attention 
      back to the computer.  

                                  CLARK
                          (engrossed)
                    Night, baby. 

      MacMillan continues to look at Haley. She finally goes. 

      Donna turns and as she walks back, she makes eye contact with 
      MacMillan. A quick moment. He swallows, turns away. 

      ANGLE ON the monitor screen. A green cursor begins to blink.

                                  CLARK (CONT D)
                    Needs a load progress screen.

                                    CAMERON
                    Why? A progress screen just masks--

                                  CLARK
                          (turning to her)
                    Here s the deal. When I tell you 
                      something s not right. You change 
                    it. Because it s not right. 

      The awkward moment is interrupted by a series of LOUD 
      ELECTRIC SHUDDERS. Particularly long. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    What was that?

                                  CLARK
                    More kinks to iron out. 

      ANGLE ON the monitor. BEEP. It loads a preliminary message...

      MASTER CONTROL PROGRAM IS ONLINE

                                  MACMILLAN
                          (reading)
                     Master Control Program is online. 

                                  CLARK
                    What does that mean?

                                    CAMERON
                    I just thought it was funny. Guess 
                    you guys didn t see Tron. 

      A command prompt finally appears on the screen. Cameron 
      reaches over Clark. Types a few key strokes.

      THE DOT MATRIX PRINTER NEXT TO THEM SCREAMS TO LIFE                                                                                    62.


      Printing the screen. 

      ANGLE ON Clark, Cameron, MacMillan in the middle. The blue-
      green of the screen lighting their faces. 

                                  MACMILLAN
                    It s alive.
