      Early morning light blazes across the water and heats up the 
      west side of the river.  We hear FOOTFALLS on gravel.  Heavy 
    but controlled BREATHING.  And then ANGELA SWANSON races by. 

    At age 36, she's attractive, fit and driven.  No mere jogger.  
    Six minute miles? No problem.  She sips from a bottle of *
      GATORADE as the gravel path she's running on angles towards 
      Strawberry Mansion Bridge.  


    On the hill overlooking the river A MAN LOITERS, white, mid 
      30's, wearing a hoodie, watching joggers run along the banks 
    of the river below.  We get the feeling he's on the lookout 
    for someone.  And then Angela appears in the distance.  He 
      starts for Strawberry Mansion Bridge.  


      Shadows gather under the bridge.  Angela kicks it into high 
      gear.  Into darkness she goes.  And suddenly --

      ANGELA'S POV - 

    The CAMERA VEERS WILDLY as we are suddenly sent careening off 
    the path and plunging into the river.  

    IN THE WATER

      BLOOD PLUMES AROUND ANGELA'S HEAD.  Her eyes roll.  She 
      struggles for breath, and chokes on the water pouring into 
    her mouth instead.  She's drowning.  She fights it.  But 
      slowly, inexorably, the river claims her....


    All is still and quiet as Angela's inert body floats out from 
      under the bridge and rides the current towards Center City 
    and the Delaware River beyond.  

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      Philadelphia's iconic Boat House Row sits on the east side of 
    the river.  In the middle of the row is the U of Penn Boat 
      House with its big blue "P" painted on the landing dock.  
      Lying on that "P" is A BODY COVERED BY A SHEET.  

      Among the patrol cops and the Penn rowers being questioned we 
      pick out Medical Investigator PETER MAXWELL, age 36, an 
      employee of the Medical Examiner's Office.  He's tall with 
      rough good looks and still maintains the body of the 
      professional football player he once was.  He looks up from 
    his notes as Megan emerges from the Boat House.  They meet 
      over the body.

                                  PETER
                    Thought you had a doctor's 
                    appointment.

                                  MEGAN
                    Waste of time.  What do we have?*

      Peter consults his notes as Megan pulls the sheet off the 
      body and beholds --

                                  PETER
                    Angela Swanson, 36.  Bumped into 
                    the Penn Heavyweight Eight as they 
                    were pushing off the dock.  She's 
                    got trauma to the back of the head 
                    and traces of foam in her mouth.  
                    CSU is up river searching for where 
                    she went in.  Liver temp 93.2.

                                  MEGAN
                    Water temp?

                                  PETER
                    64.

    She makes a quick calculation in her head.

                                  MEGAN
                    Two hours.

    Two more new arrivals emerge from the Boat House, gold 
      shields clipped to their lapels.  Detectives BUD MORRIS, age 
    42, and SAMANTHA BAKER, age 37.  Morris is the senior of the 
    two and among the details we won't draw attention to until 
      later is a fresh shaving cut on his chin and an impression on 
    his ring finger where a wedding band used to be.  Samantha is 
      eager and bright but used to taking the back seat.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/105.


                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Hey, Pete.  

                                  PETER
                    Bud.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Who do you like on Sunday?

                                  PETER
                    Not the Eagles.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Traitor.  

      They're clearly familiar with Peter.  And not with Megan.

                                  PETER
                    Detective Morris, this is Dr. Megan 
                    Hunt.  I take it you haven't pulled 
                    her on a case before.

      Detectives Morris and Baker both react to the name.  Not in a 
      good way.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    It must be our lucky day.

      Megan just smiles.  *

                                  MEGAN
                    Look at that.  Already we agree on 
                    something.

      Det. Morris blinks like someone whose sarcasm has just 
      boomeranged on him --

                                  MEGAN
                    Our victim has blunt force trauma 
                    to the back of the head and 
                      preliminary indications of 
                    drowning.  No scrapes or abrasions 
                    that indicate she tried to break 
                    her fall.  She went into the river 
                    clean after being hit on the back 
                    of the head.  I'm calling it a 
                    presumed homicide.  Liver temp puts 
                    it about two hours ago.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    That's it?  You mean you haven't 
                    caught the murderer yet?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/106.


      There, Det. Morris thinks, that ought to ruffle her feathers.  
    But Megan just smiles again.*

                                  MEGAN
                    No, Detective, have you?By the *
                    way, you can tell CSU whoever 
                    attacked her did it on the west 
                    side of the river.

    A beat.  This is news even to Peter.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    How do you know that?

                                  MEGAN
                    She got some sun this morning.

      They all look at Angela's face.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    So?

      Peter gets it.

                                  PETER
                    So two hours ago the east side of 
                    the river was in shadow.

    As Detectives Morris and Baker chew on this --

                                  MEGAN
                    Autopsy in two hours.  See you 
                    there, Detectives.

      Megan turns and starts back towards the boat house.  She 
      feels their eyes on her.  She stops and looks back at Det. 
      Morris.

                                  MEGAN
                    One more thing.  Don't believe 
                    everything you've heard about me.  
                    The truth is much worse.

      With what might be called a "mischievous smile" she resumes *
    her exit through the Boat House.


      Detectives Morris and Baker, Megan and Peter.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Here's how this is supposed to 
                    work.  We ask the questions, you 
                    tell us what you know, and WE catch 
                    the bad guy, okay?

                                  MEGAN
                    So this morning you weren't 
                    serious, you were just mocking me.

      Det. Morris takes another verbal jab to the chin.Once again *
    we catch Det. Baker admiring Megan's pluck.*

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Even if Angela fell down the stairs 
                      accidentally, that's all the more 
                    reason for Burris to hold a grudge 
                    against Angela when he got out of 
                    prison.

                                  MEGAN
                    Okay.  Let's say he did hold a 
                    grudge.  Angela was hit on the back 
                    of the head as she ran under the 
                    bridge.  If Burris killed her, 
                    don't you think he'd want her to 
                    see him, to know it was him paying 
                    her back for sending him to prison?  
                    But there were no defensive wounds 
                    on Angela.  She didn't put up a 
                    fight because she never saw it 
                    coming.  Burris didn't do it.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    So what's your theory?  She calls 
                    him up for some ex-con sex?  Under 
                    a bridge on her morning run?  
                    Here's a real theory.  He bashed 
                    her over the head and killed her.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1021.


      Det. Morris turns his unhappy gaze to Peter.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Next time you want to come along, 
                    forget it.

      Detectives Morris headsfor the car.  Det. Baker trails *
      after.  Peter looks at Megan.  She is serenely unfazed.*

                                  MEGAN
                    We need to know more about Angela.


      Fishtown.  The docklands at the eastern edge of the city.  
      Narrow row houses inhabited by white working class poor.  In 
      front of one row house a WHITE SEDAN with the Philadelphia ME 
      Office logo pulls up.  Peter and Megan emerge.  


      Peter leads Megan back to the car, shaking his head.

                                  PETER
                    I've heard of someone getting some 
                    sense knocked into them, but 
                    feelings?  That's a new one.

                                  MEGAN
                    I'd throw my ex down the stairs if 
                    I thought it'd get the same result.

      Peter gives her a look, but Megan is already on to her next 
      thought.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Let's swing by midtown on our way 
                    back.

                                  PETER
                    But midtown's in the opposite 
                    direction.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1024.


                                  MEGAN
                          (a look)
                    It was a figure of speech.


      Megan stands on the sidewalk outside the office building she 
      just exited.  If the previous scene affected her in any way 
    you wouldn't know it.  She looks bored.  She checks her 
      reflection in the front windows.  And notices a pair of 
      UNIFORMED SCHOOL GIRLS pass by behind her.  She takes out her 
      cell phone and dials a number.

                                  MEGAN
                          (into phone)
                    I just wanted to remind you it's 
                    Lacey's birthday today.  You're 
                    going to call her, right?


      Megan stares at her reflection in the window glass.  How well 
      indeed.  Detectives Morris and Baker exit the building.  She 
      shakes off the thought with a quick --

                                  MEGAN
                    Goodbye, Mother.

    -- as Detectives Morris and Baker walk up.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You want to tell me what the hell 
                    you were doing up there?

                                  MEGAN
                    A little good cop bad cop.  I riled 
                    him up, you calmed him down.  So 
                    what else did he tell you?

      Det. Morris can't believe it --

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You know what the problem with that 
                    is?  You're not a cop!  And you 
                    know what else?  You're off this 
                    case!  I know plenty of ME's and *
                    none of them are as big a pain in 
                    the ass as you are!*

                                  MEGAN
                    They're also not as good as I am.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    You like to think that, don't you.

                                  MEGAN
                    How long ago did she kick you out, 
                    Detective?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1038.


      Morris stares at her.  

                                  MEGAN
                    You have an impression on your ring 
                    finger where a wedding band was 
                    recently removed.  And that cut on 
                    your chin?  It's from a double 
                    bladed razor, probably disposable.  
                    What happened?  When your wife 
                    kicked you out she didn't let you 
                    take your own razor?  

      Det. Morris' hand goes involuntarily to the cut on his chin.  
    He stares at Megan in astonishment.  So does Det. Baker.

                                  MEGAN
                    Every body tells a story.  Bring me 
                    in or don't.  But I want justice 
                    for Angela just as much as you do.

    A long beat as Det. Morris decides what to do.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Okay.  You want in?  Whitney denied 
                      everything.  The last time he saw 
                    Angela was at the firm's Annual 
                    Dinner Sunday night.  Angela was at 
                    his table but she didn't stay long.  
                    She had a sore throat.

                                  MEGAN
                    He's lying.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    About the sex, maybe.  But that 
                    doesn't make him a murderer.  And 
                    Burris had motive.

                                  MEGAN
                    So did Whitney if she was 
                    blackmailing him to make partner.

      Det. Morris just grins.  He lets his partner explain.  Det. *
      Baker is almost apologetic in doing so.*

                                  DET. BAKER
                    Angela didn't have to.  She already 
                    made partner.  She was at Whitney's 
                    table as a reward.  She won a big 
                    lawsuit last week.  It wasn't 
                    public yet but the Partnership 
                    Committee had already voted.            Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1039.


                                  DET. MORRIS
                    And there goes your theory.

      Det. Morris savors the sight of Megan having to swallow her 
      blown theory.  But Megan is nothing if not resilient.  

                                  MEGAN
                    What was the lawsuit about?

                                  DET. BAKER*
                    A boy mauled by a dog in Fairmont 
                    Park.  

      This rings a bell in Megan's head.  *

                                  MEGAN
                    Angela was mauled by a dog when she 
                    was a teenager.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    So?

                                  MEGAN
                    So what's she doing defending a 
                    case like that?

                                  DET. MORRIS
                          (re:Det. Baker)*
                    Didn't you hear her?  She was 
                    making partner.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    The dog was owned by the Roberts 
                    family.  Old Philadelphia money.  
                    One of the firm's biggest clients.

                          (into phone)
                    Peter, got a pen?  I want you to 
                    run down an address for me.

    As she waits, Det. Morris looms in front of her.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Where do you think you're going?

                                  MEGAN
                    Why?  You don't think I'll actually 
                    catch the killer, do you?


                                  END OF ACT THREE          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1040.


                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Blocks of tattered apartment buildings, bulldozed lots, 
      graffitied walls and weeds growing chest high out of the 
      pavement.  They call this area the "Badlands."  


      Peter leans against the hood of his car outside an apartment 
      building.  He watches as another car pulls up and Megan and 
      Detectives Morris and Baker emerge.  Peter hides a smile as 
      they approach.

                                  PETER
                    Hey, Bud.  How's it going?

      Det. Morris just scowls at him.  


      Megan, Peter and Detectives Morris and Baker huddle up 
      outside Rivers' building.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    So you think Whitney found out she 
                    betrayed him?

      Megan looks at him.  A breakthrough.  He's taking her 
      seriously.  

                                  MEGAN
                    It's a theory.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    I don't get it.  She takes a case 
                    to settle it and when that 
                    backfires she hands over privileged 
                      information that will reverse the 
                    case she just won?    

                                  PETER
                    You're forgetting her unilaterally 
                    lesioned amygdala.  

      Blank looks from the Detectives.  And a rather amused one 
      from Megan.

                                  DET. BAKER
                    You want to tryEnglish,please?*

                                  MEGAN
                    He means Angela's old head injury.  *
                    After her coma shewent back to *
                    work and four things happened: she *
                    took a case for ulterior motives, *
                    she had an affair, she violated *
                    attorney-client privilege, and she *
                    started calling her mother just to 
                    say hello.  Four things I guarantee *
                    you pre-head injury she wouldn't 
                    have done.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Well, it looks like we'll be*
                    talking to Whitney again.  Without 
                    you, if you don't mind.

      Said to Megan not with his usual scorn, but rather with 
      deference.  Another breakthrough.

                                  MEGAN
                    I don't mind at all.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1044.



      Megan comes up the walk approaching the front door.  She can 
    see and hear a birthday party going on inside.  She's about 
    to ring the bell, then catches a glimpse of her daughter 
      LACEY in the window.  

    ON MEGAN

    She circles around the back of the house, straddling bushes 
    and soiling her shoes as she does so, following Lacey through 
    the windows.  Finally Lacey is close enough to the kitchen 
      door for Megan to tap on the window.

    The door opens.  Lacey steps out.  Mother and daughter regard 
      each other.  Lacey presents as a twelve year old going on 
      twenty.  Mature, sophisticated, and just as emotionally on 
      guard as her mother.  

                                  MEGAN
                    Happy birthday.

                                  LACEY
                    Dad said you couldn't come.

                                  MEGAN
                    Dad says a lot of things.          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1054.


                                  LACEY
                    You mean that aren't true?

      Megan has been here all of ten seconds and already she's in 
      dangerous territory.

                                  MEGAN
                    That maybe tell only his side of 
                    the story.  

                                  LACEY
                    What would be your side?

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm here, aren't I?

      Megan smiles, trying to diffuse the tension.

                                  MEGAN
                    How's the party?

                                  LACEY
                    It's okay.

                                  MEGAN
                    Did I miss the cake?

                                  LACEY
                    Like you'd ever eat cake.

                                  MEGAN
                    Try me sometime.

    A flicker of a smile on Lacey's face.  

                                  MEGAN
                    I got you a present.  I hope you *
                    like it.*

    She hands Lacey a blue Tiffany jewelry box.  Lacey opens it *
    and pulls out a key on a silver chain.  She stares at it, 
      then at Megan, curious.

                                  MEGAN
                    You remember that picture of me and 
                    grandpa in front of his tool shed?

                                  LACEY
                    Yeah?

                                  MEGAN
                    That shed was his sanctuary.  The *
                    one place he could hide from the *
                    world.  Nobody got in there.

                                  MEGAN (CONT'D)
                    And I mean nobody.  For years and 
                    years I tried.  And then one day, 
                    when I was about your age, he gave 
                    me the key.  
                          (re: Lacey's present)
                    That's the key to my apartment.  
                    Where you'll always be welcome.  A 
                    sanctuary.  An escape whenever you 
                    need one.  Whatever you want it to 
                    be.  

      Megan smiles nervously.  This is new territory for her.  And *
    for Lacey too.  She looks at her mother, processing this*
      gesture, not sure she fully understands it --*


      Megan and Peter stand on the doorstep.  Megan has already 
      rung the bell.  The door opens and Whitney looks out.  He's 
      none too happy to see Megan again.  

                                  WHITNEY
                    What do you want?

                                  MEGAN
                    Did you love Angela?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1056.


      Whitney has no time to react.  It's dinner time.  His wife 
      Jill calls out to him from inside the house.  

                                  JILL (O.S.)
                    Raymond, who is it?

                                  WHITNEY
                    In a minute!

                                  MEGAN
                    Did you love her?  Because if you 
                    did, then help me find her killer 
                    and tell me the truth.  She was 
                    here yesterday morning, wasn't she.

                                  WHITNEY
                    Yes, all right?  

                                  MEGAN
                    And you didn't know she slipped 
                    privileged information to Carl 
                    Rivers.

                                  WHITNEY
                    Like I told the Detectives, no.

                                  JILL (O.S.)
                    Raymond?  Who's out there?

                                  WHITNEY
                    Just a second!

    He closes the door behind him.

                                  WHITNEY
                    Look, I'll tell you everything you 
                    want to know.  But just don't let 
                    my wife find out, okay?

                                  MEGAN
                    Mr. Whitney, I owe you an apology.  
                    I thought you had more than one 
                    reason to kill Angela, but it turns 
                    out all you're guilty of is falling 
                    in love with her.

    The door opens and JILL WHITNEY, age 45, looks out at her 
      guests.

                                  JILL
                    What's going on?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1057.


                                  WHITNEY
                    This is Dr. Hunt from the Medical 
                    Examiner's Office.  She's looking 
                    into Angela's death.

                                  MEGAN
                    Mrs. Whitney, Sunday night at the 
                    firm's annual dinner, did Angela 
                    mention she had strep throat?

                                  JILL
                    Yes.

                                  MEGAN
                    And what she was taking for it?

      Jill goes cautiously silent.  

                                  MEGAN
                    I'm guessing she did.  In fact I'm 
                    positive she told you she was 
                    taking Erythromycin for an 
                    infection of Beta Streptococcus 
                    Group A.  

    Now Jill looks downright worried.  Megan turns to Whitney.

                                  MEGAN
                    Have your sons had strep throat 
                    recently?

                                  JILL
                    Don't answer that, Raymond.

                                  MEGAN
                    I'll consider that a yes.  The 
                      interesting thing about Beta Group 
                    A is that it's rare in adults 
                    UNLESS they contract it from their 
                    children.  You didn't know it, Mr. 
                    Whitney, but you got it from your 
                    sons and passed it on to Angela.  
                    And that's how your wife knew the 
                    two of you were having an affair.  

      Whitney cringes.  But his concerns about his affair being 
      revealed are trumped by the arrival of Detectives Morris and 
      Baker in a sedan, and two UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS in a 
      SQUAD CAR.  All four approach the house.  

                                  WHITNEY
                    What are they doing here?          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1058.


      Det. Morris answers this question by producing a piece of 
      paper.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Mr. Whitney, this is a warrant to 
                    search your house.  Officers?

    The two Uniforms proceed inside as Whitney scans the 
      document.

                                  WHITNEY
                    You're looking for drugs?

                                  MEGAN
                    Amoxicillin, to be exact.

    At the word, Jill sags.  As if she knew the gig was up.

                                  MEGAN
                    Not only did your wife know you 
                    gave Angela strep throat, she also 
                    knew Erythromycin is prescribed for 
                    strep throat to people severely 
                    allergic to penicillin and its 
                    derivatives, the most common of 
                    which is Amoxicillin.  She dropped 
                    your sons off at school yesterday 
                    morning, then came back here and 
                    found you and Angela having sex.  *
                    Instead of confronting you she 
                    spiked Angela's Gatorade with, I'm 
                    willing to bet, the same 
                      Amoxicillin your sons were 
                    prescribed for their strep throat.  

                                                          CUT TO:


      We're back to Angela's morning run at the beginning of our 
      story.  She sips from a bottle of GATORADE as the gravel path 
      she's running on angles towards Strawberry Mansion Bridge.  

                                  MEGAN (V.O.)
                    Angela left your house around 6:45 
                    a.m. yesterday morning.  She made 
                    it all the way to the river before 
                    she went into anaphylactic shock -- 
                    a fatal allergic reaction affecting 
                    every system in her body.

      Angela kicks it into high gear as she goes under the bridge.  
    We HOLD ON ANGELA as, suddenly, she staggers to a stop AND *
      CLUTCHESHER THROAT CHOKING --*          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1059.

                    She became dizzy.  Her airways 
                    stopped working due to 
                      bronchoconstriction.  And then she 
                    lost her balance.

      ANGELA FALLS INTO THE RIVER.  AND CRACKS HER HEAD ON AN IRON 
      BEAM -- HEAVY, METAL AND SQUARE WITH A DULL EDGE -- DUMPED IN 
    THE RIVER LONG AGO AND LYING JUST BELOW THE SURFACE.  

                                  MEGAN (V.O.)
                    Foam in the mouth is often seen in 
                    drowning cases but is also a 
                    product of anaphylaxis.  Angela 
                    wasn't hit by her killer on the 
                    back of the head.  The back of her 
                    head hit something when she fell 
                    into the water.

      Blood plumes around Angela's head.  Her eyes roll.  She 
      struggles for breath.  We watched it before, we watch it 
      again, as slowly, inexorably, the river claims her....

                                                            BACK TO:


    The two Uniforms return.  One holds up a prescription bottle 
    in an evidence bag.  Megan takes it and shows the label to 
      Jill.  It reads all too clearly: "Liquid Amoxicillin."

                                  MEGAN
                    Liquid Amoxicillin.  When this *
                    matches the formulation we found in *
                    Angela's stomach, that will be all 
                    for you.  Anything you want to say?

      Whitney stares at his wife in horror.  She looks back at him, 
      then at Megan, Peter and Detectives Morris and Baker --

                                  JILL
                    I want a lawyer.

      Megan smiles with grim satisfaction as Det. Morris brings out 
    the cuffs.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Jill Whitney, you're under arrest 
                    for the murder of Angela Swanson.  
                    You have the right to remain 
                    silent....          Christopher Murphey - Body of Evidence - 1/11/1060.



      Jill sits in the back of the Detectives' car.  Det. Baker 
      shuts her in.  Det. Morris meanwhile is having trouble 
      finding words for Megan.  

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    I guess I'll see you at trial.

                                  MEGAN
                    Yes you will.

                                  DET. MORRIS
                    Well then, thanks.  Doctor.

                                  MEGAN
                    You're welcome.  Detective.

      Det. Morris returns to his car.  Det. Baker throws a *
      respectful nod at Megan before she too climbs in and the car *
      pulls away.  *

      Megan turns to find Peter regarding her with a smile.*

                                  MEGAN
                    What are you smiling at?

                                  PETER
                    It's not like you not to rub it in.*

                                  MEGAN
                    Get in the car.
