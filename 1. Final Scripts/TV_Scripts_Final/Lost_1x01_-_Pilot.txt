                                         Pilot 

                                        ACT ONE

11OVER BLACKNESS, MUSIC.  OMINOUS AND FOREBODING.  THEN, OUT OF 
    THE DARKNESS, A SINGLE WORD.  FLOATING IN SPACE, OUT OF 
      FOCUS, TOWARD CAMERA.  AS IT APPROACHES IT COMES INTO FOCUS, 
    BUT IT'S SHARP ONLY FOR A BRIEF MOMENT:


                                          LOST




      AS IT NEARS US IT AGAIN LOSES FOCUS -- AND AS WE MOVE THROUGH 
      THE "O" OUR MUSIC CRESCENDOS, THEN STOPS ABRUPTLY AS WE CUT 
      TO:

    A MAN'S EYE22

      EXTREME CLOSEUP.  Open wide.  The man's skin wet, speckled 
      with soil and flecks of blood.  His breathing CLOSELY MIKED -- 
      erratic.  This man's in shock.  The SOUNDS of INSECTS and 
      ANIMALS other-worldly.  A blink.

      Then, the REVERSE ANGLE: staring up hundreds of BAMBOO 
      STALKS.  Sunlight almost impenetrable through the dense 
      forest.

      SLIGHTLY WIDER on the Man's face as he stares upward, 
      disoriented, stunned.  40-years-old.  Fit.  In normal 
      circumstances, one glance would make you feel confident in 
      him.  Trusting.  But here, now, he's the one in trauma.

    His name is JACK.

      Then, a RUSTLING SOUND -- something COMING -- it gets LOUDER 
    and Jack suddenly SNAPS his head to the side to see something 
      appear through the thick bamboo foliage --

    A WHITE LABRADOR.

      Collar.  Tags.  It stops abruptly, twenty feet away from 
      Jack, looking at him.  And for the first time, we PULL BACK 
    TO A WIDE SHOT of the intense, alien-looking BAMBOO FOREST.

    The dog just stares at Jack, who we now see wears a BUSINESS 
      SUIT and lies on his back, caught in broken bamboo stalks.  
    And Jack just stares back.




                                                                                CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                          2.

      CONTINUED:22


      It's an odd tableau -- man and dog looking at each other, 
      both entirely out of place...

      Finally the Lab turns and huffs back into the jungle, 
        disappearing in the claustrophobic bamboo -- and Jack would 
      call out "Wait" if he could even think that clearly and he 
      turns to sit up and it's a PAINFUL MOVE -- he manages to 
      extricate himself from the plants -- and while still on his 
      knees, he opens up his suit jacket to check out the source of 
      his pain.  Something on his left side -- but we're so TIGHT 
      on his face that whatever he sees, we don't.  Yet.

      His reaction to his wound is more disappointed than 
      terrified.  He manages to get to his feet, feeling something 
      in his jacket pocket.  He reaches in... and pulls out a 
      MINIATURE BOTTLE OF VODKA.

      And we HOLD ON his face as he looks at it... considering... 
      his heart beginning to POUND, his fear growing, as does a 
      SOUND -- a FRIGHTENING, ODD SOUND -- something REVVING in the 
      distance -- SOMETHING LOUD -- and the horror of what he 
      suddenly understands far outweighs any physical pain.  He 
      moves off --

      EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY33

      Jack moves as fast as he can through the THICK BAMBOO -- and 
    as he goes there's something that almost beckons to him -- he 
      hurries through the thick growth, his determined eyes focused 
    on the thing he approaches -- and as he gets closer to it, we 
      finally see it:

    A WHITE TENNIS SHOE

      Laces untied, caught mid-fall in a bamboo tree, hanging by a 
      branch, twelve feet above ground.  He stops for a moment, 
      looks at it.  Again: THE LOUD REVVING -- but it's CLOSER NOW - 
    - and suddenly the most important thing in the world is that 
    he get there and fast -- so he's moving now, even faster than 
      before -- through a straight-away miracle path, he's near 
      SPRINTING now -- BREATHING QUICKLY, ERRATICALLY as he makes 
    his way --

      EXT. BRUSH - DAY44

    -- and now he's running from bamboo into JUNGLE BRUSH -- 
      thick still, but there's some more sunlight and he's almost 
      there and finally he bursts out of the brush onto --

      EXT. BEACH - DAY55

    -- and Jack runs up, finally stopping dead in an EXTREME 
      CLOSEUP.  


                                                                              CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                          3.

      CONTINUED:55


      He's bathed in SUNLIGHT now -- squinting at what he sees -- 
      and we're just on his eyes. HOLD ON HIM, in shock, until he 
      moves forward -- and IN THE SAME SHOT, we PAN AS HE MOVES -- 
      180 DEGREES UNTIL WE'RE BEHIND HIM, LOOKING OUT ON SOMETHING 
      ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC.  Only twenty yards away...

    A PLANE CRASH ON THE BEACH66

      777 -- PASSENGER AIRLINER -- 250-Seater -- the MIDDLE SECTION 
      of the fuselage PLOWED INTO THE SAND -- one WING STICKING 
      STRAIGHT UP, TOWERING SEVEN STORIES INTO THE SKY, sporadic 
      SPARKS BURSTING FROM THE INVERTED ENGINE, showering down on 
      the absolute MAYHEM on the sand -- 

77ANGLE 

      -- and it is like a fucking WARZONE: scattered FIRES and 
      wreckage -- DOZENS OF PEOPLE RUNNING ABOUT, some injured, 
      others not -- they're helping each other, SCREAMING -- their 
      cries drowned out by the SOUND and WIND caused by the 
      ENORMOUS JET ENGINE -- no, not the one on the wing pointing 
      upward -- the other one -- the one on the INVERTED WING, now 
      cracked off its brackets and resting at SAND LEVEL.  And the 
      ENGINE STILL REVS -- SPASTICALLY, ERRATICALLY -- SPEWING 
      COOLANT and SPARKS and SUCKING IN SAND every time it 
      THROTTLES UP -- 

88TIGHT ON JACK 

      as he takes this in, overwhelmed -- knowing he's part of it -- 
      his eyes WELL UP in fear -- sorrow -- confusion -- and he 
      turns to look for help -- 

99ANGLE 

      -- but what he sees... is nothing.  His look spans 360 
      degrees: there's only spectacular ocean, waves violently 
      CRASHING as far as a half mile from shore -- a distant 
      coastline -- then MOUNTAINS -- jagged, 2000-foot high peeks -- 
    a deep valley of JUNGLE -- then his eyes are back on the 
      horror of the CRASH -- 

1010ANGLE 

      -- where DOZENS OF LIVES are in the balance -- and all at 
      once he knows that some -- perhaps most -- will die if he 
      doesn't take action -- and so he does --

      EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY1111

      Chaos.  Terror.  Smoke, fumes, fire -- people desperately 
      trying to help each other -- running, screaming -- everything 
      happening at once --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          4.



      ANGLE1212

      And amid the madness, the JET ENGINE MOMENTARILY REVS DOWN -- 
      enough to HEAR A MAN'S SCREAM -- Jack turns to the source: a 
      MAN is caught -- STUCK UNDERNEATH two rows of airplane seats  
      -- ten feet to the side of the malfunctioning engine --

      Jack hurries across the insanity toward the man -- flash- 
      passing pieces of conversation as he runs --

                  KOREAN MANMAN #1
          (searching for his wife)-- GET AWAY FROM THE GAS!!!  
      -- SUN!!!  SUN!!!STAY OVER THERE!!!

                    WOMAN #2MAN #2
      -- SHE WAS RIGHT HERE!  I I NEED SOME HELP!  PLEASE--!
      DON'T KNOW!

      ANGLE1313

      -- Jack races past a pretty 20-year-old girl who we HOLD ON 
      for a moment -- she just stands there, SCREAMING LIKE A 
      MOTHERFUCKER.  We'll meet her later.

1414ANGLE 

      Jack gets to the man stuck under the seats -- he's too close 
      to the terrifying, LOUD ENGINE -- which is still so hot that 
      HEAT RIPPLES can be seen behind Jack -- who sweats now as he 
      tries to LIFT THE ROW OF SEATS off the man --

      With the DEAFENING VOLUME of the jet drowning out any 
      dialogue, we see Jack YELLING for TWO MEN close by (one of 
      them is LOCKE, 58, someone else we'll get to know in a bit) -- 
      they run over and help -- and the three STRAIN HARD as they 
      lift the chair sections off -- Jack then moves to the man -- 
      whose leg BLEEDS SEVERELY.

      Jack rips off his tie, immediately goes to business the way 
      only a man with medical training could: he begins making a 
      TOURNIQUET, tying the injured man's leg off --

      ANGLE1515

      As he ties the leg, Jack looks up to see a whole mess of 
        simultaneous emergencies -- including a 60-year-old WOMAN in 
    a PEACH BLOUSE, who lies unconscious with a 30-year-old MAN 
      desperately trying to revive her --

      WHIP PAN1616

      across the beach of debris to a PREGNANT WOMAN, on her knees, 
      struggling to stand, but with no one to help --



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          5.



      ANGLE1717

      Jack then yells to the two Men he's with to take the 
      Tourniquet Man to safety -- and Jack RUNS -- OVER THE WING,

      BEHIND THE MONSTROUS REVVING ENGINE --1818

      over to the Australian Pregnant Woman (CLAIRE) -- he helps 
      her up -- helps her walk -- but she stumbles again, strains:

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- I'm having contractions --

      Jack helps her lie down--

                                  JACK
                    -- That's not ideal... how many months 
                    pregnant are you -- ?

                                  CLAIRE
                          (crying)
                    -- Almost eight months --

      ANGLE1919

      -- and he glances up, checking on the unconscious 60-year-old 
      Woman in the peach blouse, the 30-year-old Man still trying 
      to revive her -- though his eyes are there, he asks Claire:

2020ANGLE 

                                  JACK
                    -- How far apart are they -- ?

                                  CLAIRE 
                    -- I don't know, a few of 'em just 
                    happened --

      AND WE CUT BACK2121

      to the two Men, carrying Tourniquet Man away from --

      THE LOUD ENGINE2222

      -- and they're at a safe distance -- that's when ANOTHER MAN, 
      his back to us -- someone we haven't seen -- runs past us, 
      just in front of the massive engine -- just as it REVS FULL 
      BLAST -- AND THE MAN GETS SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE AND JUST AS 
      HE HITS THE BLADES WE CUT BACK TO:






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          6.



      JACK2323

      With Claire as the engine EXPLODES in the distance behind 
      them -- camera ROCKED, Claire SCREAMS, Jack COVERS Claire 
      with his body as debris falls -- LITTERING THE SITE WITH 
      PIECES OF FIERY DEBRIS.

      ANGLE2424

      At least the HORRIBLE ENGINE NOISE IS GONE now -- and with 
      Jack's horrified face close to Claire's, he forces himself to 
      appear calm -- to his focus on her:

                                  JACK
                    -- listen to me-- listen to me, you're 
                    gonna be okay -- do you understand?  But 
                    you need to lie absolutely st--

                                  CLAIRE
                          (suddenly, winces, scared)
                    -- There -- God, that's a big one--

                                  JACK
                    -- Okay --
                          (looks up, calls out:)
                    YOU!

      The random person who turns is a MAN -- a large guy, more or 
      less frozen in terror -- this is HURLEY.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    COME HERE!

                                  HURLEY
                    -- The -- the plane crashed--

                                  JACK
                    Yeah, I know -- get over here!

      And Hurley does -- in this moment he might just follow anyone 
      anywhere -- Jack rips off his watch, gives it to him:

                  JACK (CONT'D)HURLEY
      -- I need you to get this 
      woman away from these fumes!  
      Take her over there! -- Okay -- okay--
      -- Then stay with her!  Don't 
      let her move!  If her 
        contractions occur closer 
      than three minutes apart, 
      call out for me!-- You gotta be kidding me --




                                                                              CONTINUED)

                          (with bedside manner, to    
                            Claire)
                    I'll be back soon.

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- Thank you --

      Jack's already up -- Hurley calling out:

                                  HURLEY
                    -- Hey, what's your name?!

      And here it is, the first time we've heard it:

                                  JACK
                    Jack!

      And Hurley turns back to Claire, who says, crying:

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- I'm sorry --

      Hurley quickly begins helping Claire up -- and though 
      terrified, he tries to comfort her --

                                  HURLEY
                    -- Don't be sorry -- this wasn't your 
                    fault --

      WITH JACK NOW2525

      -- as he runs to the unconscious 60-year-old Peach Blouse 
      Woman (ROSE) -- immediately taking over for the 30-year-old, 
      whose name is BOONE:

                        JACKBOONE
      -- Stop -- her head's not 
      tilted far back enough -- -- Are you sure?  I'm a

      stomach--
        (as he does the work)
      -- You seriously need to 
      think about giving back that 
      license --

      And Jack's performing it now on Rose the way it should be -- 
      breath, breath, pump, pump, pump --

                                  BOONE 
                    That's exactly what I was doing!





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          8.



      ANGLE - HURLEY AND CLAIRE2626

      As Hurley moves with Claire to an area on the other side of 
      the plane -- Claire lying down again, in pain, on the sand.

      ANGLE - JACK AND ROSE2727

      As he keeps trying CPR on her -- Boone watching --

                                  BOONE
                    -- Hey man, she's still not breathing!
                          (then)
                    Maybe we need to do one of those hole 
                    things -- where you stick a pen in her 
                    throat?

                                  JACK
                          (just get the fuck outta here)
                    -- Yeah, good idea -- you go get me a 
                    pen!

      And Boone hurries off -- Jack, just relieved to be rid of 
      him, goes back to Rose -- trying to bring her back -- when 
      suddenly: WREEEEEEEEEEORRRRRR!!! -- a LOUD METALLIC WHINE 
      which makes Jack TURN AROUND to look --

      Dear God, it's --

      THE FUCKING WING2828

      -- THE 75-FOOT WING POINTING TOWARD GOD -- IT'S ACTUALLY 
      BENDING AT THE FUSELAGE WHERE IT'S CRACKED -- IT'S STOPPED 
      FOR THE MOMENT, BUT IT'S CLEAR: THIS THING IS MOMENTS AWAY 
      FROM CRASHING DOWN UPON THE SAND -- WHIP PAN down to the sand 
      -- WHERE HURLEY AND CLAIRE REST ON THE SAND, oblivious -- and 
      in the direct path of the enormous metallic WING FULL OF FUEL 
      -- HORRIFIED --

      JACK WORKS ON THE WOMAN FASTER NOW2929

                                  JACK
                    -- Come on!  Come on!

      AND THE WING BENDS AGAIN --3030

      about to go -- a SHOT FROM ABOVE THE WING -- FUEL SPRAYING 
      FROM IT --

      JACK KEEPS PUMPING -- PUMPING --3131

      Suddenly ROSE GASPS FOR BREATH -- horrified, disoriented, but 
      ALIVE --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          9.



      ANGLE3232

      Seeing this, Jack's already RUNNING NOW as the WING BENDS 
      AGAIN -- CRACKS MORE -- and as Jack runs he yells out:

                                  JACK
                    MOVE!  MOVE!

      Hurley turns -- sees Jack approach -- Hurley's confused:

                      HURLEYJACK
      You -- you said don't move!GO, GET HER UP!!!  NOW!!!

      HURLEY TURNS -- SEES THE WING -- WEEEEEEEEEEEEORRRRRRR!!!3333

      HURLEY SCREAMS AS THE WING STARTS TO GO -- a LONG LENS SHOT 
      as JACK ARRIVES -- GRABS THEM, PULLS THEM TO THEIR FEET AND 
      RUSHES THEM AWAY AS THE WING FALLS RIGHT BEHIND THEM LIKE A 
      TIPPING REDWOOD TREE --

      -- AND THE WING SMASHES TO THE GROUND3434

      LANDING ON pieces of FIERY ENGINE DEBRIS and KA-BOOOOOOOM!!! 
      THE WING EXPLODES -- AN ENORMOUS BLAST -- pieces of FIERY 
      METAL RAIN EVERYWHERE --

      JACK3535

      instinctively protecting Claire, SCARED BUT DETERMINED --

                                  JACK 
                    -- You okay?

      She nods -- fast --

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                          (to Hurley)
                    Stay with her.

                                  HURLEY
                          (out of breath)
                    Dude, I'm not goin' anywhere.

      Jack gets up and moves off --

      EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY3636

      Now we're LONG LENS as Jack walks through the wreckage scene  
      -- amid smoldering piles of debris, and People helping each 
      other.  Things seem to finally be calming down.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          10.



      JACK SCANS THE AREA3737

      looking to make sure there's nothing that needs an urgent 
      response.  He finds one MAN, 45 in a suit, who lies on the 
      ground, unconscious.  BLEEDING BADLY from the head.  Jack 
      pulls open the Man's jacket -- TO REVEAL A PIECE OF METAL 
      SHRAPNEL STUCK INTO HIS STOMACH.

      Seeing this, Jack's eyes go flush with concern.  He checks 
      SHRAPNEL MAN's pulse -- pulls open his eyelids.  Jack 
      delicately removes the man's jacket, drapes it over him, 
      forming a makeshift BLANKET.  Jack turns to the ripped-open 
      end of the fuselage -- where first class and the cockpit 
      would normally be --

      INT. FUSELAGE - DAY3838

      INSIDE the fuselage, looking out, the tumultuous OCEAN framed 
      by this giant shattered aluminum tube.  It's a disorienting 
      shot, since the plane is BANKED ON ITS SIDE.  At this angle, 
      SEATS are on a SIDE WALL, the wreckage-strewn floor actually 
    a long row of windows.

      And Jack appears, looking into the fuselage -- and we PUSH IN 
      ON HIM.  What Jack sees -- despite his ER training -- sickens 
      him.  Then Boone arrives, urgent, holding a HANDFUL OF PENS.

                                  BOONE
                    -- I didn't know which one would work best.

      For a long beat, Jack's eyes don't leave the fuselage.  
      Finally he looks at Boone.  And the pens.  And tears well in 
      Jack's eyes -- the whole experience finally catching up to 
      him.  Jack takes all of the pens, saying, softly, 
        emotionally, kindly:

                                  JACK
                      ...They're all good.  Thanks...

      And Jack walks off, past Boone, who turns, watching Jack go.

      EXT. BEACH - DAY3939

    A fifty-yard distance from the wreckage, a fellow survivor 
      stands here, staring almost angrily at the wrecked plane.  
      He's 35, handsome, with a cocky, self-centered vibe.  And 
      he's smoking.  Meet SAWYER.

    A few others recover about here -- including another Man, who 
      approaches.  25.  English rocker.  Self-deprecating -- 
      somewhere between an adult and a child.  This is CHARLIE.  
      These two have never spoken.



                                                                              CONTINUED)

      -- You, uh... s'cuse me, ya 
      sure you should be smoking -- -- You sure you want me to 
      ?shove my foot up your ass?

    A beat.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Okay.  Excellent, just... thought I'd 
                    raise it.

      Charlie walks off.  A beat later, he returns --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    -- Mind if I... bum one then?  Thanks...

      Charlie takes a cig from tough Sawyer, then walks off.

      EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY4040

      MUSIC: Synthesizer DRONE.  A surreal post-disaster moment.  
      LONG LENS SHOT as Jack, for the first time appearing 
      vulnerable -- perhaps even weak -- near the jet's open CARGO 
      DOOR.  He rummages through a stranger's SUITCASE... other 
      bags he's already searched beside it.  As he ZIPS open 
      someone's TOILETRY BAG --

      EXT. BEACH WOODS - DAY4141

    A cluster of trees off the beach.  The SHATTERED JET barely 
      visible in the distance.  Jack walks in here, getting away 
      from the others.

      TIGHT SHOTS as he sets down, on a large rock, a TRAVEL SEWING 
      KIT.  A LIGHTER.  A T-shirt.

      And in some pain, Jack pulls off his jacket -- revealing an 
      enormous BLOOD STAIN and RIP on the side of his shirt.  He 
      carefully removes his shirt.  Looks down at the LARGE SLASH -- 
    A DEEP SIX INCH CUT STARTING ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND RUNNING TO 
      HIS BACK.

      Christ, he did all that with this crash wound.

      He twists, trying to figure out how best to sew himself up.  
      He angles around -- can't find a good way to approach this.  
      And we watch him for a long beat, feeling for Jack as he 
      tries to solve this painful puzzle.  Frustrated but needing 
      help, Jack looks around -- we pop to a TIGHT SHOT as he sees 
      something off-camera.  Something that makes him stop...

      ... and we see his point of view: walking, slowly, seemingly 
      aimless through the brush, is a WOMAN.  


                                                                              CONTINUED)

      She's thirty feet away, her back to us.  Jack watches her for 
    a moment.  Then he calls out:

                                  JACK
                    Excuse me!

      And this woman turns.  Her face pale, ghostly.  Wracked in 
      stress.  Eyes wet.  This is KATE.  Pretty, 26 years-old.  
      Smart.  Trustworthy.  And, in all the important ways, 
      entirely untested.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    D'y'ever use a needle?

      And Kate just stares at him for a moment, disoriented.

                                  KATE
                    ...d-- what?

                                  JACK
                    Have you ever patched up a pair of jeans?

                    ... I... I made the drapes in my apartment 
                    -- ?

                                  JACK
                    That's fantastic -- d'you have a second?  
                    I need a little help.

      Kate takes a post-traumatic-stress-disorder beat, then moves 
      forward, through the trees.  She arrives at Jack.

                                  KATE
                    ...Help with what?

      And Jack turns, SHOWING HER THE WOUND.

                                  JACK
                    This.

      And her eyes just close.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    I'd do it myself -- I'm a doctor -- but I 
                    just can't reach it.

      It's just like drapes, same -- No, I used a sewing 
      thing--machine on the drapes --

                                  JACK
                    You can do this, I'm telling you.  If you 
                    wouldn't mind.

    A beat.  Finally Kate snaps into agreement: she'll do it.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    -- Thank you --

      And Jack pulls from his pocket the mini bottle of VODKA.  
      Holds it out to her, as if offering a drink.  Odd.  Then:

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    It's for your hands.

      Understanding now, she takes the vodka, cleans her hands with 
      it.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    Save some for me.
                          (off her look; smiles)
                    The wound.

      She nods, gives back the half empty bottle as he gives her 
      the needle and thread:

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    You're gonna have to sterilize the 
                    needle.

      She takes the stuff, using the lighter to heat the needle.

      Jack sits on the rock, sucks in a sharp intake of breath as 
      he pours the remaining vodka over his wound -- it fucking 
      STINGS --

      Kate's finished with the needle -- considers the SIX COLORS 
      OF THREAD in the travel sewing kit.

                                  KATE
                    Any, uh... color preference?

      Jack looks at her -- there it was, the first flash of her 
        personality.

                                  JACK
                    Standard black.

      Kate nods, trying to stay cool, pulling out a length of black 
      thread and threads the needle.  Kate then kneels beside him -- 
      and after a beat she starts to sew his skin.  Then:

                                  KATE
                    So I might throw up on you.

                                  JACK
                          (it hurts, but:)
                    You're doing fine.

      He watches her, this pretty young woman he doesn't know, 
      stitching him back together again, trying to keep her 
      composure.  CLOSE ON her hands.  No jewelry, no watch.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    You live in New York?

      God, she just wants to lose it.  But she doesn't.

                                  KATE
                    ... I used to.  I've been in New Zealand.  
                    About a year.

                                  JACK
                    ...How come?

                                  KATE
                    Oh, I just... had to get away --

      -- And suddenly Kate is crying.  It just caught up to her, 
      that's all.  And she weeps, resting her head on the back of 
      her hand.  Jack suddenly feels guilty, watching this kind 
      stranger weep.  So he speaks, quietly, sweetly:

                                  JACK
                    ...Hey... hey, listen, I can get someone 
                    else to do this--

                                  KATE
                    -- No.  No, I'm okay.

      And Kate gathers her strength -- shows a small sign that 
      she's not someone to give up.  She SNIFFLES, gathers herself.  
      Knows she must.  She continues sewing.

                                  KATE (CONT'D)
                    You don't seem afraid at all.  I don't 
                    understand that.

                    Fear's sort of an odd thing.  It's like

                    You don't like it, but you can't just get 
                    rid of it.  It's a struggle.  But you 
                    have to learn to deal with it or it'll

                    I haven't had much success with fear.

      Sensing she needs some help as she works on him, Jack offers:

                                  JACK
                    When I was in residency, my first solo 
                    procedure was a spinal surgery on a 
                    sixteen year-old kid.  Girl.
                          (beat)
                    At the end of it -- thirteen hours later  
                    -- I was closing her up... and I... I 
                      accidentally ripped her dural sack -- you 
                    know what that is?

      Kate has stopped sewing, now staring at him.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    It's at the base of the spine, where all 
                    the nerves come together.  Membrane as 
                    thin as tissue.  So it ripped open -- the 
                    nerves just spilled out like angel hair 
                    pasta-- her spinal fluid flowing out and 
                    I just... froze.  'Cause I knew.  If I 
                    didn't get those nerves back in that sack 
                    and sew it up... those thirteen hours 
                    were for nothing, that girl would be 
                      paralyzed.  I had about a minute.
                          (beat)
                    And all the assistants were just watching 
                    me, I could feel their eyes.  And the 
                    terror was so... crazy, so real... and I 
                    knew I had to deal with it.  So I just 
                    made a choice.  I'd let the fear in.  Let 
                    it take over.  Let it do its thing.
                          (looks at Kate)
                    But only for five seconds.  That's all I 
                    was gonna give it.  So I started to count 
                    to five.  I could feel it inside -- like 
                    when you drink a milkshake on a hot day.
                          (beat)
                    One, two, three, four, five.
                          (beat)
                    And it was gone.  I got back to work.  
                    Sewed her up.  She was fine.

      Kate breathes again, returns to stitching him.

                    I think everyone has something like that.  
                    A moment where you establish your 
                      relationship with fear.  And either you 
                    learn to deal with it... or you don't.

      From Kate, a little, sad laugh:

                                  KATE
                    If that had been me... I think I would've 
                    run for the closest door.

                                  JACK
                    No, I don't think that's true.
                          (then)
                    You're not running now.

      And Kate stops -- looks up at him.  Her eyes clearly saying, 
      "Oh yes I am."

      EXT. CRASH SITE - DUSK4242

      The sun drops below the horizon.  The sky turning a 
      miraculous purple-red.

      Claire watches the sunset.

      At another part of the beach, Locke watches the sunset.

      ANGLE - THE LARGE BONFIRE - DUSK4343

    A MAN WANDERS into frame.  Stops.  Checks his CELL PHONE.  
      Holds it in the air.  Takes another few steps.  Checks it 
      again.  This ritual has been going on for awhile.

      CAMERA PULLS BACK past a 40 year-old Middle Eastern man, 
      SAYID, along with Boone (the former lifeguard) and a few 
      others, throw PALM FRONDS to make it even bigger.  Sayid 
      turns -- sees Charlie (our English rocker), sitting alone, 
      clutching his legs, looking like he's got the chills.

                                  SAYID
                    You!  What's your name?

      Charlie's head snaps to Sayid:

                                    CHARLIE
                    -- What -- sorry -- Charlie.

                                  SAYID
                    Charlie, we need some help with the fire!  
                    No one will see it if it isn't big!

                    -- Sayid!  I am on it, Sayid!

      TRACK CHARLIE as he goes for more fronds -- CAMERA STOPPING 
      ON ROSE, the woman Jack resuscitated, who sits on the sand 
      near the fire, a blanket wrapped around her.  Lit by the 
      fire, she's taking a man's WEDDING BAND and stringing it into 
      her necklace, turning the ring into a pendant.

      FIVE BONFIRES - NIGHT4444

      Spread out across the beach, groups of EIGHT to TWELVE 
      SURVIVORS huddle around them.  And we get a sense now of how 
      many have survived: forty-seven people. One of the fires is 
        particularly big --

      ANGLE - A KOREAN COUPLE4545

      30's.  Her name is SUN, his is JIN.  Both scratched up, 
      neither seriously wounded.  She sits, he kneels before her, 
      holding her face in his hands. Talks to her IN KOREAN,  
      deeply caring.  She's just nodding, agreeing with whatever it 
      is he asks.  Those who speak Korean understand:

                                  JIN
                          (in KOREAN)
                    I want you to stay in my sight at all 
                    times.  If I walk away, you follow.  We 
                    need to stay together, do you understand 
                    me?  We cannot be apart.

      -- And as he continues, Hurley CROSSES FRAME -- we FOLLOW HIM 
      NOW.  He carries two dozen THAWED-OUT AIRPLANE MEALS.  He 
      arrives at:

      CLAIRE4646

      The pregnant woman, who sits in a disembodied Business Class 
      chair on the beach.  She rests comfortably.  Relatively 
      speaking, she's doing fine.  Hurley offers her a meal:

                                  HURLEY
                    Hungry?

                    -- Yeah.  Thank you.

                                  HURLEY
                          (re: contractions)

                                  CLAIRE
                    No.  No... I'm all right.

      Hurley's glad.  Hands her some plastic silverware:

                                  HURLEY
                    Hang in there.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah.  You too.

      Hurley nods confidently and walks off.

      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT4747

      SHANNON (the 20 year-old girl who was just screaming her ass 
      off before) sits on the beach beside a small FIRE, painting 
      her toenails, of all things.  She's composed now, but still 
      coming down from the experience.

      After a beat, Boone sits closely beside her on the sand, 
      facing her.  Watches her paint her toenails.  There's 
      something clear here: there's enormous animosity between 
      them. Regardless, he offers her a chocolate bar.

                                    SHANNON
                    As if I'm gonna start eating chocolate.

      He wants to kill her.

                                  BOONE
                    How are your toenails coming.

                                    SHANNON
                    They're fine, thanks.

    A beat.  Boone stares at her.

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon, we might be here a while






                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:4747


                      SHANNONBOONE 
    I can go a day without eating 
      if I have to.We might be here longer than 
                                                  a day.



                                    SHANNON
                    The plane had a black box, idiot.  They 
                    know exactly where we are, they're 
                    coming.
                          (beat, then:)
                    Lemme guess.  You don't think they are.

                                  BOONE 
                    No, I'm pretty sure they're not.

                                  SHANNON
                    Why.

                                  BOONE
                    Because you're so sure they are.

                                  SHANNON
                    You're such an ass.

                                  BOONE
                    While that may be true, I am still -- I 
                    swear to God for reasons I will never 
                      understand -- concerned about your 
                    survival.

      And he offers the candy bar again.  Shannon just looks at 
      him.  All resentment.  And while she's hungry, she says:

                                    SHANNON
                    I'll eat on the rescue boat.

      She goes back to her nails.  Boone knows that's a pipe dream.  
      Resenting her in equal measure, he rips open the bar and 
      starts eating.

      EXT. SHORE - NIGHT4848

      Locke, the man Jack recruited to help save Shrapnel Man, sits 
      on a piece of curved jet wreckage, which almost looks like a 
      modernist sculpture.  Locke just stares out at the crashing 
      water.  Eyes fixed on the nothingness out there.  Hurley 
      approaches.

                                  HURLEY
                    We got chicken or lasagna.

      CONTINUED:4848


    A long beat.  Locke doesn't move.  Finally:

                                  HURLEY (CONT'D)
                    They're not cooked, but they can't be 
                    worse cold than they were heated.

      Locke doesn't look away from the night sea.  A beat.

                                  HURLEY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

      But Locke still doesn't respond.

                                  HURLEY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, you too.

      And Hurley just walks off.

      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT4949

      RIIIIIP: Jack rips open Shrapnel Man's shirt.  The metal 
      piece still embedded in this breathing-but-unconscious man's 
      belly.  It's a dirty, bloody mess. Jack kneels over him, 
      checking the wound. Kate sits close, watching intently. 
      BONFIRES in the background.

                                  KATE
                    -- Why aren't you removing that?

                                  JACK
                    Because it could be holding his stomach 
                    together.  Pulling this out could cause 
                    more damage than leaving it until help 
                    comes.
                          (then)
                    His head wound's bad too.

                                  KATE
                    ...Is he gonna live?

                                  JACK
                    I could tell you a lot more if there was 
                    a CAT scan around.

      Kate can't take her eyes off the Man.  Jack turns to her and 
      sees this.  Realizes there's a connection between them:

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    ...Do you know him?

                                  KATE
                          (beat, staring)
                    ...He was sitting next to me.


                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:4949


      And Jack feels for her.  Wishes he could fix all of this.

      But he can't.

      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT5050

      Now we FAVOR a nine year-old boy -- WALT -- who lies here, on 
      his side, covered in layers of clothing to keep him warm.  
      His eyes are open, staring off.  His father, MICHAEL, 32, 
      lies beside him.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hey.  Walt.  Sure you're warm enough?

                                  WALT
                          (a whisper)
                    ...Yeah.

      Michael wants to make it better for his son -- somehow -- but 
      he can't think of one thing to do or say.  Finally:

                                    MICHAEL
                    Love you.

      And we just hold.  Walt not saying a thing.

      EXT. NIGHT SKY - NIGHT5151

      Imagine the most spectacular view of the stars visible from 
      Earth.

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    We must've been close to 40,000 feet when 
                    it happened.

      Then a crude MODEL OF A PLANE appears -- maybe eight inches 
      long, CUT out of that BANANA LEAF, and held by Jack's HAND.

                                  JACK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    When we hit a pocket of dead air.

      Now we see that we are:

      EXT. BEACH - NIGHT5252

      Bonfires and other survivors in the distance.  Jack and Kate 
      are together here, using a piece of wreckage as a table.  
      Jack holds the model plane, re-enacting the pre-crash 
      moments, trying to make sense of it all.  Kate's hands are 
      clasped at her mouth as she watches, closely, intensely.




                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  JACK
                    We dropped.  Must've been two-hundred 
                    feet.  The turbulence that followed... by 
                    far the worst I've ever been through... 
                    but turbulence doesn't bring down planes.
                          (beat)
                      Electrical power came in and out.  
                    Sounded like the hydraulics went out.  It 
                    was pretty clear what was happening.
                          (beat)
                    How long would you say that lasted?

                                  KATE
                    ...Five minutes?

                                  JACK
                    Yeah, that's what I was thinking...
                          (beat)
                    There was too much stress on the 
                    structure of the plane.
                          (beat)
                    That's when the tail broke away.

      And Jack snaps off the tail -- he now, slowly, turns the 
      fuselage, rolling it -- and you can imagine how terrifying 
      this actually was -- as he does this, Kate watches the model, 
      tears in her eyes.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    -- We were out of control. We actually 
                    went up for a while. Then dropping... 
                      flipping...
                          (then, it occurs to him)
                    What row where you in?

                                  KATE
                    ...27.

                                  JACK
                    23.
                          (then)
                    ...I blacked out.

      And God, this is the worst memory of all time.  Still, Kate 
      fights for her composure as she says:

                                  KATE
                            (unfortunately)
                    I didn't.
                          (beat, with dread)
                    I saw the whole thing.  We were 
                      falling... I knew the tail was gone.  I 
                    couldn't make myself look back.

                          (then)
                    Then the... the front section came apart.

      Jack rips off the nose section -- slowly cartwheeling the 
      leaf model...

                                  JACK
                    -- Did it hit something?

                                  KATE
                    It might have.
                          (beat, wipes away a tear)
                    We crashed maybe five seconds later.

      And Jack lets the model come down -- in a position resembling 
      what we saw at the opening.  The ANGLE IS LOW NOW -- MACRO -- 
      it looks like the opening in model form.  Jack considers 
      this.  Sort of studies the image, trying to figure it out.

                                  JACK
                    The front end of the fuselage isn't on 
                    the beach.  Neither's the tail.  I woke 
                    up about five hundred yards away from the 
                    beach... must've fallen out while the 
                    fuselage was cartwheeling...
                          (realizes his own amazing luck; 
                          then)
                    We need to figure out which way we came in.

                                  KATE
                    Why.

                                  JACK
                    Because there's a chance we could find 
                    the cockpit.  If it's still intact, there 
                    could be a transceiver.  That would let 
                    us send a signal, help a rescue party 
                    find us.

                                  KATE
                          (a little bit of awe)
                    How do you know all that?

                                  JACK
                    I took a couple of flying lessons.
                          (forces a smile)
                    Wasn't for me.

                        KATEJACK
    I saw some smoke.  From the 
      beach -- about a mile inland.-- Where?
          (pointing)
      -- through the valley.  From 
      the jungle, there.

      CONTINUED: (3)5252


      His eyes on the blackness of the night.  As he stares, in his 
      gut knowing it's the cockpit, Kate says:

                                  KATE
                    If you're going for the cockpit, I'm 
                    going with you.
                            (determined)
                    We'll leave as soon as it's light.

      Jack can't help but delight in this resolute young woman.

                                  JACK
                    I don't know your name.

                                  KATE
                    I'm Kate.

                                  JACK
                    Jack.
                          (smiles)
                    So what were you doing in New Zealand?

      Now that the topic of conversation has shifted, Kate stiffens 
      momentarily.   Then --

                                  KATE
                      Everything.  Feels like.
                          (off Jack's curiosity)
                    I was, uh... mixing paint for a while.  
                    At a hardware store.  I worked for a 
                      veterinarian, in Lumsden.

                                  JACK
                    Lumsden.

                                  KATE
                          (enough about me, pal)
                    So what's up with the tattoos, Jack?  You 
                    one of those really hardcore spinal 
                    surgeons or what?

      Now it's JACK's turn to stiffen.  But before he can answer --

          MWOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  Jack and Kate turn -- 
      listening to --

    A SOUND.5353

      FUCKING INDESCRIBABLE -- UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER HEARD 
      BEFORE -- TERRIFYINGLY PRIMITIVE -- PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          25.



      OTHER SURVIVORS5454

      Turn in the distance, looking, scared as Kate enters frame in 
      FOREGROUND -- in EXTREME CLOSEUP --

                                  KATE
                          (at a whisper)
                    ...What was that...?

      And Jack walks up behind her, looking out -- with no answer --

      ANGLE - LOCKE5555

      PUSH IN ON HIM as he turns back toward the jungle -- seated, 
      as he has been for hours, staring out to sea.  Locke doesn't 
      seem scared as much as accepting of whatever challenge this 
      is.  This guy's somehow accepted his mortality in a way that 
      can only, inevitably, be frightening.

      ANGLE - WALT AND MICHAEL5656

      The boy's sitting up -- eagerly reacting to the sound -- 
      somehow HOPEFUL -- Michael seen behind him, concerned -- both 
      looking toward the distant jungle --

                                  WALT
                    -- I think that's Vincent --

                                  MICHAEL
                          (beat, afraid)
                    -- That's not Vincent --

      ANGLE - CLAIRE5757

      Mid-way through her meal, Claire is turned, eyes on the 
      distant jungle valley --

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- Did anyone hear that sound -- ?

      DOLLY to find Hurley, getting to his feet and moving forward.

                                  HURLEY
                    ...I think, uh... unfortunately all of us 
                    did.

      Suddenly -- THE SOUND AGAIN -- and -- WORSE -- Hurley TURNS 
      toward the source of the SOUND --







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          26.



      ANGLE - TREES5858

      Distant 50-foot tall TREES SWAY -- hundreds of yards away -- 
      PAN to Jack and Kate -- who step forward -- moving closer to 
      the scary SOUND --

      ANGLE - SHANNON AND BOONE5959

      Sitting, but already alert --

                                    SHANNON
                    -- Okay... this isn't funny--

      Boone gets up -- moves to get closer to maybe see something -- 
      Shannon is on her feet, pissed --

                                    SHANNON (CONT'D)
                    -- Boone -- wait -- !

      ANGLE - SAYID AND CHARLIE6060

      -- And the Others at the bonfire -- start to move toward the 
      noise --

      ANGLE - THE GROUP6161

      And all of the characters we've met so far gather on the 
      beach -- in a sort of tiered way -- Jack and Kate near the 
      front.  There's a long silence, all of them watching... 
      afraid -- then, suddenly, GASPS as all their heads 
      simultaneously TURN to --

      ANOTHER PART OF THE JUNGLE --6262

      where a SERIES OF DISTANT TREES SWAY as if something SCARY- 
      BIG is moving -- A FEW ACRES IN SECONDS -- this huge THING -- 
      whatever the hell it is -- seems to be disappearing into the 
      jungle --

      -- AN WE HOLD ON OUR TERRIFIED MAIN CHARACTERS6363

      for a long beat... until finally...

                                    CHARLIE
                    Terrific.

                                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

      FADE IN:

6464THOUSANDS OF FEET ABOVE PURE TURQUOISE OCEAN, STRETCHING FOR 
      MILES AND MILES AND MILES -- MOVING OVER AN ENDLESS EXPANSE 
      OF BLUE.

      And we begin to PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

      INT. PLANE - FLYING - DAY6565

      This was Jack's POV -- as he still stares out the window, 
      contemplating something pretty heavy. Then:

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    ...How's the drink?

      Jack turns -- looking up at the pretty, Australian FLIGHT 
      ATTENDANT.

                                  JACK
                          (bad)
                    It's good.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    That wasn't a very strong reaction.

                                  JACK
                    It's not a very strong drink.

      So she slips a couple MINI-BOTTLES of VODKA from her cart to 
      Jack.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                          (quiet, playful)

                            conspiratorial)
                    This of course breaks some critical FAA 
                      regulations --

                    I saw you when you got on.  Giving your 
                    first class ticket to that older lady.

                                  JACK
                    Oh, I wasn't being sweet.  She guilted me 
                    into it.  She's like six-hundred years 
                    old and says she's never flown before.
                          (gimme a break)
                    Come on.

                    You think it's all an act?

                                  JACK
                    I'm pretty sure.

      Smiling, she walks off, toward the rear of the plane -- where 
      she has words with another Passenger a few rows back.  Jack 
      is smiling too, hoping she'll be back again soon.  Pleased, 
      Jack twists open one of the bottles, empties it into his 
      DRINK.  DOWNS the whole thing.

      He puts the other mini-bottle into his jacket pocket.

      Unbuckles his seatbelt, gets out of his seat just as CHARLIE 
      quickly pushes past, heading toward the front of the plane at 
    a swift clip -- a man on a mission --

                                  CHARLIE
                    Sorry...

                                  ROSE
                    Guess he really had to go.

      Jack smiles at ROSE seated across the row from him.  Of 
      course he has no idea that he will, in short order, save this 
      woman's life.

      Suddenly: light TURBULENCE.  Just a little.  No big deal. 
      DING -- "FASTEN SEATBELTS" LIGHTS UP.  Jack becomes visibly 
      tense, does his best not to let it show --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE
                    Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has 
                    turned on the fasten seatbelts sign -- 
                    please return to your seats with your 
                    seatbelts fastened...

      Jack glances at Rose, nervously clutching her armrest.

                                  JACK
                    It's normal.

                                  ROSE
                          (grateful)
                    ...Oh, I know.
                          (then)
                    I've just never been a good flier.  My 
                    husband always reminds me that planes 
                    want to be in the air.

                                  JACK
                    Well he sounds like a smart man.

                    You be sure and tell him that when he 
                    gets back from the bathroom.

      The plane SHAKES again.  Jack smiles at Rose... and we almost 
      get the sense it's easier for him to focus on her fear than 
      deal with his own --

                                  JACK
                    I'll keep you company 'til he does.

      SCREAMS, ENGINE WHINES AND THREE PEOPLE AND EVERY LOOSE

      PLANE SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY AND WE SMASH CUT TO --

      EXT. BEACH - DAWN6767

      CRASHING WAVES and we're TIGHT ON JACK, his eyes focused out 
      across the water as the SUN RISES.  Remembering the horror as 
      the SUN RISES.  It's an unadulterated moment of PURE ISLAND 
      BEAUTY -- and Jack, now in a clean white T-shirt, takes it 
      in.

      We're DOLLYING, Jack in FOREGROUND CLOSEUP, as behind him the 
      Survivors are mostly grouped together now -- nobody slept -- 
      they're all wired, SCARED -- and Walt stands among them, 
      looking up at this strange collection of adults, all talking 
      over each other about that "THING" from the night before --

                                    MICHAEL
                    It wasn't natural, whatever it was...

                    -- that sound it made -- I keep thinking, 
                    there was something familiar about it.

                                    SHANNON
                    Really?  Where are you from?

                    It could've been something like monkeys.

                                  SAWYER
                    Yeah, I'm sure it was monkeys.  It's 
                    Monkey Island.

                      Technically, you know, we don't even know 
                    if we're on an island --

                                  SAYID
                          (if he knows anything)
                    -- We're on an island.

      This is all just buzz to Jack -- the same conversation has 
      been going all night.  He's still in his own head space as 
      Kate arrives, close -- almost conspiratorial:

                                  KATE
                    You ready?

      Jack turns to see Kate. She's tired, scared, but determined.

                                  JACK
                    Kate, you showed me where the smoke was. 
                    I can get there myself--

                                  KATE
                    I'm coming with you.

                        JACKKATE
    I want you to stay here.-- No.

                                  JACK
                    We don't know what the terrain's gonna 
                    be. You're safer if you--

                                  KATE
                    I can't prove to you that I'm up for it. 
                    All I can say is my gym had a rock 
                    climbing wall -- and yeah, I realize how 
                    pathetic that sounds.
                          (then, firm but simple)
                    I'm going with you.

      Jack won't argue.  Truth is, he wants the company.  Then:

                                  JACK
                    You're gonna need better shoes.

      ANGLE - KATE6868

      Near the crash, she's doing the bleak work of pulling boots 
      off a DEAD BODY.  She puts them on.  They fit.  A severe but 
      necessary move.  And she looks up -- far across the beach, 
      LOCKE is watching her.  A somewhat intense gaze.  And Kate 
      thinks for a moment, "Did Locke know the woman whose shoes 
      I'm now wearing?"  But in the middle of that question, Locke 
      SMILES -- AND REVEALS AN ORANGE PEEL COVERING HIS TEETH.


                                                                              CONTINUED)

      Somehow, this moment just gives Kate the chills.  And Locke 
      turns away from her, continuing to PEEL THE ORANGE that he's 
      eating.

      ANGLE - 15 SURVIVORS6969

      Sitting together.  Among them are Boone and Shannon, Sayid, 
      Charlie, Michael and Walt.

                    So I was just looking inside the 
                    fuselage.  It's pretty grim in there.  
                    You think we should be doing anything 
                    about the, uh...

                    ... "B-O-D-Y-S"?

      No one gets his spelling.

                          (re: sunblock)
                    SPF 2?  Do they even make this?

                    Fine.

      She grabs it back as Jack arrives:

                    I'm going to look for the cockpit.  See

                    a distress signal.  Help out the rescue

      And Charlie actually goes first.  Jack and Kate share a look

      EXT. JUNGLE - THE HIKE - MORNING - LATER7070

      Jack cuts a SWATH through the jungle with a large STICK, 
      forging a path of sorts.  A man of few words, he's about ten 
      yards ahead of --

      KATE and CHARLIE.  Walking in silence for a beat.  Then:

                                  KATE
                    You mind if I ask you something?

                    Me?  No, I'd be thrilled -- I've been 
                    waiting.

                                  KATE
                    Have we ever met anywhere?

                    Hm.

      They keep walking.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I look familiar though.

                                  KATE
                    Yeah.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You can't quite place it.

                                  KATE
                    No, I can't.

                                    CHARLIE

                                  KATE
                    ...You do?

      Then Charlie does something surprising.  He starts singing.

      As he walks, Charlie looks back at her, somehow impressed by 
      himself.  Kate has no idea what that meant.  Jack watches 
      Charlie like he's nuts.

              CHARLIE (CONT'D)KATE
          (almost insulted)
      You still don't get it?  You -- Of course I've heard it, I 
      never heard that song?just don't know what the hell 
                                                  that has to --

                    You know Drive Shaft?

      And Jack shakes his head, a grateful "no"...

                                  KATE (CONT'D)
                    They were good.

                                    CHARLIE
                    -- You don't have to keep using the past 
                    tense, you know.  We're still together.

                    In fact, I'm supposed to be in the middle 
                    of a comeback.  So...

      And they continue, into the jungle... and now we're on a WIDE 
      SHOT of the three of them on their trek -- and we begin to 
      BOOM DOWN and realize... it's actually a POV:





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          35.



      REVERSE ANGLE7171

      Through the overgrown bushes -- something's watching them. 
      It's the WHITE LAB from the opening...

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY7272

      TIGHTER as they enter another area of jungle.  And 
      suddenly... THE SKY DARKENS.  Day to GRAY in seconds -- 
      Charlie, looks up at the sky -- WIND picks up.  ELECTRICITY 
      crackles in the air -- the three stop.

                                    CHARLIE
                    This -- is this normal...?

      SUDDENLY IT'S POURING.  SHEETS OF RAIN.  FUCKING TORRENTIAL. 
      Jack, Kate, Charlie -- all SOAKED instantly -- and they pick 
      up their pace, hurrying off as we CUT TO:

      EXT. "BASE CAMP" - CRASH SITE - RAINSTORM - DAY7373

      The rain pouring down -- VARIOUS SHOTS of the Survivors 
      scrambling.

      The Korean couple (SUN and JIN) huddle with half a dozen 
      other survivors under a piece of FUSELAGE DEBRIS -- when 
      another Survivor runs over, Jin YELLS at them in Korean over 
      the DIN of the rain, pointing:

                                  JIN
                          (in KOREAN)
                    There's no more room here!  Over there! 
                    There's room over there!

      And that Survivor is turned away, running past Michael, who 
      covers his son Walt with a too-large raincoat.

      Shannon and Boone head toward the wrecked plane -- stopped by 
      Hurley, who yells to them over the NOISE:

                                  HURLEY
                    I'm telling you, you don't wanna go in 
                    there!  Too many bodies!

      So Shannon and Boone head for shelter of some nearby trees.

      And Locke -- odd Locke -- who sits near the shore, eyes 
      closed, head back.  Letting the rain fall onto his face. 
      Washing clean all that's come before...

      And there's Sayid, being smart: he sets up a TARP he's found 
      in cargo -- using aluminum sticks of wreckage as supports. 
      And as soon as it's up, Sawyer enters --


                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  SAYID
                    I need to put up the other side!

                                  SAWYER
                          (don't tell me what to do)
                    Yeah, I'm all right in here, Osama.

      TIGHT on Sayid as he turns to Sawyer.  Fury in his eyes.

                                  SAYID
                    ...What did you call me?

      EXT. JUNGLE - VALLEY OF TREES - RAINSTORM - DAY7474

      -- AND DISTANT TREES SWAY again -- as if the thing is heading 
      into the deep valley -- MOVING -- and we PAN FAST -- we're 
      UNDER DEBRIS SHELTER -- TIGHT ON CLAIRE'S FACE as she says --

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- Look -- oh God, look, out there --

      -- we then CONTINUE THE PAN to ROSE, the rainy beach and 
      ocean in the background.  And we PUSH IN on Rose, who says:

                                  ROSE
                    ... that's the way the doctor went...

      And the SOUND OF RAIN BUILDS AND WE...

      FADE IN:

      EXT. JUNGLE - RAINSTORM - DAY7575

      As the rain POUNDS, we find Jack, Kate and Charlie, 
      continuing their hike.  They finally stop.  Their eyes 
      falling upon something -- and we PAN TO SEE IT.

      It's the COCKPIT.  Actually, the entire front SECTION OF THE 
      PLANE, smashed badly, UPENDED, resting against a giant tree.  
      The characters take it in for a moment.  A horrible sight.  
      And as they exchange a look, ready for anything...

      EXT. JUNGLE - RAINSTORM - DAY7676

      BOOM DOWN over the massive piece of fuselage as Jack, Kate 
      and Charlie arrive, looking up at the terrifying debris.  Our 
      TRIO moves around the WRECKAGE, twisted metal offering no 
      obvious way in.  Kate SPOTS something:

                                  KATE
                          (shouts over the rain)
                    OVER HERE!

      Jack and Charlie come to Kate, who indicates a JAGGED OPENING 
      AT GROUND LEVEL -- enter-able, but TIGHT.  Kate gets on her 
      stomach and CRAWLS into --

      INT. FRONT SECTION OF THE PLANE - RAINSTORM - DAY7777

      Kate stands up to find herself -- inside the front section of 
      the plane.  Everything eerily CANTED: all of FIRST CLASS and 
      the FRONT LAVATORIES between her and the COCKPIT.  OVERHEAD 
      BINS hanging open, the aisles themselves on an ANGLE -- RAIN 
      leaking in -- half a dozen BODIES still in their chairs.

      Jack emerges from the opening -- Sees Kate is uneasy --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Let's find your transgizmo and get outta 
                    here, yeah?

      Jack starts to move up the aisle -- fighting GRAVITY -- has 
      to grab onto the SEATS so he doesn't fall...

      Kate follows him, THE SOUND OF THE RAIN still pounding on the 
      shattered hull.  Goes without being said --

      This is all pretty fucking SCARY.

      Charlie then crawls through.  Stands.  Looks up, toward the 
      cockpit.  Takes it all in --


                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    God... this is horrible...

      He starts climbing behind them...

7878INT. FRONT SECTION OF THE PLANE - COCKPIT DOOR - RAINSTORM - 
      CONTINUOUS

      Jack reaches the COCKPIT DOOR.  Battered by the crash -- 
      slightly ajar, but still LOCKED.  Jack reaches in -- TUGS on 
      the door.  But it won't open.  Jack grabs a CHARRED FIRE 
        EXTINGUISHER...

                                  JACK
                          (to Kate)
                    -- Get back...

      And Jack SLAMS the extinguisher down on the DOOR KNOB.  
      Dents, but nothing.  SLAMS it down again -- the lock BREAKS a 
      little -- but it'll take some more SLAMS --

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                          (HITTING IT with all his MIGHT)
                    Come on-- come on-- COME ON!

      BANG!  The knob BREAKS off!  And Jack drops the extinguisher  
      -- RIPS OPEN THE DOOR AND THE COPILOT'S BODY FALLS OUT!

      Kate SCREAMS -- Jack SHOUTS -- and the body lands RIGHT NEAR 
      CHARLIE, JUST AS HE'S CLIMBING INTO THE FRONT SECTION AND HE 
      SCREAMS --

                                    CHARLIE
                      AAAHHH--DAMN!  GOD!

      Jack looks to Kate --

                                  JACK
                    You okay?

                                  KATE
                          (no)
                    -- Yeah, you?

                                    CHARLIE
                    I'm all right!  FYI -- I'm good...

      And Jack pulls himself up and into:







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          39.



7979INT. FRONT SECTION OF THE PLANE - COCKPIT - RAINSTORM - 
      CONTINUOUS

      Rain pours through one of the shattered windows -- though 
      TREE BRANCHES and LEAVES obscures any view.  The other 
      windows are intact, but thick with humidity.  Branches and 
      leaves also obscure any view to the outside.  The instrument 
      panel broken -- some pieces HANGING -- WIRES EXPOSED.

      And the PILOT's body is here, slumped in his seat.  Jack 
      turns back to Kate, who is about to climb up -- but she sees 
      the Pilot's body.

                                  JACK
                          (protectively)
                    -- You don't have to come up here--

                                  KATE
                    -- No, I'm good.

      So Jack helps pull up Kate.  As he starts searching 
      compartments:

                                  KATE (CONT'D)
                    -- So what does a transceiver look like?

                                  JACK
                    -- Like a complicated walkie talkie.

      Kate starts looking for it too.  In order to check the 
      Pilot's compartment, she has to pull him back, off the 
      controls.  So does, back into his seat and SUDDENLY THE PILOT 
      JOLTS, AWAKE -- KATE GASPS and Jack, shocked, moves to him -- 
      the Pilot COUGHS, disoriented and hurt.  Jack unbuckles his 
      straps -- checks his vitals --

                  JACK (CONT'D)PILOT
      -- Hey -- can you hear me?(dazed, weak)
        (to Kate)-- What -- wh --
      -- I need the water --

      Kate quickly goes through the backpack as Jack undoes the 
      Pilot's tie, loosens his collar -- Kate hands the water to 
      Jack, who gives it to the Pilot -- he drinks a little, coughs 
      some up.  A dried cut on the man's forehead -- his eye 
      closed.  Although a pro, the Pilot is on the verge of tears.

                                  PILOT 
                    -- How many -- survived?





                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  JACK
                    At least forty-eight.  Including you.
                          (Pilot nods, heartsick)
                    -- Anything feel broken?

      The Pilot slowly, painfully begins to move -- but:

                                  PILOT
                    Head hurts -- dizzy...

                                  JACK
                    Probably a concussion.

                                  PILOT
                    -- How long has it been?

                                  JACK
                    Sixteen hours.

                                  PILOT
                    -- Sixteen...
                          (then, afraid)
                    -- Has anyone come?

                                  JACK
                    Not yet.

      Jack and Kate watch as the Pilot closes his eyes, almost in 
      pain at the thought.  Finally, his voice weak:

                                  PILOT
                    Six hours in.  Our radio went out.  The 
                    redundant system... the transponder -- 
                    wasn't functioning.  No one could see us.
                          (then, with dread)
                    So we turned back.  To land in Fiji.
                          (dear God...)
                    When we hit that turbulence... we were 
                    over a thousand miles off course -- 
                    They'll be looking in the wrong place.

      Kate looks to Jack -- this is even worse news than he 
        anticipated.

                                  PILOT (CONT'D)
                    We have a transceiver--

                                  JACK
                    -- Good, that's what we were hoping --

      And the Pilot tries to stand -- it's hard, he's so bruised --




                                                                              CONTINUED)

                    You shouldn't try to...

                                  PILOT
                          (getting his bearings now)

                          (points to the panel)
                      Transceiver's in there.

      Kate goes for a compartment -- and pulls out a DAMAGED RADIO. 
      She hands it to the Pilot.  He starts to work it -- when Jack 
      realizes:

                                  JACK
                    -- Where's Charlie?

      Good question.  Kate moves back, out of the cockpit.  The 
      Pilot keeps trying to radio -- but:

                                  PILOT
                    -- It's not working...

      INT. FRONT SECTION OF THE PLANE - RAINSTORM - CONTINUOUS8080

      Kate peeks in -- but Charlie's nowhere to be seen.  Played as 
      an eerie moment... but then she sees the door to one of the 
      FRONT LAVS is ajar.  Hears something INSIDE.

      Kate climbs back -- peers into the inverted bathroom, where 
      Charlie's leaning over the toilet bowl --

                                  KATE
                    -- Hey, what're you d--?

      Charlie jumps -- nervous -- turns to her -- we HOLD ON 
      CHARLIE, he doesn't have a fast answer --

                                    CHARLIE
                    -- What?  Nothing --

      But then: MROOOOOWRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOBWWRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  Oh 
      shit: the SOUND again.  Except this time it's CLOSE --

                                  JACK
                    -- Shh!

      -- Whatever it is, it's RIGHT THERE -- stepping now, outside 
      the cockpit -- they're motionless as there's ANOTHER STEP -- 
      the WIRES in the cockpit SHAKE with the apparent "FOOT" 
      IMPACT -- and a DARK SHAPE CROSSES the window --

      Jack SLOWLY climbs up -- on one of the pilot seats -- and he 
      uses his hand -- wipes away some of the humidity on the 
      window in order to look outside -- but there's no way to see 
    a thing out there.

      So the Pilot gets up -- moves toward the broken window 
      covered with LEAVES and BRANCHES --

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    -- I wouldn't do that.

                                  PILOT
                    -- Good to know.

      And the Pilot puts the transceiver down on his seat as he 
      pushes away the LEAVES and BRANCHES and PEEKS HIS HEAD OUT 
      THE SHATTERED WINDOW.

      Jack and Kate watch, terrified for a moment.  Then, quietly:

                                  KATE
                    ...Do you s--

      SUDDENLY THE PILOT'S BODY GETS YANKED UP -- BUT HIS LEGS HIT 
      THE DASH SO WHATEVER'S GOT HIM CAN'T PULL HIM OUT AND KATE 
      SCREAMS AND THE PILOT -- HIS UPPER BODY OUTSIDE THE COCKPIT -- 
      DROPS THE TRANSCEIVER ONTO THE FLOOR AND HE SCREAMS 
        BLOODYFUCKINGMURDER AS JACK MOVES TO HOLD KATE BACK -- 
      CHARLIE SCRAMBLES UP, YELLING:

      SCREAMS ARE HORRIBLE -- KATE SCREAMS AGAIN AS THE PILOT

      Jack, Kate and Charlie all on the ground, scrambling to get 
      out, trying to get the fuck out of the cockpit but --

      Jack looks back -- sees the TRANSCEIVER has fallen off the 
      pilot's seat.  He reaches for it -- BAM!  The cockpit jars 
      again -- transceiver skitters out of Jack's grasp --

                        KATECHARLIE

      But he doesn't give up -- lunges after it -- SLAM!  Jack 
      loses his footing, lands on his stomach -- transceiver's just 
      sitting there, arm's length away and --

      Jack finally gets it into his grasp -- staggering to his feet 
      as it SHIFTS again and --

      BAM!!!  ONCE -- THE THREE FALL DOWN -- TWICE -- AND THEN 
      AGAIN -- AND THE WHOLE COCKPIT DROPS --

      -- The giant piece of jet CRASHES to the ground -- we're

      now it makes a HORRIBLY LOUD CRY --

      THROUGH THE RAIN -- WE WHIP PAN TO A SPRINTING KATE --

      And we INTERCUT NOW between KATE, JACK AND CHARLIE -- ALL 
      RUNNING LIKE NUTS --

          MROOOOOWRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOBWWRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

      Christ, it's close -- THE SOUND is all around us now, no idea 
      if we're running toward it or away from it, just PURE FUCKING 
      FEAR AND CONFUSION and...

      CHARLIE8686

      Runs through THICK TANGLED ROOTS and WIPES OUT -- coming down 
      HARD -- WIND knocked out of him -- he tries to get up but 
      CAN'T -- suddenly JACK is there to help him up --

                                  JACK
                    C'MON!

      But Charlie's foot is caught and the fucking THING is COMING  
      -- LOUDER AND LOUDER and that's when we CUT TO:

      KATE8787

      Still running, up ahead -- CRYING as she runs through the 
      rain -- almost losing her footing, but not -- distant SCREAMS 
      OVERWHELMED by a THUNDERCLAP and Kate SCREAMS as she runs:

                                  KATE 
                    JACK!!!

      But when the THUNDER stops, the screaming is gone -- and Kate 
      runs and runs and finally SLIPS -- FALLS HARD -- scrambles to 
      her feet and takes SHELTER inside:

      EXT. TREE TRUNK - RAINSTORM - CONTINUOUS8888

      -- Kate's hiding now, in the ALIEN BRANCHES AND VINES of a 90-
      FOOT-TALL TREE.  She waits there... and waits... TERRIFIED... 
      and we just HOLD ON HER... AND HOLD... until she SCREAMS OUT -

                                  KATE
                      JAAAAAACK!!!

      -- But there's nothing -- no one -- and she waits... her eyes 
      GLUED TO THE DIRECTION THEY JUST CAME FROM... she breathes 
      heavily, waiting... and WE HOLD ON HER FOR ALMOST A MINUTE.  
      And as soon as we get so close we couldn't possibly get any 
      closer -- she whispers to herself, terrified:

      FADE IN:

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY8989

      Kate is exactly where we left her, tucked amongst the roots 
      of the alien tree. Rain pouring down around her.  Dark in 
      here.  She's scared to death. We're with her.  CLOSE.

      And she hears a SOUND over the rain -- something moving 
      towards her -- and she turns around -- looking behind her 
      now, petrified.

      Nothing there.  Her eyes wide, blinking in the rain.  Nothing 
      but jungle.

      She then turns back -- AND CHARLIE IS STANDING RIGHT THERE -- 
      and it scares her so much she SCREAMS AND GRABS HIM -- 
      PUSHING -- AND THEY FALL OVER onto his back, her lying on top 
      of him in the mud --

                        KATECHARLIE
      WHERE THE HELL'S JACK?!-- I don't know!
      -- Did you see him?!-- Yes! He helped me up--!
      -- So where is he?!-- I don't know where he--!
      -- HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?!-- WE GOT SEPARATED!!!

      -- and Kate stops long enough for Charlie to say:

                                    CHARLIE 
                    -- he pulled me up.  If he hadn't, that 
                    th--

                                  KATE
                    -- Did you see it?

                                    CHARLIE
                    No.  No.  But it was right behind us.  We 
                    were dead -- I was.  Until Jack came back 
                    for me.

      And just then, something remarkable happens.  The rain stops.  
      As abruptly as it started, it's gone.  They both look back 
      the way they came -- Kate looking up, Charlie, still on his 
      back, craning his head.

                                  KATE
                    We have to go back for him.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Go back?  There?  Love -- listen -- 
                    there's a certain... gargantuan quality 
                    to whatever the hell that thing is --


                                                                              CONTINUED)

      She's already getting up:

                                  KATE
                    -- Then don't come.

      And she goes off, after Jack.  Pissed and nervous, Charlie 
      finally goes after her.

      EXT. JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER9090

      DOLLY OUT OF THE THICK FOLIAGE to find Kate and Charlie, 
      walking slowly through the dripping-wet jungle, back the way 
      they came.  They're edgy... and we're moving with them.  The 
      DRIPPING SOUNDS somehow unnerving.

      Then Kate sees something up ahead.  Something GLISTENING in 
      the mud -- and she moves for it, Charlie behind her.

      And she gets to it -- kneels -- it's a scattered collection 
      of COINS.  And among them, something she picks up.

    A PILOT'S WINGS PIN.

      And Kate stares at the pin, horrified... because she senses 
      what's coming next. She SLOWLY LOOKS UP.  And sees something 
      horrific. Charlie looks up too. His mouth opens in shock.

                                  CHARLIE
                    ...What the hell's that...?

      Then, a welcome voice:

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    It's the pilot.

      And they turn around -- grateful to see Jack approaching from 
      the jungle -- Kate moves to him, scared --

                                  KATE
                    -- Did you see it?

                                  JACK
                    No.  It was right behind me, I dove into 
                    the bushes.

      Charlie's eyes have gone back to the tree.

                                  CHARLIE
                    ...Excuse me, people... but... how the 
                    hell does something like that happen...?




                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:


      And they all look up again... and we FOLLOW THEIR GAZE to 
      reveal that, stuck up in a branch, at least thirty-five feet 
      above ground -- IS THE BLOODY, TORN BODY OF THE PILOT.  Dead 
      now, for sure.

      EXT. BEACH - DAY9191

      SHANNON, wearing a BIKINI now, lying near the surf.  Of all 
      things, she's SUNBATHING.  And the glorious sun is doing its 
      job -- and it's a damn Coppertone commercial -- except as the 
      camera SLOWLY DOLLIES, the huge PLANE WRECK is revealed in 
      the distance.

      And we can see, in the background, the Survivors are going 
      through luggage, doing work to get a fire burning again, 
      laying clothing out to dry.

      And after a beat, Boone walks over, looking down at his 
      vacationing sister.

                                  BOONE
                    Hey, we're going through the clothes. 
                    Sorting them.
                          (beat, judgemental)
                    I see you found your bag.
                          (beat)
                    You wanna give us a hand?

                                    SHANNON
                          (doesn't even look)
                    Not really.

      Boone just stares at her, absolutely despising her.  But all 
      he does is turn and walk off. HOLD ON SHANNON for a 
        beat...until we HEAR:

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    Is that your boyfriend?

      And Shannon looks over: Claire sits twenty some feet away.  
      Shannon's far nicer to Claire than Boone.

                                    SHANNON
                          (with vitriol)
                    My brother.  Boone.  God's friggin' gift 
                    to humanity.

    A beat.  Then Shannon turns to Claire -- actually very sweet.

                                    SHANNON (CONT'D)
                    Do you know what it is?

    A beat for Claire


                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  CLAIRE
                    Not yet.
                          (beat, quietly, half to herself)
                    ...I haven't felt the baby kick since 
                      yesterday.

      And Shannon turns to her -- off her look we CUT TO:

      INSERT - SEA URCHIN9292

      As it's picked out of a tidal pool.

      EXT. BEACH - SURF LINE - DAY9393

      At the surf line, Jin, our Korean HUSBAND, his pants rolled 
      up, intensely picks SEA URCHINS from the water, placing them 
      in a PLASTIC BAG he's taken from the plane.  It's an oddly 
      serene image.

      And then we have a REVERSE VIEW -- from the ocean inland -- 
      and Sun, Jin's wife, sits on the sand. Sitting, straight 
      backed, rather stoic.  Watching her husband.  The TOP BUTTON 
      of her blouse undone.

      Then we're TIGHT on Sun's face as she watches him, his back 
      to her... and though there's no dialogue here, there doesn't 
      need to be.  Because her gaze is distinctly unsettled.

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.

      And Sun looks up.  Michael stands there.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Have you seen my boy?

      Sun just looks at Michael for a long beat.  Finally, she 
      speaks, in her native language:

                                  SUN
                          (in KOREAN)
                    My apologies... but I do not speak 
                    English.

      And Michael stands there for a moment, confused.  And Michael 
      looks up and sees that, mid-reach into the sea, Jin has 
      stopped working, looking back at her wife and this strange 
      man.  Which should tell us immediately how controlling Jin 
      really is.  Then, Jin calls out:





                                                                              CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                          49.

      CONTINUED:9393


                                  JIN
                          (in KOREAN)
                    Your top button is undone!  Button it, 
                    please, right now!

      And Michael watches, somewhat fascinated and disturbed as Sun 
      buttons it up.  Michael then says, quietly:

                                  MICHAEL
                    ...I'm, uh... I'm sorry...

      And Michael walks off.

      EXT. BEACH ADJACENT JUNGLE - DAY9494

      We're maybe two feet off the ground, DOLLYING through the 
      jungle.  And we HEAR:

                                  WALT (O.S.)
                    Vincent!
                          (beat)
                    Vincent!

      And Walt enters the FOREGROUND -- so close that all we see is 
      his waist to his knees -- and that he's holding a DOG LEASH. 
      He stops.

                                  WALT (CONT'D)
                    Vincent!

      And we BOOM UP as Walt turns, looking off-camera, his eyes 
      scanning the jungle.  Then he sees something... and he walks 
      toward it -- and we FOLLOW HIM, over his shoulder, BOOMING UP 
      as he arrive at the shiny piece of metal lying on the leafy 
      floor.  He picks it up.

      IT'S A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS.

      And Walt holds them.  TIGHT ON HIM as he looks at them, 
      deeply curious.  Just then he HEARS:

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Hey!

      And Walt turns as Michael approaches, kneeling, taking the 
      kid firmly by the shoulders:








                                                                              CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                          50.

      CONTINUED:


              MICHAEL (CONT'D)WALT
      -- What did I tell you? -- I thought maybe Vincent 
      -- After everything that's would be around --
      happened -- 
    I told you to stay on the -- I didn't go far, this is 
      beach. so close to the beach, I 
      -- No, don't do this -- you thought this would be okay --
      listen to me, I mean what I 
      say.  You understand that?
        (then, seeing them)
      ...What s this?

                                  WALT 
                    ...I just found' em.

      PUSH IN on Michael, disturbed, as he considers the existence 
      of these cuffs...

      EXT. JUNGLE - AFTERNOON9595

      Jack, Kate and Charlie walking back.  A pregnant SILENCE.  
      All of them still in the wake of the insanity of what just 
      happened.  Jack up front, fiddling with the transceiver.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Anything?

                                  JACK
                          (not happy)
                    ...You keep asking me if there's 
                    anything.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Pardon me for appearing desperate, but in 
                    case you didn't hear the pilot before he 
                    was eaten, they're never going to find us 
                    unless we get that thing to work.
                          (deep breath, then)
                    So is there anything?

                                  JACK
                    No.

                                  KATE
                    What were you doing.  In the bathroom.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Oh, I thought you could tell.  I was 
                    getting sick.  Puking.  My one... 
                    tangible contribution to this trek.

                                  KATE
                    No, I'm glad you came.


                                                                              CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                          51.

      CONTINUED:9595


                                  CHARLIE
                    Yeah, every trek needs a coward.

                                  KATE
                    You're not a coward.

      And as they walk we're TIGHT ON CHARLIE, who considers this 
      as they walk... and we HOLD TIGHT ON HIS FACE AS SOUNDS FADE 
      IN -- SOUNDS OF AN AIRPLANE IN FLIGHT -- THEN:

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (V.O.)
                    Are you all right, sir?

      AND SUDDENLY WE CUT TO:

      INT. PLANE - MIDAIR - DAY9696

      Back on the PLANE, PRE-CRASH.  CHARLIE sits in his seat near 
      the rear of the plane, shaking.  Pale.  SWEAT dots his brow.  
      He looks up at the same FLIGHT ATTENDANT that helped Jack:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah -- I'm good, thanks.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    Can I get you some wat--?

                                    CHARLIE
                          (go away)
                    I'm fine.  Thank you.  Please.

      The Flight Attendant stares.  Then:

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1
                    All right.

      As she heads to the back of the plane, she looks at him, 
      maybe a little SUSPICIOUSLY.

      Charlie taps his hand, FIDGETY. Takes a quick peek over his 
      shoulder at --

      THE REAR GALLEY

      The Flight Attendant who he just blew off talks to TWO MALE 
      FLIGHT ATTENDANTS in hushed tones and --

      All three look up at Charlie.

      He immediately faces front -- nervous.  TIGHT on him.  He 
      turns back -- takes another peek --




                                                                              CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                          52.

      CONTINUED:9696


      ALL THREE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS are heading back up the aisle 
      towards him --

      Charlie quickly undoes his seatbelt, gets up in one swift 
      motion --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (CONT D)
                    Sir?  Excuse me --

      But Charlie's already moving fast down the aisle -- and he 
      brushes by JACK, getting up from his own seat --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Sorry...

      And as Charlie moves on, we can just hear behind him --

                                  ROSE (O.S.)
                    Guess he really had to go.

      Charlie arrives at the lavatories -- but they're both 
      occupied.

                                  CHARLIE
                    -- Bugger --

      -- And so he KEEPS MOVING, through BUSINESS CLASS -- crossing 
      to the other side of the plane -- he keeps going, into FIRST 
      CLASS -- he turns back to see the THREE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS 
      heading for him -- and the PLANE SHAKES.  Just a little.  No 
      big deal.  DING -- "FASTEN SEATBELTS" LIGHTS UP as Charlie 
      reaches the FRONT LAVATORY, enters --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE
                    Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has 
                    turned on the fasten seatbelts sign -- 
                    please return to your seats with your 
                    seatbelts fastened...

      INT. PLANE - LAVATORY - CONTINUOUS9797

      Charlie is FLIPPING OUT.  CAMERA is in here with him, TIGHT.  
      CLAUSTROPHOBIC as he PULLS OFF HIS SHOE -- reaches into his 
      SOCK as suddenly there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (O.S.)
                    Sir?  Are you all right?

      Charlie ignores her, still digging in his sock... finally 
      pulls out a ROLLED UP BAGGIE containing a BROWN POWDER.

      KNOCKING MORE INSISTENT NOW...



                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #1 (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to open 
                    the door...

      Charlie holds the baggie up... looks at it longingly.  This 
      physically PAINS him.  But he turns around and drops it into 
      the TOILET.  The baggie rests on the METAL DROP-PLATE as...

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #2 - MALE 
                                  (O.S.)
                          (firm)
                    Open the door now, sir.

      Charlie takes one last look at his stash, TIGHT SHOT as he 
      reaches for the FLUSH LEVER and...

      THE PLANE SUDDENLY DROPS TWO HUNDRED FEET -- CHARLIE IS 
      THROWN TO THE CEILING --

      FALLS out of the bathroom -- and in the TERRIFYING JOLTS of 
      the last minutes of the flight, he falls back to --

      FIRST CLASS100100

      -- FALLS to the floor and CRAWLS back through the MASSIVE 
      PANDEMONIUM -- gets into a free chair -- BUCKLES UP and we're

      FADE IN:

      EXT.  BASE CAMP  - CRASH SITE - DAY101101

      CHAOS.  We drop right into the middle of a BRAWL.

      CLOSE ON THE FIGHT as Sawyer and Sayid WRESTLE.  It s 
        PANDEMONIUM.  A GROUP of twenty or so stands around, watching 
      the brutal fight --

                                  VOICES
                    ...GONNA KILL YOU... LET HIM GO!... SICK 
                    OF... DON T!

      ACROSS THE CAMP Jack, Kate and Charlie emerge from the 
      jungle, see all this --

                                  KATE
                    What -- ?

      But Jack is already pulling his pack off, immediately enters 
      the fray, pulling the men apart --

                                  JACK
                    -- All right, ENOUGH!

                    HEY!  What the hell --?

      Michael is here, holds up the pair of CUFFS --

                                  MICHAEL
                    My kid found these out in the jungle.

      On Jack.  Kate.  Charlie.  All digesting this as...

                          (finger in Sayid s face)
                    And this guy was in the back row of 
                    business class the whole flight.  Never 
                    got up.  Hands folded under his blanket.

                    You re the prisoner, muchacho.

                        SAYIDSAWYER
      Thank you so much for 
      observing my behavior so very 
      carefully --You think I didn t see them 
                                                  pull you out of line before 
      -- If you do not take your we boarded?
      finger out of my face ---- Oh, please -- bring it--

      And they re about to go at it all over again when --

                                  KATE
                    STOP!

      And they do.  All eyes on Kate.  Strong.  Defiant.  Angry.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    We actually DO have bigger problems than 
                    this.
                          (beat, pulls the TRANSCEIVER 
                          from Jack s pack)
                    We found the transceiver.  But it s not 
                    working.  Can anybody help...?

    A beat.  Then, of all people, Sayid steps forward.  Turns 
      back, looks directly at fuckin  Sawyer.

                                  SAYID
                    Yes, I might be able to.

                                  SAWYER
                    Oh yeah, good!  This guy!  Perfect!  
                    Let s trust him -- !

                    Let s try to treat each other with --

                                  SAWYER
                    Shut up, lardo.

                                  JACK
                    HEY -- Give it a break.

                          (fuck you)
                    Whatever you say, Doc, you re the hero.

      And Sawyer walks off, passing Jack, BUMPING him as he goes.  
      Jack watches him, not liking him one bit --

                    You found the cockpit?  Were there any 
                      survivors?

      Kate and Charlie exchange a look.  Turn their eyes to Jack, 
    who meets their gaze.  A beat.  Then:

                                  JACK
                    No.

                                  SAYID
                          (re: transceiver)
                    It s dual-band.  Military spec.  
                      Broadcasts full-range, far as I can tell.  
                    Chances are the battery is good, but the 
                    radio... it is dead.

                                  KATE
                    -- Can you get it to work?

                                  SAYID
                          (stares at it, feels pressure)
                    I need some time.

      Kate nods -- Sayid walks off -- just as Rose moves to Jack, 
      saying quietly:

                                  ROSE
                    That man with the metal in his side -- 
                    he looks bad.

      Takes a beat for Jack to hear this -- but he finally does.  
      Jack looks at Kate for a moment -- then heads off.  HOLD ON 
      Kate, who stands there, alone.

      INSERT - TRANSCEIVER -- CLOSEUP102102

      The broken transceiver, being OPENED.  We are:

      EXT. BEACH - AT FUSELAGE - DAY103103

      Sayid s right at the edge of the fuselage, sitting on 
      wreckage, using TWEEZERS and a found SWISS ARMY KNIFE to take 
      apart and examine the transceiver.  Checking the internal 
        connections.

      After a beat, Hurley arrives, sitting across from him.  
      Saying one word, the sub-text being,  What a fucking prick :

        CONTINUED:103103


      Sayid glances up, nods: no kidding, then goes back to the 
      radio.  Understatement of the day:

                                  SAYID
                    Some people have problems.

                                  HURLEY

                    Us him.

      Hurley smiles back.  Then:

                                  HURLEY
                    You re okay.  I like you.

                                  SAYID

                    Sayid.

      As Sayid works:

                                  HURLEY
                    How d you know how to do all that?

                                  SAYID
                    I was a Military Communications Officer.

                                  HURLEY

                    I fought in the Gulf War.

                                  HURLEY
                    No way.  I have a buddy, fought over 
                    there.  He was in the 104th Airborne.

      just bonded with the enemy...

      EXT. LAGOON - DAY104104

      LONG LENS, CLOSE ON KATE, standing alone in a lagoon, out of 
      sight of the others.  Her duffel bag on the shore, she wears 
      only her underwear and tank-top in the water, cleaning 
      herself off, using a shirt as washcloth.

      As she does this, she CRIES.  Letting out all of the emotion 
      that s been building.  We HOLD on her.  This moment a 
      catharsis for us as well.

      And we HOLD on her long enough to see her pull it together.  
      Finding her strength again.  Staring off, knowing that 
      somehow she has to keep moving forward.

                                  SUN (O.S.)
                          (in KOREAN)
                    -- Excuse me --

      -- And Kate turns to see Sun standing there -- and Sun is 
      slightly embarrassed as she points back, toward the wreckage:

                                  SUN (CONT D)
                          (in KOREAN)
                    -- I believe they are finished.  They 
                    need you.

      And Sun moves away.

      EXT. BEACH - DAY105105

      Kate returns, dressed now -- as Sayid finishes wrapping the 
      radio in black electrical tape.

                                  KATE
                    -- Is it working?

                                  SAYID
                    Seems to be -- except we re not picking 
                    up a signal.

                                  KATE
                    -- Why would we need to pick up a signal, 
                    aren t we sending one -- ?

                                  SAYID
                    -- Yes, but it s a  transceiver  -- it 
                    transmits and receives.  Which means you 
                    can also read the level of other signals 
                    that you are picking up.
                          (shows her)
                    What you want is to see little bars.  
                    Right here.

      And Sayid shows her where RECEPTION BARS would normally be.  
      Currently, there are none.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    The little bars would show that the radio 
                    is getting reception.  Meaning we d be in 
                    range of another radio.  There are no 
                    bars here.

                                  KATE
                    ...So the radio s worthless.

                                  SAYID
                    -- We could broadcast blind.  Hope that 
                      someone... maybe a ship, somewhere, picks 
                    up our distress call.  But that would be 
                    a waste of the battery.  Which might not 
                    last for long.

                                  KATE
                    We need the bars.

                                  SAYID
                    We need the bars.
                          (then, with a thought)
                    It is unlikely, but perhaps worth a try.

                                  KATE
                    -- What.

                                  SAYID
                    Sending a signal from high ground.

                                  KATE
                          (uh-oh)
                    ...How high?

      And Sayid s eyes flick over Kate s shoulder as...

      CLOSE ON KATE --106106

      Following Sayid s gaze.  And CAMERA SLOWLY FOLLOWS KATE HEAD

      EXT. BEACH - DAY107107

      Jack examines SHRAPNEL MAN.  His condition has worsened 
        considerably -- skin taking on a yellow hue.  Shallow 
      breaths.  As Jack delicately looks at the wound --

                                  KATE
                    How is he?

      Jack glances over his shoulder, sees Kate.  Eyes go back to 
      Shrapnel Man.  Shakes his head: not good.  And she asks, 
      caring, nervous for the Man:

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    ...Can you do anything?

                                  JACK
                    I can pull out the shrapnel.

                                  KATE
                    ...But yesterday you said --

                                  JACK
                    -- I know.  But that was yesterday.
                          (then)
                    I was hoping he d be at a hospital by 
                    now.
                          (beat)
                    We leave him like this... he ll be dead 
                    within a day.  If I open him up... and if 
                    I can control the bleeding... and if he 
                    doesn t go into sepsis -- and if I can 
                    find some antibiotics... he might be all 
                    right.  But there s no way of knowing 
                    until I see what kind of damage there is 
                    in there.
                          (sees she s freaked; a morose 
                            joke)
                    Hey -- at least he s unconscious.

      Kate absorbs this.  A lot going on behind her eyes.  We can 
      almost see her make a decision.  Then --

                                  KATE

                    We fixed the transceiver, but we can t 
                    use it, not from here.  If I --

      You re the one who said we 
      had to get out a signal ---- Yeah, and we do, but I

      he needs ---- I want you to wait for me -
      -- No ---
      -- There s not time -- we -- Kate --
      obviously need to send out a 
      signal sooner than later --
                                                  -- Hold on a second -- you 
      -- Yes I did, what makes you saw what that thing did to 
      think you re any safer on the the pilot --
      beach than you are in the 
      jungle?

      Well.  That s logic that even Jack can t argue with.  He 
      looks at Shrapnel man, knowing he has to stay --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Wait for me.  I don t know how long

      Jack looks at her.  Knows he can t stop her.

                                  JACK
                    If you hear anything.  Anything.

                                  JACK
                    Good luck.

      Kate throws another look at Shrapnel Man -- intense.  
      Connected.  Somehow doesn t want to leave him.  Then:

                                  KATE
                    You too.

      INSERT - SEA URCHIN - EXTREME CLOSEUP108108

      The sea urchin gets CUT with a found POCKET KNIFE.  REVEAL 
      that we are:

      EXT. BEACH - DAY109109

      At the shore.  Sun kneels on the sand, cutting the sea 
      urchins for food prep on a large ROCK.  Jin stands beside 
      her, holding an airplane FOOD TRAY, collecting the cut 
      pieces.

      Once she's done, Jin takes the newly-cut pieces and adds them 
      to the tray.

      Sun reaches to take one of the pieces off the rock -- clearly 
      just trying to help -- but Jin actually slaps her hand, 
      putting the piece onto the tray himself.  She reacts -- 
      obedient and accepting as Jin walks off with the tray.  TIGHT 
      ON SUN as she watches him go.

      And in a private moment of defiance -- her eyes holding on 
      her husband as he walks off -- SHE UNDOES THE TOP BUTTON OF 
      HER BLOUSE.

    A WIDE SHOT of the image -- the complicated couple with their 
        culturally-formed dynamic framed majestically by the 
      incredible tropical terrain.

      EXT. OCEAN - DAY110110

      Hurley stands in the water, cleaning one of his shirts.  
      After a long beat, Jin approaches with the tray.  When Jin 
      speaks, it's terse.  Seemingly cold.  And, of course, not in 
      English:

                                  JIN
                          (in KOREAN)
                    I have food.  Here.  Try this.

      Hurley turns, sees Jin.

                                  HURLEY
                    S'up.

                    Try this.  Sea urchin, it's good, it'll 
                    keep you alive.

      Hurley takes a beat to understand what he's suggesting.

                    It's food, there's enough for everybody.

                                  HURLEY
                    Dude, guess what, I'm starving.  But I am 
                    not nearly that hungry.  No.

                    Thank you.  No way.  No.

      And Hurley turns back.  Jin, finally realizing he's being 
      rejected, walks off.

      Walt lies here, reading.  Angry.  Vincent's LEASH nearby.  He 
      turns the page.  After a beat, Michael comes.  Lies beside 
      him.  Eyes the comic.  A beat.

      Michael just nods.  Nothing's working.  Takes a moment.

      And Walt looks back at his father.  These words have the 
      opposite of their intended effect -- they tell the kid that 
      his dog is dead.  And furious -- on the verge of tears -- 
      Walt gets up and heads off.  Michael watches him go, his eyes 
      closing.  Somehow he's fucked it up again.

      Sayid puts the TRANSCEIVER in a plastic bag, then wraps it in 
    a beach towel.  Nearby, Kate fills an empty water bottle with 
      RAIN WATER collected on the TARP. She seems determined here.  
      Driven.

                    The others.  They've heard about the 
                    thing you saw.  The pilot.
                          (off Kate's surprise)
                    I understand why you and the doctor 
                    decided not to frighten us, but your 
                    English friend is telling anyone who will 
                    listen.
                          (beat; grim)
                    They think we are insane for going back 
                    in there.

      Kate hesitates.  Then --

                    If he told you about the pilot, he told 
                    you what the pilot said.  The rescue 
                    people -- they're looking in the wrong 
                    place.  They're not gonna find us.

      Sayid nods.  But his eyes stay on her.  Curious --

                    I don't like it here.  But you... you 
                    don't like it here even more than I do.

                    It is either impressive.  Brave.  Or 
                    something else... I can't really 
                      understand.

      Sayid's looking at her now -- with those deep eyes -- almost 
      as if looking into her soul... and God, it unnerves her.

      We're TIGHT ON HIM as we watch its effects: Charlie calms --

      eyes open, facing us.  SLOWLY DOLLY and RACK FOCUS TO REVEAL 
      SHANNON, sitting a few feet away in the sand.  She stares at 
      the corpse, hugging her knees, quiet and nervous.

      The first dead body she's ever seen.  And she just stares at 
      the thing, until Boone slowly walks up behind her.  A beat.

                                  BOONE
                    ...What the hell are you doing.

      She just stares.  Then, quietly:

                    ...I think I was mean to him.

                    Remember him?

      And Boone's staring.  Christ, he does remember.  Her eyes go 
      back to the body.  Realizing, she says, sotto:

                                    SHANNON (CONT'D)
                    He saved our lives.

      This morbid moment makes Boone very uncomfortable:

                                  BOONE
                    Shannon, come on, we're trying to clear 
                    the wreckage why don't you help out.

      But she doesn't turn away.

                    Come on, you're being worthless over 
                    here.

      That makes her turn to him, hurt, pissed off:

      You know what?  It's so easy 
      to make fun of me -- and -- I'd rather not waste my 
      you're good at it, I get it -- time making fun of you!  I 
      well screw you -- you don't wish I didn't have any reason 
      know the first thing about to!  Yeah, it is easy!  I 
      what I'm thinking -- have a better idea than you 
      -- No you don't!think I do --
                                                  -- No?  Okay, Shannon, what 
                                                  are you thinking?

      ANGLE --117117

      As Shannon's eyes flick over Boone's shoulder -- and we RACK 
      FOCUS past Boone to the distance, where Kate and Sayid pack 
      up to go.

                                    SHANNON
                    I'm going with them.  On the hike.

    A beat.  Then -- Boone just laughs.

                                    SHANNON (CONT'D)
                    I'm going.

                    Yup.

      She grabs her WINDBREAKER, walks past an incredulous Boone.

                                  BOONE
                    -- No you're not.

      She's not going.(sharp, to Boone)
        (to Kate et al)-- The hell I'm not --
      -- She doesn't want to go -- 
      she does this ---- You don't know what the

                    I'm not sure that's a good idea --

                                    SHANNON
                    What're you -- like, two years older than 
                    me?  Please.
                          (turns to Charlie, who arrives)
                    You're going, right?

                                    CHARLIE
                    -- Where, on the hike?  Are you?

                                    SHANNON
                    Yup.

                                    CHARLIE
                    -- Yes, I'm going.  Definitely.

                    Look, everybody can come.
                          (heaves her PACK onto her back)
                    But we're leaving now.

      And Kate walks off.  Shannon looks to Charlie, slightly taken 
      aback by Kate.  Says quietly:

                                    CHARLIE
                    You couldn't tell from that, but she's 
                    quite nice, really.

      Shannon heads off.  Boone, annoyed, follows.  Then Charlie 
      and Sayid.

    A LONG SHOT of them walking off -- then PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
      we're with:



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          70.



      EXT. FUSELAGE - DAY119119

      Sawyer watches them go as he sits on part of the shattered 
      wing, near the remains of one of the enormous engines.  He's 
      taking final drags on a cig.  In general, a "fuck 'em all" 
      attitude.

      After a beat, something weighing on his mind, he pulls his 
      wallet from a back pocket.  Opens it.  Pulls out a folded 
      piece of paper.  Unfolds it.

      TIGHT on Sawyer's face as he re-reads the page.

      And slowly... his face changes.  His eyes awash in concern... 
      and, more surprisingly, vulnerability.  He just stares at the 
      mysterious letter... his eyes actually WELLING UP with what 
      he reads.

      Finally, quickly, he re-folds it -- puts it back in his 
      wallet, more anxious and troubled than we've seen him.

      He finishes the cigarette and puts it out on the damn 
      airplane that brought him here.

      He gets up and moves off, quickly, after the others.

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY120120

      On Kate, with Sayid at the head of the group.  Charlie, 
      Shannon and Boone behind her in that order.  They're just 
      entering the jungle -- the growth gets thick quickly.

      And now we CUT BACK TO SAWYER, who moves quickly, determined, 
      through the jungle -- passing Boone, Charlie, Shannon -- then 
      Sayid and KATE, who he looks at, walking with her for a 
      moment.  Their eyes lock.  She's surprised -- and not 
      pleased.

                                  KATE
                    Decided to join us?

                                  SAWYER
                    Yeah, looks like it.

                                  KATE
                    What changed your mind?

                                  SAWYER
                          (mind your own business)
                    I'm a complex guy, Sweetheart.

        CONTINUED:120120


      And Sawyer keeps walking, taking the lead.  Kate wanting to 
      tell him off -- but not.  And we...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. MOUNTAIN BASE - DAY121121

      WIDE SHOT.  Spectacular view.  Our SIX HIKERS (Kate, Sayid, 
      Charlie, Shannon and Boone, with Sawyer at the front, hacking 
      away plants with a found stick) trudge through the jungle, up 
      the base of the MOUNTAIN.  The hike isn't any fun.  Plus, 
      it's HOT.  Also, they're scared.  Kate especially -- looking 
      around with concern as they walk.  Afraid that, at any 
      moment, that Thing might show up to end their lives.

      Now WE FAVOR Shannon and Charlie, who walks beside her:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Y'ever heard of Drive Shaft?

                                    SHANNON
                    ...What, the band?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah.

                                    SHANNON
                          (not a fan)
                    Yuchhh.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Right.

                                  SHANNON
                    Why?

                                  CHARLIE
                    Nothing.  Horrible.

                                  SHANNON
                    Do you have one of their songs stuck in 
                    your head--

                                  CHARLIE
                    -- Uh, yeah, sort of--

                                  SHANNON
                    -- God, I'm sorry.

                                  CHARLIE
                          (laughs it off, dying)
                    Yeah.  Me too.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          72.



      EXT. BEACH - DAY122122

      Back near the fuselage, Jack approaches Hurley --

                                  JACK
                    I need some help.

                                  HURLEY
                    -- Okay --

                                  JACK
                    I need you to help me go through the 
                    luggage -- I need any prescription 
                      medication you can find -- especially any 
                    drugs that end with "mycin" or "cillin"-- 
                    those are antibiotics--

                                  HURLEY
                    -- What's this for?

                                  JACK
                    Please just do it -- you'll see.

        INSERT123123

      TIGHT ON A SHAVING KIT.  Jack's hands UNZIP it.  Pulls out a 
      DISPOSABLE RAZOR.

      EXT. BEACH - DAY124124

      Jack, disappointed, puts the shaving kit back in the bag -- 
      he TURNS, opens another bag.  And he notices MICHAEL, sitting 
      nearby among the bags, staring off.  As Jack goes through 
      another bag, he asks:

                                  JACK
                    ...How's your son?

      Michael looks up, surprised.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Walt?  Yeah, I think he'll be all right.

                                  JACK
                    How old is he?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nine.
                          (then, suddenly)
                    Ten.




                                                                              CONTINUED)

        CONTINUED:124124


      Jack glances at Michael, then finds something in the luggage.  
      It's another SHAVING KIT.  As he UNZIPS it, starts to go 
      through the contents --

                                  MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Walt's more worried about his dog than 
                    anything.  It was on the plane, so... 
                    Kids, you know.  They're --

                                  JACK
                    -- Was it a white lab?

                                    MICHAEL
                          (stunned)
                    ...Yeah.

                                  JACK
                    -- Yeah, I saw him yesterday.  In the 
                    jungle.

                                    MICHAEL
                    -- What?  Where?

                                  JACK
                    Over there, hundred yards in or so.  He 
                    looked good.

      And Jack pulls out a STRAIGHT RAZOR.  He snaps open the 
      blade.  Tests its sharpness with his finger.

                                    MICHAEL
                    -- What was that thing you saw.  In the 
                    jungle -- what was it?

      Jack folds the razor shut.

                                  JACK
                    I have no idea.

      And Jack walks off.  Michael looks toward the jungle.  Sighs, 
      burdened with a task he doesn't want to accept: going into 
      the jungle after that damn dog.

      INSERT - BACKGAMMON SET125125

      EXTREME CLOSEUP of a mini-travel MAGNETIC BACKGAMMON SET. 
      Hands setting up the pieces.

      EXT. BEACH - DAY126126

      It's Locke, setting up the game.  After a long beat, in a 
      WIDE SHOT, Walt comes into frame, watching Locke.  



                                                                              CONTINUED)

        CONTINUED:126126

    A long beat of silence.  Finally, Locke asks, without ever 
      looking up:

                                  LOCKE
                    Do you play?

    A beat.

                                  WALT
                    Nope.
                          (long beat)
                    ...What is it?  Is it like Checkers?

      As odd as Locke seemed around the adults, he almost seems 
      normal now.  A bizarre child-like honesty that makes him

                    It's a better game than Checkers.

      And after a beat, Walt moves closer to Locke.  Watches.

                                  LOCKE (CONT'D)

                    No.

                    She got sick.  She died.  So.

      Locke looks at the kid.  You sorta wish he weren't.

                    You're having a rough month.

      Matter of fact.  Not talking down to the kid.  And Walt 
      appreciates that.  Locke turns his attention back to the 
      board.  Slowly and gently continues to set up the board, 
      pushing the small black and white tiles onto their starting 
      points.  The effect is almost mesmerizing --

                      Backgammon is the oldest game in the 
                    world.  Much older than chess. 
                      Archaeologists found sets when they 
                    excavated the ruins of Ancient 
                      Mesopotamia.  Would you like to guess how

                    ...That's older than Jesus Christ.

      Which doesn't really land for Walt.  But he asks:

                                  WALT
                    Did they have dice and stuff?

                                  LOCKE
                    Yes.  But theirs weren't made of plastic.
                          (then)
                    Their dice were made of bones.

                                  WALT
                          (slightly nervous)
                    Cool.

      Walt watches carefully as Locke picks up one WHITE piece and 
      one BLACK one.  Folds them into his CLASPED hands and gently 
      shakes...

                                  LOCKE
                    The Persians called it "Takhteh Nard" 
                    which means "Battle on Wood".  Two 
                    players.  Two sides.  One is light.  One 
                    is dark.

      Locke extends his closed fists, offering them to Walt.  Walt 
        considers... deliberates.  Then taps his finger on Locke's 
      right hand.  He slowly opens one. We don't get to see it, but 
      Walt does.  And now that distracted creepy grin is back.

      EXT. BEACH - DAY127127

      Back at the beach, Claire sits in the First Class seat, 
      writing in a journal.  Sad.  Scared.  And after a beat, Jin 
      is there, with a tray of sea urchins.

      She regards the plate.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ...Oh.  No thank you.

      But Jin insists:

                          (in KOREAN)
                    You will need to eat -- especially you, 
                    you should have some.

      She hesitates, but takes some.  Chews some off.  Eats it.  
      And God, does she not like it.  Jin watches her, nodding:

                                  JIN (CONT'D)
                          (in KOREAN)
                    It's good, isn't it?

      And as she eats the horrible food, suddenly her face changes. 
      Like she just felt something.

      Jin looks on, concerned -- and Claire stands --

                                  CLAIRE

      And she suddenly SMILES -- beams -- THANK GOD, SHE'S FELT A

                    -- I felt it!  Come here -- feel this!

      -- And she takes Jin's hand -- which disturbs him to no end -- 
      he doesn't like this situation at all -- especially what she 
      does: PLACING HIS HAND ON HER BELLY --

      Another WIDE SHOT.  Different area, some time later.  And our

      coming from the OVERGROWN GRASS FIELD -- something LOUD -- 
      something COMING, FAST -- and they all FREEZE, afraid --

      -- And Boone grabs her and YANKS her away and Kate is RUNNING 
      to, she turns back to Sawyer, who stands there alone,

      NO, SAWYER!!!

      But Sawyer doesn't move -- instead he does something wildly 
      surprising: HE PULLS OUT A GUN AND BEGINS FIRING AT THE 
      APPROACHING THING!  BAM!  BAM!  BAM!

      And Kate and the others stop, shocked, watching in out-of 
      breath horror as Sawyer FIRES, AGAIN AND AGAIN and the thing 
      gets CLOSER AND CLOSER UNTIL SAWYER'S GUN FIRES OUT AND 
      SUDDENLY, EXPLODING FROM THE BRUSH: A GIANT FUCKING ANIMAL

      and heaving its last breaths only two feet away from Sawyer,

      them, in total mind-bending shock at what's just happened. 
      Out of breath, they all walk over to the beast, which inhales

                    -- You think... that's what killed the pilot?

      Kate throws a look at Charlie -- this is exactly why he 
      should have kept his mouth shut.  But as the cat is already 
      out of the bag --

                                  JACK
                    -- It's unlikely he'll regain 
                      consciousness, but the pain might bring 
                    him around.   If it does... I need you to 
                    hold him down.

                                  HURLEY
                    Uh -- I'm not so good around blood, man.

                                  JACK
                    Then don't look.

                                  HURLEY
                    Yeah.  But I'm not so good around blood.

                    Just do your best, okay?

      Jack puts the lighter down, then puts both hands on the 
      shrapnel.

                                  HURLEY
                    Shouldn't you like, wash your hands?

                    I did.  But he'll probably get infected 
                    no matter what I do.  He lives, we just 
                    hope the antibiotics work.  Don't look.

      Mutters something to himself.  Maybe a silent prayer.  A

      FADE IN:

      INT. MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY TENT - DAY134134

      Seconds after Jack has pulled out the shrapnel -- Jack doing 
      his best to assess the wound, now bleeding profusely.  Hurley 
      has neglected his duty in holding Shrapnel Man down, in 
        awe/disgust/shock about what's happening in front of him --

                      HURLEYJACK
      Dude...Hand me those strips --

      And thank fucking God most of this happening below frame 
      because Jack actually just put his hand inside the guy.

      Dude.Just hand me the strips -- I

      But Hurley in fact cannot focus.  He's looking at the open 
      wound, eyes glazing over.  Jack sees it --

                                  JACK 
                    Hey!  Don't even think about -- HURLEY!

      But it's too late.  Hurley crumples, hits the ground like a 
      bag of rocks -- PASSED OUT.

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    Dammit.

      And as he does his best to refocus on the task at hand --

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY135135

      The group -- still reacting to the almost-dead POLAR BEAR. 
      Sawyer, eyes on the bear, shoves his gun into the back of his

                    was one on the plane --

                    You found a gun on a U.S. Marshal?  Yes, 
                    I believe you did.  You knew it was there 
                    because you were the one he was bringing 
                    back to the States.  Those handcuffs were 
                    on you.

                    There's a button on the grip -- push 
                    that, it will eject the magazine.

      And Kate does it: it POPS out with a solid metallic SNAP.

                                  SAYID (CONT'D)
                    But there's still a round in the chamber  
                    -- hold the grip, pull back on the top 
                    part of the gun --

      She does that -- the bullet POPS out.  She tosses Sayid the 
      clip.  She picks up the bullet.  Hands Sawyer the worthless 
      gun.  He takes it, somehow amused by her.

                    Not girls exactly like me.

      Sawyer's amused by her.  And he just walks away -- and we 
      HOLD ON KATE for a long beat as she watches him go... finally 
      HEARING:

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #3 (V.O.)
                    Can I get you a refill?

      And Kate looks up as we CUT TO:

      INT. PLANE - DAY136136

      We're looking up at the FLIGHT ATTENDANT -- and realize that 
      we're back on the plane.  The moments before the trouble.

      And the Flight Attendant is talking to KATE, who looks up at 
      her -- and as if having to hide some deep trouble, kindly 
      says about her almost-empty cup of Coke:

                                  KATE
                    No, I'm fine with this, thank you.

      The Flight Attendant turns to the MAN sitting beside Kate --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #3
                    -- You, sir?

      AND WE REALIZE IT'S THE MAN WHO WAS BLEEDING FROM THE HEAD AT 
      THE CRASH SCENE -- THE MAN WHO JACK IS OPERATING ON.

                                  MAN
                          (to her chest)
                    I'll have a coffee, sweetheart.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT #3
                    -- Coffee, sure --

      And the Flight Attendant moves away.  The Man glances at 
      Kate.  Kate stares out the window, pensive.  A beat.

                                  MAN
                    You look worried.
                          (she says nothing)
                    I'd be worried too, I was you.

      Kate's eyes just stare at the blue out there.

                                  MAN (CONT'D)
                    Hey -- look at the bright side.  There's 
                    an off-chance they'll believe your story.
                                  (MORE)


                                                                              CONTINUED)

        CONTINUED:136136
                                  MAN (CONT'D)
                          (tongue firmly in cheek)
                    I sure know I do.

      Kate finally looks at him.  An intense stare.  For a reason 
      we're about to learn, she resents this man.

                                  KATE
                    It doesn't matter to me what you believe.

      He grins.  If it wasn't clear before, it's clear now -- this 
      guy is a Class-A prickfuck.

                                  MAN
                    Well that sure is true.  Always has been.
                          (long beat)
                    You sure you don't want another soda?

                                  KATE
                          (defiant)
                    Yeah, thanks.

      Then she goes to take a final sip -- and what we see shocks 
      us.

      KATE IS WEARING THE HANDCUFFS.

      HER JACKET HAS HIDDEN THEM FROM THOSE AROUND HER -- BUT HOLY 
      SHIT, SHE'S THE ONE THE U.S. MARSHAL WAS TAKING BACK TO THE 
      STATES -- AND THE MAN BESIDE HER IS THAT MARSHAL.

      As she finishes her drink, the PLANE SHAKES.  Just a little. 
      No big deal.  DING -- "FASTEN SEATBELTS" LIGHTS UP.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE
                    Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has 
                    turned on the fasten seatbelts sign -- 
                    please return to your seats with your 
                    seatbelts fastened...

      And Kate turns to the man.

                                  KATE
                    I have one favor to ask.

                                  MAN
                    This oughta be good.  Wh--

      AND SUDDENLY THE PLANE DROPS TWO HUNDRED FEET IN TWO SECONDS  
      -- PEOPLE HIT THE CEILING -- SCREAMS AS THE BEVERAGE CART 
      COMES DOWN, HITTING THE MAN BESIDE KATE -- HE'S SUDDENLY 
      UNCONSCIOUS AS THE PLANE HITS HORRIBLE TURBULENCE --





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          88.



      PASSENGERS SCREAMING -- TERRIFIED --137137

      -- AND THE PLANE DROPS -- it's MAYHEM as the thing is about 
      to break up and the OXYGEN MASKS DROP NOW and people scramble 
      to grab them -- Kate tries too --

      BUT HER CUFFS ARE ATTACHED TO HER BELT -- SHE CAN'T REACH 
      HIGH ENOUGH -- AND SHE CAN BARELY BREATHE NOW -- UNABLE TO 
      REACH FOR THE OXYGEN MASK --

      PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING --138138

      CAMERA SHAKING MADLY AS THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLANE IS TESTED  
      -- THE VIEW OUT KATE'S WINDOW ALTERNATELY SKY AND SEA AS THEY 
      DROP --

      THEN KATE139139

      GRABS THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN AND PULLS HIM OVER HER -- HE SLUMPS 
      ON TOP OF HER, HEAD BLOODY AND SHE PULLS HIS KEY-RING OUT -- 
      SCRAMBLES TO UNLOCK HER CUFFS -- SHE DOES -- AND SHE GRABS 
      THE OXYGEN MASK, PUTS IT ON HER -- AND PROPS THE MARSHAL UP 
      IN HIS SEAT -- GRABS HIS MASK AND PUTS IT ON HIM.

      AND WE'RE TIGHT ON KATE --140140

      TERRIFIED OUT OF HER MIND AS THE PLANE IS ABOUT TO BREAK UP -- 
      AND WE'RE LOOKING AT HER AS THE REAR OF THE PLANE RIPS OFF -- 
      JUST FUCKING DISAPPEARS -- PEOPLE AND THINGS FALLING OUT INTO 
      NOTHINGNESS AS WE SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. JUNGLE - DAY141141

      Just where we left Kate -- as the others walk off, following 
      Sawyer.  Sayid then moves to Kate, who's pale now.  And he 
      says to her, sweetly:

                                  SAYID
                    -- We should keep moving.

      And Kate nods -- and heads off --

      EXT. MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY TENT - DAY142142

      Hurley still out fucking cold, Jack continues his surgery.  
      Up to his elbows in blood.  His patient, now clearly 
        identifiable as the MARSHAL who flew with Kate.

      We don't see what Jack is doing, but it has a frantic feel to 
      it.  Clearly get the sense that things have gone from bad to 
      worse.




                                                                              CONTINUED)

        CONTINUED:142142


      His hands move on autopilot -- using the torn shirt to soak 
      up the blood with his left hand -- holds the needle and 
      thread in his right, trying to stitch up whatever is torn 
      inside -- A desperate attempt to stick his thumb in the dam 
      that is this guy's life.  And that's when --

                                  SHRAPNEL MAN
                    Gah ---

      Jack FREEZES -- the Man's face is contorting in pain as he 
      begins to GAIN CONSCIOUSNESS --

                                  JACK
                    -- No --

      The guy is literally struggling to breathe -- but he's 
      conscious now.  Moving his lips, something coming out in a 
      whisper -- the guy is WILLING himself to say something -- 
      Jack puts down the needle -- leans closer --

                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    What?  I can't...

      And suddenly, the guy GRABS Jack by the shirt.  Pulls him 
      close with his last ounce of strength. And he HISSES --

                                  THE MARSHAL
                    WHERE IS SHE?

      Off Jack's face --

      EXT. BEACH - DAY143143

      TIGHT ON A SMALL LEAF (known as "Sleeping Grass").  A small 
      hand touches it -- and the LEAF CLOSES.  RACK FOCUS TO REVEAL 
      Walt, sitting on the sand, studying this odd plant.

      After a beat he HEARS:

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Walt!

      And Walt turns around -- across the beach, he sees his 
      father.

                                  MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    You looking for this?

      Walt looks, curious.  And Michael steps forward -- REVEALING 
      VINCENT, WALT'S WHITE LAB.  Walt's face comes to life as he 
      RACES across the sand to the dog, who runs to Walt.  Walt 
      hugs the dog, loving him.  Michael watches this.  He can't 
      help but smile at the reunion.


                                                                              CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                          90.

        CONTINUED:143143


      Then Michael looks over to Jack -- who kneels over the Man 
      with the shrapnel wound.  And Jack is talking to the Man -- 
      and Michael watches this from a distance -- can't hear 
      anything -- but what Michael sees is fascinating.

      The Man -- the Marshal -- is telling Jack something. 
      Something urgent -- and Jack's reaction is shock.  Disbelief.

      And the Man -- holding on to Jack's lapel -- dies.  And Jack 
      stares at him, stunned.

      Michael watches as Jack finally sits back, exhausted, 
      shocked.

      And Michael watches him, intrigued.

      We're TIGHT ON JACK -- LONG LONG LENS -- as he looks off, his 
      mind spinning --

      EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY144144

      We're TIGHT ON KATE as she walks, staring off, numb... 
      reliving her last moments on that airplane... HOLD ON HER for 
    a long beat.

      ANGLE - SAYID

      Also walking.  He pulls out the transceiver as they go. 
      Sawyer sees this.

                                  SAWYER
                    Oh.  Now it's a good time to check the 
                    radio.  Not before, but now.

                                  SAYID
                    We're up higher.

                                  SAWYER
                          (asshole)
                    Yes, we are.

      Sawyer walks off, past Sayid as Sayid turns on the radio. 
      Stares at the screen. And he walks up to camera and stops -- 
      now in EXTREME CLOSEUP.

      AND WE SEE HIS POV --145145

      TIGHT: A BAR FLICKERS in the RECEPTION window -- Sayid's 
      shocked -- breathless --






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                          91.



      BACK TO SCENE146146

                                  SAYID
                    -- Bar -- bar, there's a bar--
                          (then, loud)
                    HEY!  WE GOT A BAR!!!

      The Others stop -- turn to him -- Sayid fiddles with the 
      controls as the others surround him -- he holds down a button 
      and makes the call:

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    -- Mayday mayday--

      But: SCRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  HORRIBLE FEEDBACK!

                        KATESAYID
      -- What's that?-- Feedback --
      -- Feedback from what?-- I don't know --
      -- What would do that?

                                  SAWYER
                    I'll tell you what would do that.  This 
                    guy not fixing the radio -- the thing 
                    doesn't work --

      And once again: SCRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Sayid 
      releases the button --

                                  SAYID
                    No -- no, it's not broken...
                          (suddenly)
                    We can't transmit because something's 
                    already transmitting.

      This sinks in --

                        SHANNONCHARLIE
        What?Transmitting from where?

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Somewhere close -- the signal's strong --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Close?  You mean here on the island 
                    close?  That's fantastic!

                                  SAYID
                    Could be a Satphone -- maybe a radio 
                    signal...

      TIGHT ON KATE as she finally asks the only question really 
      worth answering --

                                  KATE
                    Can we listen to it?

                                  SAYID
                    I don't know what frequency the signal is 
                    -- hold on --

      Sayid begins to SCAN for the frequency -- nothing but STATIC.

                      SAWYERKATE
      -- There's no transmission --Sawyer, shut-up --

                                    CHARLIE
                    It's the rescue crew -- it must be --

      And suddenly GASPS from the group as they HEAR A FRANTIC 
      FEMALE VOICE:

                                  FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                    ...Il est dehors... Il est dehors et

                    -- That's French.  The French are coming! 
                    I've never been so grateful for the 
                    French --

      Our people can't believe they're actually hearing another 
      voice:

                        KATEFEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
    I never took French -- -- Veuillez nous aider... Ils 
      What's she saying?sont morts
                                                  -- Ils sont tous morts...

                                  SAYID
                    -- Does anyone speak French?

      MOVING over all their faces as the voice continues.  No.  
      None of them speak French.  But then -- pointing:

                                  BOONE
                    She does.

      Boone's pointing at Shannon.  And not since Algebra 2 has 
      Shannon been on the spot like this.


                                                                              CONTINUED)

      ABOUT, YOU SPENT A YEAR IN DRINKING!  NOT STUDYING!
      PARIS!

      And now another VOICE emerges from the walkie.  A MALE VOICE, 
      oddly flat.  Without inflection.  Automaton --

                                  MALE VOICE (V.O.)

                    Right then -- what was that?

      But now the FRENCH WOMAN is speaking again.  And her voice is 
      FADING a little...

      Shannon tries to understand it -- shaking, her eyes closed -- 
      Kate's nervous --

                                  SAWYER
                    You're telling me no one here speaks 
                    French?!?

                      CHARLIEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
      -- That voice -- that's Iteration one seven two nine 
      weird --four five three two.

      And THE DESPERATE FEMALE VOICE begins again...

              FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)SHANNON
      -- Nous aider... Ils sont (small voice)
      morts --It's -- it's repeating --




                                                                              CONTINUED)

                                  SAYID
                    -- Yes, she's right -- 
                    It's a loop.  "Iteration."  It's 
                    repeating the same message.
                          (and to prove it)
                    It's a counter -- the next number will 
                    end five three three.

      And they HUSH, focused on the transceiver as --

                                  MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                    Iteration one seven two nine four five 
                    three three.

      Beat.  Then, the FRENCH WOMAN begins again, still FAINTER - 
      Sayid looks up at the others, triumphant.

                                  SAWYER
                    Does anyone understand what the hell he's 
                    talking about?

                                  SAYID
                    It's a running count.  Of the number of 
                    times the message has repeated.  It's 
                    roughly thirty seconds long, so...

      Sayid's eyes look skyward, lips moving -- runs the numbers...

                                  SAWYER
                    Don't forget to carry the one, chief.

                      CHARLIEKATE
      -- Guys, the battery --Give him a minute.

      Boone couldn't care less about figuring out the numbers.  He 
      is still intent on his sister --

                                  BOONE
                    -- C'mon, Shan -- What's she saying?  
                    Try.

              FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)SHANNON
      Si n'importe qui peut (scrambling; stressed)
      entendre ceci -- veuillez -- I don't know -- I think 
      nous aider...she's saying "Please."
                                                      (listens)
                                                  She's saying "Please help me.  
                                                  Please come get me."

                    Or she's not!  You don't speak French!

                    Let her listen.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                    Il les a tues.  Il les a tues tous.

      And Shannon's face FALLS as she listens, something 
      registering... and whatever it is, it scares the LIVING SHIT 
      OUT OF HER.

                                  CHARLIE
                    What?  What is it?

      The voice gets fainter and fainter.  Shannon brings the 
      walkie to her ear, she's calm now, almost as if she's 
      CHANNELING the speaker.  And yeah -- it's fucking SPOOKY...

                                  SHANNON
                    "Please help... I'm alone now... on the 
                    island alone.  Someone please come... the 
                    others, they're dead.  It killed them.
                          (then)
                    It killed them all."

      And with that, complete and utter SILENCE.  The battery is 
      dead.  Just the wind.  Then Shannon lowers the transceiver.

      We suddenly find SAYID.  His lips stop moving.  His eyes drop 
      from the heavens.  And he looks even more frightened than the 
      rest of them.

                                  SAYID
                    Sixteen years.

                                  SAWYER
                          (snapping out of it)
                    What?

                                  SAYID
                    Sixteen years.  Five months.  And nine 
                    days.  That's the count.

                      CHARLIEBOONE
      The count?  What -- ?You wanna give us a minute 
                                                  here, man?  'Cause this is --

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    The message.  The iterations.  It's a 
                    distress call.  A mayday.  A plea for 
                    help.  And if the counter's right, it's 
                    been playing... over and over for sixteen 
                    years.



                                                                              CONTINUED)

      And we let that doozy sink in for a moment before --

                                  BOONE
                    Someone else was stranded here?

                                  KATE
                    Maybe someone came for them...

                                  SAWYER
                    If someone came, why's it still playing?

      Beat.  Another beat.  And another.  Taking in all six of 
      them.  All equally freaked... no longer so sure they were 
      lucky to survive.  Finally --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Guys -- where are we?
