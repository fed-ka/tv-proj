FISSURE NEST TUNNEL
The five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel, out of the wind's
banshee wailing.
The lead PREDATOR reaches up to his headgear, pulling
at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus.
He removes the helmet, clips it to his rear utility pack, and takes a
deep breath of the air.
A curious speckled pattern runs across his
wide forehead, marking him
different to the others; in addition, one of the fangs of his mandibles
has been sheared away.
We'll call him BROKEN TUSK, he's the leader of
the hunting party.
He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the
tunnel.
Several feet in from the rim, it changes from rock to a textured
biomechanical surface; a swirling mass of disturbing shapes.
He
hurries forward in response to the GURGLING-HISS of one of his team who
has found something.
The other PREDATOR holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny.
Skewered
on the end is a shriveled FORM with eight spindly legs and a segmented
tail; it's a FACEHUGGER, the first stage of the deadly ALIEN lifeform.
BROKEN TUSK HISSES a caution to his party; they respond by pulling
spears and elaborately-shaped swords.
Several shoulder-mounted plasma
cannons slide up to firing position, tracking with their owners'
helmets.
Thus armed, they move cautiously ahead...taking no chances.
One helmeted PREDATOR pauses, scanning the area.
PREDATOR-VISION.
He switches through a variety of different views; infra-red, ultra-
violet, enhanced motion-tracking.
Nothing.
He's so pre-occupied with this task, he totally fails to notice the
skeletal ALIEN loom up behind him, emerging from the biomechanical
growth on the floor.
A barbed tail skewers the PREDATOR straight
through the neck, splashing luminous blood across his chestplate.
A
gargled DEATH-RATTLE issues from his throat, the band of PREDATORS
spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground.
The
band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid; they
themselves are set upon by a half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS.
The carnage is
swift and terrifying, a blur of motion.
Steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air, alive
with the CRIES and HISSES of both adversaries.
One PREDATOR is pinned
against the tunnel wall, his spear out of range.
The ALIEN claws away
his face mask, and he finds himself dodging the ALIEN's toothed tongue,
extended toward him with pile-driver speed.
He reaches down, grasping
the 'smart-weapon' hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc
that terminates at the ALIEN's grinning face.
Big mistake.
The two
are in such close proximity that the ALIEN's acidic blood sprays across
the PREDATOR's head.
While their technology seems to be resistant to
it, their bodies aren't:
the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into
the PREDATOR's skin.
He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a HIDEOUS
PIERCING SCREAM, clawing at his seared face.
It all seems to be over as quickly as it began; there can be no
question as to who were the victors.
The PREDATORS stand amidst a sea
of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house.
As his
companions begin to carefully decapitate the ALIEN skulls, BROKEN TUSK
steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades.
The first
PREDATOR to be attacked was killed instantly; he crosses to the other.
What he finds causes him to react with
pity and disgust.
His fallen comrade is only just alive; mandibles
clicking frailly, half his head burnt away.
BROKEN TUSK watches the
ailing PREDATOR slide a steel blade from it's sheath and offer it to
him.
He takes it, knowing what has to be done.
Rolling the knife
quickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick
seasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen
hunter.
This unpleasant task accomplished,
BROKEN TUSK straightens up and activates his wrist-computer.
A dark
shape blots out the light coming from the entrance; a small PREDATOR
shuttlecraft, sleek and elegant.
It hovers in the air with little more
than a loud HUM, and extends a ramp.
The surviving PREDATORS leap
aboard, carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men
returning from combat.
One more thing need to be done.
BROKEN TUSK bends down and flips a
sequence of keys on the dead PREDATOR's wrist.
A countdown is
displayed in some unknown character-set, accompanied by a HIGH PITCHED
BEEPING.
He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes
smoothly to the air, it's undergear retracting.
PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY
An airlock RUMBLES open and the PREDATORS file NOISILY into the
Mothership's docking bay.
An OLD PREDATOR crouched against a strut
takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly
look up at them.
Like the PREDATORS themselves, the ship is a curious
mixture of old and new.
An elaborate frieze written in alien script
runs around the wall, with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed
into it.
Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship; we see BROKEN
TUSK carry his ALIEN head off down one of them.
PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
The gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship.
BROKEN TUSK enters, pausing next to a kind of readout device:
a
cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which
constantly changes it's mass into shapes and alien text.
He peers over
the protective railing.
WHAT HE SEES is magnificent:
a captive QUEEN ALIEN, the nucleus of the
ALIEN society, fed by giant intravenous pipes.
Each of it's limbs is
tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement.
To the rear,
it's giant egg-sac glows and throbs, suspended by a jury-rigged sling.
A SCANNING MECHANISM hangs above the EGGS the QUEEN lays, seemingly
defying gravity.
As each EGG is scanned by a blue triangular beam -
similar to a PREDATOR gun-sight - it becomes translucent, giving us a
view of the pulsing FACEHUGGER inside.
This done, a manipulator are
carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet, which then sinks into a
hatchway in the floor.
It's an assembly-line of almost frightening
mechanical efficiency.
PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
The blue beam slides across one of the eggs, and suddenly changes to
red, BEEPING rapidly.
BROKEN TUSK sees the flowing display-tank alter
from a rotating simulation of an ALIEN WARRIOR skull to a
representation of a QUEEN's head.
The manipulator arm swiftly grasps
the EGG in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor.
The causes the QUEEN to go
berserk, straining at her bonds and SHRIEKING ferociously.
She's
obviously been through this before and knows what's about to happen.
The protrusionsplits open, spilling out an intense white light:
an
energy-filled blast furnace.
The manipulator claw opens, the EGG drops
in, and is no more.
PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS
An orange light plays across a wall of skulls, casting dark shadows
into long-empty orbs.
BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like across a flat
slab of rock in the center of the room, inspecting his formidable
arsenal of weaponry. Satisfied, he reaches out to run a finger across
the jaw of his ALIEN trophy in an almost-erotic gesture.
He regards it
for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind, before
finally getting to his feet.
PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY
The lights in the gallery are dimmer when BROKEN TUSK enters.
He
watches the cherry-red beam of the gliding SCANNING MECHANISM lock onto
one of the EGGS, then runs his hand in sequence over the control board.
The manipulator arm swings over, seizing the egg and loading it onto a
waiting pallet.
BROKEN TUSK points his finger at the QUEEN and makes a guttural
CLICKING SOUND from deep in his throat.
The effect is not unlike that
of a child firing an imaginary gun.
As if reading BROKEN TOOTH's
thoughts, the QUEEN lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous
HISS of contempt.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
We're in the dark womb of a split-level command center alive with
clusters of video readouts, somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air-
traffic control tower.
On the upper tier, a large circular holo-
display currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw.
Thin
trailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air
conditioning ducks, though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of
the people manning the consoled here.
We move in on CASSIE DOLLANDER
and ROB PARSONS, two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank.
CASSIE listens carefully to something on her headset.
CASSIE
Ah, negative on that request commercial freighter 'Nan-Shan'.
I've
already got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon-fix.
Hold on
my mark until I get back with some confirmation.
Rimward Traffic
Control out.
She thumbs a button and leans over to PARSONS.
CASSIE (CONT'D)
How's it looking?
PARSONS worriedly shakes his head.
PARSONS
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
CASSIE
Better tell the boss.
PARSONS pulls out a coin.
PARSONS
Toss you for it.
RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE
HIROKO NOGUCHI is sweating heavily, a black forelock of hair falling
across her Oriental features.
Her eyes flicker warily from side-to-
side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her, trying to
assess from where the next attack will come.
She doesn't have to wait
long; two NINJA SWORDSMEN drop to the floor in front of her, striking
without hesitation.
She expertly avoid the blows, parrying relentlessly.
A persistent TONE
begins to intrude O.S., like a telephone RINGING.
She tries to ignore
it, but her concentration is clearly broken.
A THIRD SWORDSMAN appears
from out of nowhere, his sword SWISHING towards her chest.
The blade
plunges deep into her stomach, emerging from her back.
She glances
down in annoyed disbelief.
HIROKO
Fuck!
Holo off.
The SWORDSMEN immediately flicker and disappear.
She sheathes the
sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to
her desk. Mopping her face with a towel, she thumbs a stud.
The
RINGING TONE stops, the corporate logo on her flat-screen desk panel
replaced with a black girl's face.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Noguchi.
CASSIE
(O.S., onscreen)
Something just came up on Deep Space Tracking.
HIROKO
What kind of 'something'?
CASSIE
(O.S., onscreen)
Easier if you come down and look.
HIROKO
I'm on my way.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
KAMEN steps into the command center, nodding familiarly to the DUTY
PERSONNEL.
A long-haired labrador rushes up to KAMEN, wagging it's
tail. Her name is BREWSTER.
She's the base mascot.
KAMEN reaches down
and ruffles it's fur.
He climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier,
pulling the French-plaited hair of ANNIE URIOSTE, an Italian systems-
mechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console.
URIOSTE
You didn't wipe your feet coming in.
KAMEN
Well, it's okay.
You didn't tell me it was monsoon season going out.
PARSONS looks up at KAMEN and grins.
PARSONS
Hey, buenos dias, cowboy.
When d'you blow in?
KAMEN places his hat on PARSONS' head and THUMPS it down.
KAMEN
Just got back.
Missed anything?
URIOSTE
(snorts)
Yeah.
We're almost out of beer.
PARSONS
Ahh, don't pay any attention to Urioste. She's still pissed that
Noguchi wouldn't let her go off on your hunting trip.
KAMEN pours himself a cup of coffee from a BUBBLING percolator.
KAMEN
Wasn't my trip, I just did the driving. 'Sides, freezing my butt off
out in the wet taking pot-shots at the local wildlife isn't my idea of
a good time, either.
He sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid.
PARSONS
Where'd you leave them?
KAMEN
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.
They're making
their own way back tomorrow.
CASSIE
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
KAMEN
Shit.
When?
CASSIE
Yesterday.
We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story
on 'Sixty Seconds'.
Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
KAMEN looks ill.
KAMEN
Fucking great.
I invested some money in them.
CASSIE
You win some, you loose some.
KAMEN
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.
Anything
else you wanna ruin my day with?
CASSIE
No, but I got something that might interest you.
HIROKO enters, pulling on a leather jacket.
HIROKO
What've you got?
KAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble.
They
turn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of
the neighboring solar system.
CASSIE
A pair of incomings.
They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen
twenty-four local time.
PARSONS
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just
to make sure.
CASSIE
Yeah.
Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
The simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing two unidentified objects heading
towards the planet in the center of the display.
Computer notations
accompany them.
CASSIE (CONT'D)
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a
deep-space drive.
HIROKO
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
PARSONS
That's what we thought.
HIROKO
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
PARSONS
Done it already.
Nothing matches.
CASSIE
And if you thought that was interesting, watch this...
HIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change.
KAMEN
Jesus.
PARSONS
Yeah, exactly.
Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're
looking at.
KAMEN
Tactical nukes, maybe?
Everybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything.
It's
obviously not an appealing thought.
HIROKO
Where're they headed?
CASSIE
We ran a trajectory simulation.
If they carry on along that path, it's
possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
There's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant
glances. HIROKO seems worried.
She scratches her forehead.
HIROKO
I don't know what to make of this.
Get a copy of the telemetry relayed
back to Antarctica Traffic Control.
Better alert the nearest RimCorp
Base, too.
PARSONS nods, suddenly serious.
PARSONS
Fort Powell.
What do we tell 'em?
HIROKO
Just give them the facts.
They can leap to their own conclusions.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
HIROKO peers at the display with undisguised concern.
A sense of
urgency buzzes around the room.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
When?
CASSIE
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.
Those incomings
are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too
close for comfort.
HIROKO
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
PARSONS looks up from his board in harassment.
PARSONS
Already working on it.
HIROKO
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
She meets KAMEN's eyes.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Looks like you were right.
Someone's lobbed a pair of smart-missiles
at us.
KAMEN shakes his head.
KAMEN
Relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies; why bother?
All you're gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control
net.
That'd be small potatoes even for terrorists.
PARSONS and CASSIE are all-business at the control board.
PARSONS
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
CASSIE
Okay, give me the numbers.
She flips a switch.
A nearby screen changes to display an orbital path
sketched out in rectangular neon blocks.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
The two blips on the holo-board representing the pods make a marked
alteration in their course.
PARSONS
They've changed their heading again.
HIROKO
Compensate!
PARSONS
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
CASSIE
What do you need?
PARSONS
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
CASSIE
It's on the board.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
One of the two blips on the holo-display vanishes, and three-quarters
of the monitors abruptly turn to static.
PARSONS curses.
PARSONS
Goddammit!
He pulls off his headset with weary resignation.
PARSONS (CONT'D)
We've lost the downlink.
It's gone.
TENT - NIGHT
A portable neon light in the tent flickers, casting staccato bluish
light over ACKLAND and the FACEHUGGER.
MINH and BEAUVAIS stare at it
in horrified fascination, while YORK pulls a tourniquet around his
thigh.
He winces.
BEAUVAIS
Have you tried prising it off?
YORK shakes his head.
YORK
I wanted to get him back here; get him back to base.
MINH
Forget it.
We lost the satellite link. It's dead.
There's a long pause while everyone considers the options.
BEAUVAIS
We've got no option.
We're gonna have to get it off.
MINH
Oh man...
YORK
Get real, Beauvais!
That thing might chew his fucking face off for all
be know!
The motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again.
MINH catches BEAUVAIS'
head-jerk.
BEAUVAIS
Minh...
MINH
Yep...
MINH hefts his 'howitzer' and leaves the tent.
BEAUVAIS rounds on
YORK, continuing.
BEAUVAIS
How do you know it's not already?
YORK
I don't, but I think we should just wait and let the Doc take a look...
TENT - NIGHT
PREDATOR-VISION.
The extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on
ACKLAND for a long moment, but takes no further action.
CHOPPER - DAWN
The cockpit is small, a two-seater with room for cargo in the back.
KAMEN's in the pilot seat, and HIROKO's riding shotgun.
The controls
moving by themselves, on autopilot.
A REPETITIVE BEEPING causes KAMEN
to look up from his magazine.
KAMEN'S P.O.V.
From out of the window of the 'chopper', we see the twin blue lights of
the navigation beacon blinking on-and-off above the trees.
KAMEN nudges HIROKO awake.
KAMEN
Wake up.
We're at the beacon.
He switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down.
HIROKO rubs the sleep from her eyes.
CHOPPER - DAWN
KAMEN and HIROKO stare at the site in disbelief.
KAMEN hauls an
automatic pulse-rifle from the rear.
KAMEN
Looks like trouble.
KAMEN reaches under the pilot's seat and pulls out a hand-pistol.
Passes it to her.
KAMEN (CONT'D)
Used one of these before?
HIROKO coolly examines it.
HIROKO
Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader. Uses twelve mill hollow 'O'
rounds, with through the barrel smart laser-sighting. Sure, I can
handle this.
HIROKO's show-boating and KAMEN knows it, but he still can't help being
a little bit impressed.
KAMEN
Okay.
Watch were you point it...
TENT - DAWN
KAMEN opens the tent flap and peers inside.
ACKLAND's on the cot,
sweating heavily.
There is no sign of the FACEHUGGER.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
With nothing to do, most of the screens are out and the remaining
personnel bored.
PARSONS is reading a magazine with his feet up on the
console, uninterested in HIROKO and KAMEN's conversation nearby.
HIROKO
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.
Until we come up with
something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
KAMEN
Agreed.
HIROKO
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
KAMEN
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.
They're the least of your problems right
now.
HIROKO
What do you mean?
URIOSTE walks up, very serious.
She interrupts.
URIOSTE
Sorry.
Can I have a word?
HIROKO
Sure.
What's up?
URIOSTE
Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago.
The algae must have clogged up an
intake duct.
KAMEN
Think I spoke too soon...
HIROKO
Again?
How long before we start noticing the difference?
URIOSTE
I reckon it'll be another day before the smell gets unbearable.
Beauvais usually fixes it, but... ah...
HIROKO knows what she means.
BEAUVAIS is dead.
HIROKO
Can you handle it?
URIOSTE
Sure, I can manage.
But I'm not going into the Pit on my own.
HIROKO
(to Urioste)
Alright, get somebody from the auto-shop.
(to Kamen)
Is that
alright?
KAMEN
Yeah, no problem.
Ask Diller, he's good with his hands.
URIOSTE exchanges a grin with CASSIE.
CASSIE
I'll go along with that.
A SHRILL TRILLING from his console communicator makes PARSONS leap up
to answer.
PARSONS
Parsons.
(long beat)
Yeah.
Hold on.
RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY
A CLOSE UP of an eye, bright blue and dilated.
DOC REVNA's shining a
hand- held light into ACKLAND's face.
ACKLAND's regained
consciousness, but is far from happy.
He's sitting on the edge of a
cot in the base Infirmary, an antiseptic room full of automated medical
equipment.
The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby, a
circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting
blades and surgical paraphernalia.
ACKLAND
Hey, c'mon Doc, I feel fine.
Really.
REVNA flicks off the probe.
REVNA
Headache?
Dehydration?
ACKLAND
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
REVNA
Forget that.
I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours.
I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
REVNA shakes her head and turns to KAMEN.
REVNA (CONT'D)
He's broken a fever that would kill a mule, but if he says he's alright
I'm prepared to believe him.
He's all yours.
HIROKO enters.
She watches from behind KAMEN.
KAMEN
What happened out there, Ack?
ACKLAND
(consternated)
What do you mean, 'what happened'?
What am I doing back here?
Where's
York?
HIROKO
(insistent)
What's the last thing you can remember?
ACKLAND thinks hard.
ACKLAND
We... watched a meteor hit over Linson's.
HIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances.
HIROKO
A meteor?
ACKLAND
Yeah, it impacted really off.
We went out to the crash-site... and...
uh... that's... that's all.
KAMEN
Nothing else?
ACKLAND
No.
KAMEN turns to REVNA.
KAMEN
Show him 'Fido'.
REVNA pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack.
She
hands it to ACKLAND.
He studies the dead FACEHUGGER floating inside
with morbid fascination.
REVNA
Ring any bells?
ACKLAND tries hard to think, but it's as if a wall's slammed down hard
on his mind.
ACKLAND
Not really, no.
Ugly little sonuvabitch. What is it?
KAMEN
We thought you might be able to tell us. I found it by your cot at the
camp.
You were out cold.
ACKLAND
What did York say?
HIROKO
York's vanished.
ACKLAND
Vanished?
HIROKO
Beauvais and Minh are dead, Ackland.
York's gone awol, unless you can
help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion, he's the prime
suspect right now.
The news hits ACKLAND hard.
He falters and leans back, addressing
REVNA.
ACKLAND
Can I... um... have some water?
Please?
REVNA
Sure.
She goes to fetch a cup.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMISSARY
It's lunchtime, and the SOUND of machinery STEAMING food mixes with the
CHATTER of the twenty-or-so personnel eating there.
HIROKO and KAMEN
are deep in conversation across a table.
KAMEN
Do you believe him?
HIROKO
Ackland?
I don't know him well enough to say.
If we were back on
Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure.
There's not much we can do out here.
KAMEN stares hard at her.
That's not much of an answer, and HIROKO
knows it. She capitulates.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Alright then, For what it's worth... yes, I do.
KAMEN digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork.
KAMEN
You should try this seasoned stuff.
It's good.
GUTTIEREZ approaches the table carrying something.
GUTTIEREZ
Got a present for you.
He hands HIROKO's leather jacket over to her.
HIROKO
Oh, I've been looking for this!
Where was it?
GUTTIEREZ
You left it in the chopper.
Oh, and before I forget, Don?
I ran that
test you wanted on the turbines.
KAMEN
And...?
GUTTIEREZ
And, nothing.
They checked out just fine.
RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY
REVNA sits at a desk and peers into a microscope.
Every so often she
GRUNTS in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal.
The stasis tube containing the dead FACEHUGGER stands to one side of
the computer screen.
The Infirmary is very quiet, and only the gentle
THROB of the air-conditioning intrudes.
ACKLAND tosses uncomfortably
on his cot.
He finally sits up and massages his chest.
ACKLAND
Oh.
Oh God...
REVNA lowers her pen and looks across.
REVNA
What is it?
ACKLAND
It's nothing, Doc.
Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
REVNA
Do you want a tablet?
ACKLAND winces in pain.
His breathing's getting heavy.
He nods.
ACKLAND
Uh-huh.
REVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy.
ACKLAND's
beginning to COUGH now.
REVNA
That sounds nasty.
I'll give you a couple of Demazine.
ACKLAND nods again.
His COUGHING has deepened, and now he's banging
his chest with a balled fist.
REVNA hurries over with three red
tablets and a disposable cup of water.
ACKLAND takes them gratefully
and gulps them down. The effect is almost immediate; ACKLAND quietens
and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips.
REVNA (CONT'D)
Better?
ACKLAND
Yeah...
Before he has a chance to elaborate, ACKLAND COUGHS once more.
A thin
spray of blood and saliva dots REVNA's white smock and speckles her
cheek. ACKLAND's scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to
hyperventilate. She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the
process.
He falls to the floor, his MOANS growing in volume.
REVNA
Hold on, it's alright.
I'm gonna give
you a shot...
Her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical
instruments. She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a
vial of amber liquid attached.
ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto
the floor, his hands clawing at the air.
REVNA fumbles with the
injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm.
ACKLAND
convulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the
ceiling.
The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again.
We hear a gentle CRACKING, like twigs being snapped.
REVNA watches in
horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across
the floor from below ACKLAND's corpse.
REVNA shudders as the body
moves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it.
WHAT SHE SEES.
ACKLAND's body slumps forward onto it's front,
revealing a gaping cavity in his back.
Bits of spine and ribcage are
just visible.
A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform
- pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from it's body with a pair of
still-underdeveloped arms.
Around it's head is a distinctive nascent crest.
It kicks away from
ACKLAND with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance.
After a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a
table.
REVNA thinks quickly.
She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red
stud next to the pressure-door, which promptly RUMBLES closed.
The room is bathed in pools of shadows.
Plenty of hiding space for the
creature.
REVNA hears breaking glass, making her start.
She
cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of
probe-arms.
There's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery.
REVNA reaches up and twists the base; it detaches easily.
Now she's
armed. Stooped over, she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER...
There's a flurry of movement, and suddenly the hunter becomes the
hunted. The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL
SHRIEK, and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense.
We
hear a SIZZLE like frying bacon...
RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY CORRIDOR
HIROKO sprints down the corridor and reaches the Infirmary.
DILLER,
CASSIE, and a few others are crowded around outside.
YORK lays
unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door, making
access difficult.
Above them, a hinged flap on the wall lies open
revealing a circular mechanism beneath.
BREWSTER scratches at the
bulkhead and WHINES.
MUFFLED THUMPS come from within.
HIROKO
What happened?
DILLER
York just turned up outside.
We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
HIROKO
(astonished)
York...
HIROKO leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud CRASH from
within the Infirmary distracts her.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
What's going on?
CASSIE
The door's sealed from inside.
Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds
like Ackland's going nuts.
HIROKO
Force the door.
DILLER
Can't.
It's pressure sealed.
GUTTIEREZ races up and hands DILLER a wrench with a shaped tip.
GUTTIEREZ
Here...
DILLER
Thanks.
He inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard, the physical
effort showing on his face.
The door grinds open about eight inches...
The bloodied CHESTBURSTER forces itself through the narrow gap, HISSING
vehemently.
Yellow fluid wells from a wound in it's crested skull,
dissolving everything it comes into contact with.
The small group
gathered around fall back in panic, jarring YORK's trolley and knocking
HIROKO to the floor.
BREWSTER BARKS at the CHESTBURSTER, which tenses
as if to leap.
DILLER brings the wrench down, but the CHESTBURSTER evades his blow and
takes flight.
It strikes at HIROKO, who reflexively draws her head
back and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek.
The ALIEN disappears down the corridor, leaving a trail of smeared
blood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring.
GUTTIEREZ bends down and
helps HIROKO to her feet.
Shocked, she MUTTERS something to herself in
JAPANESE, and regains some of her composure.
HIROKO
Get after it, don't let it get away!
DILLER stands there with the metal bar.
Does she think he's nuts?
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Go on!
This galvanises DILLER.
He races off in pursuit.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jan, give me a hand over here.
HIROKO AND GUTTIEREZ try to force the door, but DILLER was right - it
won't budge.
HIROKO slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around
blindly.
She must have hit the control knob, because the door slides
back.
CASSIE looks inside.
CASSIE
Oh my God...
She turns away and retches.
HIROKO steps through and goes pale.
There
are blood-smears over everything, and it's all GUTTIEREZ can do to stop
BREWSTER from getting in there.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
PARSONS' finger traces a path along a set of computer schematics
displayed on a suspended glass screen.
PARSONS
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
HIROKO
What is that?
DILLER
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.
I found the grating
ripped right off.
The little fucker was strong.
HIROKO
Where does that lead to?
PARSONS
Central Pumping.
All the waste gets
treated, broken-down, and flushed
out into the swamp.
If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked-
out.
HIROKO
You've checked that end?
GUTTIEREZ
Not yet, no.
HIROKO
Do it.
I don't want that thing on my installation.
I want it caught
and destroyed.
KAMEN
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.
Each part of this station is
basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off
external couplers.
If we disconnect them and seal off every section,
we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.
That
should give us ample time to find it.
HIROKO
Alright.
Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign
a release for the weapons.
Cassie, organise a team roster and put it
on the board.
CASSIE nods soberly.
HIROKO looks at everybody, and her words are
carefully chosen.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
I don't care how you kill this thing, just be careful not to get in
it's way when it bleeds.
You all saw what happened to Doc Revna.
There are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.
Keep in pairs.
Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down
with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
DILLER
Okay.
HIROKO
One final point.
Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in
itself.
However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a
hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
This seems to appeal to those assembled there.
There's a palpable buzz
in the air.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Alright, let's get to it.
New York rules apply.
RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE
YORK is recounting his story to KAMEN and HIROKO in a hushed voice.
Small beads of sweat stand out on his forehead and his eyes are haunted
by remembrance.
The man's a mess.
YORK
...I mean, these... these mothers were... were huge.
They look like
bushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all over 'em.
They must've wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds.
Minh got
off a couple of shots from that cannon of his, but he might as well
have been using a B-B gun.
I don't know how the hell I made it out of
there alive.
He nods toward the PREDATOR spear in HIROKO's hands.
YORK (CONT'D)
The one I clipped with the hoverbike shoved that at me.
Whatever it's
made of, it went straight through a double-layer of honeycomb polyalloy
composite like it was butter.
YORK shakes his head in fear.
YORK (CONT'D)
I don't wanna ever come up against those things again.
Ever.
KAMEN claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him.
KAMEN
Don't worry about it, Yorkie.
You're safe now.
Go get come rest.
YORK nods.
He gets to his feet and leaves the room.
HIROKO waits
until the door slides shut behind him.
HIROKO
So, what do you think?
KAMEN
What do I think?
I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift
their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the
middle of something we shouldn't.
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
DARKNESS.
DILLER and URIOSTE's VOICES heard O.S. in HUSHED TONES.
The
scraping of METAL-ON-METAL.
DILLER
What is that...is that it?
URIOSTE
No.
I... think that's a regulator valve. Hold on.
There's more NOISE.
URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Ah, got it...!
About a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber
illuminate.
Three others flicker erratically, one of them remaining
unlit. DILLER waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse-
rifle level. He enters, followed by URIOSTE.
She's carrying a portable
- but bulky - piece of machinery.
URIOSTE
Are you getting anything?
DILLER
(sarcastic)
Yeah, eyestrain.
What's with the lights?
URIOSTE
They're always like that.
Head-Office are real cheap when it comes to
spares.
Wave that thing in the corner...
DILLER sweeps the tracker carefully around.
The small screen registers
nothing.
DILLER
The room's clean.
URIOSTE
Great.
URIOSTE pulls at a two-piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the
floor.
It's heavy and thick with grease, but she doesn't seem to mind.
Below it is what looks like a round metal plug.
Recessed into its
surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve, with handholds on
either side.
She turns the lever.
There's a loud CLUNK, and a plume
of steam JETS out of the valve.
URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Give me a hand with this.
GRUNTING, the two of them pull the thick metal plug clear of the pit.
Murky water sloshes around below.
URIOSTE pulls a second lever, and
hidden pumps make the water level drop rapidly.
URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Pass me over that tripod, will you?
Leaning against the wall behind DILLER is a sturdy metal tripod topped
with a block-and-tackle arrangement.
A hook dangles below this, it's
thick metal cabling going up through the block-and-tackle and
connecting to the drum of a small industrial winch attached securely to
the wall.
DILLER hands the tripod over to URIOSTE.
She splays the
legs apart and inserts their tips into matching holes around the open
pit.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
Most of the lights in Admin are off, and the room's deserted.
PARSONS
is seated away from his usual station at a console topped by ten
monitor screens, each displaying a securi-cam picture.
He looks tired.
KAMEN comes up behind him carrying two mugs of coffee.
KAMEN
How's it going?
PARSONS
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
He takes the coffee gratefully and sips at it.
PARSONS (CONT'D)
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now.
Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
KAMEN
You should hit the sack, too.
PARSONS
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
KAMEN
What time's sundown?
PARSONS
'Bout five minutes.
KAMEN
Give me a yell is something happens.
PARSONS
You got it, cowboy.
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT
A think metal cable connected to her jacket harness suspends URIOSTE in
the gloom of the Pump Shaft.
In front of her is a machine-part we saw
her carry earlier.
With the strap of a flashlight clenched in her
mouth, she's just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of
machinery in an alcove, with simultaneously doing her best not to touch
the walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge.
The REPORT of DE VRIES' weapon can be heard even down here, perhaps
more startling in the confined space.
URIOSTE jumps, dropping the
flashlight into the water in the process.
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
DILLER turns away from the winch and peers into and beyond the access
tunnel leading outside.
URIOSTE's VOICE floats up out of the shaft.
URIOSTE
(O.S., muffled)
What was that?
DILLER
(raising his voice)
Something outside...
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT
URIOSTE's flashlight bobs up-and-down on the water below, still lit and
well out of reach.
URIOSTE
(disgustedly)
Shit.
DILLER
(O.S., muffled)
What's the matter?
URIOSTE
I've dropped my torch into the water. Give me about... uh... a meter-
and-a-half's worth of slack.
DILLER
(O.S., muffled)
Okay.
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
DILLER crosses to the wall-mounted winch.
On the mechanism's side is a
luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters.
He
pulls a throw-switch, and the display slowly changes from "8" to "9.5"
as the cable feeds out.
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT
URIOSTE descends the dingy shaft, partially abseiling off the walls.
Her feet almost tread water.
She's down as far as she can go.
URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Whoa, whoa...
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
URIOSTE's VOICE echoes up out of the pit.
URIOSTE (CONT'D)
(O.S., muffled)
That's enough.
DILLER locks the winch-switch back into it's 'up' position.
The WHINE
of the cable-feed stops immediately.
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT
URIOSTE stretches out to the floating lamp, flexing her fingers.
It's... just... about... in... reach...
Six slender fingers EXPLODE from beneath the water's surface and clamp
like a vise around URIOSTE's wrist.
A sleek eyeless head follows,
trailing a body straight out of a charnel-house nightmare.
A SCREAM
forms in her throat, rapidly cut-off as the ALIEN's other hand clamps
firmly over her mouth, jerking her downwards.
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
DILLER whirls in response to the CHOKED CRY from below.
He sees the
winch tripod above the shaft RATTLE, the cable going taut as an
angler's line. The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps
from it's 'clamped' position, freely unspooling cable at a frightening
rate.
The digital counter flickers rapidly;
"11...11.5...12...12.5...13..."
DILLER watches the tripod's tubular
legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain.
He scrambles for
the winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place; the
over-stressed cable vibrating with a LOW METALLIC TWANG as it hits the
shaft's edge.
DILLER's moment of satisfaction is short-lived; the
deep-sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by
the colossal force from below.
He leaps aside, avoiding the heavy
piece of machinery as it HURTLES towards him.
Watches it disappear
noisily into the conduit.
DILLER
Annie!
DILLER's quivering fingers grope for his flashlight.
DILLER (CONT'D)
Annie!
He feverishly reaches the shaft's edge and peers into the darkness.
WHAT HE SEES.
The torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the
ALIEN emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft
walls towards him.
Recoiling in horror, he makes a run for the door.
Half-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor,
grasping it just as the ALIEN reaches the top.
DILLER fumbles with the
safety and give the creature a full BLAST on rock-and-roll, BLASTING it
back into the pit.
RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM
DILLER's on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as ANOTHER
ALIEN's claws emerge from the exposed hole.
He races across the
threshold and SLAMS the thin inner door closed.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
PARSONS sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed
to his bank of screens by an exterior securi-cam.
PARSONS
Oh my God...
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
PARSONS listens to HIROKO, suddenly wide awake.
The morning shifts are
starting to filter in, and it's obvious to them something's wrong...
HIROKO (CONT'D)
(O.S., on speaker)
Everything's under control.
Wait a second.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
HIROKO (CONT'D)
(O.S., on speaker)
...already out here.
We're going to lock every bulkhead and seal the
base.
RYUSHI STATION - LIVING QUARTERS
CASSIE brushes her teeth in front of the wall-mounted mirror of her
tiny bathroom-cubicle.
A raucous emergency klaxon GOES OFF in the
corridor outside.
CASSIE
Shit.
CRAWLER - DUSK
KER-CHUNK!
The cab's occupants react as the thin roof buckles
slightly. Skeletal fingers SLICE through, RIPPING at the metal like a
can-opener.
DE VRIES
Jesus!
THOMAS raises his rifle and looses a fusillade of shots through the
roof. One of them RICOCHETS off the interior, SHATTERING the
windscreen.
There's a THUMP from outside...
DE VRIES (CONT'D)
You got 'im!
Their triumph is short-lived.
Globules of yellow acid perforate the
roof like Swiss cheese, dripping down on them.
GUTTIEREZ floors the
brakes.
The crawler swings through ninety degrees before SCREECHING to
a halt.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
CASSIE enters admin at a run.
Before, it was empty.
Now it's sheer
chaos. She shoves her way through dozens of grim-faced people.
PARSONS
is standing at a console, YELLING into his headset.
PARSONS
Seal everything now!
CASSIE
What's happening?
PARSONS
Cassie, thank Christ!
We're under attack.
CASSIE
We're what!?
York races in, SHOUTING above the clamor.
YORK
The son-of-bitches got into 'E' wing! They're ripping it apart!
PARSONS
Fuck!
Somebody get over there with some guns!
Now!
CASSIE watches the scene unfolding on the banks of monitors.
PEOPLE
mouthing unheard words into camera.
Bursts of STATIC.
Fleeting
glimpses of nightmarish SHAPES darting across the picture...
CASSIE
How many of them are there?
PARSONS
Too many.
RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS
Pumped up with adrenalin, KAMEN reaches an intersection and encounters
a harrowing tableau.
An ALIEN blocks his way on the other side of a
corridor bulkhead, holding a STRUGGLING MAN above the floor.
It's
piston-like tongue shoots into the MAN's skull, spraying gore.
The ALIEN sees KAMEN, and it's mouth twists into a bloody SNARL.
Both
KAMEN and the ALIEN lunge forward together, but KAMEN's got the edge by
a split-second.
He STRIKES a bright red switch and the overhead
pressure bulkhead SLAMS down and locks into place.
His breathing is
heavy as he slowly backs away from the hatch...
RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE
HIROKO enters her office at a run.
She crosses to an inset control box
on the far wall and presses a button.
Two exterior panels begin to
slide closed behind the polycarbonate window.
KERSMASH!
Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes
under assault from the razor-edge tip of an ALIEN's tail.
In shock,
HIROKO reflexively falls backwards onto the floor, scrambling away.
She watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge
outside, fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously
raining repeated blows on the window with it's tail.
The ALIEN leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the
onslaught, showering splinters across the room.
The twin shutters
secure behind it, closing on the creatures tail in the process.
It
HISSES in indignation and thrashes about.
Like a lizard, the segmented
tail SNAPS in two.
The freed ALIEN staggers a little before gaining
balance, blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden
floorboards.
It sights HIROKO and hurls itself in her direction, an
unstoppable killing machine...
HIROKO
Holo on!
Her VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic, it's a wonder the
computer can recognize it.
FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear,
forming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN.
The ALIEN halts,
confused by this intrusion. It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms,
bewildered by the lack of contact as it's claws pass through them.
Gaining on a few seconds of bought time, HIROKO flings herself towards
the PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby.
The ALIEN locks in on this
sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her.
HIROKO
GRUNTS, swinging the spear with her full strength...
She's no super-athlete, but the cutting edge's advanced metallurgy does
the job.
It slices half-way through the ALIEN's skull and sticks
there, spewing yellow fluid everywhere.
HIROKO beats a hasty retreat
as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor, fumbling at the lodged
weapon...
RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS
HIROKO reels into the outside corridor.
She SHRIEKS as her shoulders
are seized from behind...
KAMEN
Come on!
HIROKO looks at KAMEN confusedly as he continues along the corridor.
HIROKO
That's the wrong way!
KAMEN
Detour.
Other way's blocked...
RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP
THOMAS pushes DE VRIES through the opening, with GUTTIEREZ hurriedly
following.
The Auto-shop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one
wall. The front of a crawler pokes from one of them, while in the
center of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenance-pit on
a hydraulic platform.
A handful of GREASE MONKEYS stands around the
doorway, brandishing power-tools in lieu of firearms.
A blonde surfer-
type with long straggly
hair rushes over to them.
This is MATT, their savior.
MATT
Close it up, close it up!
GUTTIEREZ stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up.
In the midst of the flames, the ALIENS are fighting a pitched battle
tooth-and-nail with their unseen opponents.
It's like a scene out of
Hell.
RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS
Clusters of rotating emergency lights wig-wag above HIROKO and KAMEN as
they flee through the maze of long corridors leading to the Command
Center.
KAMEN is falling behind as they approach a junction.
HIROKO
Hurry it up.
KAMEN
Don't wait for me!
HIROKO and KAMEN race along the final corridor leading to the Command
Center. Halfway down, KAMEN turns in response to a JARRING SOUND from
the rear.
The metal grating making up the floor is SMASHED violently
from beneath.
KAMEN
Run!
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
The PANDEMONIUM from the outside corridors gets the attention of YORK
and everybody else in admin.
He crosses to the bulkhead doorframe, and
what he sees makes his eyes bug.
YORK
Jesus Christ!
He SHOUTS back into the crowded room.
YORK (CONT'D)
They're inside, inside the corridor!
RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR
HIROKO and KAMEN try to outrun the tidal wave of twisted and broken
steel that emerges in their wake.
KAMEN YELLS with fright as an ALIEN
claw pinions his ankle.
He trashes about, clutching at anything to
prevent himself being dragged beneath the floor.
CRYING OUT is pain as
slivers of edged metal slice into his hands...
HIROKO
(anguished)
No!
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
YORK stands frozen at the bulkhead frame, staring down the corridor in
horror.
CASSIE races up and pushes him out of the way...
RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR
HIROKO looks furiously around.
Spying an emergency axe in it's wall
housing, she SMASHES the glass with her elbow, cutting herself in the
process.
HIROKO hefts the heavy tool, swinging it down onto the
disappearing ALIEN's carapace with all her might...
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Bastard!
The blade bites deep, and yellow blood bursts from the threshing
ALIEN's wound.
Speckles of it dot KAMEN's leg, eating through the
material of his trousers and into the skin and muscle beneath.
He
SCREAMS, a sound of pure intense pain...
HIROKO hurls the axe aside.
She begins pulling KAMEN out of the hole
as the caustic liquid seeps into the nearby electrical conduit.
There's a SPARKING, followed by a FLASH and a SHEET OF FLAME.
CASSIE
steps through into the corridor, just as valves evenly-spaced along the
length of the tunnel open up, jetting white high-density foam under
extreme pressure.
The hatch to the Command Center at the far end
begins to close...
HIROKO
Cassie...!
CASSIE's head shoots around.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
YORK seizes a metal chair from behind a nearby console and wedges it
into the narrowing divide.
CASSIE squeezes through the gap and
urgently HOLLERS to HIROKO...
CASSIE
It you don't... uh!... move your ass, you're gonna need a helluva diet
to get through here!
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
from CASSIE's P.O.V. we watch HIROKO supporting KAMEN and stumbling him
along.
Foam fills three-quarters of the corridor to their rear and is
nearly up to their knees everywhere else.
The chair's frame CREAKS
ominously in protest...
YORK
Hurry up, we're losing it!
CASSIE's eyes widen in terror...
CASSIE
Behind you!
HIROKO turns to see the long, phallic head of an ALIEN emerge
momentarily from out of the foam.
Something yanks at KAMEN and he
disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise...
HIROKO
Kamen!
HIROKO starts to thrash at the foam, but CASSIE reaches out and drags
her away.
CASSIE
It's too late!
HIROKO
Nooooo!
The chair begins to buckle, collapsing in on itself...
YORK
It's going!
With a supreme effort, CASSIE yanks HIROKO through the gap.
YORK
vaults clear as the chair SNAPS in two, leaving the bulkhead to THUNDER
closed. The two women collapse in a heap on the floor.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
HIROKO stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed
disbelief.
PARSONS
Miss Noguchi?
No reaction.
He tries again.
PARSONS (CONT'D)
Miss Noguchi!
HIROKO snaps out of it.
She crosses over to the bank of monitoring
screens.
HIROKO
What's the story?
PARSONS runs through each of the screens.
PARSONS
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.
We've lost 'B', 'C',
and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally
evacuate.
HIROKO
How many... how many people are missing?
CASSIE
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over
the place.
HIROKO
What's our weapons situation?
DRISCOLL - a big guy with a beard - LAUGHS curtly.
DRISCOLL
Shit!
Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.
We
got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
HIROKO
Auto-shop?
CASSIE
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
HIROKO
Has anybody talked to them?
CASSIE
Not yet.
HIROKO
Do it.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
Everything electrical in the Command Center flickers momentarily, and
the bank of monitors turn to static.
There's an instant of silence
collective concerns amongst those gathered there.
DRISCOLL
What the hell...?
PARSONS
Don't panic, people.
We've just switched over to internals.
HIROKO
They knocked out the external feeds.
PARSONS
Looks like it.
CASSIE
Thirty six hours?
PARSONS nods.
PARSONS
Give or take.
CASSIE
We're not gonna make it, are we?
HIROKO
Get the auto-shop on-line.
PARSONS shakes his head.
PARSONS
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk.
That's down with the other feeds.
HIROKO
Well... try the headset.
RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP
Spirits are low in the auto-shop.
MATT
I'm tellin' you, it's impossible.
Nothing can grow and reproduce this
fast.
THOMAS
Yeah.
Right.
You wanna go outside and tell them that?
DE VRIES
What's keeping those fucking Marines, man? They should'a been here by
now!
THOMAS lashes out at an empty can, kicking it noisily across the floor.
THOMAS
Maybe they ain't coming.
Maybe they don't even know we've got
problems...
GUTTIEREZ
I don't wanna hear that kind of crap, Thomas.
They're coming.
Just a
matter of time, that's all...
GUTTIEREZ' headset lies nearby.
PARSONS muted VOICE comes out of it.
One of the GREASE MONKEY's snatches it up and listens.
GREASE MONKEY
Yo!
Guttierez!
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
PARSONS
Through now.
HIROKO
Jan, it's Hiroko.
What sort of shape are you in down there?
GUTTIEREZ
(O.S., on speaker)
Pretty damn good shape, considering.
You can tell Don Kamen from me
his people have got balls of steel.
HIROKO
Kamen didn't make it, Jan.
There's a pregnant PAUSE from the speakers.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jan?
GUTTIEREZ
(O.S., on speakers)
Yeah.
I... we're still here.
We're all... uh... all sorry to hear
that.
HIROKO
Can you make it back?
GUTTIEREZ
(O.S., on speakers)
Uh... I'd say that was a negative.
If we open the doors, those things
are gonna swarm inside.
There's another problem, too.
HIROKO
What's that?
GUTTIEREZ
(O.S., on speakers)
De Vries put a round through the storage tanks over by the west pier on
the way in here.
Right now, the stuff sprayin' out is just burnin' up,
but if we get a blow-back, a good part of the station could go with it.
CASSIE
Oh, man...
HIROKO
Alright, let's keep calm.
We've got to have an option of some sort...
there's got to be a way out of this.
YORK
Oh yeah?
Like what?
YORK's kept quiet, but everyone turns to him now.
His tone is scathing
and cuts to the marrow.
CASSIE
Well, what about those other things outside; those warriors?
Maybe we
can cut some kind of deal...
YORK looks around at them in incredulous disbelief.

MATT walks nervously around, holding the headset.
Everybody's eyes are

MATT
Well, it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load
the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.
That way we could put a
bit of distance...
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
MATT (CONT'D)
(O.S., on speakers)
...Between us and the station.
Least 'till the guys from Fort Powell
arrive.
HIROKO
That sounds promising.
Can we operate the crane from here?
DRISCOLL
Nah.
It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for
remote operation.
Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and
running.
HIROKO
Which mean physically going outside.
DRISCOLL looks around uneasily.
DRISCOLL
Yeah.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK
A small group of people, most of whom we saw in the Command Center, are
clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor.
HIROKO's wearing a black hi-tech catsuit, a fetishist's dream.
Across
her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster.
She nods at a
pile of clothing in DRISCOLL's hands.
HIROKO
Is this the suit?
DRISCOLL
Uh-huh.
She takes it from him.
Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls
it up.
YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his
face.
YORK
This is fuckin' lunacy!
You're not gonna make it across the platform
on foot!
CASSIE
Shut up, York.
HIROKO
No, he's right.
Has anyone got a bike near here?
A REDHEADED GIRL looks around hesitantly, then raises her voice.
REDHEADED GIRL
I have.
HIROKO
Let me have the keys.
The GIRL rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over.
HIROKO puts
them in a pocket on the suit's sleeve.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Which one is it?
REDHEADED GIRL
Uh... the Hyundai racer.
Yellow and black stripes.
YORK
Oh, yeah.
Real inconspicuous...
HIROKO
Listen, I don't care if it's pink and purple polka-dots as long as it
gets me there in one piece.
Somebody loan me a headset.
CASSIE pulls off hers and hands it over.
DRISCOLL's watching HIROKO
fasten up the suit.
He spots a mistake.
DRISCOLL
No, go back.
Second clasp from the bottom.
HIROKO finds the offending clasp and locks it.
HIROKO
How much air-time have I got?
CASSIE
About thirty minutes.
Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to
admire the scenery.
HIROKO
Deal.
CASSIE
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into
the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the
inside of the glass as you go.
DRISCOLL
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the
helmet pick-ups, too.
That's also on the display.
HIROKO
Sounds great.
PARSONS
It's not all good news.
We had to take off the helmet lights.
You'll
be going in blind.
HIROKO
What?
Why?
DRISCOLL
We had to.
They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits
you're gonna have to negotiate.
Besides, all the crap floating around
reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights
would have make that much difference, anyway.
Maintenance lights down
there oughta be enough to do the trick.
HIROKO
How tight are these shafts?
CASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks.
CASSIE
Tight.
We chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running
into any Aliens.
HIROKO takes a deep breath.
Beads of perspiration dot her forehead.
PARSONS nods.
PARSONS
There's still time to back-out.
HIROKO
Forget it.
I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do
myself.
Where's the disk?
PARSONS hands over a vinyl-wrapped packet.
PARSONS
Don't lose it.
HIROKO slips it into a breast-pocket and secures the flap.
HIROKO
Don't worry.
I won't.
DRISCOLL hands several metallic objects to HIROKO.
DRISCOLL
Here.
If you got to use 'em, make 'em count.
They're magazines for her gun.
She slots them into the bandolier.
HIROKO
Thanks.
PARSONS
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it
straight.
HIROKO
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.
Insert the disk, and
press the green enabling button...
PARSONS
(interrupting)
No.
There's two of them.
She pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place.
HIROKO
Sorry.
Two green enabling buttons...
PARSONS
Right.
When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of
there.
Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke
some kind of response.
YORK hands over a sophisticated-looking power-tool.
YORK
You'll need this for the gratings. Trigger finger to operate, thumb
button to switch over to the rivet gun.
The sensors'll choose blade or
socket heads automatically.
HIROKO
Right.
(long beat)
Okay, I'm set.
YORK and DRISCOLL lower the massive dome-fronted helmet over HIROKO's
head. Auto-clasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar.
PARSONS clips the slimline air-tank to her back, and DRISCOLL makes the
connections.
PARSONS
Alright, let's open her up.
Carefully, now...
CASSIE and the others hold their weapons and motion-trackers steadily
at a fixed point on the ground.
Two ONLOOKERS bend down to the
pressure-hatch beneath the floor-grating.
It's identical to the one
DILLER and URIOSTE removed earlier.
A plume of pressurised gas jets
into the air, and they pull the metal sealing-plug free.
CASSIE
scrutinizes her tracker...
CASSIE
All clear...
HIROKO reaches up to her helmet and presses a chunky button on one
side.
HIROKO's P.O.V.
We're looking through the transparent bowl of the helmet at the open
shaft, braken water SLOSHING around it's rim.
Superimposed lines of
glowing neon appear on the visor's surface, a precisely overlaid
duplication of the scene in computer-graphic form.
A flatly-
synthesised male
COMPUTER VOICE comes over the helmet speakers, O.S.
COMPUTER VOICE
(O.S., on speakers)
Approaching 'A' module lower level venturiduct DS Oh-four...
HIROKO gets down on her hands and knees and crawls towards the opening.
She stares at the murky water with mounting apprehension.
Tries to
reassure herself.
HIROKO
Okay.
Okay.
She looks around at the impassive, staring faces.
Summoning up her
courage, she submerges the helmet...
HIROKO'S P.O.V.
The pale illumination of the lower level deck-lights gives way to
absolute nothingness; a stygian nightmare.
She SHUDDERS with horror
and pulls her head free.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Oh...!
Oh, God...
She WIPES frenetically at the slickly-coated visor, breathing heavily.
Worried hands grab her.
CASSIE
Are you alright?
PARSONS
What?
What's wrong?
What is it?
HIROKO's eyes dart around, speaking volumes.
She swallows hard and
calms down.
HIROKO
It's alright.
I'm okay.
Steeling herself, she takes a deep breath and plunges headfirst into
the water once more...
HIROKO's P.O.V.
Everything goes to blackness again.
The head-up-display presents a
view of the unseen tunnel in cheerful candy-apple hues.
COMPUTER VOICE
(O.S., on speakers)
Entering venturi duct, en route to secondary overflow sump DS oh four
slash eleven...
YORK watches HIROKO's feet disappear into the shaft.
PARSONS
Seal it.
The heavy sealing-plug is dragged across the grating and positioned
over the hole.
YORK shakes his head.
YORK
Suicide run, man.
Fuckin' suicide run.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT
CASSIE wasn't kidding about the venturi-duct.
It's only about half-
again as wide as HIROKO.
The only illumination comes from the hazy
circle above.
As the plug reseals the hole, even that's gone.
Something flickers.
Two weak fluorescent tubes come on, lighting the
murk with a faint orange haze.
CASSIE
(O.S. on speakers)
All the comforts of home.
HIROKO
Thanks, Cassie.
CASSIE
(O.S., on speakers)
Don't mention it.
She inches her way through the narrow space towards us, breathing
heavily. The CLICKING of the motion-tracker in her helmet is
overwhelming in the
silence...
RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP
From our P.O.V. high up near the roof of the auto-shop we see THOMAS
sitting on the raised hydraulic platform.
He GRUNTS as he pulls a
valve on the crawler's underside.
Across the room, the second crawler RUMBLES out of the far bay.
One of
the GREASE MONKEYS walks slowly backwards, waving it on.
GREASE MONKEY
Okay.
Back.
Back.
Little bit more...
He steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing.
GREASE MONKEY (CONT'D)
Whoa...shit!
The man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the
floor. Scowls first, then frowns.
It's sticky.
Over near the doors, MATT exhales deeply on a cigarette.
DE VRIES is
nearby, listening attentively as GUTTIEREZ gets a message on his
helmet.
GUTTIEREZ
She just set off!
MATT claps his hands together - just once - to get everybody's
attention.
MATT
Okay, people.
Let's hustle...
There's a SCREAM from behind.
They wheel around in time to see the
GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening.
THOMAS yells
down from the platform.
THOMAS
They're comin' up through the pit!
A box with two large buttons - one green, one red - dangles from the
ceiling on the end of a cable.
MATT forces down the red control,
making the platform lower.
Several tons of machinery and crawler bring
about the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening,
CRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens.
An ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time, scrambling for the safety of the
nearby shadows.
DE VRIES sights it.
DE VRIES
Over there!
One of the MEN has seen it.
His head snaps up to a mammoth engine-
block suspended from a winch high above.
He LEAPS for the release-
catch as the ALIEN passes underneath.
Pulls hard on the grip.
Chains
RATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down.
The ALIEN begins to look
up, just a second too late.
The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into
the creature, flattening it instantly.
Unseen by anybody, another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the
platform-bound crawler.
It wraps it's long, bony fingers around the
face of the MAN, stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck.
The
LOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets
THOMAS' attention.
THOMAS
Mother-fucker!
THOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the 'on' switch hard.
The
ALIEN's tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEY's skull, showering
THOMAS with a faint speckling of blood.
The ALIEN discards the body
and lunges at THOMAS, who counters bringing the chainsaw up.
The blade slices into the creature's throat, and up through it's head.
THOMAS draws out the chainsaw quickly.
Something happens to the PITCH
of the blade, a peculiar sound...
The acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band.
Like a metallic
snake, it WHIPS off it's supporting frame.
Straight at THOMAS.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT
HIROKO elbows her way further through the cramped water-filled duct.
A
wide grille directly in her path blocks further headway.
HIROKO'S P.O.V.
Green neon flashes in her display, with accompanying
notations.
COMPUTER VOICE
(O.S., on speakers)
Progress to secondary overflow sump DS oh-four slash eleven impeded.
Grating must be removed to facilitate entry...
HIROKO
(into headset)
Okay, I'm at the first access grate.
CASSIE's VOICE is a little less clear now, with traces of STATIC
drifting in...
CASSIE
(O.S., on speakers)
Copy that.
Be careful, now.
HIROKO
You betcha.
She places the tip of her power-tool over the first of the grille's
anchoring bolts.
The complex mechanism WHINES as it selects the
correct wrench-tip for the job...
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
PARSONS races up to the GIRL manning the communication console.
PARSONS
What is it?
GIRL
Auto-shop.
RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP- CRAWLER CABIN
THOMAS is laid-out in the back seat of the crawler's cab, with DE VRIES
and MATT trying to staunch the wounds from the chainsaw band's impact
to his chest.
GUTTIEREZ speaks into his headset mike.
GUTTIEREZ
Rob?
We got problems.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER
THUMP.
THUMP.
SLAM!
The grille in knocked out of it's housing and
floats lazily off into the water.
HIROKO passes through the newly-
created hole.
HIROKO'S P.O.V.
She finds herself in an upright cylindrical chamber, about five feet in
height.
Massive extractor fans churn dangerously where both the floor
and ceiling ought to be.
Kicking up a swirl of particles.
Pale blue
light filters down from above.
COMPUTER VOICE
(O.S., on speakers)
Caution!
Entering secondary overflow sump DS oh-four slash eleven.
Grating must be removed to facilitate entry to Central Reservoir...
HIROKO
(annoyed)
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
With difficulty, she straddles the floor turbine.
A vortex of water
swirls around her as she brings the power-tool up once more.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
PARSONS listens attentively.
He CLICKS his fingers at CASSIE.
PARSONS
Where is she?
CASSIE
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
PARSONS
Quick!
Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop
maintenance pit.
CASSIE's all-business, immediately calling-up the base floor-plan files
on a monitor.
PARSONS (CONT'D)
(into headset)
Is Thomas gonna make it?
GUTTIEREZ
(O.S., on speakers)
Uh...difficult to say.
I think...
RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP
GUTTIEREZ looks on as MATT ties-off a bandage.
GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
...The chainsaw band might have punctured his lungs.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
CASSIE looks up, worriedly.
CASSIE
I found it...
PARSONS
And?
CASSIE
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
PARSONS
Get her on-line.
Now!
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CENTER
HIROKO's pulls her third bolt free.
It drifts slowly downward,
slipping between the vanes of the floor turbine.
A fragmented VOICE comes through on her headset, distorted beyond
recognition.
HIROKO's forehead knits together in concentration and
annoyance.
HIROKO
What was that?
I don't copy.
CLICK.
CLICK.
BEEP!
The routine sound of the motion tracker changes
suddenly.
HIROKO turns her attention from the task-in-hand to study
the tracker's helmet readout.
THREE NEBULOUS BLOBS have appeared from
off-screen.
Heading straight for her position.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
CASSIE turns to PARSONS in frustration.
CASSIE
I can't reach her.
Too much signal break-up.
PARSONS
Keep trying!
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER
BEEP.
BEEP.
BEEP.
The signals pick-up speed the closer they get.
CASSIE's garbled VOICE isn't helping ease HIROKO's panic.
She looks
wildly around the chamber.
The only way out the way she came in...
COMPUTER VOICE
(O.S., on speakers)
Attention.
Removal of restraining bolts it necessary to facilitate
access to...
HIROKO stabs the exterior helmet control.
The COMPUTER VOICE ceases,
while the BEEPING from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume.
Whatever the signals are, they're almost on top of her...
HIROKO turns to the narrow entry duct.
It's position makes it
virtually impossible to get back into.
She tries anyhow.
BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!
A rush of displaced water flood into the chamber,
flattening her against the wall.
DARK SHAPES THUNDER past the other
side of the grille like express trains in the night...going away from
HIROKO.
She twitches in fear and disbelief as the BLOBS on the monitor
screen recede and finally disappear.
The tracker's pitch returns to
it's hollow CLICKING.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR
HIROKO emerges from the water, a thin membrane of surface slime
adhering to her helmet.
Blinded, she raises a gloved hand and wipes
the mucus away...
HIROKO'S P.O.V.
She's inside the Central Reservoir, a long cylindrical concrete tunnel
some eighteen feet in diameter.
The water-level comes up about half-
way.
What fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion...
She's found the main offshoot of the ALIENS' nest.
Glued into the
curved walls by a secretive resin as BODIES.
HUMANS, RHINOS, LEMURS.
Other ANIMALS.
Most are dead, their innards blown open.
The rest are
comatose, twitching occasionally.
Every square inch not containing
bodies is filled with ALIEN EGGS.
It's like Hell for real.
HIROKO reaches slowly up and reactivates her helmet readout.
COMPUTER VOICE
(O.S., on speakers)
...Brrzzt.
Traversing Central Reservoir en route to platform venturi
dust DS two-six.
HIROKO's P.O.V.
She looks around and finds the exit point on the display. It's several
feet away.
Under the surface.
She wades swiftly through the water,
passing beneath something that gives her cause to pause.
A large
PULSATING BAG, about ten feet long and roughly ovular in shape.
It
might be translucent, but in this light it's hard to tell.
HIROKO submerges.
Sure enough, there's the grille.
She raises the
power-tool and starts extracting the bolts.
BZZZZ!
There's the first
one, no problem.
BZZZZ...BZZZZ!
The second and third are just as
easy.
She goes for the fourth.
BZZZ...CHUNK.
Nothing happens.
HIROKO
Come on...
She bears down on the trigger again.
The motor's not running.
A tiny
green LED flashes on the machine's side.
It's locked solid.
A
malfunction.
COMPUTER VOICE
(O.S., on speakers)
Attention.
Removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate
access to
venturi ducts.
There's only one recourse left to her.
She jams down the thumb
button...
KER-SLAM!
The force of the rivet-gun propels her backwards, her
internal suit-pressure making her rise to the surface.
She wipes the
slime from her helmet yet again...
...And finds herself staring at an ALIEN EGG, it's top cracking open in
four neat sections.
The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate...
...And misses, it's fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery
dome. HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates
itself on the water's surface, it's powerful tail propelling itself
back toward her.
It contracts on itself, preparing to leap.
HIROKO
raises the power-tool,
reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again.
Fat rivets RIP
through the FACEHUGGER's body.
It writhes around on the water's
surface, a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it.
HIROKO dives
into the water again. She rams the power-tool at the final bolt.
BZZZZ!
It's out!
She levers-off the grille.
Forces herself into the
confined space beyond...
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT
Another poorly-lit shaft filled with murky water, though this one goes
upwards on a diagonal slope.
HIROKO braces herself against the walls
and begins to climb.
COMPUTER VOICE
(O.S., on speaker)
Traversing venturi duct en route to platform surface.
WHAM!
An ALIEN's head squeezes through the opening behind her.
It's
claw snakes in, groping blindly just inches from her feet.
She grits
her teeth and puts more effort into her ascent.
WALLPO!
It's hand closes around her leg, yanking her back.
She tries
frantically to gain purchase on anything.
She fails.
The ALIEN draws
her nearer, it's other hand closing on the helmet's visor.
Fracture
lines appear on the glass, followed by cracks.
Polluted water starts
to flood in, while air-bubbles expand outward from the broken glass.
HIROKO drives the power-tool at the ALIEN and mashes the trigger.
Rivets penetrate the creature's endoskeleton, making it draw back.
A
haze of yellow blood spills out into the duct.
HIROKO pushes upward,
coughing.
She closes her fist around a lever above.
Pulls on it with
all her might.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
Everybody in admin registers astonishment as her voice comes over the
speakers.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
(O.S., on speakers)
...Can all uncross your fingers.
A WHOOP goes up.
Various hands are SLAPPED.
PARSONS
We copy, boss.
Nice going.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
HIROKO (CONT'D)
(O.S., on speakers)
...To you shortly.
Noguchi out.
PARSONS clicks his fingers to DRISCOLL.
PARSONS
Driscoll; you're up.
DRISCOLL's moving even as PARSONS speaks.
DRISCOLL
I hear you...
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL
DRISCOLL flips open an access flap on one wall of the ladder-well.
Printed on the inside is a set of instructions, with the following
printed boldly in red;
CAUTION!
EXPLOSIVE BOLTS - READ CAREFULLY!
He traces his finger along a line of text.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT
HIROKO enters the cab at a run.
She flips a row of switches, and the
control board comes to life.
HIROKO
Access panel... access panel...
She finds it.
Gets her fingers in the groove and slides it out.
Beneath is a mini-disk drive with two buttons.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Bingo.
She pulls the vinyl-wrapped packet from her catsuit pocket.
Carefully
withdraws the disk and slides it home.
Thumbs the first button, which
glows an emerald green.
The board's flatscreen monitor lights up immediately.
HIROKO studies
it for a moment, then presses her headset link.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
Okay, we're in business.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
PARSONS
Right.
Auto-shop, you all set?
RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP - CRAWLER CAB
Everybody from Auto-shop is crammed into the two articulated vehicles.
GUTTIEREZ sits in the driver's seat of the first crawler.
He glances
out of the side window.
MATT gives him a 'thumbs-up' from the cab of
the second crawler.
GUTTIEREZ
(into headset)
Say the word, and you won't see our asses for dust.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT
HIROKO wipes a trickle of sweat from her forehead.
She poises her
finger over the second drive-button.
HIROKO
Alright.
Here we go...
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
Everybody in admin looks tense.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
(O.S., on speakers)
Three...
RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP - CRAWLER CAB
GUTTIEREZ leans forward.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
(O.S., on headset)
Two...
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT
HIROKO blinks as the sweat drains into her eyes.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
One...mark!
She stabs the drive switch.
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT
The control board monitor is suddenly awash with information and
schematics...
HIROKO
Okay, I'm out of here!
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
PARSONS
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL
DRISCOLL raises a black device shaped like a cylinder with a handgrip
on the end.
Slots it into the mechanism beneath the flap and carefully
turns it.
A tiny red LED comes on.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL
DRISCOLL reports into his headset.
DRISCOLL
Bolts blown!
FIRST CRAWLER CAB
GUTTIEREZ pushes forward on the crawler's controls.
The head-up
display projected on the cab windscreen changes from 'NEUTRAL' to
'DRIVE'.
FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT
GUTTIEREZ braces himself as they speed on a collision course towards
the ditched crawler they left outside auto-shop earlier.
GUTTIEREZ
Shit!
SECOND CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT
MATT
Yee-haa!
Demolition derby, baby!
FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT
DE VRIES YELLS at GUTTIEREZ over the ROAR of the flames.
DE VRIES
Hotter 'n hell out there!
RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT
A blinking message on the crane's monitor screen:
POSITIVE MATCH.
COMMENCE LIFTING OPERATION.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
CLANG!
Everybody reacts as the SOUND penetrates through the walls and
ECHOES around admin.
PARSONS
Okay, people.
Hold on tight...
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
Pencils, disposable cups, and anything else not bolted down all roll
from table-tops.
Most are grabbed by their owners.
GUTTIEREZ turns his head to one of the guys in the rear.
GUTTIEREZ
Take the wheel, Roy!
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
CASSIE answers, holding on to the edge of her console.
CASSIE
Hiroko, it's Cassie.
What's...
HIROKO's VOICE interrupts.
HIROKO
(O.S., on speakers)
I've lost the bike and I'm cut-off.
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
CASSIE
But...
BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES pile inside the surprisingly cramped driver's
cab. There's a seat up-front, with another behind a small control
fascia pointing out-back.
DE VRIES hands over her rifle and slides
into the rear.
She flicks on an overhead light.
Taped to one side is
a black-and-white magazine cut-out of a naked male body-builder.
DE VRIES
Nice buns...
She gives the control board a cursory once-over.
GUTTIEREZ calls back
from his vantage point at the doorway.
GUTTIEREZ
Can you handle it?
DE VRIES powers-up the console.
DE VRIES
Piece of cake.
BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
DE VRIES twists on the 'waldo' controls operating the manipulator
hands.
BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
GUTTIEREZ fires a barrage down at the oncoming creatures.
He HOLLERS
back to DE VRIES.
GUTTIEREZ
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
DE VRIES
Couple more seconds!
RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER
The connecting jolt is even greater then before.
Several larger
objects CRASH to the deck.
BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
DE VRIES
That's it!
We've got it!
Get us out of here.
GUTTIEREZ looses one last volley at the ALIENS.
He pulls the cab door
shut, and throws himself into the driver's seat.
GUTTIEREZ
C'mon sweetheart.
Do your stuff...
BIG BERTHA - NIGHT
Big Bertha's heading away from the base into the surrounding trees.
GUTTIEREZ grits his teeth as they plunge towards the high branches.
GUTTIEREZ
Get down!
DE VRIES hits the floor.
The thick boughs impact with the cab,
SHATTERING the safety glass.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CULVERT
HIROKO emerges within an air pocket inside the drain.
She shivers.
It's just as dirty and cramped as she remembers.
Several of the
maintenance lights down here are broken, and visibility is minimal.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
(quietly)
Wha...?
BROKEN TUSK whirls, and clamps a hand across her mouth.
She gets the
message.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR
They exit the culvert through another smashed grate.
HIROKO finds
herself back in the Central Reservoir again.
She wades through the
water behind BROKEN TUSK, holding the spear above her head.
The two of
them look very vulnerable in here.
They pass beneath the PULSATING SAC
HIROKO saw earlier. It looks riper now, ready to burst.
An INSIDIOUS
PULSING NOISE - like a heartbeat - gains in volume the further they
travel.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
They come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by
an enormous pump.
ALIEN gunk covers everything.
HIROKO gasps.
High above it a QUEEN ALIEN, nesting on top of the vast
mechanism.
It's EGG SAC drapes around the pump; spiraling down around
it. She seems to be asleep.
BROKEN TUSK ignores the QUEEN.
His eyes are searching the multitude of
forms - human and otherwise - cocooned into the walls.
He finds what
he's looking for.
Up on one wall is another PREDATOR.
Dead.
It's
stomach blown open.
HIROKO holds her spear tightly.
FACEHUGGERS pulse malignantly, wrapped
around several trapped victims.
A number of empty EGGS are scattered
here-and-there.
BROKEN TUSK looks around.
No ALIENS.
He begins climbing the organic
fresco, watching the QUEEN ALIEN carefully for signs of awareness.
The
bellows-like SOUND of her BREATHING is overwhelming.
He reaches the
entrapped PREDATOR. It's left arm is encased in a solidified mass of
secreted resin.
BROKEN TUSK raises his 'smart weapon' and activates
it.
The SPLINTERING NOISE makes HIROKO wince.
She glances up at the QUEEN.
It's breathing start to change, and it's head moves...
BROKEN TUSK sees it too.
He hesitates for a moment.
The QUEEN
settles, and her breathing goes back to normal.
BROKEN TUSK resumes
his work, chipping off the final chunk of coating.
He sheathes the
'smart weapon', and flips open the other PREDATOR's wrist device.
He
withdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier, and goes to
work...
DOWN BELOW, HIROKO's backing away.
She doesn't see the arm coated in
slime that grasps at her hair.
She shudders, stifling a SCREAM.
Her
eyes are wide as she turns...
It's KAMEN.
He's been embedded into the biomechanical frieze.
When he
speaks, his voice is wracked with pain and suffering.
KAMEN
Hiroko...
HIROKO fearfully says something beneath her breath in JAPANESE.
UP ON THE WALL, BROKEN TUSK has finished his task.
He slides the tip
of a claw across the self-destruct mechanism.
It's readout display
illuminates with alien characters.
He activates a button, and the
readout begins to blink...
BELOW, KAMEN is talking to a sickened HIROKO.
KAMEN (CONT'D)
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.
I
don't...remember what happened next.
HIROKO
What can I do?
KAMEN
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
HIROKO
I... I can't!
KAMEN
You have to...
HIROKO
No!
BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder.
He raises his right arm.
SCHNICK!
The wrist knives slice outwards.
Red blood SPATTERS HIROKO's pale
face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR
BROKEN TUSK pushes HIROKO through the reservoir.
An ALIEN EGG on a
nearby wall PEELS OPEN.
Before the FACEHUGGER even has a chance to
spring, BROKEN TUSK swings his wrist-blades in a wide arc, cutting
through the EGG and it's writhing contents.
The two of them reach the deep end and have to wade.
HIROKO pushes
herself along the biomechanical outcropping.
Ahead of them is the
PULSING SAC. Before they're even passed beneath it, they hear
SOMETHING.
A SOUND like water-filled balloons hitting wet concrete.
The SAC ruptures, spattering thick gloopy matter.
A form comprised of
slender limbs emerges from within.
An IMMATURE QUEEN ALIEN.
Though
just-born, it's reflexes are razor-sharp.
It lashes out at HIROKO and
BROKEN TUSK.
HIROKO ducks, and the QUEEN's claws embed themselves in
BROKEN TUSK's shoulder, destroying his automatic cannon.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
Columns of fire jet from fissures and openings inside the Pump Chamber,
rippling across the adult QUEEN ALIEN and her hapless victims.
She
begins to SCREAM, flailing around atop her metal throne...
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR
The adult QUEEN's SHRIEK echoes through the reservoir, accompanied by a
ball of fire that travels part of the way down.
The IMMATURE QUEEN
turns her head in reply, answering with her own YOWL.
BROKEN TUSK HISSES with hate, and brings his 'smart weapon' SLICING
down through her arm, severing it at the wrist.
HIROKO simultanesouly
DRIVES her spear into the ALIEN's chest.
She grabs the injured
PREDATOR and pulls him away from the thrashing creature.
HIROKO
Come on!
Come on!
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
The alien numbers on the PREDATOR self-destruct readout inexorably
count down...
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO slips into the chopper's pilot seat.
She flips a bunch of
switches and the turbines RISE in VOLUME from a LOW WHINE to a DULL
ROAR.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
The heli-jet flies pretty much like a standard helicopter.
HIROKO
pulls-back on the collective, and the turbines' pitch changes from a
THROATY GROWL to a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO'S P.O.V.
Through the canopy dome, we see BROKEN TUSK climbing
the Navigation Tower, with the ALIENS close behind.
HIROKO
Okay, Butch.
I can play cavalry, too...
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
The third row of digits on the alien destruct mechanism disappear.
Time's running out...fast.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
BROKEN TUSK's P.O.V.
The grinning face of the young QUEEN gets suddenly closer as the heli-
jet is propelled towards the metal structure.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO pushes on the stick.
The heli-jet pulls away...then tilts
violently to one side, engines desperately trying to compensate.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO wrestles the overtaxed controls.
HIROKO
Shit!
BROKEN TUSK turns towards her.
HIROKO (CONT'D)
In the back!
In the back!
The PREDATOR may not understand her words, but he can follow the
frantic jerking of her hand.
He twists around to look in the chopper's
rear.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
BROKEN TUSK pulls out a pulse-rifle from the rear.
He quickly takes
stock of it.
HIROKO
Watch your shots!
If you hit the engine you'll blow us both to hell!
BROKEN TUSK goes for the trigger.
His index finger won't slide into
the trigger guard...it's too big!
He takes the guard in both hands and
exerts pressure.
SNAP.
Problem solved.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
BLEEP!
There's only one set of digits left on the destruct device's
display counter.
RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER
The last segment of the destruct mechanism's display disappears.
We
hear a
HIGH-PITCHED TONE.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO throws the joystick forward.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
Gauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli-jet rides the
turbulence out.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
The heli-jet's bucking like a bronco now, and they're losing height
rapidly.
HIROKO
We've lost the starboard engine!
We're going down!
Hold on!
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls.
The glass cracks with the impact.
HIROKO'S P.O.V.
Leaves, twigs, and branches rush past as the heli-jet breaks through
the canopy of foliage.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
The canopy implodes.
A hail of glass shards RIP through the cockpit,
spraying across HIROKO and cutting her skin.
She SCREAMS.
CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
HIROKO moves her head, and GROANS.
There's a nasty gash across her
forehead. She turns to BROKEN TUSK.
The door frame on his side is
buckled and twisted. Part of the metal has sheared off, it's sharp end
impaling him through the shoulder.
The PREDATOR coughs luminous green
blood.
HIROKO
We've gotta get you out of here.
