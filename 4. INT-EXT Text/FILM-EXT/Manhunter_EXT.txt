The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men
imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK
CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington.
His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white
sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late
thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio-
let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from
a glass of iced tea. Then:
CRAWFORD
I should have caught you at the boat
yard when you got off work. You
don't want to talk about it here...
GRAHAM
I don't want to talk about it
anywhere.
(beat)
If you brought pictures, leave them
in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin
will be back soon.
CRAWFORD
How much do you know?
GRAHAM
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and
the 'Times.'
(beat)
Confessions?
CRAWFORD
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He
smashes the mirrors and uses the
pieces.
(beat)
None of them knew that;
GRAHAM
What else did you keep out of the
papers?
CRAWFORD
Blond, right-handed, really strong,
wears a size eleven shoe. The prints
are all smooth gloves. He's on a
full moon cycle. Both times. His
blood is AB Positive.
GRAHAM
Somebody hurt him?
CRAWFORD
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham.
2.
Graham flips his cigarette into the surf.
CRAWFORD
Will... you saw this in the papers.
The second one was all over TV. Did
you ever think about givin' me a
call?
GRAHAM
No.
CRAWFORD
Why not?
GRAHAM
The Bureau already has the best lab.
Plus you have Bloom at the University
of Chicago...
CRAWFORD
And I got you down here fixing fuckin'
boat motors.
GRAHAM
You don't need me. I wouldn't
be useful to you anymore, Jack.
CRAWFORD
Last two like this we had, you
caught.
GRAHAM
That was three years ago. And by
doing the same things you and the
rest of them at the lab are doing.
CRAWFORD
That's not entirely true, Will.
It's the way you think.
GRAHAM
I think there has been a lot of
bullshit about the way I think.
(beat)
I came down here to get away from
all that.
CRAWFORD
You look all right now.
GRAHAM
I am all right.
Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps
them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this.
3.
CRAWFORD
If you can't look anymore, I
understand...
GRAHAM
As long as they're dead...
CRAWFORD
These are all dead, Will.
PICTURES
If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two
snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck
carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family
behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.
CLOSE: GRAHAM
looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he
puts them down and looks along the beach.
GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN
KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the
water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand.
MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands
watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen
around her ankles. Her body language openly states
hostility. It's towards Crawford.
GRAHAM (O.S.)
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and
eat.
CRAWFORD (O.S.)
I'LL come back later. I got messages
at the Holiday Inn to collect
Molly starts walking forward. On it...
CUT TO:
is working in the sand. Behind him Graham is stapling
chicken wire to two foot-high fence posts.
KEVIN
Will it keep them out?
GRAHAM
Yeah. ..
KEVIN
How many turtle eggs you think are
in here?
GRAHAM
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
KEVIN
Crabs would get most of the newborns
before they made it to the sea, huh?
GRAHAM
Yeah, but not now.. These will all
make it... guaranteed.
CUT TO:
On the porch swing. Beyond them at the water's edge Graham
nothing to each other
the fence. Crawford and Molly say
or a while. Then, finally:
MOLLY
Whatever I say, you'll take him
away, won't you?
CRAWFORD
I have to.
MOLLY
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't
you leave him alone?
CRAWFORD
Because it's his bad luck to be
special.
MOLLY
He thinks you want him to look at
evidence.
6.
CRAWFORD
Nobody's better with evidence. But
he has the other thing, too. He
doesn't like that part of it...
MOLLY
You wouldn't like it, either if you
had it.
There is a pause between them. Molly lights a cigarette.
Crawford leans forward, resting his thick, pale, forearms
on his knees.
CRAWFORD
Talking about 'like,' you don't like
me very much, do you?
MOLLY
No.
(beat)
I don't like people who park in the
'handicapped zone'...
CRAWFROD
I'LL try to keep him as far away from
it as I can...
CUT TO:
Small poplars line the curb. It rained. The sidewalks are
wet. They are drying in splotches. The street is deserted.
The front walk vertically bisects the FRAME. An Atlanta
Police department car pulls to the curb and stops. The door
opens, lighting the interior and Will Graham starts out the
passenger side.
GRAHAM
(distant)
Thanks for the lift.
OFFICER
I'll come inside with you, if you
like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd
probably want to be alone.
GRAHAM
That's right.
OFFTCER
There's a VTR setup waiting in your
hotel room, that you asked for
They transferred the home movies of
both families once half-inch VHS.
7.
GRAHAM
(getting out)
Thanks.
Graham exits the car and walks TOWARDS us. We PAN AROUND as
he moves through EXTREME CLOSEUP and see the Leeds family house
with all of the Atlanta Police department "crime scene" postings
Graham doesn't enter the front door. Be walks around the side.
CUT TO:
The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and
sits on the gritty shingles. We're looking for a distressed
reaction. There is none. Graham is clamped down. Beyond
him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant...
More brilliant than they ought to be. The Delta Aquirid
meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image.
He takes out his tape recorder again.
GRAHAM
There's a wicker dog bed on the back
porch. There's a doghouse in the
back yard. Where's the dog?
HOLD ON Graham.
CUT TO:
coming down the stairs. News media are all over Springfield,
the Commissioner, the Mayor's P.R. Officer in the b.g. No-
body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who
separates himself from the pack and darts up to them. He is
LOUNDS. He starts chasing behind them.
LOUNDS
Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie
Lounds? I covered the Lecter
case for the Tattler. I did the
paperback... !
CLOSE: GRAHAM
walking down the stairs. His face is locked like a steel
trap. He's repressing something powerful.
LOUNDS
(running on, behind
them)
When did they call you in, Will?
What have you got?
Graham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now.
CRAWFORD
Lounds, give it a rest...
LOUNDS
Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!
Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford
tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham:
LOUNDS
How does this guy compare with
Lecter? How does he do them?
Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to
turn him around.
19.
GRAHAM
Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under
him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The
impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The
violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from
Lounds.
GRAHAM
(very low)
Keep the fuck away from me!
Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham
lets go.
WIDER: CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY
down the sidewalk and Lounds who slides off the car hood and
lands on all fours.
CRAWFORD
(over his shoulder
to Lounds)
Get the hell away from here, Lounds!
CUT TO:
INSANE - ENTRANCE - DAY
The DOOR SLAMS open and Graham comes out into daylight and
air. The air is tactile to him. He can almost feel the
motes of dust and light that swim freely. He breathes.
GRAHAM'S POV: GRASS
is dappled with pointillist points of color: a spectral
breakup. As it returns to a normal green...
TIGHT SHOT: GRAHAM
breathes. He stands in front of the sign on the building:
"CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE." He
leans against the railing and breathes clean air. The image
is flattened in a LONG LENS. We hear a CLICK. It FOCUSES
and DE-FOCUSES.
CUT TO:
moves down to us...
MOLLY
approaches in SLOW MOTION raising a bag of shrimp and a six-
pack of Dos Equis.
An image from Bill Owens' "Suburbia." A family house. No
different than any other family house around. But it is
somehow sinister in its vacancy. It ought to be littered
with bicycles and wagons: the signs and symbols of suburban
normalcy. TRACK LEFT to reveal the back of Graham staring at
the house from across the street.
CUT TO:
In a different position staring at the rear of the house from
a neighbor's bushes. We don't know why Graham is staring at
the Jacobi house from different vantage points.
CUT TO:
DAY
Graham looking at the house from the third vantage point.
JACOBI BACKYARD
And turned earth where the cat was found.
REARSHOT: GRAHAM
starts backing up and we MOVE WITH him. He looks over his
shoulder at us and keeps walking backwards. Trees enter the
frame on the left and right.
TRACKING GRAHAM IN PROFILE
He stumbles through underbrush into a dry streambed. He
backs up a slope on the other side and finds himself in some
trees. There are three. Graham looks around.
BRANCHES
now obscure the Jacobi house. Something glints right...
SEARCHING THROUGH GRASS
At the base of one elm tree. A ring tab from a soft drink
can is half-buried in leaves. Graham's fingers move leaves
aside.
41.
GRAHAM
looks slowly up the tree trunk.
RED CREEK MUD
Wedged into the first strong limb, it's from the instep of
a boot.
GRAHAM
hangs his coat on the branch of a neighboring tree and climbs
the far side of the elm. His head and his cheek raise
through limbs. His eye is six inches away when he finds a
soft drink can wedged between limb and trunk.
GRAHAM
I love it. Sweet Jesus, yes come
on, can.
He photographs its placement with the camera on his belt,
bracketing exposures. Then he tears a small branch and uses
it to put the can in an evidence bag. Graham climbs higher
until his foot is level to where he saw the mud. He looks
to his left. Something he sees stops him cold.
A SYMBOL
is carved in the wood.
GRAHAM
photographs this as well as a branch that's been trimmed by
a cutting tool. Then he looks...
OVER GRAHAM'S SHOULDER: THE JACOBI HOUSE
A perfect view.
GRAHAM
high in the tree, leans back against the trunk. Re seems
frozen. Then:
GRAHAM
(mumbling to himself)
... after you killed the cat and
threw it into the yard, my man,
you climbed up hero and waited.
You used a cutting tool on these
branches so you could see.
(MORE)
42.
GRAHAM (CONT'D)
You watched the children and passed
the time whittling and dreaming.
(beat)
When night came, you saw them
passing their bright windows and
you watched the shades go down,
and you saw the lights go out one
by one. And after a while, you
climbed down and you went in to
them, didn't you?
(shouts)
DIDN'T YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH!
YOU WATCHED THEM ALL GODDAMN DAY
LONG! !
(beat)
That's why you like houses with big
yards, the easier to see them
CUT TO:
The door is opened by Geehan and his big smile, shepherding
his customers-to-be out the front door. The smile falls off
Geehan's face. The young buyers look quizzically.
43.
GEEHAN
has deflated against the doorframe.
GEEHAN'S POV: THREE ATLANTA P.D. CARS, A FORENSICS
TRUCK, + ATLANTA P.D. HELICOPTER
with flashers going are converging onto the scene. Will
Graham is at the nearest police car talking on a cellular
phone .
GRAHAM
I'm sending the can to Jimmie
Price to dust for prints.
(fast beat)
I need Bowman in Documents to fall
on this carving. Then I need the
Firearms and Toolmarks Section out
here on the severed branch. I
need to know what kind of cutting
tool he used.
CUT TO:
GRAHAM
Who did he ask for?
CBAWFORD (V.O.)
You.
CUT TO:
Running. He slips on the polished floor, recovers himself
... He darts through Crawford's door.
CUT TO:
grabs for the phone.
LOUNDS
Will, listen...
CUT TO:
As Molly comes out of the house, we PULL BACK and CRANE UP
INTO a very HIGH ANGLE WIDE SHOT revealing: Four state
trooper cars parked on Graham's property. On the road are
two roadblocks 100 yards apart on either side of Graham's
house. All their flashers are going. Molly looks around in
confusion. We see her turn to the sea, a coast guard launch
pulls to 100 yards off the beach. Its searchlight plays on
the water's edge then across the property. Molly look; at
all the policemen...
CUT TO:
65.
advances on us, its engine screaming. Its front wheel brakes
to a stop right before CAMERA.
DOOR
opens. Running down the stairs and across the tarmac is
Will Graham in shirtsleeves with a Car-15 assault rifle with
collapsible stock. His eyes scan the perimeter.
FBI MEN
moving fast, follow Graham. Their eyes sweep the terminal area.
One carries an Uzi submachine gun, the other two, handguns.
A CORDON OF FLORIDA STATE TROOPERS
hussle Molly and Kevin between them from their cars towards
Graham. Two carry suitcases.
GRAHAM + MOLLY + KEVIN
inside the protective barrier of men.
HIGH ANGLE: THE AIRPORT
Graham moves Molly and Kevin up into the Gulf Stream. FBI
men follow. The troopers back off. The flashers on their
cars are still turning. PAN RIGHT with the Gulf Stream as
it taxis to the head of the runway. It pauses a moment, then
blasts down the runway and up into the morning sun.
CUT TO:
MOLLY - NIGHT
Beyond is Chesapeake Bay and the nightlights of Baltimore
reflecting across it. The swimming float bobs in the
distance. One yellow light is on it.
FRONTAL: MOLLY + GRAHAM.
The grass looks cold in the moonlight. Holly wears a heavy
cardigan.
70.
Behind them -- with yellow lights -- the house looks like
a motel.
MOLLY
It's hard to have anything, isn't it?
Rare to get it, hard to keep it. This
is a damn slippery planet.
When she said this she was staring out to sea. Now she turns
to look at Graham and puts a hand on his arm. He still stares
out to sea:
GRAHAM
Slick as hell.
Then Graham looks at her and covers her hand with his own.
MOLLY
You remember when we first met?
And were together alone in that
room. And the exhilaration was
too much to hold on to. And then
something flickered across your
face like a shadow and I asked you
what was wrong?
GRAHAM
I remember.
MOLLY
Do you remember what you said?
GRAHAM
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
Molly stares into his eyes.
MOLLY
Time is luck, Will.
(heat )
I know the value of our days...
They stare into each other. There's a pause. They rise.
She puts her arm around Graham's waist. They start towards
the house.
MOLLY
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
CUT TO:
7:30 PM
SPURGEN, chief SWAT instructor from Quantico, examines the
parking lot. We've cut in mid-dialogue.
SPURGEN
...if he's smart he'll approach
from the front, pass, and take you
from the back. How well do you
hear?
GRAHAM
Pretty well.
SPURGEN
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets.
It'll be invisible in this light,
but you'll stand out like a zebra
for us.
(beat)
They told me you checked out a .44
Charter Arms Bulldog.
GI(AHAM
Yes .
SPURGEN
Good. You'll load these, Ever
fire them?
Spurgen hands Graham a glycine envelope containing 25 rounds
of .44 Special ammunition.
GRAHAM EXAMINES ONE ROUND
Instead of a lead bullet, there's a matte-black, blunt-nosed
cylinder .
76.
GRAHAM
Glaser Safety Slugs?
SPURGEN
(nods )
... commercially prohibited.
(beat)
Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon
in a copper casing. On impact it
all opens up in the target. Expect
the recoil. They're hot loads.
Body armor?
GRAHAM
Kevlar Second Chance.
SPURGEN
I hope you have a second chance...
GRAHAM
Because he's gone for the head shot
seven out of eight times'
SPURGEN
You got it.
GRAHAM
Let's walk the route.
As they start across the parking lot:
CUT TO:
NIGHT
pulls into the prescribed space. It's raining. He kills the
engine and gets out.
HIGH ANGLE: GRAHAM
exiting the car. The image is in GREEN AND BLACK. We are:
behind the balustrade in a prone firing position sighting
through a heavy-barrelled Heckler and Koch Model 93 with a
Startron scope.
78.
A SECOND HIGH ANGLE: GRAHAM
also in GREEN AND BLACK. Reveal we are:
with the same rifle sweeping the parking lot. He reacts to
something to his left.
GRAHAM
... walking along the determined line, fifty yards from the
apartment building.., hears something through the delicate
patter of the rain.
GRAHAM'S POV: CORNER OF BUILDING
A distant "plop-plop-plop" of running feet...
GRAHAM'S
eyes tighten.
CORNER OF BUILDING
HOLD. Then entering around the corner is a running MAN.
He's 6'2". He's heavy and wears a running suit with the
hood up. His face is lost in its shadow.
RUNNER'S RIGHT HAND
is gloved and slips into the pocket of his jacket, grasping
something...
RUNNER'S FEET ACROSS WET BLACK TARMAC
splash through shallow puddles.
GRAHAM'S FACE
in anticipation. The foot beats are getting LOUDER...
GBAHAM'S EYES
like taut wire about to snap.
79.
WIDE PROFILE:
GRAHAM
on the left.
The Runner enters on the right. In SLOW MOTION
as they cross, Graham slams him sideways...
RUNNER
is knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side
of a car. He comes off the car violently, to turn, to
fight ...
.44 BULLDOG
comes up.., pressure on the trigger.
RUNNER'S HEAD
turns INTO CAMERA. He is a black man with a moustache and
scared eyes staring into the .44. His hands shoot into the
air:
RUNNER (MAN)
Yo, boss. Plastic and cash in the
right pocket...!
GRAHAM
(re the mistake)
God-dammit!!!
Walking away, Graham rips off his jacket: and the Kevlar vest.
Coming off the expectation of contact, Graham is explosive.
The Runner looks at Graham as if he's crazy: Spurgen and two
D.C. cops are running in.
RUNNER
Arrest dat sucker...!
Crawford catches up to Graham:
CRAWFORD
You okay?
Graham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest
across the parking lot. He almost killed the man. Meanwhile,
Spurgen is with the Runner.
SPURGEN
It was a mistake . Sorry we...
RUNNER
'Sorry' yo' mama!!
Runner pissed off -- starts towards Graham. Spurgen stops
him.
80.
SPURGEN
Hold on! We thought you were
someone we're trying to catch...
RUNNER
(backs up)
Hold onto this!!
(grabs his groin)
I get dat cannon stuck up mah
face?! Car dirt splattered up
and down mah Calvin Kleins?!
'Catch somebody?!' You couldn't
catch yo' ass with yo' right hand!
You lucky you muther-fuckers catch
a cold! Who the hell goin' pay my
cleanin' bill? Huh?
HUGE LAUGHTER which is coming from...
CUT TO:
Dollarhyde's van is on the left against the wall. The alley
is empty. Then we see shapes between the van and the wall.
CLOSER: OVER LOUNDS' RIGHT SHOULDER
We do not see his face. We see his shoulder and his lap.
From an unseen facial wound, blood drips onto his pants' leg.
Dollarhyde starts spilling liquid on Lounds. Lounds starts
to moan and rouse from unconsciousness. His head starts to
turn. He knows he's going to die. And he has some courage.
87.
LOUNDS
Go 'head and kill 'ee, you 'astard!
You rot in 'ell. rot in 'ell!
CUT TO:
slams open. Dollarhyde stops in the door frame.
REBA (O.S.)
Is that you. D?
101.
DOLLARHYDE
Yes, are you okay...?!
REBA (O.S.)
I'm fine.
REBA
In her cotton dress. The prairie wind blows her hair and
presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown
weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard.
DOLLARHYDE
nears her, towers above her. He touches her face. Reba folds
into his arms and lays her head on his hard chest. His heart
is going fast. He doesn't believe this fine thing is happen-
ing to him and that she's okay.
REBA
Good morning...
(kisses his cheek)
If you show me where things are,
I'll make us some coffee...
DOLLARHYDE
No! Don't go back into the house...
(to Reba's quizzical
reaction)
it's too nice outside.
REBA
My sister's coming by to pick me up
for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
DOLLARHYDE
I have work to do at the plant.
REBA
I'll get my purse.
DOLLARHYDE
I'll get it.
(leaving)
Stay right here. You lock very good
in the sun...
CUT TO:
He's heavy-set and sullen. Dollarhyde's van, with Reba, pulls
in.
102.
DOLLARHYDE
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
REBA
I'm fine, Francis.
Dollarhyde gets out.
DOLLARHYDE
Fill it up and check the oil, please.
Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the
nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood,
draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout
into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he
starts to move around the van he sees something in the
interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't
know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He
wipes and wipes the same spot.
REBA'S
dress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat.
Her legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats.
From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can
look up her dress. He bends down a little to see better...
MEN'S ROOM DOOR
Nothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel
and throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the
backside of the van.
DRIVER'S WINDOW
Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on
the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing...
ATTENDANT
unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same
spot in front of Reba.
DOLLARHYDE
is coming around the van. Fast.
DOLLARHYDE
You sonofabitch...
103.
ATTENDANT
(cocky)
You don't like it? You know what
you can do about it...
Attendant starts away. Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him
into and through a display of STP. The Attendant bounces once
and slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away...
Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it.
REBA'S FACE
through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to
roll down the window.
ATTENDANT
is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has
never seen before, anywhere.
DOLLARHYDE
pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He
advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end
of the spout.
ATTENDANT
is wide-eyed. Dollarhyde's big hand ENTERS and flattens the
man into the wall, compressing his thorax.
DOLLARHYDE
I ought to jam this in your chest,
and drain your heart...
The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk.
Dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. He hesitates. Then
he throws money at the Attendant and leaves...
CUT TO:
NIGHT
He sits under the tree with the lights out. He is waiting.
Watching. He looks at his watch. Then he hears a car
approach and looks up.
DOLLARHYDE'S POV: GREEN OLDSMOBILE
pulls into Reba's drive.
Normal reality. There was no, there is no seduction. No
contact.
REBA
What was it?
DANDRIDGE
Pollen .
REBA
Thanks for the ride.
DANDRIDGE
See you tomorrow.
Reba walks into her apartment
112.
RALPH DANDRIDGE
walks back to his car. We are TRACKING WITH Dandridge walk-
ing past the hedges. An arm shoots out and turns Dandridge.
Dollarhyde's hand clutches the whole of Dandridge's lower
face from underneath his jaw. He starts crushing Dandridge's
face. THREE soft POPS are from Dollarhyde's nine millimeter.
He shot Dandridge three times in the heart.
CUT TO:
The Gulf Stream approaches and races past us at its cruising
speed of 585 mph. As it leaves the frame, the image we're
left with is the moon. It looms large and white 30 degrees
above the horizon and rising into a starry sky,
CUT TO:
streaks TOWARDS US down the almost deserted highway.
CUT TO:
running towards the house through the trees. Branches
slap at them. Ahead, the orchard will parallel the house.
They can get to within 25 yards using the trees as cover.
CRAWFORD
(into radio)
Get the roadblocks set on Route
Three! There's an access road to
the back of the house. That ought
to be a second team's approach.
Will Graham and I are in an orchard
due west of the house.
GRAHAM
How far away's the back-up?
CRAWFORD
Three minutes.
Graham gestures Crawford to a position with a front 3/4 view
of the house.
GRAHAM
I'll cover the back.
CRAWFORD
Stay in the trees.
As we TRACK with Graham through the trees towards the back,
beyond him we see the side yard and the side windows moving
past. The windows are large. At the back -- like a ramp --
are two storm cellar doors.
127 .
FRONTAL: GRAHAM
in the dark shadows of the trees. He seems to float: through
the branches and slows and settles quietly. Then the ex-
pression on Will Graham's face starts to change...
GRAHAM'S POV: KITCHEN WINDOW
Shadows. A light comes on. Then the figure of Reba is
swung out of a corner past the window...
GRAHAM
(resigned whisper
into radio)
There's somebody in the house, Jack
CRAWFORD (O.S.)
(radio filter)
Wait for the back-up! Will?
GRAHAM
(whispers in radio)
It's happening again, Jack...
CUT TO:
As we PULL BACK and see arriving squad car flashers play on
the walls and Crawford runs through the foreground, we see
Graham point the gun down to Dollarhyde's head. As we're
pulling away comes the final FLASH + REPORT and...
CUT TO:
129.
-- in the MIDDLE of the FRAME -- walks down the sidewalk
away from us towards the waiting cab. The rain pelts his
black hat and black raincoat. 'Before he reaches the cab...
CUT TO:
sitting with his back to us. Beyond him the sun reflects
off the crashing surf and burns out everything except the
silhouetted image of Graham.
GRAHAM IS WATCHING
the fenced-in area of beach he and Kevin built at the opening
of the film. A baby tortoise crawls over sand mountains and
is swept away by surf into the life-supporting sea.
CLOSE: GRAHAM
drinks a beer.
He senses a presence and starts to turn...
WIDE REAR SHOT:
BEACH + CRAHAM
turns towards us. Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Her coat is
under her arm. She drops it and her flight Sag in the sand
and continues walking to Graham.
134.
GRAHAM
stands as she comes near him. The aqua highlights of the
water eat into their figures as they look at each other.
Molly touches the wounded side of his face. Then:
MOLLY
Let's forget who said what to whom...
GRAHAM
You got a deal...
Graham takes Molly's hand.
WATER'S EDGE
Molly and Graham walk to the water's edge and look out to sea.
The highlights burn out sections of the two people.
MOLLY
