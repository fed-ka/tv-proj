          EXT. URBAN STREET / ALLEY. NIGHT 1 (19.05)11

          We establish on the town twinkling at night. 


          EXT. URBAN STREET / ALLEY. NIGHT 1 (19.05)1A1A

          It s dark. Very dark. SARAH, wearing a scarf, shines a 
          torch around a street. 

                                            SARAH
                          I know you think this is ridiculous. But 
                        I - saw it - Neil. 

          She points a torch one way. She points a torch another. 

          She turns a blind corner and turns left and right.

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                          Because they re coming Neil, I ve seen 
                        it.  

          SARAH frowns. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                          HinkleyWay Shopping Centre - meet me 
                          there.   

          She hears the noise of a bin clattering. She points a 
          torch towards it. 

          Her torch hits a person. Crouched in the dark. He looks a 
          mess. It s POLUS. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                          Hello?

          There is liquid all around him. It could be blood, it 
          could be rust. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        Neil. Hang on...

          She takes the phone from her ear but doesn t disconnect. 

          She looks again at POLUS. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        You OK?

          She approaches. 

          There is a sound. It s a sound we re going to hear a lot 
          of. The sound of something breathing without a throat. A 
          sound akin to a fish dying in the open air.                     THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  2



                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        Are you... hurt? 


            POLUS  eyes are revealed - they burn amber. 

                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        Can you...

          Suddenly POLUS turns and lunges straight at her. 

          There isn t even time for SARAH to scream. 

          The phone spins out of her hand and across the floor and 
          we spin with it. 

          We close on the phone. 

                                            NEIL (O.S.)
                          Sarah... Sarah... SARAH!

          And from that shout we crash into titles.

          INT. DR TREMLETT S OFFICE. NIGHT 1 (19.05)33

          Close on the face of PAUL, 17, and with eyes to die for. 
          He sits uncomfortably for a moment, and then shifts.

                                          DR TREMLETT (O.S.)
                        So how s college?

          We pull back and he s sitting in a large psychiatrist s 
          office. The office is somehow too big. Too long. It s lit 
          like a Frank Lloyd Wright museum exhibit. It feels odd. 

          The clock is ticking. PAUL is picking at his nails. DR 
          TREMLETT is watching him. 

          The clock s ticks are the loudest things in the room. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. Fine. 

          Tick. Tick. Tick. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        How s the target setting going?                    THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  3



                                            PAUL
                        Fine. 

          Tick. Tick. Tick. PAUL looks up at DR TREMLETT, who is 
          looking at his fingers. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        Your Mum said you ve been having your 
                          dreams again...

          PAUL says nothing. Tick. Tick. Tick. 

                                          DR TREMLETT (CONT D)
                        Do you want to talk about them?

                                            PAUL
                        Isn t talking about dreams boring? 

          TREMLETT smiles at PAUL. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        It can be. But I m interested. 

          PAUL turns and looks at DR TREMLETT

                                            PAUL
                        OK. Well. I was in a car, and I was 
                          driving these people - this family - they 
                        were all fat I remember - this fat family 
                        - and then one by one this fat family 
                        they turned into penguins - and then I 
                          couldn t find the fish to feed them and 
                        the car s air-conditioning was drying 
                        their skin. So they slowly died and then - 
                          rotted. 

          DR TREMLETT looks at PAUL - appraising. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        Paul. I m not here to trick you, OK?

          PAUL turns and looks back at him. Suddenly slightly 
            emotional. 

                                            PAUL
                          I don t want to talk about my dreams. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                          Understood. 

          PAUL controls himself. 

                                          DR TREMLETT (CONT D)
                        So what do you want to do?                    THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  4



                                            PAUL
                          I want to know if... I want to know 
                          whether...

          He stands and walks to the window. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                          I want to know - what does madness look 
                        like?

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        Paul, you know I don t like that word and 
                          you re not mad...

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah? I really hope you re right.  

          Tick. Tick. Tick. We close in on PAUL s face. We go super-
            tight. 


          EXT. STREET. NIGHT 1 (19.10)44

          PAUL enters the street and heads toward MAC, 17, geeky, 
          but with eyebrows you want to love. He doesn t look at 
          him.  

                                            PAUL
                        Beep. Beep. 

          MAC smiles at his passing friend. 

                                          MAC
                        Just so you know, I m not your dog. 

          PAUL gets on his bike. 

                                            PAUL
                          I know. 

          MAC picks up his bike. 

                                          MAC
                        Apart from in the American sense. I d be 
                        your  dawg - you know, your d-a-w-g. If 
                        you asked me nicely. 

                                            PAUL
                        I ll keep you in mind.  

                                          MAC
                        Brap. 

          MAC grins. PAUL starts to ride. MAC rides after him.   

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Still crazy?                    THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  5



                                            PAUL
                        Still crazy. 

          We watch from the back of them. 

                                          MAC
                        Good to know. 

                                            PAUL
                          Always good to know. 

          We watch them ride off together. Music begins to play. 


          EXT. ABANDONED SHOPPING CENTRE - GATES. NIGHT 1 (19.15)55

          They ride their bikes through dirty grass under 
            fluorescent lights. 

          MAC fucksaround a bit. PAUL is steadier. 


66EXT. ABANDONED SHOPPING CENTRE - CAR PARK. NIGHT 1 
          (19.15)

          They wind their way up and across the car park roof. 


77EXT. ABANDONED SHOPPING CENTRE - ENTRANCE. NIGHT 1 
          (19.16)

          MAC is trying to pry the boards open on the shopping 
            centre fixed entrance. 

          PAUL is holding the bikes. 

                                            PAUL
                        This is a bad idea. 

                                          MAC
                          Correction: This is a good idea with bad 
                          possibilities. 

                                            PAUL
                          ...What does that even...?

                                          MAC
                          Besides, you promised. It s my turn. 

                                            PAUL
                         You promised. It s my turn.  

                                          MAC
                         Neo, sooner or later you're going to 
                          realize just as I did that there's a 
                          difference between knowing the path and 
                          walking the path.                     THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  6



          The board is pried apart. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        We re in. 

          MAC enters. PAUL hesitates. Looks around. 


88INT. ABANDONED SHOPPING CENTRE - UPPER FLOOR / LOWER 
            FLOOR. NIGHT 1 (19.16)

          MAC steps into the gloom of a cathedral like deserted 
          shopping centre.  

                                          MAC
                        You see? What s not to like? 

                                            PAUL
                          Remind me what we re looking for again?

                                          MAC
                        Used junkie needles. I want to see if I 
                        can suck the dirty heroin out. 

          PAUL stops by a dead bird. On the floor. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        We re looking for film props, OK? For my 
                          horror. Shapes. Strange things. 
                          Cybernetic Organisms, Titanium 
                          rechargers, Ectoplasmic residue. Anything 
                        that can be - 

          MAC realisesPAUL isn t listening. 

          PAUL bends in really close, and picks up a stick and uses 
          it to unfurl the dead bird s wing. 

                                          MAC (O.S.) (CONT D)
                          You ve found a dead thing. Well done. 

          MAC has approached behind PAUL, who turns to look at his 
          friend. 

                                            PAUL
                        It must have got trapped in here. 

                                          MAC
                                    (laugh)
                        I ll cook it, if you eat it. 

          MAC picks up and pokes at the bird with a stick. 

                                            PAUL
                        It s a thrush. And don t poke it too 
                        hard, it could still be alive.                     THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  7



          MAC pokes it hard. The bird doesn t move. MAC laughs. 

                                          MAC
                        You pick it up I ll let you throw it at 
                        me. No dibs, nothing. A total freebie. 
                        But you ve got to pick it up. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. We re definitely too old for that. 

          MAC looks at his friend and smiles. 

                                          MAC
                        OK. If I pick it up, can I throw it at 
                        you?

                                            PAUL
                                    (laugh)
                          Fuckoff. 

          MAC bends and PAUL moves away quickly, laughing. 

          MAC picks the bird up and then instantly drops it 
            hollering. His hands are covered in blood and grime. He s 
          gone straight through the skin into the bird s fleshy 
          innards. That bird died a bloody death. 

                                          MAC
                        SHIT!

          PAUL laughs. MAC looks at his hands, quite traumatised.  

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Look at - oh the - oops - 

          PAUL cycles away from MAC, who thinks about staying 
            traumatised, before deciding to hare it after his friend 
          instead. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        I m going to wipe this shitall-over your 
                        hair you know that?

          PAUL laughs hard as he cycles away. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                          You re in trouble now boy.

          MAC grabs his bike to follow. But the chain has come off. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        No. No. Shit. 

          He kicks his bike. 

          Back to PAUL who is cycling like his life depends on it 
          and having a great time.                      THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  8



          He looks back, then forward again: he s heading toward an *
            escalator too fast to stop.The best he can do is hang on *
          for dear life and try to maintain control.*

                                            PAUL*
                        Shit! Shit! Shit!*

          He s almost made it all the way when his bike goes from *
          under him and he goes arseover tit, tumbling down. *


99INT. ABANDONED SHOPPING CENTRE - LOWER FLOOR. NIGHT 1 
          (19.18)

          PAUL lands hard. 

          Ow. His bike is buckled. He is hurt. He looks at his 
          hands and his arm. He s badly scraped himself. His eyes 
          fill with tears, but like a good teenage boy he blinks 
          them back. 

          He touches his arm tenderly. 

                                            PAUL
                        Shit.

          And then he stands and starts brushing his knees and 
          clothes down. Then, suddenly, he stops - 

          There s a man pointing a gun at him. 

                                            NEIL
                          Friend... Are you a friend?

                                            PAUL
                        What?

                                            NEIL
                          Where s Sarah? I m looking for Sarah. 

                                            PAUL
                        Who?

                                            NEIL
                          I will shoot. 

                                            PAUL
                        Why?

          NEIL lifts his gun and shoots. PAUL ducks. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                          Jesus!

          PAUL is very scared and slightly - pissedoff.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  8A



                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                        I m not even supposed to be here. It was 
                        my friend s idea of a fun night out. 

          NEIL looks at him for another second.                     THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  9



                                            NEIL
                        Who are you?

          Then a body comes crashing down from the skylight behind 
          them. Crash. Bang. Glass and debris surround it. 

          It lands with a slight thud and crunch. It s SARAH. 

                                            PAUL
                        Shit. 

          NEIL looks at the body. Then up at PAUL.  

          Then around the top of the shopping centre a figure flits 
          by. 

          And another. NEIL notices. He grimaces. 

                                            NEIL
                        Run. 

                                            PAUL
                        What?

                                            NEIL
                        Run. 

          NEIL turns and runs. 

          PAUL thinks, bends, picks up a bullet casing at his feet - 
          looks at it. And then runs hard after NEIL. 


1010INT. ABANDONED SHOPPING CENTRE - TOP CORRIDOR. NIGHT 1 
          (19.20)

          NEIL runs quickly. He now has SARAH on his back. 

          He notices running shapes on the walls behind him. There 
          are shadows. There is kinetic movement. This is scary. 

          He hits a dead end. He looks back. 

          There is something lit in the far distance. A shadow. A 
            shape. Something. 

          The shape moves towards NEIL. It s got a strange sort of 
            loping movement. It may be a young FADE GIRL (in fact it 
          is, we ll meet her later), but it s too far away for us 
          to see. 

          NEIL lifts his gun and shoots again. Once. Twice. Three 
            times. And then the gun jams. And the shape keeps moving. 

          NEIL looks around for somewhere to escape to. There is 
          nowhere.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  10



          NEIL puts SARAH down, he faces the shape, he readies 
          himself for attack. 

                                            NEIL
                          Come-on. Come-on. 

          Bang. Suddenly NEIL s attacked not from the front but by 
            a blur from behind him. He is sent hard to the ground. 

          And the thing that s landed on NEIL. It s extraordinary. 
          His flesh looks rotten. His face the same yellowish black 
          and white. It s POLUS. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        You can - touch now - ?

          There is a splash and dash of kinetic movement as NEIL 
          and POLUS struggle with each other. First it looks like 
          NEIL will get the upper hand. But slowly inevitably POLUS 
          gains control. NEIL is pinned to the floor. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        No... No...

          NEIL looks up and sideways and all around, there is no 
          escape. 

          And then he sees something which surprises him even more. 
          He sees PAUL. And sees PAUL can see them. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        How can you - ?

          POLUS extends his tongue - and hangs it on NEIL s 
          eyeball. He licks it slightly. NEIL s eyeball clouds over 
            milky.  

          NEIL screams. POLUS opens his mouth and makes a sound 
          like hell. 


1111INT. ABANDONED SUPERMARKET - TOP CORRIDOR. NIGHT 1 
          (19.21)

          His eyes filled with tears, PAUL slowly tries to 
            disappear. There s only one problem - he can t. 

          He tries not to listen as NEIL continues to scream. 

          This is horrific. 


          INT. MARK S HOUSE - HALLWAY. NIGHT 1  (21.50)1212

          MARK opens the door and falls through it. He is kissing 
          VICKY rabidly. She s hot.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  11



          They keep kissing - and fall against the stairs. He 
            almost pulls her top off her. 

                                            VICKY
                          Careful. This is new. 

          She breaks off. They breath heavily. They re both pissed. 
          She takes off her top. He takes off his. 

                                            VICKY (CONT D)
                          What s your name again?

                                            MARK
                        Mark. 

                                            VICKY
                        And do you do this a lot Mark?

                                            MARK
                        What?

                                            VICKY
                        Pick up random strangers in bars and take 
                        them home with you...

          MARK thinks and then grins. 

                                            MARK
                        Yeah. Quite a lot. 

          VICKY laughs. Then takes a small baggiefrom her pocket. 
          And puts a pill on her tongue. 

                                            VICKY
                        Are you a bad man Mark?

                                            MARK
                        I can be. 

          They kiss deeply. Ingesting the pill. VICKY dislocates 
          and laughs again. 

                                            VICKY
                          Where s the bedroom?

                                            MARK
                        Top of the stairs. Second left. 

          VICKY smiles at him. 

          She walks up the stairs. She kicks off her shoes as she 
          does. She takes knickers off from beneath her skirt. 
          She s less good at this than she d like to be. She 
          stumbles slightly, she s pissed. She dangles her knickers 
          in her hand as she continues. MARK grins and takes of his 
          jeans as he stumbles up the stairs after her.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  12



          She walks into the door on the first left. 

                                            MARK (CONT D)
                        No. Not there. 

          But he s too late. 


          INT. MARK S HOUSE - SARAH S ROOM. NIGHT 1 (21.51)1313

          She turns on the light and walks in. She drops her 
          knickers on the floor with a theatricality.  

                                            VICKY
                          Matadors - ready. 

          It s a normal looking room. A bed sits in the middle of 
          it. 

                                            MARK
                        No... No...

          MARK charges in after her - his jeans half on, half off. 
          He s angry. 

                                            VICKY
                          Jesus. OK tiger. What is it? 

                                            MARK
                          I told you...  

                                            VICKY
                        What?

                                            MARK
                          Just... This is my wife s room. 

          VICKY stops everything.  

                                            VICKY
                          Right. 

                                            MARK
                        Well. I say wife. I mean - only in the 
                        most technical sense - we re separated. 

                                            VICKY
                        But you live together?

                                            MARK
                          Again. Only technically. The mortgage 
                          payments were too much for only one of us 
                        to handle alone. It s just - it can get - 
                          tricky. 

          VICKY approaches a picture. She looks at it. MARK 
          watches.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  13



                                            MARK (CONT D)
                          I mean, I knew she d be out - and she s 
                        fine with me having sex. We re only 
                          technically - technically - 

          He thinks and deflates slightly. 

                                            MARK (CONT D)
                          I just didn t want you - in here. 

                                            VICKY
                        This her? 

          It s a picture of SARAH. Outside, having fun. With her 
          hands in the air. 

                                            MARK
                        Yeah. 

          She looks over a few more photos. 

                                            VICKY
                          You re in none of them. 

                                            MARK
                        There might be one or two. 

          VICKY turns and looks at MARK. 

                                            VICKY
                        She s pretty. 

                                            MARK
                        Yeah.

                                            VICKY
                        And I m going to go now. 

                                            MARK
                        Yeah. 

                                            VICKY
                        Few too many - technicalities - for a 
                        quick shag on a night out, you know...?

          MARK looks back at the photograph of his wife. We look at 
          it too. 

                                            MARK (O.S.)
                        Yeah. I know. 


          EXT. NEIL S CARAVAN. NIGHT 1 (21.55)13A13A

          NEIL carries SARAH toward the caravan.                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  14



          INT. NEIL'S CARAVAN - BEDROOM. NIGHT 1 (21.55)1414

          NEIL carries SARAH into the room and puts her down softly 
          on the unmade skankylooking bed. There are clothes and 
          books everywhere. This is a guy who doesn t do tidy, or 
            clean. 

          NEIL turns on a calor gas lamp - his eye comes into 
            focus, it s bleeding profusely. But he s not 
            concentrating on that, he s concentrating on SARAH. 

                                            SARAH
                          There s ash. There s ash everywhere. And 
                          bodies all around...

          NEIL looks at the blood and takes out his phone. He gets 
          an answerphonemessage. 

                                            NEIL
                          Helen? Answer the phone... Sarah s 
                          hurt... they hurt her... Helen?

          NEIL exits the room. 

                                            SARAH
                        And I m alone.

          EXT. APOCALYPSE. VISION. DAY X1616

            SARAH, stands alone in a world of... ash. Music plays - a 
          driving rhythm with an ethereal quality. 

          Ash flakes fall from the sky like snow. SARAH looks up at 
          them and scans the sky. 

          She puts her hand up to catch a piece of ash and the 
            images seem to slow as she does. 

          We close in on SARAH S face. She frowns, confused. 


          INT. NEIL'S CARAVAN - BEDROOM. NIGHT 1 (21.56)1717

                                            SARAH
                        And I feel... I feel...

          NEIL re-enters carrying a drip. He attaches it messily to 
          the curtain rail above the bed. He tries to find a vein 
          in SARAH s arm.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  15



                                            SARAH (CONT D)
                        Don t you see? This proves it. My visions 
                        were right. Do you hear me Neil? The 
                          future. It s ash. Everybody dies. 
                          Everybody s dead. You re in so much 
                          danger. We all are.  

          NEIL slaps her arm repeatedly. Deeply exasperated. 

                                            NEIL
                          I can t find... I can t find a vein... 
                        What did he do to you?


          EXT. APOCALYPSE. VISION. DAY X1818

          SARAH is alone, stumbling some more, unsure again. 


          INT. NEIL'S CARAVAN - BEDROOM. NIGHT 1 (21.57)1919

          SARAH coughs again. Blood comes out, she touches it, she 
          knows what it is. Her face crunches like a little girl. 

                                            SARAH
                        He s changing Neil. He s evolving. He s 
                          getting stronger. And he will lead other 
                          people through. 

                                            NEIL
                          I knew you shouldn t have been out alone. 

          Suddenly she reaches out and grabs NEIL s face she pulls 
          him closer towards her. 

                                            SARAH
                        You tell Mark. You tell Mark. I loved 
                        him. I always - loved him. 

          She coughs blood again, some lands on NEIL s face, some 
          lands on the dirty pillow beneath her. 

                                            NEIL
                          Sarah. Save your strength. 

                                            SARAH
                        The Fades are coming. It s inevitable. I 
                        can see it now. The world is... dying. 
                        All that mattered was Mark. And I wish 
                        I d known that - before. I don t want to - 

          SARAH falls back and away. Her face achieves a restful 
            state. She s dead. 

                                            NEIL
                          Sarah... Sarah...?                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  16



          He checks her pulse. He half climbs over her. He checks 
          her breath. He checks her pulse again. He knows. 

          NEIL slumps, his head in his hands, her corpse behind him 
          on his own bed. 


          EXT. APOCALYPSE. VISION. DAY X2020

          PAUL stands in a world of ash just like the one SARAH was 
          just in. 

          A world of just ash. And he s alone in it. 

          Ash flakes fall from the sky like snow. 

          He frowns and puts his hand up to catch one. 


          INT. PAUL S HOUSE - BEDROOM/LANDING. DAY 2 (08.11)2121

          PAUL wakes with a start. He quickly realiseshe s wet 
          his bed. He moves out of the way and looks at the patch 
          with scorn. 

          He gets up angrily, pulls his pyjama bottoms off, wipes 
          down his legs with them, pulls on a pair of tracky
          bottoms, and begins to change his bed things. 

          MEG, early-40s, bouncy, enters the room joyfully. Well, 
          as joyful as you get when you re trying to be sweet to 
          your mixed-up teenage son. 

                                          MEG
                          Morning love. 

          She notices the bed things. 

                                          MEG (CONT D)
                        Oh...

          PAUL says nothing. MEG attempts to help him. He 
            shoulders her off. 

                                            PAUL
                        I got it Mum, OK...

          MEG tries to help again. 

                                          MEG
                        No. You don t...

                                            PAUL
                        Mum. 

          She takes a step back, trying hard to maintain her 
            smile.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  17



                                          MEG
                          Nothing to be ashamed of. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah, it is...

                                          MEG
                        No. It isn t. Now, do you remember 
                        what the dream was about - 

            PAUL s smile fades. 

                                            PAUL
                        Who said it was a dream? 

                                          MEG
                        Dr Tremlett -

          PAUL blanches at the mention of that name. He pulls on 
          a top and some other clothes. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mum, I m not a kid anymore, OK? I m not 
                        your boy. I m trying to be - a man. 

          MEG laughs. And then immediately regrets it. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                          Thanks. 

                                          MEG
                        No. No. It s just the way you said it - 
                        it was funny - of course you re a man. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. 

          PAUL steams out of the room, leaving his Mum with the 
          dirty sheets. 

                                          MEG
                          Paul... PAUL!


          INT. PAUL S HOUSE - STAIRS. DAY 2 (08.12)2222

          PAUL charges down the stairs past his sister ANNA, who 
          is ascending in the opposite direction. Holding her 
          nails up as if to dry them. 

          PAUL runs through her hands. 

                                            ANNA
                        Ow! Don t. You ve ruined... These 
                        nails are new and all monkeybreath...

          PAUL has gone.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  18



                                            ANNA (CONT D)
                          Paul... PAUL!

          MEG appears at the top of the stairs. Carrying PAUL s 
          damp sheets. 

                                          MEG
                        Leave him be. 

                                            ANNA
                          I think he s cracked a nail.

          MEG listens to the door to the kitchen slam (PAUL), 
            slumps and says nothing... ANNA looks up at her Mum. 

                                          MEG
                          I just - I don t know what s going on 
                        with him.

                                            ANNA
                        It s called being a teenage boy - but 
                        he should be wanking, not pissing.

          She looks again at her nails - annoyed.

                                            ANNA (CONT D)
                          You re going to have to write me a 
                        note, there s no way I m gonnamake 
                        first lesson, gonnahave to start 
                        these again.  


          INT. MARK S HOUSE - SARAH S BEDROOM. DAY 2 (08.22)2323

          MARK wakes to hear the sound of rummaging through the 
          room. 

          He checks where he is. He realisesthis is a room he 
            should not be in. 

                                            MARK
                          Sorry... Sorry Sarah...

          MARK sits up. HELEN yelps. And MARK yelps back. 

                                            HELEN
                          Jesus. You surprised me. 

          MARK looks at HELEN - slightly astonished. 

                                            MARK
                          Helen? 

                                            HELEN
                        Hi. Mark. Hi.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  19



          We cut to behind HELEN s back. She s tucking a small gun 
          into the back of her trousers. Yeah. A gun. 

                                            MARK
                        What you - doing - here? 

                                            HELEN
                        I m stealing things. What are you doing 
                        here?

          HELEN smiles. Her hands now free, she undoes her coat, 
          and for the first time we realiseshe s wearing a dog 
          collar. 

                                            MARK
                        This is my house. 

                                            HELEN
                        Half of it. Sarah gave me her key 
                          yesterday, asked me to pick something up.
                        And before you ask - no, I don t know 
                        where she is - but I m pretty sure she 
                          wouldn t like you in her room. 

                                            MARK
                        I got a bit... last night was a bit...

                                            HELEN
                          That llexplain this...

          She lifts up Vicky s knickers.  

                                            HELEN (CONT D)
                        Don t look Sarah s style...

          MARK raises an eyebrow. 

                                            MARK
                        It was less fun than you think

                                            HELEN
                        I m not taking sides Mark. I think it s a 
                        sorry mess, but I m not taking sides. 

                                            MARK
                        No. I know. 

          MARK looks at her. Then smiles. 

                                            MARK (CONT D)
                        It s good to see you. 

                                            HELEN
                        Good to see you too. 

                                            MARK
                        You don t fancy some breakfast do you?                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  20



          HELEN smiles. 

                                            HELEN
                          Thought you d never ask...

          MARK gets up and leaves the room. 

          HELEN breaths and takes out the gun. Looks at it. And 
            stuffs the gun into her handbag.

          EXT. SCHOOL - PLAYGROUNDS. DAY 2 (08.50)2727

            Establish on a school. And a school sign -  StBarnabas
            Secondary School and Sixth Form College.  

          MAC and PAUL are amongst those thronging through the 
            school gates. 

          MAC is holding a bullet casing up to the light - 
          despite the crowd of kids around them. 

                                          MAC
                        This is a - bullet...

                                            PAUL
                          I know Mac, will you put it away?

          MAC turns and shouts at the top of his lungs. 

                                          MAC
                          MURDER. MURDER. I VE JUST BEEN SHOT!

          PAUL flinches away. No-one turns around or even looks 
          at them. MAC looks at them all - satisfied, but 
          slightly disappointed.

                        Like any of them pay the slightest 
                          attention to what we do. We re the 
                          unwashed, we re the unwanted, we re 
                        the invisible in this school. 

          Someone spits on MAC s back as he passes. His friend high 
          fives him. MAC knows it s there. But ignores it.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  21

                        And this is a bullet. And a slightly 
                        odd one I think. Which makes it even 
                        more exciting. 

          PAUL is really confused and his friend isn t helping. 

                                            PAUL
                        Not exciting...

          His sister ANNA passes him in the opposite direction. Her 
          eyes flare - she doesn t want to be acknowledged by PAUL - 
          not now - not here. 

            Beside her walks JAY, beautiful, 17. As they walk on by, 
          PAUL summons courage. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                        Hi. Jay. 

          She turns to look at him - surprised. PAUL is equally 
            surprised the words have come out of his mouth. MAC 
            smiles - amused by all this. 

                                          JAY
                        What?

          And if her surprise wasn t bad enough... ANNA turns. 

                                            ANNA 
                          Fuckoff Paul. How we came out of the 
                        same egg is a mystery to me. 

                                            PAUL
                        Womb. We came out of the same womb. 
                        Egg and we d be - identical - twins - 
                        there are certain differences between 
                        us if you hadn t noticed. 

                                            ANNA
                        Yeah. You re retarded. 

          MAC laughs. ANNA sticks a finger up at him. And PAUL 
          and MAC push through the double doors. 


          INT. SCHOOL - CORRIDOR. DAY 2 (08.53)2828

          MAC is still going. In a very MAC way. But the world is 
          even more crowded inside the school walls, and PAUL 
          hates it.

                          A bullet. A strange bullet casing. Which 
                        my best friend claims was fired at him. 
                        Which makes my best friend Indiana Jones.

                        Which is good because I always wanted to 
                        be Short Round from Temple of Doom. 

          PAUL looks around - he doesn t want to be out here 
          talking anymore. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Or - Marion Ravenwoodfrom Raiders 
                        when feeling particularly confused... 
                        That was smooth by the way. 

          PAUL thinks and then pushes MAC through a toilet door. 


          INT. SCHOOL - GIRLS  TOILETS. DAY 2 (08.53)2929

          MAC and PAUL are surprised to find themselves in a 
            girls  toilets. An empty girls  toilets thankfully. 

                                          MAC
                        What did you do that for? The Marion 
                          Ravenwoodquip? Don t worry I m not 
                        going to come out to you. I m actually 
                          probably the most heterosexual person 
                        you know.

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. I m scared...

          But MAC s attention is elsewhere. He thumps the side of 
          a tampon machine and checks whether anything falls out. 

                                          MAC
                        Minus the sex of course. I m a... hetero--
                        ual. You do know this is the girl s 
                          toilets, right?

                                            PAUL
                          You re not taking this very seriously. 

          The door starts to swing open. PAUL thinks quickly and 
            pushes MAC and himself into a toilet cubicle. 


          INT. SCHOOL - GIRL'S TOILET CUBICLE. DAY 2 (08.54)3030

          PAUL climbs on the toilet seat, pulls MAC onto him and 
            clamps his hand over MAC s mouth.  

            A girl goes into the cubicle next to them. 

          She starts to pee. MAC s eyebrows move up and down 
            furiously. He s trying not to laugh. 

          She farts. MAC almost explodes.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  23



                                            A GIRL
                        Oh. I ain t got any toilet paper. You 
                        got some?

          PAUL thinks and then tears off some toilet paper with 
          his free hand and passes it under the cubicle wall. 

          The girl takes the paper from him. Wipes. Flushes. 
          Leaves. 

          PAUL lets go of MAC s mouth. 

                                            PAUL
                          There s the female mystique fucked 
                        then?

                                          MAC
                          Sadly, that might genuinely have been 
                        the most sexual experience of my 
                          entire life.

          PAUL laughs. The first time he s smiled all day. 

          His shoulders uncurl - he starts to feel - I don t know - 
          relaxed. Sitting in a girls  toilet with your best friend 
          can do that to a man.

          MAC smiles gently at his friend then touches his 
            shoulder. And they don t touch much so this touch is 
            important. It s just a tap. Nothing held, nothing 
            pronounced. 

          They both flinch slightly.

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        I m taking this very seriously, you just 
                        got shot at. I m just... I talk when I m 
                          nervous. I once told my mother the entire 
                        plot of the Bible - old and new testament 
                        when we were watching Jaws. She was 
                          enthralled. Naturally. 

          PAUL looks at MAC. 

                                            PAUL
                        These dreams... I ve been having...

          MAC looks up and grins. 

                                          MAC
                        Mate. Those are natural things. Beautiful 
                          things. 

          PAUL laughs in spite of himself. 

                                            PAUL
                          Shut-up.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  24



          MAC unlocks and leaves the cubicle with a theatrical 
            flourish. 


          INT. SCHOOL - GIRLS  TOILETS. DAY 2 (08.56)3131

                                          MAC
                        Yeah. You need to clean yourself up in 
                        the morning. But that gunk you have your 
                        hand - your junk - that s the miracle of 
                        life right there baby. Right there. 

          PAUL follows him out, aware of danger from all sides. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. Don t you understand? The dreams - 
                        my dreams - are coming true. 

          MAC stops, for the first time apprehensive. He frowns. He 
          smiles. 

                                          MAC
                        Your - dreams - are coming true?

                                            PAUL
                        When that guy shot at me, I followed 
                          him... He fought with - he fought with 
                        this - creature - I can t describe him 
                        but he wasn t human - but I think it was 
                          a human he was fighting with and - the 
                        gun was - the gun - the bullet - proves 
                        it doesn t it? That the dreams are sort 
                        of - real - which means I m - which means 
                        I m - what?

          MAC considers for a long time. 

                                          MAC
                          Heather Langenkampfrom Nightmare On Elm 
                          Street?

          PAUL looks at MAC, disappointed. And then exits the 
            bathroom. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        That is such a compliment! Heather 
                          Langenkampis an utter legend. 


          INT. SCHOOL - CORRIDOR. DAY 2 (08.57)3232

          MAC hurries to catch PAUL up as he walks down the 
            corridor. 

          They walk past those that hate, despise and ignore them. 
          Which is, well, everyone.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  25



                                          MAC
                        OK, I ll be Heather you be Kim Myers from 
                          Nightmare on Elm Street 2, but honestly 
                        mate - the film is not as good. 

          The bell rings, kids from all sides enter classrooms, MAC 
          and PAUL remain. 

          PAUL turns, still really upset. They face each other. 

                                            PAUL
                          I just wanted someone who d - believe me. 
                        And you re taking the piss. 

          MAC is surprised. 

                                          MAC
                        But of course I believe you. 

          PAUL is slightly surprised in return. 

                                            PAUL
                        You do?

                                          MAC
                          Ya-huh. 

                                            PAUL
                        And - do you think - I m - mad?

          MAC tries to think how to phrase this. 

                                          MAC
                        You remember that time you shityourself 
                        on cub camp and I told you - 

                                            PAUL
                        To tell everyone I d sat in dog shit. 

                                          MAC
                        And then everyone pointed out that we 
                          hadn t seen dogs for miles. 

                                            PAUL
                        So you said  oh he must veshithimself 
                        then  and everyone laughed and I became 
                        known as Chocky...

          MAC smiles at the memory. Then turns and starts to walk 
          down the corridor. And this time PAUL follows him. 

                                          MAC
                        Have I let you down since? Let anyone 
                        laugh at you since...                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  26

                        Only because you re way more unpopular 
                        than me. 


          INT. SCHOOL - MARK'S CLASSROOM. DAY 2 (09.01)3333

          They sit. STEVE is also in the class.

                                          MAC
                        If you re mad. Well, we ll find a way to 
                        cope with that. But it s equally possible 
                        what you re seeing is what other people 
                          can t. That you re, you know, special. 

                                            PAUL
                          Special?

          MAC smiles at his friend. 

                                          MAC
                          Special. 

                                            PAUL
                        I m scared Mac.

                          You re scared? My only friend is either a 
                          lunatic or Heather Langenkamp. I m 
                          petrified.   

          MARK enters. Full of energy. 

                                            MARK
                        OK. Get ready. It s time for his story. 
                        His story. History. That s the one. 

          The class laugh. OK. MARK is one of those teachers. The 
          good ones. And whatever is going on in his life, he s not 
          letting it faze him. 

                                            MARK (CONT D)
                        OK. Who s ready for the holocaust?


          EXT. FIELDS. DAY 2 (12.33)3434

          NEIL, still looking just as unwashed and with an 
            improvised eyepatchover his eye (Sellotapeholding in 
          place some sort of padding), checks a rabbit trap and 
          pulls out a bird that s somehow been trapped inside it. 

          It s dead. 

          He looks at it closely, looking at it carefully for

          He sees nothing. 

          He puts it in his satchel and continues across the 
            fields to home... which is a small caravan, dead ahead. 


          INT. NEIL'S CARAVAN. DAY 2 (12.34)3535

          NEIL enters the van and puts his satchel on the side. 

          The van - now very visible in the day light - is a 
          mixture of mould and damp. It s a mess. If we could 
          smell it, it d smell terrible. 

          NEIL puts a kettle on and checks the fridge for milk. 
          He pulls out a bottle and smells it. It s not good. 

          He grimaces and puts it back in the fridge.  

          He takes the bird out of his satchel. 

          He spreads the bird s wings and looks at its body. 
          There s no clue there. 

          He puts it in the sink. 

                                            HELEN (O.S.)
                        I was hoping it was you. 

          Neil jumps. HELEN steps out from her hiding place behind 
          his cupboards. Yeah. Another surprise entrance from the 
            vicar. She gets everywhere. 

          NEIL looks at her, slightly irritated. And then turns 
          away and busies himself. 

                                            NEIL
                          I love it how you feel free to just let 
                          yourself into people s places whenever 
                        you like...

                                            HELEN
                        This isn t a place - it s a hole. 

                                            NEIL
                        It s safe here. 

          He turns and looks at her. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        Where were you last night?

          HELEN notices how gnarled up his face is. 

                                            HELEN
                          What s happened to your eye?                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  28



          The kettle begins to boil.

                                            NEIL
                          I kept ringing. Where were you?

                                            HELEN
                        I had things to clean up. 

          NEIL looks coldly at HELEN for a beat and then exits to 
          the bedroom. 

                                            NEIL
                        We need to bury her immediately. 

                                            HELEN
                        Neil. We re still a team.  

                                            NEIL (O.S.)
                        No. We re your team. 

          HELEN thinks and then follows. 

                                            HELEN
                        Oh, that s the thing is it? You want a go 
                        at playing the man?


          INT. NEIL'S CARAVAN. BEDROOM. DAY 2 (12.36)3636

          SARAH lies dead on NEIL s bed. 

          They both stare at her a minute. This is hard. 

          HELEN talks softly. 

                                            HELEN
                        I got her gun. I collected it. From her 
                          place. This morning. 

                                            NEIL
                        Good. 

          NEIL thinks. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                          I lost mine. My gun. 

          HELEN looks at NEIL sharply. NEIL reads the look. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                          I shot it and then he - attacked me and I 
                          - lost it. I got - I was - scared. This 
                        is Sarah, you know? This is Sarah. 

          HELEN decides whether to explode or not - she decides not 
          - she speaks softly.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  29



                                            HELEN
                        Your eye looks painful Neil. Her body can 
                        keep. Let me look at you first. 


          INT. NEIL'S CARAVAN. DAY 2 (12.37)3737

          NEIL is moving an old, heavy, tubular metal chair with a 
            raised back so that it s under the window. 

                                            NEIL
                        She said the attack proved her vision 
                        right that... the future was ash... was 
                          death... It didn t sound great.

                                            HELEN
                          I don t understand why the attack proves - 

                                            NEIL
                        It proves it because it s never happened 
                          before. The Fades are not supposed to be 
                        able to touch us. He is breaking through -  
                        he s becoming flesh - 

          NEIL looks at HELEN, sits on the chair and, without 
            explanation, attaches his feet to the bottom legs using 
            gaffer tape. 

                                            HELEN
                          That s a big assumption. 

                                            NEIL
                        And if he becomes flesh, then so will 
                          others, and - as death becomes life, so 
                        life will become death. So - everything 
                        ends. That s what her vision meant.  

                                            HELEN
                        Yeah. Let s not get too dramatic shall 
                        we? 


          INT. NEWSAGENT. DAY 2 (12.38)3838

          MAC and PAUL are taking in the crisp collection. 

          They are studying them with the determination of a 
            specialist librarian. 

                                          MAC
                          I just can t decide if this a Cheese and 
                        Onion Wednesday sort of day or Salt and 
                          Vinegar Friday? 

                                            PAUL
                        It s actually Friday.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  30



          MAC looks at PAUL - disappointed. 

                                          MAC
                          Sometimes you re disappointingly literal. 

          He turns back to the crisps. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Oh my God, didn t even consider Smokey
                        Bacon Monday. 

          And then PAUL sees something. 

                                            PAUL
                        Get down. 

                                          MAC
                        What?

          PAUL drags MAC down. 

          JAY enters the shop. 

          She s super casual in her insouciant way. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        What?

          He stands up, he sees JAY. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Oh. 

          JAY turns towards the voice. MAC is dragged down out of 
          view before she sees him. 

          MAC begins to grin. 

          She takes a coke from the fridge and then a strawberry 
          sherbert lace from a box on the counter. 

          She smiles at RICHARD, behind the till. 

          PAUL pops up his head from the shelves. 

          MAC pops his head up too. Both look at JAY. 

                                          JAY
                        And ten Marlboro Lights. 

                                            RICHARD
                        OK love. 

          She s given them. She pays. 

          She turns to go. Both boys shoot down back out of view.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  31



          She then walks down the aisle as she walks out. 

                                          JAY
                        Hi Paul. 

          PAUL stands up from his hiding place. Trying to be all 
          Clint Eastwood. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah?

          MAC stands up behind him. He s holding a toilet plunger. 

                                          MAC
                        Found it!

          PAUL turns - gratefully - and then sees what MAC is 
          holding. 

          JAY grins and keeps walking towards the exit. 

                                          JAY
                        See you Paul. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. Hi. I mean, yeah. I mean, bye. 

          She exits. They both stare after her. 

                                          MAC
                        Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. That went well.

            Pause. He looks at the plunger. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Not an entirely romantic instrument. 

          PAUL thinks and picks up two packets of Beef and Onion 
          and makes for the counter. 

                                            PAUL
                          Welcome to the world of Beef and Onion 
                          Tuesday. 

                                          MAC
                          Tuesday! Of course! 

          PAUL lays them on the counter. He looks up confidently. 

                                            PAUL
                        And ten Marlboro Lights...

                                            RICHARD
                        You got any ID kid?

                                            PAUL
                        I m 18. I ve just got a young face.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  32

                        You can touch his stubble if you want. 

          He mouths  please  and indicates JAY standing outside the 
          shop window lighting her fag. RICHARD thinks - looks at 
          the girl - and then hands him the fags. 

                                            RICHARD
                        If you re from the thought police I ll 
                        have your bollocks, OK son?

                                            PAUL
                          Thanks. I mean, I m not. I mean, I m - 
                          grateful. 

                                            RICHARD
                          That s  4.10. 

          PAUL reaches into his pocket. Then stops. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. You got any cash?

                                          MAC
                        Does the Pope shitin the woods?

          PAUL turns back to RICHARD apologetically. 

                                            PAUL
                        Can I owe you  2?

          RICHARD laughs first. 


          INT. NEIL'S CARAVAN. DAY 2 (12.41)3939

          NEIL finishes tying his feet and positions his hands 
          crossed at the back of the chair.  

                                            NEIL
                        You can move in here for a start. 

                                            HELEN
                        I ll do as I do. 

                                            NEIL
                        We can be safe out here. It s non-
                          negotiable. 

          HELEN wraps gaffer tape first around his hands and then 
            around his bound hands and the whole of the chair, 
          winding the gaffer around his waist and chest. He now 
          can t move from the chair. 

                                            HELEN
                        We are not here to predict the future 
                        Neil. Sarah was the seer...

                                            HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Her inevitability isn t ours. We take 
                        every challenge...

                                            NEIL
                        As it comes... I know. But if the 
                          challenge is too great? If the Fades do 
                        break through?

          HELEN stops what she s doing and looks at NEIL. 

                                            HELEN
                        Then you re right - we ll be fucked. Does 
                        that make you feel better?

          NEIL half-smiles, she wraps gaffer tape around his 
          forehead to the back of the chair.

                                            NEIL
                          I don t like it when you swear. 

          She smiles and gaffers his mouth. 


          EXT. STREETS. DAY 2 (12.42)4040

          PAUL and MAC walk companionably along a street. 

                                          MAC
                        She loves you...

          He eats a crisp. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. 

                                          MAC
                        She loves you not...

          He eats a crisp. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. Really. 

                                          MAC
                        She loves you...

          He eats a crisp. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac. You need to - stop. 

                                          MAC
                        She loves you not...

          He eats another crisp. 

                                            PAUL
                          I will use physical violence on you.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  34



                                          MAC
                        This is science. 

                                            PAUL
                        You need science. 

                                          MAC
                        And you need love MobyDick. 

          PAUL says nothing. MAC grins and reaches to take another 
            crisp. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        She loves you. 

          PAUL bangs on the underneath of the packet, the crisps 
          fly everywhere. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Now that s just childish...


          INT. CARAVAN. DAY 2 (12.43)4141

          HELEN lifts up NEIL'S eye patch again.  He winces as she 
          looks at the eye closely.  It s swollen and covered in 
          dried blood.  His lens is cloudy, milky, seeping puss.

                                            HELEN
                        This is going to hurt... I m going to 
                        have to scrape out the poison. 

          She opens her bag, lays out a surgical roll and selects 
          her metal implement of choice.

          NEIL steels himself as she leans over him and moves to 
          clean out his eye.  We cut away as he hollers in pain 
          from beneath his muzzle.

          It seems to last forever but it s actually only moments 
            before HELEN drops the metal implement and grips her 
          hands around NEIL'S temples.

          She closes her eyes, talking under her breath as her body 
          suddenly tenses rigid. 

          NEIL wants to buck in pain but he can't. HELEN moves her 
          hands over his eyes, still talking under her breath as if 
          inducing some sort of trance.  

          She seems to surge with pain, then NEIL does too. Then as 
          the room shakes around her - light comes from her hands. 
            Golden light. 

          Suddenly she s slammed back away from his body.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  35



          She lands hard at the corner of the caravan, as if 
            lifeless.  NEIL doesn't move.  Stillness fills the air, 
          then...

          HELEN stirs, she sucks in a breath like it's her first 
          and then her mouth eeksopen and a wet, black butterfly 
          emerges.  It crawls up on her nose, flexes its wings to 
          dry them out. And then it takes off away. 

          NEIL is still, she is still. They lie for as long as 
          feels right. This shouldn t be rushed. And HELEN lies 
          back - covered in sweat with dribble seeping from her 
            mouth. Then she opens her eyes, sniffs and wipes her 
            mouth.  

                                            HELEN (CONT D)
                          I couldn t - save it.

          She stands up, wobbles slightly and then walks over to 
          him and gently kisses him on the forehead before undoing 
          his gaffer muzzle, with brutal speed, and then his arm 
            restraints. 

                                            HELEN (CONT D)
                        The eye s dead - he infected your cornea. 
                        You won t see out of that again.  

          HELEN looks around the room - her eyes are bloodshot, 
          she s used more energy than she s got. Neither are 
          looking at each other - she puts her hand on his shoulder 
          as if unsteady. 

                                            HELEN (CONT D)
                          I couldn t have saved her, Sarah, you 
                        know that? Any more than you could. Her 
                          injuries were too severe. 

            NEIL s face tells a thousand stories. 

                                            NEIL
                          I know. 

          HELEN is thinking quick and hard. 

                                            HELEN
                        And I will move in here. Just until we 
                          understand what s happening. 

                                            NEIL
                        Good. 

                                            HELEN
                        The truth is, all this, it s simple. 
                          Either the world will end or we ll stop 
                        him or something stronger will come along 
                        that can...                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  36



          NEIL frowns. 

                                            NEIL
                          You re back on this - creature who 
                        will save us all?

                                            HELEN
                        Why not? He s out there Neil - I know 
                        he is. 

          NEIL considers this - thinking - maybe about PAUL and 
          then grins. 

                                            NEIL
                          Hecould be a woman you know. I ve heard 
                        some of them do OK. 

          HELEN laughs. 

                                            HELEN
                          Careful, or I ll take the other eye. 


          INT. PAUL S HOUSE - STAIRS. DAY 2 (17.48)4242

          PAUL thunders up the stairs. There is an argument going 
          on. 

                                          MEG (O.S.)
                          Because I ve asked you repeatedly to do 
                        it. 

                                            ANNA (O.S.)
                        And I ve told you repeatedly I won t. 

          PAUL pauses on the stairs, listening to the two women 
            argue. 

                                          MEG (O.S.)
                        You look cheap Anna. 

                                            ANNA (O.S.)
                        So I should take style advice from you 
                          should I... I may look cheap but you look 
                        dead. 

                                          MEG (O.S.)
                        If you dress like a slut people will 
                        treat you like a...

                                            ANNA (O.S.)
                        My Mum actually thinks I dress like a 
                          prostitute? There s an ambition achieved. 

          PAUL shuts his door carefully behind him.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  37



          INT. PAUL S HOUSE - BEDROOM/LANDING. DAY 2 (17.49)4343

          PAUL shuts the door - revealing NEIL who was hidden 
            behind it - but PAUL doesn t notice; he looks around for 
            somewhere to stash the cigarettes. NEIL S wearing a patch 
          over his damaged eye, and will do for all subsequent 
            scenes until he is healed in Episode 3. 

            A muffled argument between ANNA and MEG continues 
            downstairs. 

          He pulls a box from under the bed. It s filled with quite 
          good - quite realistic - drawings of The Fades. NEIL 
          looks at them too. 

          PAUL frowns at them and then sticks his cigarettes under 
          them. 

                                            NEIL 
                          I always used to put them inside a sock 
                        at the back of my sock drawer. 

          PAUL jumps - scared. 

                                            PAUL
                        What? You?

                                            NEIL
                        Yeah. Me. 

                                            PAUL
                        What are you - doing here?

          NEIL takes out an apple and bites into it. 

                                            NEIL
                          Looking for you. The kid who saw stuff he 
                          shouldn t be able to. 

          ANNA thunders past them on the landing outside PAUL s 
          room. Now we can hear her. Particularly as she s 
            shouting. 

                                            ANNA (O.S.)
                        Maybe if you haddressed like a slut he 
                          wouldn t have left you. Have you 
                          considered that? 

            A door slams. NEIL looks towards it. So does PAUL. 

          NEIL turns back and looks at PAUL.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  38



                                            NEIL
                        You got two choices kid. You can scream 
                        and get the whole house running in here 
                        or you can realiseI probably have some 
                          information that you need to hear. 

          NEIL takes another bite. 

          Off PAUL. Thinking. 


          EXT. STREETS. DAY 2 (17.55)4444

          NEIL walks a little bit ahead of PAUL. 

                                            NEIL
                        So how much can you see?

                                            PAUL
                        Of what?

                                            NEIL
                        Of the things you shouldn t. 

                                            PAUL
                        What things?

          NEIL turns and looks at PAUL. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                            nuqDaq'oHpuchpa''e'? That s Klingonfor 
                           where s the bathroom ? You re making 
                          absolutely no sense. 

          NEIL looks at PAUL with a soft smile. 

                                            NEIL
                          Klingon. The kid speaks Klingon. 

                                            MARK (O.S.)
                        Neil.

          NEIL looks up and sees MARK, surprised. 

                                            NEIL
                          Mark...

          MARK looks from NEIL to PAUL. 

                                            MARK
                        With one of my students - hello Paul. 

                                            NEIL
                        I m an - old friend of the family. 

                                            PAUL
                        Hello Mr. Etches.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  39



          MARK looks steadily at NEIL. NEIL looks back. There s 
            animosity here. 

                                            NEIL
                        How s Sarah?

                                            MARK
                        She s fine. 

                                            NEIL
                        Good to - see you Mark. 

          Neither are sure it is good to see the other. 

                                            MARK
                        Yeah. Definitely. 

          NEIL and PAUL walk on.  

                                            PAUL
                        How do you know Mr. Etches?

                                            NEIL
                        Long - story. 

          NEIL checks his watch. And begins to walk. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                          Come-on we re going to be late. 

                                            PAUL
                        For what?

          PAUL thinks and then runs slightly to catch him up. 


          EXT. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - ROOF. DAY 2 (18.01)4545

          NEIL sits on the edge of the roof. PAUL thinks and then 
            copies him. It s some drop. 

                                            NEIL
                        Close your eyes. 

          PAUL thinks and then does that. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        Just concentrate on my voice. Empty your 
                        head of everything but my voice. Now open 
                        your eyes. 

          PAUL does.

                        They like height - when organic matter 
                          passes through them they burn.

                        So you ll see them on roof tops, on bus 
                          shelters, walking down the middle of the 
                        road, cars are fine, being winged by a 
                        car - that doesn t hurt. So look for them 
                        on ledges on - 

          We watch with Paul s eyes. His eyes blur as the screen 
          does. Then things start to focus. Blurs become semi-
            transparent shapes. That slowly become people - Fade 
          people. On the top of buildings, sign posts, telephone 
            boxes, in the middle of the street... everywhere and 
          anywhere where the general public are not.  

          PAUL is amazed at the number and the complexity. 

                                            PAUL
                        What are they?

                                            NEIL
                          They re the dead. And they re trapped 
                        here. 

            PAUL s eyes grow wide. 

                                            PAUL
                          They re - the dead?

          NEIL looks at PAUL. Who is staring at what is below him. 

                                            NEIL
                        When people die... 

                                            PAUL
                          They re - dead?

                                            NEIL
                        When people die - they go up or they stay 
                        here - some go up - some stay here. These 
                        are those that stay here. We call them 
                        The Fades. 

                                            PAUL
                          They re - just - trapped here. 

                                            NEIL
                        If they don t ascend - yeah. 

                                            PAUL
                        So these are bad people? The people left 
                        over - the ones that go up are going to 
                          heaven right? 

                                            NEIL
                        Good? Bad? Why people believe death is 
                          somehow fair... Death is random - same as 
                        life is. Life has famine, illness, 
                          shitness. Death is similarly crap. That s 
                        why the problem exists.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  41



                                            PAUL
                        The problem?

                                            NEIL
                          Imagine being trapped in a world you 
                        can t touch, you can t taste... hate 
                          grows. Those left behind - get - shitty. 

                                            PAUL
                        And that s what... So that man I saw 
                          attacking you was a - shittyghost?

          NEIL considers how to answer this. 

                                            NEIL
                        No. He was something new. 

                                            PAUL
                        And you - what are you? Are you a - 
                          Ghostbuster?

          NEIL turns to PAUL and smiles. 

                                            NEIL
                                  (ironic)
                        Yeah kid. I m a Ghostbuster.

          NEIL smiles at PAUL, who is not smiling back.

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                          I m... We re an ancient order. Some call 
                        us angelics.I don t. We exist to protect 
                        those that need protecting - from things 
                        we don t - can t - understand. Disputes 
                          between the dead. Ascension points. We 
                          protect and we keep the balance. 

                                            PAUL
                        How?

          NEIL considers how to answer this question. 

                                            NEIL
                        With - weapons - we ve adapted guns which 
                        are organically treated so as to hurt 
                        them. Stun them. But mostly - with our 
                          powers. We are - blessed - in some way - 
                        I ve a friend who heals, I ve another - 
                        she is a - was a - seer. 

                                            PAUL
                        And you? What do you do?

          NEIL doesn t like this question. 

                                            NEIL
                        I m - complicated.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  42



          NEIL thinks about saying more, but doesn t. 

                                            PAUL
                        And none of this stuff... None of this 
                        stuff is in my head?

          NEIL grins. 

                                            NEIL
                            Ghostbuster shonour.

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. But you could be mad too. Or in my 
                        head - too. 

          They sit on the edge of the car park. Watching the sun 
          fade. 

                                            NEIL
                        Good point. That s more than possible. 

          Out on PAUL. 


          EXT. APOCALYPSE. VISION. DAY X4646

          PAUL stands in a world of ash. 

          A world of just ash. 

          Ash flakes fall from the sky like snow. 

          He puts his hand up to catch one. 

          He looks about himself - he starts to walk. He walks 
          towards a hill in the distance. 

          Looking around, all the time, scared - he sees a derelict 
            broken telephone box on the floor beside him. He stares 
          at it - surprised. 

          Then. Big surprise. The mist clearing slightly - he sees 
          someone standing looking at him. This is JOHN. We won t 
          know who he is until later. 

                                            PAUL
                          Hello...?

          JOHN looks at him and then turns and starts to run. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                        No... No... Don t run...

          PAUL follows. But then he trips on something, he looks to 
          see what it is. It s a - hand. It s a human hand. 
          Sticking out of the dust.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  43



          He looks at it - aghast. 


          INT. PAUL S HOUSE - BEDROOM. NIGHT 2 (02.17)4747

          PAUL awakes again with a gasp. 

          Again he s wet his bed. 

          He looks at his groin, disgusted. 

          He peels off his trousers. 

          He wipes down his legs. 

          He puts on tracksuit bottoms. 


          EXT. UNDERPASS. DAY 3 (12.33)4848

          PAUL is moving fast, he s late. He s running.  

          He turns a corner...

          To see a FADE GIRL in the middle of the underpass in 
          front of him. A teenage FADE GIRL we may recognise from 
          the attack on Neil, and who ll we ll later know as 
          Natalie. Again skinny, too skinny, again starving, again 
            almost black and white. But this time with a listless 
          look in its eyes. 

          PAUL swerves to avoid her but can t. 

          He ploughs straight through her body. 

          The FADE GIRL screams - PAUL screams - and THE FADE 
            GIRL s skin burns and then just like that PAUL is through 
          her.

          He turns back, she s gone. He touches the air where she s 
          been with a studied look on his face. 

          Then PAUL takes a breath - takes another breath - and 
          tries to get control of his breathing. Then he walks 
          away. 

          And the re-appropriated FADE GIRL watches him. An 
            interested look on her face. 


          INT. DR TREMLETT S OFFICE. DAY 3 (12.49)4949

          The clock is ticking, we re back in a symmetrical office. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        You seem different today...                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  44



          PAUL looks back at him. 

                                            PAUL
                          Different how?

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        Has something happened since our last 
                          session?

          PAUL thinks. His jaw locks. 

                                            PAUL
                          I donated blood. 

          Beat. DR TREMLETT looks at his patient. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        Well. Maybe that s it. 

          He thinks, assessing PAUL. And PAUL assesses him back. 

                                            PAUL
                        No. I didn t donate blood. That was a 
                        joke. You didn t laugh. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                          I want to talk to you about your Dad 
                          again...

          PAUL stiffens again. 

                                            PAUL
                        OK. Probably a bit pointless. What do you 
                        want to say?

                                          DR TREMLETT
                          I think it s important that the dreams - 
                        the bed wetting - didn t start til after 
                        the divorce. 

                                            PAUL
                        So he s the reason I m mad? It s my Dad s 
                          fault. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                          I wish you d stop using that word. 

          PAUL suddenly explodes. 

                                            PAUL
                        But I am! I know what I am. I m mad. I 
                        see - things - I look out of the window 
                        and see - things - and I hate it. And I 
                        want it to stop. I just I want it to 
                        stop.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  45



                                          DR TREMLETT
                        What things do you see?

          PAUL looks out of the window - we don t see what he sees - 
          and then looks back at DR TREMLETT.  

                                            PAUL
                        Give me pills. Give me a - lobotomy. Just 
                        make it stop. Because I hate this.  

          There is a silence. 

          DR TREMLETT looks at PAUL carefully. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        I m not going to prescribe you anything 
                        Paul. 

                                            PAUL
                        Then why am I here?

          DR TREMLETT looks at PAUL. 

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        You know, you remind me a lot of me when 
                        I was your age...

                                            PAUL
                        Is that supposed to be a compliment?

          TREMLETT smiles at PAUL. He doesn t smile back.

                                          DR TREMLETT
                        There are two things I think you should 
                        know Paul - one - you re never as odd as 
                        you think you are. Two. The things that 
                        scare us are the things that keep us 
                          human. Never be afraid of being scared. 
                        Just don t let being scared dictate the 
                          choices you make. 

          PAUL looks at him - is he right? He hopes he is. 


          EXT. SKATEPARK. DAY 3 (13.03)5050

          PAUL sits bum-sucking a cigarette on a park bench. 

          He s so consumed that he doesn t notice JAY approach. 

                                          JAY
                          Didn t know you smoked...?

          PAUL is really surprised to see her. He doesn t know what 
          to say. This girl makes him nervous.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  46



                                            PAUL
                        Yeah? 

                                          JAY
                        Yeah. 

          PAUL tries to think of something to say. 

                                            PAUL
                        I m just learning. 

          He winces, regretting the remark. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                          I mean, yeah, I m just learning... I 
                        tried to write L on the cigarette in my 
                          sister s lipstick but...

          JAY looks at him and smiles. 

                                          JAY
                        Well, you re bum-sucking the shit out of 
                        that, filter must be soaking...

          She takes the cigarette out of his mouth and moves her 
          lips carefully around it. She inhales and exhales. 

                                          JAY (CONT D)
                        See?

          PAUL nods and takes the cigarette back. He tries to smoke 
          how she showed him. 

                                          JAY (CONT D)
                        You heard about the thing at the old 
                          shopping centre?

                                            PAUL
                        No. 

                                          JAY
                          There s police all around it. Everyone s 
                          talking about it in school - current 
                          theory is someone got raped...

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah?

                                          JAY
                        Yeah. AndAlicia s been off school. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah? Alicia? Yeah. 

          She turns and looks at him.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  47

                        You OK? You seem weirder than ever...

                                            PAUL
                        Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I m just... trying to 
                          decide if I m mental or not.

                        What are your odds?

          JAY laughs. PAUL looks at her and smiles - he loves her 
            smile. 

                                            PAUL
                        My sister would kill you she even sees 
                        you talking to me...

                                          JAY
                        She d probably kill you too. She s into 
                        her - she doesn t believe in the inter-
                          mingling of the species - even if it s 
                        just talking. 

          PAUL isn t sure what  just talking  means. But he likes 
          the tone of what she s saying.  

                                            PAUL
                          I guess you re all off out tonight...

                        We re all off out every night. Up the 
                          woods. Only thing to do round here. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. I guess so. Just be careful of the - 
                        you know - rapist. 

          JAY smiles at PAUL and his weirdo comment. 

                                          JAY
                          You re not mental. You re just different.

                        ...As she cleaned me up from whoever 
                          bullied me.  Oh Paul, someone s squirted

                          scared of difference.   Oh Paul,

                          I always wanted to be different. 

          She turns and looks at PAUL. 

                                          JAY (CONT D)
                        I was a bit of a hairbrush princess, you 
                        know - think I m a popstar. I don t know - 
                        my Dad thinks I m better than everyone 
                        so...

                                            PAUL
                        Well. I ve - never - wanted to be 
                          different.  

                                          JAY
                        Maybe I don t mean you re different. 
                        Maybe I mean special. 

          PAUL looks at her. 

                                            PAUL
                          You re the second one who s said 
                          something like that...

          JAY looks at him carefully for a moment - does she like 
          him too? 

                                          JAY
                        Got the taste of your spit in my mouth 
                          now...

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah?

          She smiles at him. 

                                          JAY
                          You ve got nice eyes - in this light. 

          PAUL flushes and then tries to think of an eloquent 
            response. He fails. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah?

          She smiles. Then she thinks better of being here further, 
          takes the cigarette again and has another tug. 

                                          JAY
                          Better go. 

          He hesitates a second - forming words in his mouth he 
          will never say. She grins at the effort. 

                                            PAUL
                          Right.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  49



          And JAY walks off. 

          PAUL stares after her. Thinks, and then finally calls 
          out. 

                                            PAUL (CONT D)
                          You ve got nice eyes too. 

          She doesn t turn around. 

                                          JAY
                          I know. 

          PAUL smiles and turns back to his cigarette. 

          She picks up her bike and cycles off. 

          PAUL watches her with a shy smile. 


          INT. POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR. DAY 3 (17.26)5151

          MARK walks through police corridors accompanied by DC 
            FIRTH. MARK is genuinely apprehensive about what he s 
          doing here. His eyes alive to all sides. 

                                          DC FIRTH
                        Mr. Etches isn t it? You taught me GCSE
                          History. Mr. Etches. 

                                            MARK
                        Oh. Um. Right. Yes. Do you know what this 
                        is about? I just got the call and - 

                                          DC FIRTH 
                        The DCI will tell you. Phillip Firth. I 
                        am. DC Firth. 

                                            MARK
                          Right. Yes, Phillip, I remember. How did 
                        you do in the end? In your exams?

          MARK zones out. DC FIRTH smiles, kindly. 

                                          DC FIRTH
                        I got a D. Never was much shake at school 
                        work. I, uh, DCI Armstrong is ready to 
                        see you. 


          INT. POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY 3 (17.27)5252

          The room is square and serious looking. DC FIRTH presses 
          a button on the digital recorder and nods at MARK.  

                                          DC FIRTH
                        OK?                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  50



          The door opens, DCI ARMSTRONG enters. He s trying hard to 
          be the police officer he wants to be. 

                                          DC FIRTH (CONT D)
                        DCI Armstrong entering the room. 

          He checks his watch. 

                                          DC FIRTH (CONT D)
                        The time is 5.27pm. 

            ARMSTRONG sits and smiles. MARK frowns back. 

                                            MARK
                        So - what s this about?

                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                        When was the last time you saw your wife?

                                            MARK
                          Sarah? She s not my wife, well, barely. 

                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                        When was the last time you saw Sarah?

                                            MARK
                        Day before yesterday - some - time. 
                          What s this about? 

                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                        We had Sarah s DNA on file...

                                            MARK
                        Why?

          DCI ARMSTRONG lightly bites his lip. 

                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                          I cannot, for operational reasons divulge 
                        that at this point. 

          MARK looks at DC FIRTH and then back at DCI ARMSTRONG. 

                                            MARK
                        Is she OK? You re beginning to scare 
                        me...

            ARMSTRONG looks at MARK carefully. He bites his lower 
          lip. 

                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                        This morning a weapon was found - an 
                          adapted gun - in the HinkleyWay shopping 
                          centre. 

                                            MARK
                        The derelict place?                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  51



                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                        The patrol dogs found it. Nearby, we 
                        found some clothing with your wife s 
                        blood on it. 

          MARK sits there for a moment. DCI ARMSTRONG takes a 
            breath and looks at DC FIRTH who is frowning at MARK. 

                                            MARK
                        Her - blood?

          MARK makes a noise in the back of his throat. An 
            uncontrollable noise. 

                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                        This doesn t mean - shouldn t mean - 

          MARK isn t sure what to do. He tries to control his 
            racing thoughts. 

                                            MARK
                        When do we start looking for her?

                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                        We are opening an investigation with 
                          immediate effect and we hope to have your 
                        full co-operation in the matter. 

          MARK is full of energy. 

                                            MARK
                        We should just start - I should just 
                        start - looking - 

                                          DCI ARMSTRONG
                        We will be sending our search team out at 
                        first light tomorrow. But what we need 
                        from you is a list of all friends and 
                          acquaintances. Mark. You re going to be 
                        vital to this investigation. 

          MARK looks down at the table - then up first at the 
          frowning DC FIRTH and then across at DCI ARMSTRONG. 

                                          DC FIRTH
                        You can trust him Mr. Etches. He s a good 
                        guy. 

          DCI ARMSTRONG frowns at his DC. Unsure why the 
            interjection was needed. 

                                            MARK
                        She s still alive. I can feel it.

          INT. PAUL S HOUSE - STAIRS. DAY 3 (17.38)5353

          PAUL charges through the house. His Mum comes down the 
          stairs. 

                                            PAUL
                        Can t stop Mum. 

                                          MEG
                        How was the session?

                                            PAUL
                        Fine. 


          INT. PAUL S HOUSE - KITCHEN. DAY 3 (17.38)5454

          PAUL opens the cupboards - and pulls out two bars of shop-
          brand chocolate and an apple. 

          MEG follows him into the kitchen. 

                                          MEG
                          You re going to talk to me properly. 

                                            PAUL
                        Mac s waiting Mum. 

                                          MEG
                        Let him.

          PAUL frowns at his Mum. 

                                            PAUL
                        He said that Dad was the reason I was 
                          screwed up basically. And then he told me 
                        about how I reminded him of him. And that 
                        was sort of the end of session. 

          MEG is shocked by this. 

                                          MEG
                        He said your Dad was the reason - ?

          PAUL turns and looks at her. 

                                            PAUL
                        Dad or the divorce or... I don t know... 
                          I didn t... Can we talk about it another 
                        time?

                                          MEG
                        We re always talking about it another 
                        time, me and you, aren t we?

          PAUL smiles softly.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  53



                                            PAUL
                          That s because another time is always the 
                        best time...

                                          MEG
                        I m allowed to be worried about you. 

                                            PAUL
                          I know you are Mum.  

          PAUL thinks and then exits the kitchen. 

                                          MEG
                        Paul. Paul. You haven t even eaten.

          PAUL turns around and holds the apple and chocolate in 
          the air. 

                                            PAUL
                        Good for me. Bad for me. Bye. 


          EXT. PAUL S HOUSE/STREETS. DAY 3 (17.39)5555

          MAC stands practising with a yo-yo. He s doing badly with 
          it. 

          PAUL comes out of the house. 

          His phone rings. He looks who it is, he smiles and throws 
          the phone to MAC who catches it impressively. 

          And then answers. 


                                          MAC
                        ....I know... Oh, I ll make sure he gets 
                        his protein Meg. Mum. Meg. I m a big fan 
                        of protein... 

          PAUL pushes MAC in a friendly way. They keep walking. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Yeah. You too.

          MAC disconnects. And throws it back to PAUL, who fumbles 
          the catch. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                          Parental quicksand?

            A dead bird falls from the trees behind them. Neither of 
          them notice it. 

                                            PAUL
                          Something like that...                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  54



          MAC smiles and taps his knee with his hand. 

                                          MAC
                        Well, you know the only way to escape 
                        quick sand is by raising your legs slowly 
                        until you re lying on your back - on your 
                          actual back. Then you ll just float. 
                        Takes balls but it s possible. 

          MAC looks at PAUL, slightly more seriously. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        You OK?

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. 

                                          MAC
                          I mean... the Heather Langenkampstuff...

                                            PAUL
                          I knew what you meant. 

          They walk in silence a bit longer. They walk past a bin. 
          MAC dumps the yo-yo inside, then turns and walks 
            backwards in front of PAUL.  

                                          MAC
                          Because I ve had a thought - 

                                            PAUL
                        What thought?

          MAC does a bit of a moonwalk. 

                                          MAC
                        The Sixth Sense. 

          PAUL laughs, despite himself, won over my his friends 
          nagging insistence. 

                                            PAUL
                        Would you say everything you ve ever 
                          learnt about was from films Mac?

          Another bird drops from the trees behind them. 

          MAC turns front and starts walking normally while giving 
          this notion serious consideration. 

                                          MAC
                        No. Television been doing some important 
                        work for me recently. And then there s 
                        the whole complicated - nay, thorny - 
                        issue of internet pornography...                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  55



          INT. MARK S HOUSE - HALLWAY. NIGHT 3 (17.56)5656

          MARK enters his house, tired. 

          He takes off his coat. He rubs his face. Unsure how to 
          compute what just happened. 

          Then he starts to cry. 


          EXT. WOODS/DELL. NIGHT 3 (19.46)5757

          A bunch of kids are sitting around a couple of lanterns 
          drinking some sort of homebrew. 

          Amongst them are TRACY, JAY and ANNA, dancing in the 
          sunset. STEVE watches them. And we watch as if from a 
            distance. 


          EXT. WOODS/DELL. NIGHT 3 (19.46)5858

          Further off, PAUL and MAC lying on their bellies, watch 
          the kids enviously. 

          PAUL watches JAY particularly closely. 

                                          MAC
                          Admittedly, for the isolated incidents 
                        they show in the film, maybe Bruce 
                          Williscould have been a ghost for 
                        those -

            A bird drops down from the sky, neither of them notice. 
          If they did, they d notice five birds, all dead, all in 
          the same spot. 

                                            PAUL
                        That bit with his wife and the wedding 
                        ring, I like that bit. 


          EXT. WOODS/DELL. NIGHT 3 (19.46)5959

          ANNA sits on the lap of STEVE, a beefy looking guy. 

          ANNA snuggles into STEVE s lap. She s playing drunk but 
          quite enjoying it. 


          EXT. WOODS/DELL. NIGHT 3 (19.46)6060

          MAC lies considering. PAUL lies watching JAY.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  56



                                          MAC
                        But what about the rest of his life? 
                        The bits the film doesn t show? I 
                        mean, what if he felt like a coffee... 
                        He walks into your standard American 
                        brand coffee place...

          MAC plays Bruce.

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                         Hi, I d like a coffee please . No 
                          answer.  Excuse me, but I d like a cup 
                        of coffee . No answer. 

          PAUL suddenly notices SARAH. Now a Fade. And with a light 
            emanating from her chest. 

                                          MAC (CONT'D)
                        They can t see him. He s a ghost. 
                        Well, eventually, he s going to be 
                          pretty - you know - annoyed. 

                                            PAUL
                        Yeah. OK. 

          Another bird drops dead.  

                                          MAC
                        It s a fatal flaw. 

          SARAH begins to walk away. She glances over her 
          shoulder to PAUL. PAUL stands as if to follow her.  

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                           Hello, hello, where s my coffee . I 
                          mean... like he hasn t guessed he s a 
                          ghost. Bruce Willis looks like a man who 
                        likes coffee. 

          MAC checks his friend s face. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        You OK Paul? 

            Behind them NEIL appears, he s been following SARAH, he 
          ducks out of view. Then he spies out, and is very 
            surprised to see PAUL - again. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Who s here?

          PAUL says nothing. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        What is it? Where is it?                  THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  57



          We watch with MAC s eyes as PAUL decides and then 
            scrambles to follow SARAH. Another bird drops dead. 

          MAC is left following behind. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Paul. Wait up. I haven t finished my 
                          theory -  

          PAUL breaks into a run. 

          MAC tries to follows, but then trips over a tree root 
          and lands face first in the dirt. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                          Paul... Paul!

          NEIL runs past MAC. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        And who the fuck are you?

          NEIL keeps on going. MAC realiseshe s alone. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        This is going to happen a lot isn t it?

          Another bird drops dead. Narrowly missing MAC. He looks 
          up, enraged. And then resigned. 

                                          MAC (CONT D)
                        Good point. Well made. 

          PAUL - his face concentrating - his mind alert - makes 
          his way fast through the trees behind SARAH. 

          NEIL follows him - weaving between the trees. 


          EXT. WOODLAND. NIGHT 3 (19.49)6161

          But another force is moving faster and harder than PAUL 
          and NEIL. 

          We just catch kinetic glimpses. Maybe it s clear it s 
            POLUS. Maybe it isn t. 


          INT. NEIL S CARAVAN. NIGHT 3 (19.49)6262

          HELEN lets herself in, using a torch to light her way - 
          she looks around at the filth and the squalor. 

          She lights the calorgas lamp with a match and turns off 
          and puts down the torch.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  58



          EXT. WOODLAND. NIGHT 3 (19.50)6363

          SARAH keeps walking. Another bird drops dead. 

                                            NEIL (O.S.)
                        So - you ve made your decision then?

          PAUL turns wildly to face NEIL. Who is looking only at 
          him. 

                                            PAUL
                        You again. 

                                            NEIL
                        Me again. 

                                            PAUL
                        Who - is she?

                                            NEIL
                          Sarah. Her name is Sarah. 

                                            PAUL
                        She s a friend?

          SARAH turns and looks at NEIL. 

                                            SARAH
                        Look after Mark for me. 

          NEIL nods at her. 

                                            PAUL
                        They can talk?

                                            NEIL
                        She can right now. 

          PAUL looks back at SARAH. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        She s looking for a place to pass. This

                        this country not fucked with enough to 
                        still have passing places...

          More birds fall from the sky. 

                                            PAUL
                        What?

          EXT. WOODLAND. NIGHT 3 (19.52)6565

                                            NEIL
                        There are holes in the world. Ascension 
                          points. There used to be loads. Then man 
                          invented concrete and... There s another. 

          NEIL indicates an older woman looking about herself 
            anxiously. She s in a nightgown. She has a glow in her 
            chest. She looks lost. 

          PAUL has too many questions. 

                                            PAUL
                        What are those - lights - in their chest?

                                            NEIL
                          They re beacons - when the dead near 
                          ascension their - souls - shine. Those 
                        that pass, that light lltake over their 
                        body with a bang. Those that don t, the 
                        light turns off and they know they re 
                          trapped here - forever. 

                                            PAUL
                        So this is about - ascension - this is 
                        about - heaven?

          NEIL turns. Surprised by the use of that word. 

                                            NEIL
                        You know, I ve got a friend who s going 
                        to really like meeting you. She s into 
                        the quasi-religious shit too. 

                                            PAUL
                        What?

                                            NEIL
                          Heaven s a big word. This is about death 
                        kid. Only death. 

          Off PAUL. 


          INT. NEIL S CARAVAN. NIGHT 3 (19.53)6666

          HELEN looks around the van. What has she let herself in 
          for?

          Then she opens her bag and begins to unpack her weapons. 
          Guns. Three of them, she lays them carefully on the 
          kitchen table.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  60

          More birds fall. NEIL uses his jacket to try and shield 
          him and PAUL. 

                                            NEIL
                          Fucking birds. 

          PAUL looks up at him. NEIL decides to explain. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                          Collateral damage. 

          PAUL stumbles, NEIL doesn t notice. 

                                            PAUL
                        Will any of this ever make sense?

          NEIL considers this. 

                                            NEIL
                          Probably not. 

                                            PAUL
                        Do you know how much danger you re in - 
                        we re in?

                                            NEIL
                          Probably a lot. 

          PAUL has a moment where something passes across his face. 
          He almost loses his balance, but rights himself. 


          INT. NEIL S CARAVAN. NIGHT 3 (19.57)6868

          HELEN is cleaning one of the guns with precision. She s 
          humming to herself. A tune we don t know. 

          Suddenly the lamp goes out. 

          She fumbles for her torch. She can t find it. She lights 
          a match. 

          She looks up to see - POLUS. 

                                            HELEN
                        Oh. 

          She clicks her gun. It doesn t fire. And what happens 
          next is violent, brutal and extremely quick.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  61



          EXT. WOODLAND. NIGHT 3 (20.02)6969

          SARAH s light turns out, she looks at it - slightly 
            aghast - then at NEIL. 

                                            NEIL
                        Oh shit.

                                            SARAH
                          Neil... Neil...

                                            NEIL
                        She s not going... She s not passing.

                                            PAUL
                        What?

            A tear rolls down SARAH s face. 

                                            NEIL
                        I m sorry Sarah. I m sorry. 

          PAUL wobbles again. He steadies himself again. 

                                            PAUL
                        It is... I sort of...

          PAUL falls backwards and begins to fit.

          NEIL runs towards him. 

                                            NEIL
                          Paul... Paul...


          EXT. CARAVAN. NIGHT 3 (20.03)7070

          On the roof of the Caravan, POLUS - his hands and face 
          covered in blood - makes a noise like death.  


          INT. CARAVAN. NIGHT 3 (20.03)7171

          The moon lights the caravan like a spotlight in a death 
          camp. 

          HELEN s body - her throat ripped out - bleeds across the 
            floor.  


          EXT. WOODLAND. NIGHT 3 (20.03)7272

          NEIL tries to shield a fitting PAUL as a torrent of birds 
          fall from the sky.                   THE FADES - Episode 1 - PINK AMENDS - 04.04.11  62



7373EXT. APOCALYPSE. VISION. DAY X 

          PAUL is running through ash and rubble. He s following 
          JOHN. 

                                            PAUL
                          Wait... please wait... who are you?

          JOHN stops at a ridge in front of PAUL, smiling down on 
          him.

                                            JOHN
                        No time to stop. 

          PAUL looks at him - now horrified. 

                                            PAUL
                        What is this - place?  

          He looks down on the other side of the ridge. 

          It s become a wasteland of nothing. It s a total 
            apocalypse. And on the floor in front of him lie the 
          corpses of MAC and NEIL.  

          PAUL looks at the bodies and looks at the wasteland - we 
          close hard on his eyes as he takes in the horror. What 
          does this mean?


          EXT. WOODLAND. NIGHT 3 (20.04)7474

            PAUL S awakens. He looks up at the worried looking NEIL. 
          And behind him a worried looking SARAH. 

                                            NEIL
                        What did you see? Look at me. Paul. 

          PAUL looks around. There are dead birds all around them. 

                                            NEIL (CONT D)
                        Look at me Paul. What did you see?

          We close on PAUL s face.
