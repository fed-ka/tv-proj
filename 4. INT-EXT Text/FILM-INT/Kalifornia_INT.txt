FLASH!! An oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat
up Chevy's windshield... revealing... THE DRIVER, 45ish, as
he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door.
The pretty teenage girl slides into the car. Dressed only in
a skirt and T-Shirt, she's soaked to the skin. Make-up runs
down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. She
seems nervous... scared even.
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
Thanks.
As she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has
been injured. It's bound with coarse white toweling and
stained with blood. In her other hand, she clings tightly to
a cheap yellow leather purse. He reaches forward and puts
his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing
against her leg, she moves away. He slides the gear-shift
into drive.
Another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls
out into the night.
Suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites!
Revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. Silhouetted briefly
against the paint chipped walls are two figures: A man, BRIAN
KESSLER, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black,
and a woman, CARRIE LAUGHLIN, 25, short black hair and tight
black clothes. Carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical
cord runs to a strobe light. Brian holds a flashlight in one
hand, a tape recorder in the other. He begins speaking into
the tape recorder.
BRIAN
Her father worked the night shift
here. Most nights he'd bring her
with him.
(pause)
She was eleven years old.
His flashlight scans the ominous environment. Carrie takes
flash photo.
The beam of Brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness,
revealing another room.
BRIAN
This is it. This is the where he'd
take her whenever he had the urge to
molest her.
The flashlight finds the corner in question. Flash!! The
warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room.
BRIAN
Of course! Nobody would have heard
her cries over the noise of the
machines.
A male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his car's
front window. The windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the
constant sheet of rain beyond.
DRIVER
Damn! This defroster never works...
The driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs.
He finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work.
The girl leans forward into the stream of warm air.
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
...Mmm... feels good.
She closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face. He watches
her. His eyes linger on her body.
DRIVER
Have a problem with your car?
She pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a
nervous smile.
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
No.
(beat)
My problem's with men.
He throws a curious look at her, then back to the highway.
Brian's flashlight moves around the room.
BRIAN
This is where she murdered her first
victim. They found his body over in
the corner, shot through the head.
The flashlight continues to search through the darkness.
BRIAN
They found her second victim over
there.
Another flash!!!!!
Very close on the girl's yellow purse... as the metal zipper
is pulled open. The driver notices her opening the purse.
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
Okay if I smoke?
DRIVER
(unconvincingly)
...sure.
The driver watches as she reaches into the purse... out a
soggy pack of matches. She looks at them... I look to the
driver.
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
My matches are all wet. You got a
lighter?
DRIVER
(scans the dashboard)
Yeah. It's here somewhere. It's my
wife's car. Ah... there it is.
He pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat. Out of the corner
of his eye, he sees the girl's hand slip back in her purse.
And stay there. She stares at the car lighter and... waits.
The driver glances at her, then back to the lighter.
FLASH!! As another strobe light ignites. Tape recorder hand,
Brian continues...
BRIAN
She lured them here with the promise
of sex.
(beat)
Imagine the anger and hatred she
must have felt returning to this
place. Did she use that to help her
pull the trigger?
Carrie snaps another shot. Flash!! The blinding flash
illuminates the night rain streaming in through the fractured
remains of the ceiling.
CARRIE
Shhhhhhhhh.
Brian stops talking. Carrie scans the darkness. From the
quiet...
A Thunderous Roar!!
A Blinding Flash!!
As... a semi-trailer crosses paths with the 70'S CHEVY.
Close on the girl. An intent expression on her face as she
watches and waits... for the cigarette lighter to eject. His
hand reaches deeper into her purse. The Driver tenses as he
sees this. Suddenly...
POP!! The lighter ejects.
The Driver reaches for the dash. The girl hurriedly lifts
something out from inside the bag. The Driver yanks the
lighter out... and whips a look to the girl.
Brian's flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the
rafters and catwalks. Scanning... Listening... Brian and
Carrie glance tentatively at each other... Then slowly Carrie
lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing
into the rafters. Carrie fires a shot, triggering a brilliant
Flash!!
CUT TO:
Flash! Out of the inky black... The glistening wet rock
emerges, hurtling downwards... Tumbling end over end through
the night rain...
The girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. She
looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling
slightly.
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
What's the matter?
DRIVER
(unconvincingly)
...nothing.
The girl reaches out, steadies his trembling hand... and
pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips.
When... in a THUNDEROUS CRASH!! The glistening wet rock comes
smashing through their windshield!!!!
Still hearing the whine from some tremendous dynamo, we emerge
from the inside of BRIAN'S RIGHT EARDRUM, pulling back far
enough to see his face.
KIM (O.S.)
Brian?
Brian is distracted, distant, not paying attention to the
game of "Twenty Questions" that he is playing.
BRIAN
Dead.
KIM (O.S.)
(sarcastic)
Obviously!
NEW ANGLE
A small party in progress. Graduate student types, smoking,
drinking. The usual. Carrie and Brian stand out in this group,
their look is more stylized, their attitude less complacent.
Carrie, in particular, looks restless.
CARL
Man or woman?
BRIAN
Man.
Carrie tunes in and pays attention to the game.
CLAUDIA
Real or fictional.
BRIAN
Real.
CARRIE
Ted Bundy.
Brian's eyes dart to Carrie. The look on his face tells
everyone she nailed it. Brian gets up to get another drink.
Several people laugh, amazed that Carrie knows Brian so well.
CLAUDIA
What a guess!
CARL
Doesn't count, she's disqualified.
CARRIE
Why?
CARL
Because you've been living with him,
and his thesis for the last year and
a half.
(beat)
He's probably been researching Ted
Bundy all week.
PETER
Carl, you are the world's worst loser!
Carl looks over to Carrie. She gives him the finger and a
cheeky smile.
CAROL, sitting next to Carrie, asks...
CAROL
Any word from that gallery?
CARRIE
Not yet.
CAROL
Nervous?
CARRIE
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget
these are the people who banned the
Mapplethorpe show. Anyway,
California's loaded with galleries.
CAROL
(nods toward Brian)
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed
to leave?
Carrie watches Brian disappear into another room.
CARRIE
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
CAROL
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his
for over three years now.
Carrie lights a cigarette. Her frustration is showing.
CARRIE
Yeah, well Brian's got 'til the end
of the summer, then I'm outta here.
She gets up and begins weaving her way through the crowded
room. Carol follows.
CAROL
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you
veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
CARRIE
Oh, I don't know... I think that
once I dye my hair blonde, buy a
string bikini and cultivate that
tan... I could be veggin' out with
the best of 'em...
(does a valley-
girl/beach bunny)
Like fer shurr!
Carrie and Carol share a strained laugh.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
The room's crowded with people. There's a lot of noise --
"shop talk," banter. Clipped conversations overlap, as we
find Brian with his friend Eric. They are in the midst of
making a blender of margaritas.
BRIAN
I'm talking about the mind and
culpability of a serial killer.
Someone who has no ability to
distinguish between right and wrong
should not be imprisoned, let alone
executed.
Eric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as Brian pours in the
booze.
ERIC
Oh, here we go again. Let's just lay
it all at the altar of misfiring
synapses, amok biochemicals and
horrendous childhoods.
BRIAN
Look, it's a fact, most of these
people suffer from a severe chemical
brain imbalance.
(beat)
That enough Tequila?
ERIC
Probably not...
Brian pours in the rest of the bottle.
BRIAN
(to Eric)
The answer is research and treatment
under hospital supervised conditions,
not the electric chair!
Eric looks for triple sec in the cupboards. PETER overhears
them on his way to the refrigerator.
PETER
Yeah, until it's your mother's head
they find in the refrigerator.
He pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two beers.
Carrie steps up behind Brian.
BRIAN
Executing the killer wouldn't bring
my mother back.
CARRIE
Thank god!
Brian turns to see Carrie now behind him. She wraps her arms
around his neck.
BRIAN
(sarcastic to Carrie)
Ha, ha.
ERIC
Yeah, but it'd sure make you feel
better, wouldn't it?
BRIAN
No, it wouldn't make me feel better.
Peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator.
PETER
...Looking for this?
Eric takes the triple sec from Peter and pours some in the
blender. He turns it on. It whines.
CARRIE
(to Brian)
If I have to listen to one more
"tweed" talk about his dissertation,
I'm going to throw up.
ERIC
(to Brian)
Label it anyway you want, the bottom
line is these people are evil, plain
and simple.
BRIAN
(continuing with Eric)
Okay, now you want to talk about
good versus evil? Well then let's
start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
CARRIE
Who do I have to blow to get out of
here?
BRIAN
(reconsiders)
A... I gotta go.
The place is almost empty. Early, still wet from the rain,
walks to the counter and sits down. He calls out to the
kitchen.
EARLY
Coffee and a bowl of chili, please.
WAITRESS (O.S.)
...Be right there.
The only other customer is an OLD MAN, sitting at the counter
nearby nursing a cup of coffee. His face half hidden under a
rain soaked hat. Early selects a tune from the countertop
juke box.
OLD MAN'S POV
Out of the corner of his eye he sees a bug (from the concrete
block) crawl out of Early's sleeve and onto the counter.
OLD MAN
(from beneath his
shadowy brim...)
The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a
man's body. Seven heads and seven
tails.
Early gazes at the Old Man curiously, then calls out to the
waitress...
EARLY
Make that to go.
Early notices the small bug crawling across the counter. He
leans closer to it and watches it. After a moment, he THWACKS
it off the counter with his thumb and finger. The bug lands
on the hot iron griddle with a SIZZLE!
EARLY glances at the Old Man again... then scoots over one
stool closer to him. Early seems curious to want to get a
glimpse under the brim of the Old Man's hat.
IN THE BACK KITCHEN AREA
The waitress is bagging Early's order to go... when the front
door slams shut!
FRONT DINING AREA
The waitress re-enters the room. It's empty. Neither the Old
Man nor Early are there. With Early's food in hand, she makes
her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door.
She glances around curiously. On the griddle, the remains of
something black and charred smoulders. Closer to the entrance,
she stares at the front door. The sign that hangs in its
window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads
"OPEN."
AT THE FRONT DOOR
She wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously
out the window... not a soul in sight. She locks the door
and begins closing up for the night. She turns to make her
way to the rear of the diner then notices something. Slowly
she moves along the side wall, past a number of highbacked
booths.
HER POV
Sitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are
a pair of RED HIGH HEELED SHOES (the same pair worn earlier
by the Pretty Teenage Girl). The Waitress glances nervously
about the interior. No one in sight.
AT THE BOOTH
She reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes. Looks
at them closely. Stares at the inside lining. Then suddenly
out of the quiet... a voice.
EARLY
...Size 6.
The Waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers!
Early leans out from behind the highback partition.
EARLY
That's right ain't it, size 6?
The Waitress... smiles, nods shyly.
EARLY
Happy birthday Adele.
ADELE
Early, you are so sweet.
This is ADELE CORNERS. She's 17, pretty, uneducated and
Early's girlfriend. She steps over to him, gives him a kiss,
then sits down on the seat across from him. She starts to
try on her new shoes.
ADELE
I feel kind of like the wizard of
oz, you know when she gets the red
shoes.
EARLY
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me
that chili there.
She passes the bag to Early. He digs in. Between bites, he
glances over to Adele who's enthusiastically pulling on the
new shoes.
A door swings open spilling light into a darkened room. Brian
and Carrie, a little drunk, return home from the party.
Their apartment is in an old converted industrial building
in a funky low rent part of town.
Brian walks ahead, Carrie trails behind him, peeling off her
clothes. She begins unzipping her dress, unnoticed by Brian.
BRIAN
Tonight turned out to be pretty
interesting.
CARRIE
The party?
She grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair.
BRIAN
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
CARRIE
It was definitely the high point of
the evening.
Carrie's dress falls to the floor.
BRIAN
(getting excited)
Just being there where it really
happened. It was different... more
visceral.
CARRIE
Mmm... I love it when you talk like
that.
Brian is at the foot of the bed, he turns to see... Carrie
has transformed. She has stripped down to her black bra and
panties, fishnet stockings, a nightporter style leather cap.
A surprised Brian stands there a moment. Looking at Carrie.
She looks great.
OMITTED
Carrie pushes Brian back onto the bed.
OMITTED
Carrie climbs on top of him. She kisses his neck. Slowly
starts working her lips across his chest and down his stomach.
Through the soot tinged atmosphere, sunlight filters in past
the curtained windows. Early is lying face down in bed, his
right arm extended over the side. Adele is in the kitchen
half dressed, and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of
Early's shirts. She realizes the iron is out of water, she
sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with
water. As she does she glances at a cactus on the counter.
OMITTED
ADELE
You thirsty Lucy?
OMITTED
She waters her small cactus (Lucy).
ADELE
Bet that feels good, don't it?
NEW ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR
Adele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by
a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor. She picks it
up.
ADELE
Now if that ain't Momma's little
angel.
Adele puts it back onto the fridge. It is a photo of a young
Early with his mother. In the photo Early appears to be about
ten or eleven. he stands next to his mother. Her arm is draped
over his shoulders, she is holding a drink. A cigarette butt
dangles between her fingers. Nearby a portable radio is tuned
to music, when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to
the news.
NEW ANGLE ON EARLY
A handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his
eyes.
The NEWSCASTER'S voice gets louder.
NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
...two more victims last night, when
a twenty pound rock smashed through
the windshield of their car...
CLOSER - EARLY'S FACE
Slowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off
one eye. Even closer on his left eyelid. It flutters... pops
open and blinks. Now... his eyeball stares right at us. The
pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light. The
newscaster's voice continues to amplify...
NEWSCASTER
This was the third such attack in
the past month and while an extensive
police operation is underway... no
arrests have yet been made.
The newscaster's voice quickly fades away. Early calmly closes
his eyes and drifts back to sleep.
Brian enters the darkened loft interior.
BRIAN
I picked up some Chinese. Did you
hear from the gallery?
Brian turns the corner, he's immediately greeted by a series
of erotic images being projected on the far wall. They are
slides of Carrie's photographic work. In regard to the nature
and content of Carrie's photographic work, her photographs
address the sexual collision of opposites. "What if's." The
subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly
unlikely partners. Studies in contract. Moments of passion.
BRIAN
(tentative)
You got your slides back.
From across the room, he hears Carrie's disembodied voice.
He drifts toward the couch.
CARRIE
Yeah, same old shit. Too graphic...
not suitable for mass consumption...
one of those... I forget. Who cares.
Brian finds her slumped down on the couch. He sits down.
She's got a drink in her hand. A bottle on her lap. She
continues to click through the slides. As she rambles on,
it's obvious that she's definitely under the influence of
something 90 proof.
CARRIE
Christ Brian I'm dying here... you
are too, you just don't know it yet.
You're too busy working on that damned
thesis... And, thing is... when you
finally do finish it, it's just gonna
get filed away on some shelf at the
University Library... then what?
Brian can see she's upset. Drowsy from the booze. He just
watches her. Listens. Her words linger in his head.
CARRIE
(continues)
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
BRIAN
(quietly)
...I do.
CARRIE
Then you can write anywhere. Let's
get out of here, while we still can.
BRIAN
Carrie, come on... we can leave
anytime we...
CARRIE
No we can't. We can never leave once
you start talking about tenure...
and vacation pay... and parking
privileges and... oh shit! let's
just go to California now, right
now, before it's too late.
BRIAN
...just like that?
CARRIE
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln...
point it West... stop when we hit
the fucking ocean.
The bold graphic sexual photographs of Carrie's continue to
accentuate her comments.
CARRIE
That's half the kick anyway. Doing
something you've never done before.
Experiencing something... different.
Something... unpredictable.
Brian notices an envelope on the floor nearby. He picks it
up. Opens it. Inside, he finds the photographs Carrie took
at the warehouse. Interested, he shuffles through them. He
becomes more and more intrigued with what he sees.
BRIAN
...These are great.
He glances over to Carrie... she's fallen asleep. He reaches
over and quietly pulls the drink glass from her hand.
Early spills through the doorway.
EARLY
Adele, who's car's that out...
Early spots his PAROLE OFFICER standing in the bedroom area
snooping around. He has a prosthetic hand which he uses to
search through Early's things.
PAROLE OFFICER
She's not here.
The Parole Officer hiccups throughout the scene.
EARLY
What are you doin' here? I ain't
supposed to be at the Parole Office
'til tomorrow, two o'clock.
Early notices the man looking through some of his letters
and papers.
PAROLE OFFICER
Social call.
The Parole Officer opens one of the closet doors, pilfers
through things inside, as if searching for something. Early
is getting pissed off but says nothing.
PAROLE OFFICER
You're supposed to call me when you
lose your job Early. I stopped by
the mirror factory today, you left
quite a mess behind there.
EARLY
Wasn't my fault...
He lifts his crudely bandaged middle finger.
EARLY
...It was dangerous there and they
treated me like shit.
Parole Officer steps over to the refrigerator, opens it,
snoops around inside.
PAROLE OFFICER
(swallows a hiccup)
Yeah... Well you never have been
'treated right'... Have you?
(hiccup)
Your father was pickin' on you when
he threw you out of the house for
stealing the tires off his truck.
The Marines misunderstood you when
they gave you that dishonorable
discharge.
He finishes with the refrigerator and continues his search
through the drawers and cabinets of the trailer.
PAROLE OFFICER
(hiccup)
...The police were way out of line
when they stopped you from beating
that bartender half to death. And no
doubt God'll be pickin' on you on
Judgement Day...
EARLY
I ain't got nothing against God.
It's the people he let come into the
world... lot of them should have
been stopped at the door. What are
you looking for?
The Parole Officer ignores the question. He steps up to a
sink overflowing with dirty dishes.
PAROLE OFFICER
That girlfriend of yours ain't much
for housekeeping, is she.
Early dismisses the place with a glance.
EARLY
I'm thinking about moving...
Early opens the refrigerator, grabs a bottle of beer.
EARLY
Maybe down to Texas... Probably get
some work on them offshore oil rigs.
Hear the pay's good... hell, the
weather's got to be better'n here.
Early sits down at the table. The Parole Officer steps over
to him.
PAROLE OFFICER
What are you talking about? You know
you can't leave the state.
(hiccup)
What you can do is get a job.
The Parole Officer pulls a slip of paper from his shirt
pocket, sets it on the table.
PAROLE OFFICER
You be at this personnel office,
Friday, three o'clock sharp.
EARLY
What is it?
PAROLE OFFICER
...Janitor's job.
EARLY
Oh man... come on, I don't want no
janitor job.
Early lifts his beer for another drink. The Parole Officer's
prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer
bottle, just inches from Early's lips.
PAROLE OFFICER
Hey, I don't give two shits about
what you want or don't want... I'm
telling you to be there Friday, three
o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be
here for dinner. You understand?
With that Early looks up at the man, almost defiantly, then
stands up. The Parole Officer hiccups again. Early stares at
him for a moment.
EARLY
You oughta think about putting a bag
over your head... Might cure them
hiccups.
The Parole Officer shakes his head in disgust and walks out
of the trailer to his car.

BRIAN'S DESK IN ANOTHER PART OF LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT
Brian's in the midst of working his way through pages and
pages of thesis notes scattered atop his desk. Using
chopsticks he shovels Chinese straight out of the carton as
he studies Carrie's warehouse photographs.
CARRIE'S POV
As we approach Brian from behind, moving closer, closer.
NEW ANGLE - BRIAN'S DESK
Carrie steps up behind him. She's rubbing her eyes, having
just awakened. A hangover beckons. Brian notices her.
BRIAN
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake
you.
CARRIE
Thanks. What are you doing?
BRIAN
Well, I sat down with my tapes and
your photographs, which are great by
the way... and I started writing.
Carrie grabs his container of Chinese and takes a few bites.
Listens.
CARRIE
So how's it going?
BRIAN
...I think it's the best stuff I've
done.
Carrie glances over his shoulder at his writing.
BRIAN
...and I think I know why.
CARRIE
Why?
BRIAN
Because I was there. And for a moment
that night I understood how she came
to pull the trigger.
CARRIE
(sarcastic)
This mean your finally going to finish
your thesis?
BRIAN
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's
a book here. Your photographs and my
research, together.
CARRIE
A book on the warehouse murders?
BRIAN
A book on some of the most infamous
murderers in America. I want to go
to where they lived and where they
killed and I want you to photograph
it.
Brian reaches down to the floor and pulls a large map of the
United States up and lays it out on his desk. He traces a
route West. Along the way, specific locations have been
circled.
BRIAN
What I'm thinking is, we can drop
down through Tennessee, across
Arkansas and into Texas, from there
it's a straight shot into California.
(pause)
"We don't stop... until we hit the
fucking ocean."
OMITTED
CARRIE
It's about fucking time, Kessler!
I'd just about given up on you.
BRIAN
We don't have enough money, but we'll
figure something out.
Carrie steps up to Brian.
BRIAN
...It's either the best idea I've
had in a long time... or there's way
too much MSG in this stuff.
Brian looks at the container of Chinese in his hand. Carrie
takes it from him, sets it down on the road map. Kisses him.
Early tries to get the engine to tick over. Then... He sees
JOHN DIEBOLD, his landlord, emerge from his house and begin
lumbering toward the Grand Prix. The two panting ugly-ass
pitbulls trot alongside their master.
DIEBOLD
(shouts)
Hold on a minute there boy!
EARLY
Shit!
Early tries the engine again. Still won't start. Diebold,
getting closer. The dogs are barking.
DIEBOLD
Goddamit, you're gonna settle up
that rent here and now.
Hurriedly, Early tries the engine one more time. It starts.
Grinning from ear to ear, Early pulls away before Diebold
and his dogs reach him.
Pissed, Diebold grabs a rock and hurls it, hitting Early's
car.
The car stops, dead in its tracks.
DIEBOLD
I've had it with your bullshit boy.
I want my money.
Early looks in the rear-view mirror and sees... Diebold
standing there confrontational.
Early throws the gearshift into reverse...
Brian steps up to a large bulletin board. He sees several
'Ride-Share' notes to various cities on the board. He pins a
Ride-Share note onto the board. We see the note is headlined
in red - "CALIFORNIA"
CAROL
You know, they say one of these
days...
Brian glances over his shoulder.
BRIAN
(sarcastic)
...the whole thing's going to slide
into the ocean... Yeah, I know.
Carol peers over Brian's shoulder and reads the note.
CAROL
"Looking for someone to take turns
at the wheel and share expenses...
on a week long cross country blue-
highways tour of historic murder
sites..."
(beat)
You gotta be kidding. Who in their
right mind would want to do that?
BRIAN
...I would.
Brian smiles at her and walks away.
CAROL
(watching Brian walk
away)
Like I said...
She shakes her head.
EARLY
Where's the personnel office at?
Carol turns to see Early.
RITA
(points down the hall)
First door on the left.
She walks away. Early's eye catches the bulletin board, he
sees in bold red marker - "CALIFORNIA."
BRIAN
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent
right outta "Deliverance."
(quotes from the movie)
"Still? Who said anything about a
still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
CARRIE
Funny, very funny.
Brian starts the car. It backfires loudly startling Carrie.
Brian laughs.
BRIAN
(quoting again)
"Aintry? This river don't go to
Aintry."
Through the windshield we see Early... Adele by his side.
CARRIE
You've got to be kidding me, they
look like Okies!
Brian honks the horn, Early waves back.
CARRIE
Jesus... They've probably got five
bucks between them. Turn around.
BRIAN
Lighten up...
ON EARLY AND ADELE
ADELE
Geez, they look kinda weird.
EARLY
You just smile, let me do all the
talking.
ADELE
How many times you gonna tell me
that?
EARLY
(smiling at Brian)
As many times as it takes.
Carrie watches as Brian and Early carry their things to the
trunk. Carrie leans forward and sets the trip odometer to
zero. When she sits back up, Adele is standing at her window.
ADELE
Hi, I'm Adele.
CARRIE
(reserved)
Carrie.
She turns away from the window...
ADELE
(shyly)
I like your hair.
Carrie turns back, rolls down window...
CARRIE
...Pardon?
ADELE
...I said, I like your hair.
CARRIE
...Thank you.
She turns and sees Early reflected in the side mirror watching
her. He grins at her, Carrie looks away.
NEW ANGLE: FROM INSIDE THE TRUNK OF THE LINCOLN
Brian crams the last of the bags in, as Early watches.
BRIAN
Tight fit.
EARLY
Best kind.
Brian looks to him, Early grins and winks. Brian slams the
Lincoln trunk lid shut.
SCREEN TO BLACK
Flames consume the magazine photos of Elvis and Priscilla,
Farrah and Ryan, Early and Adele. Along with them, the black
and white photo of young Early and his mother.
Brian behind the wheel, Carrie riding shotgun. Early and
Adele are sitting in the back seat. An awkward silence
prevails. Brian clears his throat.
BRIAN
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and
Adele haven't had time for breakfast,
Early.
EARLY
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
BRIAN
Brian.
EARLY
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't
eat much in the mornin', never have.
Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky
Lager's my favorite.
Brian raises his eyebrow a tad, but is not really curious
about it.
ADELE
It's because of what he read in a
book once... That folks needin'
breakfast is a myth, or whatever,
put out by those cereal people.
A glance passes between Brian and Carrie. Is she for real?
CARRIE'S POV - IN VANITY MIRROR
Early motions Adele not to talk so much.
NEW ANGLE
BRIAN
So what do you do Early?
EARLY
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick
Mirror factory, or I used to...
ADELE
One night we figured out how much
bad luck he must have comin' from
all them mirrors he broke...
(beat)
Four hundred and ninety four years
to work it all off... After he dies,
he'll have to keep coming back to
earth over and over and over...
CARRIE
Karma.
Adele and early show no sign of understanding the word.
ADELE
What?
CARRIE
Karma...
(beat)
You know, if you do something bad to
somebody fate will pay you back by
something bad happening to you.
ADELE
That French ain't it?
Carrie glances at the odometer on the dash... THE FIRST MILE
clicks over.
Adele watches Carrie, intrigued by the obvious skill Carrie
shows with the camera. Brian glances into the rear-view mirror
at Adele.
BRIAN
So Adele, did Early happen to mention
the places we'll be stopping at?
ON ADELE'S REFLECTION IN MIRROR... then Early leans in front
of her.
EARLY
Yeah Bri' I did.
Adele leans against Carrie's front seat.
ADELE
(to Carrie)
Are you takin' the pictures?
CARRIE
(surprised)
...Yeah.
ADELE
Is it hard to learn?
CARRIE
Not really.
Early pulls Adele back toward the back seat.
EARLY
(to Brian)
You gonna talk to the people who did
those murders?
BRIAN
That's a good idea. Unfortunately
most of them have been executed.
EARLY
...Too bad.
Adele focuses her camera at the scenery out the side window
of the car.
ADELE
Look, Pigeon Forge!
ADELE'S POV
Road sign to Pigeon Forge.
EARLY
(under his breath)
Shush, Adele.
ADELE
Early, can we stop there... just for
a little while.
Brian begins talking into a small portable tape recorder.
BRIAN
The Novaks are all gone but the fence
that Michael Zaruba was hired to put
up is still here.
He glances to Carrie, who fires off several photos of the
fence and yard.
The Lincoln continues slowly down the long drive... Up ahead
through the windshield Brian sees a beautiful old farm house.
BRIAN
The Novaks embraced the young drifter
as one of their own.
The Farmer turns away from the front door.
FARMER
(muttering)
Goddamned ghouls...
IN THE KITCHEN
We see that Early and the purse have gone.
A small roadside diner. A fair number of people inside having
dinner. Adele, Early, Carrie, and Brian are seated at one of
the tables.
AT THEIR TABLE
Carrie watches Early eat with a kind of horrible, rude
fascination. He has no table manners at all. He eats with
his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right
hand. All the while, he chews with his mouth open. He's
serious about his "eating."
BRIAN
(studying his map)
Well we've come three hundred miles
so far. Not a bad day's haul.
Early doesn't bother to respond. He keeps eating.
BRIAN
You got any family or friends in
California, Early?
CU ANGLE ON EARLY
With a piece of bread he mops up the gravy on his plate.
EARLY
(chewing)
Nope... You?
ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE
Early's foot itches... He tries to scratch it but it doesn't
do any good.
BRIAN (O.S.)
No.
ADELE (O.S.)
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
CARRIE (O.S.)
No.
ANGLE - THE GROUP
As Brian folds up the map. Early takes off his boot, then
his well-worn sock. Carrie's look of disgust grows as Early
brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he
eats. Carrie puts her fork down: dinner is over for her.
ADELE
...Well, least we got each other.
That's somethin'.
OMITTED
OMITTED
Brian looks up, sees Carrie's expression... Then what's
causing it... Early mops up the last bit of food on his plate.
He notices Brian and Carrie staring at him and slowly puts
his foot back down on the floor -- then the sock.
Brian picks up the check to see the total... Starts pulling
his wallet out... Isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab
to Early.
EARLY
Thanks Bri', I'll get the next one.
(prompts Adele)
Think it's time we hit the sack.
Early winks at Brian, Carrie catches the wink. Early and
Adele get up and head for the door. Adele waves goodnight.
ADELE
(to Carrie)
Sweet dreams.
Close on Carrie, she is reflected in a mirror. Reveal, Carrie
wearing only a T-shirt is at the vanity angrily brushing her
teeth. In the bathroom next to her, a bath is running. In
the adjacent bedroom, Brian is in the bed working on his
notes.
CARRIE
(spits out a mouthful
of water)
You mean because I object to having
somebody take off their shoe and
scratch their foot while I'm eating
I'm prejudiced?
BRIAN
(reading notes)
He can't help the way he was raised.
I kinda feel sorry for him.
Carrie pauses in brushing her teeth.
CARRIE
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you
didn't get a whiff of that sock?
BRIAN (O.S.)
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
CARRIE
(under her breath)
Up yours.
BRIAN
I heard that.
Carrie finishes brushing her teeth. Secretively she gives
Brian the finger...
BRIAN (O.S.)
...heard that too.
Carrie glances at the bath water running in the tub. It's
rusty brown and disgusting. She pulls the plug on the bath
idea.
The tap is running at the sink as Early empties the stolen
purse. He adds the last few coins to a small pile of cash.
EARLY
Can you believe thirty bucks for
this room... for what? A lumpy
mattress, that crummy TV and a
crapper.
ADELE (O.S.)
Early, sing me a song.
Early continues to sift through all the items from the purse.
EARLY
Which one.
Adele starts to sing a song.
OMITTED
Early start sing with her... As the song ends.
ADELE
(laughs)
Hey can we go to that Chinese
restaurant when we get to Los Angeles?
You know, to see all them famous
footprints?
ON EARLY IN BATHROOM
Early reaches down into the bottom of the purse and pulls
out a pair of glistening stainless steel scissors.
EARLY
Only if they let me put mine down
too.
He stares at the scissors curiously, then switches off the
bathroom light.
DARKNESS
BRIAN (O.S.)
Look Carrie, we're gonna be stuck
with these people for a week...
Click, a light is turned on. Revealing...
Brian has turned on the nightstand light. He and Carrie are
lying in bed.
BRIAN
...And all I'm saying is I think we
ought to try and get along with them.
That's all.
CARRIE
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're
with somebody else.
BRIAN
Carrie.
CARRIE
I don't want to talk about it.
Brian turns the light off. From the blackness...
CARRIE
Pretty smooth how he stiffed us on
dinner?
Brian switches the light back on.
BRIAN
He didn't stiff us. He paid for the
gas remember.
Silence... Brian reaches out for the light... when
CARRIE
I'm telling you he's nearly broke
and we're going to end up paying for
those two.
Brian decides to leave the light on. He moves closer to
Carrie. He slides up against her backside. He reaches for
her under the sheets. Kisses her neck.
BRIAN
You finished?
Carrie pushes her body up against his in response.
CARRIE
...Um, maybe... maybe not.
Brian's mouth moves down along her back. He slips beneath
the sheets. From the expression on her face, she obviously
approves... Yet she can't resist slipping in another remark...
CARRIE
...Um... Funky fucking sock.
Carrie rolls over on her back. Brian moves on top of her.
Kisses her stomach.
CARRIE
...and what's with that hair? Is
that grease or motor oil or what?
Carrie reaches down and grabs two fists full of Brian's hair.
She pulls him to her. He slides up along her chest, kissing
her. Things heat up. She reaches out, grasps his arms. Pulls
him closer.
CARRIE
...you believe that tattoo? Looks
like he had another girls name there
and carved it out.
Brian bites at her neck. She stops talking. His sweating
shoulder presses against her face. She turns her head to
encourage him.
In the dresser mirror... she sees their shadowy reflections.
Their bodies atangle under the sheets.
CARRIE
...and that body odor.
Their reflection in the mirror intrigues her. Intoxicates
her. His aggression excites her. She pulls him into her. The
metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as
they make love.
Then slowly, the camera bisects the plaster and lumber divider
and emerges in the next room...
TO FIND
Early leaning quietly against the same wall. Listening to
them. As he does, he uses the scissors to cut through the
crusty bandage on his finger. Then, across the room he notices
Adele in bed asleep... the scissors stop.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Early enters the diner drinking his morning beer. Adele is
not with him. He spots Brian and Carrie seated opposite one
another in one of the booths. He walks up to their table and
drops down uninvited on the seat next to Carrie.
BRIAN
Morning...
Early lifts his beer bottle in salute.
EARLY
Bri'.
CARRIE
Where's Adele?
EARLY
She wasn't feeling so good.
The WAITRESS arrives with a menu, offers it to Early.
WAITRESS
Breakfast?
EARLY
(burps)
Nah... Don't eat breakfast. Never
have.
The Waitress notices Early's bottle of beer.
WAITRESS
Ah sir... sir.
She gets Early's attention.
WAITRESS
(concerned)
We ah... don't have a liquor license
here. So I'm afraid...
EARLY
Well don't be, I got plenty more
where this one came from.
The Waitress gives him a curious look and walks away.
Just then, Brian look past Early... A surprised expression
crosses Brian's face. Early turns to see... Adele approaching
the table. Her hair has been crudely chopped to resemble
Carrie's. It looks like shit.
CARRIE
(at a loss for words)
You cut your hair.
Adele smiles, pleased with Carrie for noticing. She sits
down next to Brian.
ADELE
Early cut it.
(smiles at Early)
...Once he gets an idea in his head
there's no holding him back.
Carrie looks to Brian curiously. Adele is distracted by a
small cactus on the window near the table.
BRIAN
Nice job Early.
Carrie notices Adele's 'new' (stolen) purse... We see the
wheels turning in Carrie's head. How? Where?
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Carrie turns back to the dresser and gathers up the last few
things. She glances into the dresser mirror looking for
Early's reflection at the door, but he's gone. Relieved, she
turns the corner to grab her bags and finds Early standing
right there! Looking at her. He startles her.
EARLY
I got 'em.
He picks up her bags and walks out of the room. Carrie watches
him, then she steps to the doorway.
BRIAN (O.S.)
All set?
CARRIE
(startled)
Fuck!
BRIAN
Take your time.
CARRIE LOOKS BACK TO EARLY
Brian at wheel, Carrie next to him loading her camera. Early
in the back seat, Adele next to him pulls out some make up
from her bag, we see the little cactus from the motel lobby.
She begins to put on some lipstick. Early reaches into the
frontseat and grabs the manuscript that sits between Brian
and Carrie.
EARLY
(starts to read)
This the book your writing?
BRIAN
It's just a work in progress, kinda
rough.
EARLY
This guy killed a mess of people.
BRIAN
Who?
EARLY
Henry Lucas.
BRIAN
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only
convicted of killing eleven but he
claimed to have killed over three
hundred.
EARLY
Wonder what all them people done
made him so mad?
Brian looks to Early in his rear-view mirror.
BANG!!
The front tire blows... the car lurches. Brian reacts, pulling
the Lincoln to the side of the road in a dusty halt.
BRIAN
I guess it's your turn to pay Early.
Early nods and Brian looks over to Carrie, making sure she
heard. The four of them get out of the car.
The Fat Man pays THE ATTENDANT for gas and is handed the
restroom key.
The Fat Man turns the key and enters the bathroom. The door
starts to swing shut behind him, but...
TWO FINGERS catch it before it does.
ADELE (O.S.)
Only when I deserve it.
The Fat Man is standing at the urinal. He has a ureterostomy
bag he's emptying, when...
Early's hand hits the blow dryer. A whirring sound fills the
room. The Fat Man turns his head. Early lunges at him from
behind, yanks his head back and rips a switchblade across
his throat!
The Fat Man clutches at his throat. Sees the blood on his
palms. He looks up in shock. Early pounds the man's head
into the wall.
The Fat Man falls to his knees against the urinal. His hand
grasping the lever. The urinal flushes. Water flows. The Fat
Man's blood mixes with it. The urinal overflows. The blood
tinged water spills onto the white tile floor. Early pries
the dead man's fist off the lever.
Early struggles to turn the fat corpse over.
Early reaches in the dead man's pocket and removes his money
clip.
Early calmly washes his hands in the beat up ceramic sink.
He pulls a comb from his pocket and combs his hair in the
mirror.
The bloody water spiralling down the drain hole.
Early is driving. Brian riding shotgun, is making some notes
in his manuscript. Adele is teaching a reluctant Carrie to
play a card game called "SNAP."
ADELE
...Hey you're good. Thought you said
you never played before?
CARRIE
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
ON EARLY AND BRIAN
EARLY
...They never caught that Black Dolya
Killer, huh?
BRIAN
Dahlia, no.
EARLY
Now why is that?
BRIAN
Some people think it's because he
never killed again. He just
disappeared back into society.
EARLY
You don't sound too convinced 'bout
that?
BRIAN
I always thought it was the work of
a serial killer. Anyone who took
that much time and care bisecting
another human being must have been
enjoying it and would have done it
again. And again. Until someone
stopped him.
EARLY
That your... "theory", ain't that
what they call it?
BRIAN
Yeah.
EARLY
You wanna hear mine?
Carrie listens in as she continues to play cards with Adele.
BRIAN
(amused)
Sure.
EARLY
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Brian picks up his tape recorder.
BRIAN
(into tape)
Early Grayce, June twenty third.
Brian hands Early the hand held tape recorder.
EARLY
(into tape)
Well I'll just bet he's still alive.
Old, livin' in some trailer park or
somethin' somewhere, but still alive.
Thinkin' every night 'bout what he
done. Goin' over and over it in his
mind. How smart he was for getting
away with it.
Carrie is chilled by the intensity of Early's remark. She
watches him out of the corner of her eye. SMACK! Adele's
hand hits the pile of cards and she wins the game. Startled,
Carrie turns back to Adele.
ADELE
(to Carrie)
You lose!
BRIAN
(to Early)
I suppose anything's possible.
Brian puts one leg across the other and goes back to his
notes.
NEW ANGLE: CLOSE UP BRIAN'S SHOE
Revealing... the blood encrusted toe of his shoe.
NEW ANGLE: CU ON EARLY
EARLY
You ever play any pool Bri'?
EARLY'S POV
Up ahead a HONKY TONK BAR with a large sign "POOL TABLES,
BOWLING & MUSIC"
The patrons are young men and women. Eighteen to thirty. The
River's Edge kids today. Leather. Ludes and Beer. Wasted.
Rowdy.
We follow one of the waitresses through the bar... As she
passes by a pool table one of the players, A LARGE YOUNG
CRACKER, makes a grab at her...
LARGE YOUNG CRACKER
When you gonna give me so o' that!
She spins safely out of his reach.
WAITRESS
Maybe when you grow up a little sonny.
Some guys, close enough to hear her over the noise, laugh at
her put down. She moves on until she reaches...
Brian standing near a small high table. Early's not with
him. She sets four beers down on the table. Brian tries to
talk to her over the music. He leans in close. His mouth to
her ear.
BRIAN
These aren't Lucky Lager, I ordered
Lucky Lager.
WAITRESS
Sorry honey, 'ain't nothin Lucky
around here.
The waitress laughs. Brian smiles and glances around the
room. He notices the Large Young Cracker staring at him.
ACROSS THE ROOM
Early steps out of the bathroom and makes his way back to
Brian.
NEW ANGLE ON BRIAN
He watches the waitress disappear into the crowd, then turns
to find the Large Young Cracker in his face!
YOUNG CRACKER
What did you say to her city boy!
The Young Cracker is obviously very drunk.
BRIAN
Nothing, I jus...
YOUNG CRACKER
(cuts him off)
What's a jism gargling cum drunk
fairy like you looking at a pretty
girl like that for anyway?
The Young Cracker doesn't notice Early return from the
bathroom. He moves in next to Brian. Early is relaxed and
nonchalant as he looks over the Young Cracker. He leans closer
to Brian.
EARLY
(matter of factly)
You'd better hit him first Bri',
'cos it's comin'.
With his eyes on Brian, Early grabs a beer. Brian is scared,
and confused, with one ear and one eye on the Young Cracker,
the other on Early.
YOUNG CRACKER
This yur' boyfriend?
BRIAN
(dumbfounded)
What?
EARLY
Hit him.
Early looks at the beer.
EARLY
(angry)
Bri' this shit ain't Lucky Lager!
Early takes a swig off the beer, grimaces and sprays it out.
It hits the Young Cracker. The Cracker looks down at his
shirt in shock. Early is oblivious.
YOUNG CRACKER
(to Early)
Hey Asshole!
Brian is frozen, confused, doesn't know who to address. Early
continues to ignore the Young Cracker.
BRIAN
They don't stock it here Early.
YOUNG CRACKER
(to Early, furious)
Why you fuckin'...
The Young Cracker moves to hit Early. Early swiftly smashes
his beer bottle into the oncoming face. The Young Cracker
doubles over clutching his face in agony. Early kicks him in
the face, sending the Young Cracker to the ground. Early
finishes him off with several more kicks from his heavy work
boots.
Two large tough guys approach Early and Brian. Brian's heart
racing, Early cool as a cucumber. Instead of taking on Early,
they stop, reach down and drag the unconscious man away. The
waitress returns to their table.
WAITRESS
Sorry about that, he's always causing
trouble.
She sets down two beers and two shots, doubles.
WAITRESS
These are on the house.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Carrie and Adele split the last bottle of beer between them.
They are sitting on the floor and Adele has Carrie's foot in
her lap. She's painting Carrie's toenails bright red. Neither
of them is feeling any pain.
ADELE
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's
where I get it from. She wouldn't
hear of my moving in with Early...
on account of his just getting out
of jail and all. Ain't seen her in
nearly a year now. I wish she'd call
me, just once.
CARRIE
(interrupting)
What's Early been in jail for?
ADELE
(reluctantly)
Carryin' a gun.
CARRIE
...Anything else?
ADELE
An' resistin' arrest... At least
that's what the Police said.
CARRIE
Jeez... Adele!
Adele realizes she has said too much, looks at her watch.
ADELE
I'd better be goin'. It's late.
Adele hastily weaves her way out the door.
CARRIE
Great.
Carrie stares down at her feet. Red toenails. Cottonballs
between the toes.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
The door opens revealing Brian silhouetted in the doorway.
Under the influence of Lucky Lager, he fumbles with the key...
gets inside and noisily shuts the door behind him. Carrie
remains stonily silent, in the dark.
BRIAN
Gotta see a man about a mule... What's
wrong?
A few seconds pass.
CARRIE
The same thing that's been "wrong"
the whole trip. Your good buddy Early.
Carrie, in bed, switches on the side table light. Reveals
Brian leaning on the wall trying to get his shoes off without
falling over.
BRIAN
Who said he's my good buddy?
CARRIE
You sure been acting like you were...
(redneck accent)
...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin'
and ever' thang.
Brian points to the empty beer bottles on the table.
BRIAN
Hey come on, you two were drinking
too... so what's the big deal.
Brian throws his shoes somewhere and heads toward the
bathroom.
CARRIE
Yeah, and you should've seen how
terrified she was that he'd find
out. He beats her.
BRIAN
How do you know that?
CARRIE
She told me...
(adding)
...but only when she "deserves" it.
Did you know he was in jail?
BATHROOM
Brian turns on the light. Takes a piss. A long one.
BRIAN
Yeah, for stealing a car. Aaahhhh.
Suddenly, from right behind him:
CARRIE (O.S.)
Bullshit!
Startled, Brian turns to see Carrie.
CARRIE
...He told her it was for carrying a
gun, but the truth could be murder
for all we know.
No response from Brian. Carrie walks away.
LIVING ROOM
Carrie steps over to the bed, pulls the sheets back. Brian
leans out the bathroom door:
BRIAN
Stop being so fucking melodramatic!
If it was murder he'd still be locked
up or on parole, in which case he
wouldn't be allowed to leave the
state.
CARRIE
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave!
Geezus Brian!
Brian smacks himself on the forehead (a sarcastic "how stupid
of me!") He pulls his shirt off over his head, and admits...
BRIAN
(sarcastically)
Of course! The accent, the clothes,
and those table manners!... He's got
to be a mass murderer!
(pause)
What else could he be?
He switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway,
and begins to pull his jeans off. Carrie climbs into bed.
BRIAN
You know, it wouldn't even surprise
me if he turned out to be... a
Republican!
Brian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed. Carrie
switches off the the only light in the room. In the dark, we
hear a thud as Brian trips over a chair.
BRIAN
Goddamnit!... my fucking toe!
Carrie is driving. Brian is contending with a major hangover.
There is still a silent tension between Brian and Carrie
from the argument the night before. Early is in the back
with Adele. Brian moves his head and moans.
ADELE
My daddy always took sauerkraut juice
and tobasco sauce for a hangover,
mixed in one egg not two, and some
tomato juice...
From the front seat, Brian's hand springs up in a desperate
plea for an end to Adele's colorful description.
BRIAN
I'm okay, thanks.
Brian rolls down his window for some fresh air, as the car
pulls away.
Carrie glances over at Brian, who is now asleep next to her.
She looks up into her rear-view mirror...
CARRIE'S POV: IN THE MIRROR
Early is asleep, leaning against the door. Adele is rummaging
through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her.
Suddenly... The wail of an approaching ambulance gets Carrie's
attention. It roars by. Carrie glances in the mirror again.
The next instant, unexpectedly...
Brian's heads bangs against the side window.
BRIAN
What! What!
Carrie nods toward the back seat. Brian turns and sees Adele
looking back at them questioningly. Beside her, Early rustles.
BRIAN
What is it?
CARRIE
Look again!
Brian notices that Adele's rummaging has revealed an automatic
pistol in the open canvas bag. Brian stares at it. Early's
eyes open.
Brian is driving. Carrie keeps to herself. In her side mirror
she catches a glimpse of Early curled up in Adele's lap. She
watches a moment longer... and realizes that they are making
out. Beginning to kiss and touch one another.
The Lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. Brian
glances to the back seat to make a remark to Early and Adele
and sees that they are amorously engaged.
Brian and Carrie start to gather their stuff. Carrie opens
the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the
.45 automatic. She takes a few packs of film, and closes the
glove compartment.
EARLY
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little
sleepy,... think Adele and me are
gonna take us a fiesta.
CARRIE
(pissed off)
Siesta.
Carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition,
locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. Both she
and Brian exit the car. As they start to walk toward the
structure Brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. Adele
leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white
top starts to come up.
Even in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building
is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. The last
rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows.
The light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat-
hooks hanging from the ceiling.
Carrie is getting her camera equipment ready. She's quiet
and uncommunicative.
NEW ANGLE
CLOSE, on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest
on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room.
Brian pops a cassette in the player.
CARRIE
What's that?
BRIAN
A copy of a tape they found. He
recorded everything.
Camera in hand, Carrie begins to move about, despite the
fact that this place repels her.
Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The
small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we
slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman
being tortured and pleading for her life.
FLASH!! FLASH!!
Carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles.
Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. Screams
from the audio tape bounce off the walls.
BRIAN
(speaks into his small
hand held tape
recorder)
His mother had him working in here
before he was eight years old...
killing animals with a sledgehammer
that was bigger than he was.
Brian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into
another room.
BRIAN
When she was pissed at him, she'd
beat the shit out of him and lock
him in here overnight...
The pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady
whimpering.
BRIAN
(continuing)
...Eventually the boy wakes up one
morning, picks up that sledgehammer
and starts hurting back.
FLASH!! FLASH!!
Carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then
she stops, turns and walks out of the room. She's had enough.
Brian follows after her.
BRIAN
There's more...
CARRIE
I'm finished.
Carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear.
BRIAN
Look... I know you're pissed off
about the gun, and I don't blame
you...
Carrie wheels around to face him.
CARRIE
Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm
it, turn that thing off.
She switches off the cassette player.
CARRIE
I'm scared. A week ago you would
never have even thought to pick up
that gun. This afternoon you're out
there wielding it around like Clyde
fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake!
What's with you?
BRIAN
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was
stupid, I admit it, alright?
(pause)
But let's not blow this. Not now...
Let's just get the photos.
CARRIE
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
OMITTED
BRIAN
Oh come on, don't give me that shit...
you wanted to take these photos as
much as I wanted you too.
CARRIE
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever
it took to get you up off your ass
and on the way to California...
There's a big difference.
Carrie storms out of the place. She exits the tunnel, and
makes her way toward...
THE LINCOLN
As she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees...
Early and Adele fucking wildly!
Carrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them.
Fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on
them.
THROUGH CARRIE'S CAMERA LENS: ON EARLY AND ADELE
Early is sitting against the back seat. Adele is straddling
him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button.
Early's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press
up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's
finger presses down on the button, CLICK!!
Then in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back
seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving...
Talking dirty to Adele.
Keeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through
a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the
motor drive once all the film is shot out.
Then unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at
Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele.
A chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera.
She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's
arms. He startles her. She pulls away from him.
CARRIE
Brian I want him out of our car!
BRIAN
Why, what did he do?
CARRIE
Brian get him out of the car. Next
gas station either he leaves or I
do!
OMITTED
An electrical storm is in full swing.
The only person inside is a YOUNG MALE ATTENDANT. He's
watching TV behind the counter as Carrie enters. On the TV
we see a NEWSMAN. We only catch fragments of what he is saying
because the storm outside is affecting the TV reception.
CARRIE
Twenty dollars in the tank and a
carton of cigarettes.
In fact, each time the lightning flashes occur all of the
electrical power at the station is affected. The fluorescent
lights outside and inside begin to flicker and falter
sporadically.
NEWSMAN
...the ex-mental patient with a
history of arrests is still at
large...
Static.
Carrie looks at the TV, watches for a moment. It doesn't
hold her attention. She looks away and notices Adele leaving
the car. Adele walks toward a Coke machine at the other end
of the gas station.
ATTENDANT
Here's your cigarettes...
Carrie turns back toward him.
ATTENDANT
...And change. Better be careful,
looks like a bad one coming. Where
you headin'?
CARRIE
California.
ATTENDANT
Hear it never rains there. Must be
nice.
He buttons up his rain coat and goes out into the night to
gas up the Lincoln. Carrie pulls a pack of cigarettes from
the carton, nervously lights one up. She looks out the window
toward the Lincoln.
Simultaneously, as Carrie watches this... Behind her on the
TV screen... A wave of interference scrambles the picture.
NEWSCASTER
...we would like to repeat...
Static.
NEWSCASTER
...there is a nationwide manhunt
for...
Static.
The static clears and the Newscaster appears.
NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
...is believed responsible for the
murders of his landlord John
Diebold...
Static.
A video tape image of a familiar gas station recorded by a
surveillance camera.
NEWSCASTER
...of the fatal stabbing and robbery
of Mr. Joseph Davies Robbins...
NEW ANGLE ON CARRIE
She stares at the TV with growing horror as she notices a
familiar black Lincoln in the background. In mid-ground, a
male figure approaches the video camera unknowingly. Slowly,
Early's image becomes visible.
NEWSCASTER
If you see this man...
Carrie panics, turns toward the door and runs smack into the
arms of a dripping wet Early Grayce! Early stares at her and
drops his bag to the ground.
EARLY
I ain't ridin' in no bus... bitch.
Then... Early notices himself on the TV.
NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
...call your local police or FBI...
Static.
Early grabs Carrie around the neck and yanks her into the
back office. He pushes her down onto a chair.
EARLY
You just sit there and keep your
mouth shut.
He searches behind the cash register and finds a sawed-off
shotgun. He shuts the TV off.
EARLY
I knew that boy'd have a hogleg here
somewhere.
The Attendant rushes back in from the pouring rain. Early
points the sawed-off shotgun at him.
EARLY
Get over here.
Early forces him into the office.
EARLY
Sit your ass down in that corner.
Adele enters the adjacent room. She checks out the various
vending machines in search of candy. Early taps on the window
and motions her into the office. She sees Carrie in the chair,
scared to death, and Early aiming the gun at the Attendant.
ADELE
Early, what're you doin'?
EARLY
Go back to the car and keep Brian
there. I don't want him in here...
(beat)
Do it Adele... Now!
Adele looks back at Carrie, then hurries out. Early empties
the cash register.
EARLY
What's your name, boy?
ATTENDANT
(very scared)
Walter Livesy.
EARLY
Think. I might just have to kill you
Walter. How do you feel about that?
ATTENDANT
Not so good. You sure you have to?
EARLY
I don't know. Wish I did.
CARRIE
Early, just think...
EARLY
Shut your mouth.
Adele opens the door on the driver's side looking scared.
Brian is in the passenger seat. He's looking in the glove
compartment for a map. The .45 automatic Early gave Brian is
clearly visible. Adele stares at it.
BRIAN
Adele, what are you doing back here?
Adele gets in and starts looking under the seats.
ADELE
...Lost my purse... Could you help
me look for it? It's probably under
the seat.
The Attendant is reaching up, handing Early the money from
his pockets. Carrie is seated in front of him.
EARLY
Where you from Walter?
ATTENDANT
(nervous shake)
Vernon, Florida.
EARLY
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
ATTENDANT
Turkey mostly.
EARLY
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter
than most people think...
Early rips the phone out of the wall.
EARLY
Tell you what Walter, you lie down
there now... You make sure you stay
put for a while after we leave...
Okay?
The attendant nods yes.
ATTENDANT
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
EARLY
What do you need a Bible for?
The attendant has no response.
EARLY
You think I'm goin' to kill you.
Well that'd make me a liar then
wouldn't it?
ATTENDANT
No sir.
Early takes the Bible off the desk and hands it down to the
Attendant.
EARLY
Here you go.
The frightened young man lies face down on his stomach
clutching the Bible and starts to pray.
On the counter next to him Early notices a large stuffed
"happy face" display. "Free with every 20 gallon purchase."
He grabs one, stares at its face curiously.
EARLY
(mumbles to himself)
I wonder if Adele would like one of
these?
(beat)
Nah...
Suddenly... He puts the barrel of the gun between the "happy
face" eyes... Points it at the back of the attendant's head.
Carrie begins to scream. Early pulls the trigger.
The blast explodes the "happy face" and rips into the back
of the Attendant's head, killing him.
A thunderous crackle of lightning all but masks the gunshot.
The rain starts pouring down.
BRIAN
What was that?
Adele stares blankly back.
The room fills with billowing down stuffing. As the stuffing
floats to the floor it sticks to their hair, skin and
clothes...
EARLY
(surprised at the
feathers)
What the fuck!
Brian opens the door to leave.
The last of the feathers fall like snow. The whole room is
now white except for a red stain around the head of the dead
Attendant.
The car moves down the highway. Early in the back seat is
still trying to brush away feathers.
EARLY
Hate to be an Indian-giver but I'm
gonna have to ask for my gun back.
Brian reaches in the glove compartment. He removes the gun
and hands it to Early.
BRIAN
(to Early)
What happened back there?
Carrie sits in the corner of the back seat, covered in
feathers but not even noticing them.
CARRIE
He shot him in the head... oh God!
Adele turns to the back of the car to face Carrie.
ADELE
(raising her voice)
He did not, you liar. Take that back.
The Lincoln swerves off onto the side of the road. Adele
looks to the front again and steers it back onto the highway.
CARRIE
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking
insane.
EARLY
Everybody just shut up!
Early picks some more feathers off himself.
EARLY
You two just cooperate and do what I
say, and we'll all arrive safe and
sound in California, as planned...
unless, of course, Adele don't kill
us first with her driving.
NEW ANGLE - EXTREME CU
The St. Christopher statue swings from the rear-view mirror.
The windshield wipers sweep back and forth against the pouring
rain.
Adele enters the decrepit store. The others are inside. Brian
and Carrie are tied up. Brian watches Early intently as he
takes one of the bags from Adele. He begins opening one of
the carry out containers.
EARLY
What the hell is this stuff?
ADELE
It's Chinese food. It was the only
place open. You said you was starving,
you'd eat anyth...
Early opens another container. Stares curiously at the
contents.
EARLY
Yeah but, what is it?
ADELE
I don't know, they didn't speak too
good English.
Early sets the container down.
EARLY
And just what exactly are the Chinese
doing here in the middle of the
American desert anyway?... Didja get
the beer?
Adele somewhat reluctantly hands Early a bottle of beer from
a second bag.
EARLY
..."Chink" beer!
Early notices that Brian is watching him intently. He mistakes
Brian's interest for hunger.
EARLY
Oh hell, I'm sorry Bri. Adele, honey,
untie Brian, he's starving over there.
(pause)
Carrie, you want some?
Carrie doesn't respond at all. Adele unties Brian.
Early pulls out his gun, puts it on the table next to him.
Brian sits across from Early. He watches as Early rummages
impatiently through the carry out paraphernalia.
EARLY
Where's the damn forks and spoons
at!
Frustrated, Early finally takes a gulp of Chinese food right
out of the container. It goes down rough.
EARLY
...Is it just me, or has this whole
trip been goin' downhill ever since
we ran outta Lucky Lager?
Brian picks up a pair of chopsticks, then reconsiders, puts
them back down and, like Early, gulps from the container.
NEARBY, Carrie sits quietly. As she listens to the two men
talk... she notices something on her arm. She lifts her arm
up to get a closer look.
HER POV
She sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling
to her. Closer... and she sees that one of the tiny feathers
is tinged with blood. The Gas Station Attendant's. It freaks
her.
ON BRIAN AND EARLY
BRIAN
(quietly)
How many people have you killed Early?
Early stops... thinks for a moment.
ON CARRIE
She tries to brush the bloodied feather away... but with her
hands bound, she can't reach it.
ON BRIAN AND EARLY
EARLY
Well now, how many people d'you see
me kill?
Brian shakes his head.
BRIAN
None.
ON CARRIE
In quiet desperation, she raises her arm to her lips... and
blows the solitary blood tinged reminder away.
ON BRIAN AND EARLY
Early stares at Brian.
EARLY
...Well then, that's how many I
killed.
BRIAN
(unconvincingly)
If you say so.
EARLY
Damn right I do.
ON ADELE
Adele watches the tiny down feather drift to the floor.
ON BRIAN AND EARLY
Early picks up a different container and gulps some down.
After a moment...
EARLY
You never killed anyone have you
Bri'?
Brian shakes his head no.
EARLY
You never even seen anybody killed,
right?
Brian stops eating and looks at Early.
BRIAN
What are you getting at?
Early leans closer to him.
EARLY
You wanna tell me how'n the hell you
gonna write a book 'bout somethin'
you don't know nothin' 'bout?
Eye to eye, the two men stare at one another. Brian has no
answer.
EARLY
Ya see what I'm sayin'?
(beat)
Ha!
BRIAN
(nervously mimes the
same)
...Ha.
Early goes back to gulping down his dinner. This time he
gets a spicy one.
EARLY
(a nod toward the
carry out container)
...watch out for that stuff, it bites.
Brian gazes at the cluster of Chinese carry-out food
containers. An ironic reminder of an earlier conversation.
He lets out a weak ironic laugh.
BRIAN
(recollecting to
himself)
...way too much MSG.
Early is behind the wheel, not a care in the world. Adele
sits beside him playing with her camera. She turns and aims
the camera at Brian and Carrie in the back seat, their hands
are bound.
ADELE
Smile.
Neither makes any attempt at smiling. Adele snaps their photo
anyway. In the front seat, she sits quietly for a moment
then leans over to Early and whispers something to him.
EARLY
No way. I guarantee you he was
breathing when I walked outta there.
Adele sits back quietly. Carrie wants to speak but doesn't.
EARLY
Hey... Ain't we getting near the
next murder site... Bri?
BRIAN
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
EARLY
Hell it don't...
(beat)
...Hand me Brian's map there Adele.
One day I'm gonna pass some store
and see your book in the window. Me
and Adele gonna buy a copy for our
coffee table.
NEW ANGLE
Carrie silently fuming in the back seat. Brian stares at the
rope that binds his wrists.
Brian and Early are silhouetted against the dying sky. Flash!!
Early takes another photo.
BRIAN
...They asked them just before they
were executed why they did it. They
said "to be famous."
(beat)
Why do you do it?
Flash!! Early takes a flash photo of Brian, momentarily
blinding him.
EARLY
Do what Bri?
Early moves slowly toward Brian.
BRIAN
We both know you didn't have to kill
that gas station attendant.
Brian's eyes dart nervously to the gun dangling in Early's
palm. Flash!
BRIAN
You wanted to.
(beat)
Why?
Flash! Brian flinches. Early remains silent as he closes in
on Brian.
BRIAN
It make you feel good? Powerful?
(Flash!)
Superior, what? Come on Early, tell
me something.
(Flash!)
Were you angry?
Early's boot lands toe to toe with Brian's shoe.
BRIAN
(tentative)
Who are you angry with Early... your
mother, your father?
Eye to eye, the two men stand there.
EARLY
You want to know about my daddy,
I'll tell you about my daddy, Bri...
MALE OFFICER
Let's take a look.
FEMALE OFFICER
I'll call in the plate.
The Male Officer exits, unlocking his holster. The Female
Officer picks up the police radio and calls in the license
plate number.
Early driving. Adele in the passenger seat looks bewildered.
Carrie and Brian in back, handcuffed, eyes hollow with
exhaustion and fear. Then out of the quiet...
EARLY
I'm still waiting.
Adele looks across the seat to Early. Her face drained of
all expression.
EARLY
(disappointed)
Not so much as a simple "thank you."
Adele at a loss. Finally... confused...
ADELE
(empty)
...thank you.
EARLY
Thank you for what?
(becoming aggravated)
What are you thanking me for Adele?
ADELE
(hesitantly, she admits)
...I don't know.
EARLY
Well Adele... it was for...
(screaming at her)
...saving your fucking life back
there!
She shrinks away from him.
EARLY
(gesturing with his
fingertips a fraction
apart)
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from
spendin' the night at the morgue.
You understand?
CARRIE
He wasn't going to shoot her, you
murdering son of a bitch!
Early looks into the rear-view mirror. Brian tries to defuse
the situation.
BRIAN
Carrie... stop it.
CARRIE
(explodes)
What the fuck is wrong with you
Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes
for once and open your eyes... you'll
see that he is a homicidal fucking
killer. He is... for real!
BRIAN
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut
up!
Early is driving. He notices something in the distance.
EARLY'S POV - NIGHT
Off in the distance... an oasis of greenery.
OMITTED
Sequence omitted from original script.
Adele rambles on.
ADELE
(far away)
...You can forget about 'em forever
and then look at 'em and they're
doin' even better than before.
BRIAN
(watching the house)
Adele... we gotta do something before
Early kills someone else.
BRIAN'S POV
Of Early and Carrie as they are let into the house.
Adele is still rambling on about her interest in cacti.
ADELE
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em.
They can live for two even three
hundred years.
BRIAN
Adele for god sake please lis...
ADELE
(she glances over to
Brian)
There ain't nothing we could do.
Once Early sets his mind on somethin',
well thats the end of that.
Adele drifts back to the cacti.
CLOSE ON A PORCELAIN CACTUS
One of many we now reveal to be atop a fireplace mantle.
Adele leans in against the mantle and scrutinizes the cactus.
Carrie and Brian sit on the floor, back to back, their arms
bound around the leg of a piano by a pair of police handcuffs.
Mrs. Musgrave is standing nearby. She's overwhelmed. Numb.
She pours herself a glass of bourbon.
MRS. MUSGRAVE
(to herself)
It's just like in that dream I had.
If only I had seen their faces.
She takes her drink and sits down on the couch nearby. Adele
drops down quietly on the chair next to her.
ADELE
(tries to cheer Mrs.
Musgrave up)
You've got beautiful cactuses here,
I just love 'em. My momma used to
keep a garden.
Mrs. Musgrave downs most of her drink with the first try.
Distressed, her head slumps down.
EARLY (O.S.)
(from the kitchen)
Hey Bri... You ever stop to think
that if you switched the two letters
in your name...
(entering the room)
...it would spell Brain.
Early, his pistol wedged in his belt, appears from the kitchen
eating a sandwich. Between bites... He walks over and rips
the phone out of the wall unit. He glimpses Mrs. Musgrave.
EARLY
What's wrong with her?
ADELE
(sorry for her)
She had a dream that somethin' like
this was gonna happen.
Early notices the glass of bourbon in her trembling hands.
He steps over to her and takes the glass away.
EARLY
I'll bet she did.
He sets the glass down next to a recent picture of Mrs.
Musgrave and an ELDERLY MAN with silver hair.
EARLY
Where's your husband?
MRS. MUSGRAVE
(lying)
...I'm a widow.
Early looks at her, he doesn't believe her.
Early leans into frame, staring at the display case.
EARLY'S POV
Inside of it is a four foot long replica of the first ATOMIC
BOMB, "Fat Boy." Faded newspaper articles on the wall indicate
Mr. Musgrave had something to do with the bomb's initial
construction. An old photo on the bookshelf shows a much
younger Mr. Musgrave in a '50's kitchen. He is laughing and
embracing a '50's style female mannequin.
MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.)
My oh my, this is quite rare, quite
rare indeed. Come have a look...
Early's eyes drift over to a set of golf clubs that sit in
the corner of the room.
MR MUSGRAVE'S POV - THROUGH TELESCOPE
The planet Saturn and its glorious rings.
MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.)
Peaches?
OMITTED
THWACK!! The planet turns into a blur of light... then
blackness.
Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano, in the
background we see Mrs. Musgrave and Adele looking out the
window into the backyard.
BRIAN
(whispers to Carrie)
You gotta talk to her. She looks up
to you, she'll listen to you.
CARRIE
I tried talking to her at the mine.
It didn't work.
BRIAN
Then try again, (it's our only
chance.)
Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano. Across from
them, Early sits in an overstuffed chair looking through
Carrie's collection of erotic photography.
EARLY
(to Brian)
Have you seen this one? That don't
leave much to the imagination now
does it?
He looks at another photograph. Confused, he turns it upside
down, stares at it.
Mrs. Musgrave is laid out on the couch. Adele, deep in
thought, watches over the older woman. Finally Adele reaches
into her purse, pulls out her small potted cactus then walks
across the room to a table. Its top is covered with small
potted cacti. She gently places hers among them.
ON MRS. MUSGRAVE
Mrs. Musgrave begins to regain consciousness. Her eyes open
to find... Adele standing over her. Adele brings her finger
to her lips -- Shhhh.
Early looks through several more photos. He stops on one of
a nude woman's torso. Early looks at it for a moment... then
extends the photo out toward Carrie, comparing it to her.
EARLY
(smiles and shakes
his head in disbelief)
That's you ain't it?
Carrie doesn't answer him. Then, in the background directly
behind Early... Adele and Mrs. Musgrave quietly appear. Carrie
notices them as they start to cross the hallway to the
kitchen. Early sees Carrie's eyes glance past him. He turns
to see why... when...
CARRIE (O.S.)
You're right Early...
Early stops. Looks back to Carrie. Brian also turns to her
curiously.
CARRIE
...It is me. Do you like it?
Early looks at the photo again. Adele and Mrs. Musgrave now
cross safely to the kitchen. Carrie eyes meet Early's. He
smiles, pulls the nude photo of her close to his face... and
licks it.
Adele quietly opens the back door.
ADELE
Go on now... please.
Mrs. Musgrave is confused, is it a trick? She looks into
Adele's eyes... and knows it's not. The old lady turns and
walks out into the dark desert. Adele stands at the open
door, watching Mrs Musgrave escape.
ADELE
(in a whisper)
...Call me.
Early finishes looking through the photographs. He closes
the cover of the portfolio.
EARLY
Well they say there's room fur all
kinds in California... and that's
where we're gonna be this time
tomorrow. California.
(beat)
Adele honey?
EARLY (O.S.)
Adele?
Early enters, and sees Adele standing at the back door. Adele
turns to face him. Early looks past her into the night and
realizes what she's done. He strides across the room pulling
the pistol from his waistband.
AT THE KITCHEN DOOR
Early pushes Adele out of the way.
EARLY
(shouting)
Peaches! Come on back here. There
ain't nothin' for you to be afraid
of.
He steps outside and starts firing his gun into the
blackness... bullets THUNK into the cacti.
EARLY
(shouting over the
gunfire)
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
ADELE
Early! Stop!!
Desperate, Adele grabs a large potted cactus. She rushes
toward Early. Swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she
pummels the side of his head. He stumbles forward,
disappearing into the darkness. Adele stands outside the
kitchen door, bewildered. Then...
EARLY (O.S.)
Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!!
Early re-emerges from the shadows. Adele's eyes widen when
she sees him. His cheek has long bloody gashes where the
cactus ripped the flesh.
EARLY
(perplexed)
Honey... What do you think you're
doin'?
Adele starts to cry.
EARLY
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying
'bout? I'm the one got hit.
ADELE
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not
gonna climb up that Hollywood sign
with you... I decided. I think your
mean, and you hurt people.
A look comes over Early's face that we've never seen before.
That he's never felt before. Hurt. He doesn't know how to
deal with it. And he definitely doesn't like it.
BRIAN
Carrie, watch for Early.
CARRIE
What are you going to do?
BRIAN
I'm going to try and lift the end of
the piano. If I can... slide your
cuffs free.
Carrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. Brian presses
his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his
strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor.
Carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg.
CARRIE
What about you?
BRIAN
I don't know.
Carrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. Then she notices
a chair nearby.
CARRIE
Can you lift it again? Just lift it,
hurry.
Carrie grabs the chair. As Brian lifts the piano, she pushes
the chair beneath the underside of it. It holds the piano
suspended an inch off the floor. Brian drops to the floor
and slips the cuffs free.
When... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden.
A moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's
pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees
Brian and Carrie standing.
EARLY
You two been busy in here.
BRIAN
What happened to Adele?
EARLY
Well, let's put it this way.
(beat)
I need me a new woman.
A shocked silence. Brian and Carrie look to one another.
Carrie moves toward the kitchen but Early stops her! Brian
rushes at him. Early sticks the .45 automatic in his face!
EARLY
Sorry about this Bri...
He starts to squeeze the trigger.
CARRIE
(desperate)
Early, don't.
Early stops. He looks to Carrie.
CARRIE
I'll do whatever you want. You want
me to go with you, I'll go with you.
Just don't kill him.
Early deliberates the situation, then eases up off the
trigger... and smiles to Brian.
Then, without warning, he hits Brian over the head with the
butt of the .45 automatic. Brian falls to the floor
unconscious.
OMITTED
Early looks out over the expanse of the desert. He sees a
dirt fire road.
EARLY
I'll bet there's a 'door' out there...
save us some time.
Carrie doesn't understand what he means. Nonetheless, she
nods her head in agreement.
Brian is handcuffed on the floor. His eyes open slowly as he
begins to regain consciousness. He senses someone behind
him. He pivots around to see Mrs. Musgrave kneeling down to
help him.
Early still behind the wheel. Carrie sits up against the
passenger side door. She is tense and guarded. Out the window,
nothing but empty desert.
EARLY
Pass me a beer hon'.
Carrie quietly responds. She kneels on the front seat and
reaches into the back. She grabs a bottle by its neck, and
pulls it from the six pack of beer. Bottle in hand, she
hesitates a moment...
NEW ANGLE: EARLY'S POV IN THE DRIVING MIRROR
Early watches Carrie.
EARLY
You wanna hit me with that, huh?
NEW ANGLE
Carrie reconsiders and sits back in the far corner of the
front seat.
CARRIE
(not looking at him)
No.
She hands the bottle to him. Early reaches out for the beer,
but instead of taking it, he clasps his hand over hers.
He looks at her and begins to squeeze...
EARLY
Stop lyin'... I can see right through
you.
Early squeezes even harder -- Carrie begins to wince with
pain. She waits for the glass bottle to shatter in her hand.
EARLY
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?
(beat)
I know you better than you think...
CARRIE
(confused)
...You're hurting me...
Early hits the brakes. The car screeches to a halt in a cloud
of dust. Early squeezes on her hand even harder and begins
to drag her toward him.
EARLY
I seen the way you been lookin' at
me since we met... Snappin' my photo
when you thought I wasn't lookin'.
Wanting me...
Carrie turns her head away. Early pulls her closer.
EARLY
I saw you when I killed that boy...
He grabs her hair with his other hand... Pulls her head around --
forcing her to look at him. Early has Carrie right up against
him, looking right into her eyes.
EARLY
(whispers)
You were plenty hot.
CARRIE
(explodes)
You sick twisted fuck! You don't
know shit about me.
She struggles trying to free herself. Early, his face only
inches from hers, smiles...
EARLY
Sick... some people might say takin'
photos of me and Adele humpin' in
the back of the car is sick.
Carrie struggles even harder, but Early tightens his hold.
EARLY
...You know what I mean?
CARRIE
...I know I'd love to smash this
bottle right in your fucking face.
Suddenly... Early releases Carrie, taking the beer from her.
Carrie retreats back into the corner of the passenger side.
EARLY
That's better... Honesty... I like
that in a woman.
He gives her a grin, then opens the bottle.
EARLY
But I'll tell ya... when we get to
California, we're gonna have to do
something 'bout that gutter mouth of
yours.
Early takes a gulp of beer.
MRS. MUSGRAVE
He's pulled out all the lines. The
nearest phone is twenty miles east
of here.
Brian notices an old pickup truck parked outside.
Carrie leans against the passenger door. Early's eyes scan
the open desert -- looking for the elusive 'doors.' Carrie
reaches for her pack of cigarettes. Early, without a word,
reaches out and takes the pack from her. He crumples it up
and throws it out the window.
NEW ANGLE
Carrie's eyes go to the instrument panel. The temperature
gauge is in the red.
Early opens the back door. He grabs a box of supplies (some
rope, a kerosene lamp etc.)
EARLY
Come on.
Carrie slowly begins to respond. She slides across the front
seat.
NEW ANGLE: CLOSE ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
Carrie's hand crosses frame and pulls out a knob on the dash.
The front door is kicked open. Early enters the room with
Carrie in tow.
CLOSE ON EARLY
He looks around the room... A smile forms on his face.
EARLY
Howdy, my name's Early Grayce and
this is my girl Carrie. I hope you
don't mind us bargin' in like this
but a... we was on our way to
California when our car broke down,
and...
EARLY'S POV (AS HE EXPLAINS)
A living room fully decorated in '50's furniture. Sand covers
everything... Including...
A FAMILY OF FOUR MANNEQUINS placed around the room: The father
sits in front of the TV... The mother (the same mannequin as
in Mr. Musgrave's old picture) is toppled over a kitchen
counter... The little girl is seated at a table... The little
boy is playing with his toy plane on the floor.
EARLY (O.S.)
Well... it's gettin' pretty rough
out there, so if it's all the same
to you, we'll be staying the night.
Wind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows.
A solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room
area. Its flickering light finds... Early, stripped to the
waist, crouched over the broken TV set. He fidgets with the
knobs. Then the mangled rabbit ears antenna. Carrie sits on
some blankets in the corner next to the couch. She's scared
to death. Her eyes scan the battered room. Debris everywhere.
Amidst all of it, Carrie's erotic photographs have been placed
about the room.
ON EARLY
Still unable to get the TV to work, he smacks it a good one
on the side.
With the smack!... Carrie whips her look back toward Early...
To find he's lost interest in the TV. He turns toward Carrie.
Stares at her for a moment. Then with a hint of a smile, he
begins to move toward her. The time has arrived.
He reaches down, grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her
feet. Carrie doesn't resist. He's rough with her as he kisses
her on the lips. Carrie pulls her mouth away from his. She
seems confused, unsure of her feelings. Early watches her,
until her eyes come back to his. Then she steps forward
crowding her body against his, as she slips one hand around
his neck and kisses him deep and hard...
Suddenly Early breaks the kiss and backhands Carrie hard
across the face. She lands on the floor several feet away,
the palm of her right hand is bleeding.
Early looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass
protruding from his side.
He pulls the glass shard out, blood drips down his side and
onto his jeans.
Carrie gets up and races into the back bedroom, frantically
looking for a way out, there is none. On the bed the two
adult mannequins now lie naked. They have been placed,
intertwined in a grotesque sexual position.
Carrie turns and rushes back toward the door. Early intercepts
her and throws a punch to her stomach, which doubles her
over. Then Early sends a second punch to her face, she
stumbles backward, landing onto the bed amongst the
mannequins. Early begins undoing his belt.
EARLY
(friendly)
You'll like it...
A violent gust of wind sends several of the erotic photos
swirling through the air. One of the photos whips across
Early's chest. The wind holds it there momentarily.
EARLY
Not a lot, but you'll like it.
Early peels Carrie's photo off him, the blood from his wound
covers the back of it. He slaps it against the nearest wall.
It sticks. He walks toward her.
The high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm.
Brian is still driving dangerously fast. The dim lights of
the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road
ahead and the swirling sand.
He passes a road sign: 'DEVASTATION DRIVE'
Then... As the pickup truck comes around a corner Suddenly...
directly in front of him -- Headlights!!
Brian reacts... too late!!
The pickup truck ploughs into the vehicle, and tumbles end
over end through the open desert, before finally coming to
an abrupt halt.
With each thrust of Early's body, Carrie's badly bruised
face contorts with pain and hatred
FADE IN:
In the darkened bedroom, Early's solitary figure rustles
atop the bed. Slowly, he awakens. His eyes open. Across the
bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. In
the other cuff is Carrie's motionless hand.
Then, out of the corner of his eye, Early sees something in
one of the nearby rooms. Curious, he stands, shoves the .45
automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway.
As he passes through the living room and enters the hallway,
his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment.
EARLY'S POV
A blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps
around the front door frame... It looks like a magical "door"
shrouded in a wall of light!
ON EARLY
In disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the "door"... and
sees through a window at the opposite end of the house...
the morning sun rising. With that he turns his attention
back to the front door!
EARLY
I knew there was doors out here!
He walks toward the doorway of light. He grins as he opens
the "door" and steps through it. The sunlight momentarily
blinding him.
EARLY'S POV
A black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness...
Eventually it blocks out all the light until... WHAAMM!!!!
