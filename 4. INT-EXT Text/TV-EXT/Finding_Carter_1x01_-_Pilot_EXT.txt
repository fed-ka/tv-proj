PRESENTATION PURPOSES)

 -- working an unbent paper CLOSE ON a pair of hands -- Carter s
 a satisfying click, and clip inside the lock on a door.  There s
we pull back to see a triumphant Carter and several of her 
friends, including MAX, a sexy stoner.   

MAX
Niiiiice --

But then they hear the PERSISTENT BEEPING of an alarm system.

MAX (CONT D)
Uh oh.4.


Carter slips inside the darkened building.  A beat later, the 
beeping stops.  Carter pops her head out, Cheshire cat grin.

CARTER
(chiding Max)
When will you learn to trust me?

Carter ducks back inside; the others follow her in.



Carter is just waking up in this unfamiliar place.  She has 
slept a picture of her and Lori on the bedside table.  She picks 
up the picture, lays it next to her in bed, looking at it as she 
 a knock on the door.holds on to her blanket.  There s

ELIZABETH (O.S.)
Lynd --
(quickly)
Carter?  Are you up?20.


CARTER
Just a second!

Carter leans over the side of the bed, stuffs the picture into 
her duffel bag, then shoves it under the bed.  Then she lays 
back down, takes a deep breath, and calls:

CARTER (CONT D)
Come in.

Elizabeth enters, with a simple tray of toast and orange juice.

ELIZABETH
(re: the tray, a little 
laugh)
Believe it or not, I gave this a lot of 
 out there thought.  Your grandmother s
making omelettes and waffles, but I 
don t know what you like, or if you 
 even eat breakfast, and you just don t
seem like a breakfast-in-bed type, so --

CARTER
(dismissive)
This is fine.  Thank you.

ELIZABETH
Okay.  Good.  Well ... I was thinking, 
maybe you and Taylor could take the 
car, she could show you around town, 
introduce you to some of her friends --

CARTER
Or I could just go see the ones I 
already have.  

ELIZABETH
You mean, back where you ... 

CARTER
Yes.  Back where I know people.

ELIZABETH
What is that, a two-hour drive?
(thinks for a beat)
Sure.  I can take you.

CARTER

take me on playdates.21.


ELIZABETH

CARTER
 exactly what you offered a That s
minute ago.

ELIZABETH
You and Taylor.

CARTER
In other words, somebody has to be in 
the car with me.  

ELIZABETH
 willing to do whatever it Carter, I m
takes to make this relationship work.  
I just need to know you want that too.

Carter considers this; then:

CARTER
It would help a lot if I believed you 
trusted me.

SMASH CUT TO:



 been Carter and Max sit on a hill behind the Bowlarama.  They ve
there for a while, and Carter is clearly very bummed.  

CARTER
You called Khaz?  And the girls?  What 
about Casey?

MAX
She had to work.

CARTER
Really?

MAX
(admitting)
No.  
(then)
 Carter, you gotta understand, people re
a little freaked out --

CARTER
You want to talk about freaked out?  
Let me tell you about freaked out.  Not 
only is my mom not my mom, my name is 
not even my name, and apparently, my 
friends are not really my friends. 23.


MAX

He puts a friendly arm around her shoulder.  Carter leans her 
head against him.

CARTER
Thank you.

Max pulls out a joint.

MAX
And I got this.

CARTER
Thank God.

Max lights the joint and hands it to Carter.  ANGLE ON: Kyle 
watching them.  As they smoke the joint:

MAX
So these people, your family -- you 
like them?

So, probably not an assassin.

Kids grinding, drinking, smoking, puking -- it s a pretty fun 
party.  Carter is surrounded by a crowd, watching as she pours 
bourbon in a bar glass and ignites it with a fireplace wand.  

(THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS WILL BE CHANGED.)

CARTER
The trick is, you only want to drink 
the bourbon --

She tosses back the drink, fire and all.  

THE CROWD
Whooaaaaaa!

She slams the glass back down.

CARTER
-- not the fire.

THE CROWD
WHATTTTTT!
(they burst into applause)

ANGLE ON: Taylor, off in a corner.  GABE (not bad, could use 
some cooler clothes) hands her a drink in a red solo cup.  

TAYLOR
What is it?

GABE
Not sure.  Something lethal.

TAYLOR

Gabe keeps looking over at Carter.

TAYLOR
This is fun.

GABE
What?31.


TAYLOR
Me sitting here while you stare at my 
sister.

GABE
 blame me Was I?  Sorry.  But you can t
for being intrigued.

TAYLOR
Being abducted has its rewards.

GABE
She tell you what it was like?

TAYLOR
She lived in a two-bedroom apartment in 
 like she York, Pennsylvania.  It wasn t
was sold into child slavery.

GABE
s back, right?  happy she You re

TAYLOR
t  happy.  I don Yeah, of course I m
know how happy she is, though.

GABE
She looks pretty happy.

TAYLOR
Gabe, as you can probably tell, because 
you cannot take your eyes off her, my 
sister was having a totally fun and 
awesome life where she got to drink and 
smoke and probably be a complete slut.  
While I was standing off in some 
corner, never doing anything that would 
remotely qualify as fun or awesome, 
because I lived in constant fear of the 
terrible thing that happened to my 
sister.  Except ... it didn t!

Taylor drains the drink in her red solo cup.

GABE
Whoa, slow down --

Taylor grabs two Jello shots off a tray, gulps them down. She 
lets her hair down and removes an unnecessary layer of clothing.   

GABE (CONT D)
Taylor!  What are you doing?32.


TAYLOR
Making up for lost time.

Off Taylor, heading for the heart of the party.

DISSOLVE TO:



A car sits at the curb --



 first day of work.  Zubin has figured out who she is, Carter s
 juiced she works for him.  He sidles up to a customer, and he s
showing him a newspaper with Carter on the front page.  

ZUBIN
 her.  She works here.  Tell your That s
friends.

Carter smiles, pleased that Zubin is spreading the word.

DISSOLVE TO:



ANGLE ON: Taylor and Gabe, sitting together like they do this 
all the time, which they do.  Only this time, Taylor is dressed 
much funkier, much more Carter-like, in ripped denim shorts and 
wife-beater under a plaid shirt.  Carter, at work, is visible in 
the background, working the cash register.

GABE
I like this new look.

TAYLOR
I felt like I needed to do some 
 sick of seeing myself renovating.  I m
as this ... tragic figure.

GABE
 go Change is good.  Long as you don t
overboard, which you kind of did the 
other night.

TAYLOR
Yeah, that was rough.  But I definitely 
want to go to more parties, you and me.  38.


GABE

Carter walks up.

CARTER
What what?  Heard my name.

unmistakable fondness.

Taylor recoils, watching the two of them make googly eyes at 
each other.  She is not thrilled.

TAYLOR

Carter and Gabe break eye contact.

CARTER
(joking)
Nothing now.  Thanks, buzzkill.

TAYLOR
You two like each other?

Gabe and Carter look at each other.

Since when?

CARTER

TAYLOR
Great!  I m happy for you!  Guess I 
should have just stayed in my corner!

Taylor races out of the yogurt shop, colliding with a TOTAL 
HIPSTER in wire-rim flip-up sunglasses and a funky bowler.39.


CARTER
(to Gabe, re: Taylor)
What was that?

GABE
I have no idea.

At that moment, Zubin summons Carter back to work.  

ZUBIN
Breaks over.  Back to your post.

Carter returns to work behind the cash register.

CARTER
Can I help the next customer?

A customer puts a cup of yogurt on the scale.

CARTER (CONT D)
That is a very stylish cup of yogurt.  
 have to What did you do, layers?  I ma
try that myself.

The customer pays and moves off.

CARTER (CONT D)
Who s next?

CLOSE UP: on a cup of yogurt being placed on the scale.  It s 
filled to the top with gummi bears.

CARTER (CONT D)
Here we go, someone after --

 the TOTAL HIPSTER.  Carter looks at the customer.  It s

Carter freezes, unsure what to do.  Zubin glares at her.

ZUBIN

No response.

ZUBIN (CONT D)

CARTER

No, I got it.

Lori hands over a $10 bill.  Carter sees she s written on it: 

LOVE YOU MORE.

CARTER (CONT D)
(whispering)
Not possible.

Lori flips up the shade part of her glasses and locks eyes with 
Carter.

LORI
(also whispering)
Yes possible.

CARTER
Mom --

Then Carter sees, through the window, two pairs of cops 
approaching the yogurt shop, guns at their side.  

CARTER (CONT D)
(sharply, to Lori)
Back here.

Carter pulls Lori behind the cash register, and grabs a Yo Mama 
baseball cap and apron.

CARTER (CONT D)
Put these on.

As Lori does, Carter pulls a tray of free samples out of a 
freezer.

CARTER (CONT D)
Take the free samples, and walk out the 
front door.

LORI
Carter --

CARTER

LORI

CARTER
Go now.

ANGLE ON: the front door.  Elizabeth enters.  Kyle is by her 
side.  Both have their guns drawn.

CARTER (CONT D)
(to Lori, in an 
exasperated tone)

need somebody to pass out free samples. 
 (low, urgent, in Lori s
ear)
Now.

LORI

Lori walks toward the front door with the tray of free samples.  
Right past Elizabeth.  

ELIZABETH
(to Carter)
Where is she?

CARTER
Where is who?

ELIZABETH
Carter, this place is surrounded by 
cops.  I promise you, Lori Stevens is 
not getting away.  

ANGLE ON: what Carter sees through the window: Lori handing her 
tray of free samples to some grateful kids, and then walking 
quickly, purposefully, down the street, out of sight.

CARTER
Hard to believe you need this many 
 not exactly people to catch her.  She s
Lara Croft.  The woman can barely throw 
a Frisbee.  
(chokes up a bit)
Though it was fun to watch her try.

ANGLE ON: Gabe going over to Kyle.

GABE
(to Kyle)
 going on?Dad.  What s

KYLE

Carter sees Kyle.  And recognizes him.

CARTER
(to Kyle)

GABE

As Carter races out of the yogurt shop, away from Elizabeth,

FADE TO BLACK.
