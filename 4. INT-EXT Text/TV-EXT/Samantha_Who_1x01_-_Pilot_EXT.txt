      Upscale, downtown.  Samantha and Todd are about to go in.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Wait, I left my notebook in the car. 
                    I need to get it.

                                    TODD
                    I'll get it.
                          (off her anxiety)
                    Just wait inside.  If anyone talks
                    to you, just nod and laugh like you
                    have any idea who they are.

      Todd exits.  Samantha is about to go in... when ACROSS THE
      STREET she spots a MAN IN A CREAM-COLORED OVERCOAT.  He seems
      to be watching her.  A flicker of something -- recognition? --
      crosses her face... then is gone.  She gives a noncommittal
      smile, then enters the restaurant.


      Samantha walks alone.  MUSIC: the over-dramatic "Where Do I
      Go?" from "Hair."  Across the street, she sees, keeping to
      the shadows... the cream-colored OVERCOAT GUY she saw before.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Hey! 

      No response.  Sam starts across the street after him --

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    I said hey!  You! 

      -- and is almost run down by a TAXI!  The HORN BLOWS, the
      cab swerves -- and she's snatched away at the last second.

      On the sidewalk, she turns to see her rescuer: Detective
      Polk, the cop from her parents' house, who's just ruggedly
      handsome enough to become a love interest down the line.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Wow.  Thank you.  I'm such an idiot,
                    I was trying to talk to that --

      She looks: overcoat guy is gone. 

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    ...guy.  Wait, I know you, you're
                    that detective!  How weird is that,
                    that you were... following me, oh my
                    god you're following me.  Why are
                    you following me? 

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Someone tried to kill you.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    And?  You're protecting me?  You
                    think I might know who or why?  Sorry. 
                    If you want to know who'd want me
                    dead, though, I have some thoughts. 
                    Ready?  EVERYONE.  Who wouldn't?  I
                    would.  I need to be stopped.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    You're not so horrible. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                      Sweet-talker, now you're just flirting.
                          (pause)
                    But you probably know more about me
                    than I do at this point.  It could be
                    anyone.  Crazy patient.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      27.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Someone I testified against in court. 
                          (beat)
                    Jealous wife. 
                          (embarrassed)
                    You know about my affair?

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    You weren't too circumspect.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I'll tell you who didn't know: my
                      boyfriend.  That's what I'm doing
                    out here now, deciding if I should
                    tell him.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Yes.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    No, seriously.  What do you think?

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Yes.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Stop saying that.  If I tell him, I
                    can end up alone; if I don't, he
                    never knows.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    You'd know.  I've seen it plenty in
                    my job -- what's the worst thing for
                      a relationship? 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Going camping.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Worse.  Lying.  The guilt is like a
                    splinter, that gets under the skin...

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Or a grain of sand.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Why a grain of sand?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    In an oyster.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    No, that makes a pearl.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    So maybe guilt is a pearl.                                                                                      28.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Guilt is not a pearl, guilt is a
                    splinter.  Who's the cop, here?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    But I have nothing to feel guilty
                    about!  I didn't do anything.  Bad
                    Sam did it.  I'm Good Sam, Bad Sam
                    is dead.  God I sound like a TV movie,
                    I'm leaving before you lock me up.  

      She starts across the street -- and we hear A CAR HORN BLAST! 
      And Polk yanks her to safety yet again.  When she's safe on
      the curb:

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Maybe it wasn't murder.  Maybe you
                    just have bad peripheral vision.


      A doorman outside: FRANK, African-American, 50s, uniformed. 
      Samantha comes out of the building, carrying her suitcase
      and a few file folders from her desk.  Frank nods.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (re suitcase)
                    He's just going to need some time. 
                          (beat)
                    Sorry, I don't remember your name.

                                      FRANK
                    No reason to.  Only word you've said
                    to me in five years is "Taxi."

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Okay, yes, I'm a bad, bad person, 
                    can we move on now, thank you!
                          (pause; embarrassed)
                    Sorry.  Hard day.

                                      FRANK
                    I'm Frank.  Sorry for your troubles.  

      Sam reaches for his hand, and drops her folders.  As they
      scramble to pick them up, WE SEE A PHOTO in one: the OVERCOAT
      GUY.  Sam sees the photo, stands, staring at it.

                                      FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Ms. Newly, if I can say...
                          (as she looks up: hm?)
                    I know a fair amount of people, given
                    the chance you have, that would love
                    to go back and change things about
                    their life.  Seeing what I have of
                    yours... I hope you'll avail yourself.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I hope so, too, Frank.

                                      FRANK
                    So where do you go from here?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    God, that's the question, huh?  Get
                    back to work... find out who tried to
                    kill me... undo the damage I've done,
                    make up with Todd, and in general try
                    to win what I fear will be a daily
                    battle with my own nature.

                                      FRANK
                    I meant uptown or downtown.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Oh.                                                                                      32.

      She looks left and right, trying to get some sense, some
      pull, one way or another.  Frank feels badly for her.

                                      FRANK
                    There's a Tom Waits song.  "If you
                    get far enough away, you'll be on
                    your way back home."

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (nods at the wisdom)
                    Wow...
                          (then)
                    Okay, what does that mean?

                                      FRANK
                    That if you're trying to tell a story,
                    you'd best start at the beginning.

      Samantha thinks... then gets it, and moans.  PRE-LAP DOORBELL:


      Samantha stands outside the door, suitcase and files in hand. 
      The door opens.  Her mom, Regina, is there. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    You don't have to tell me why we
                    fought, yet, but at least tell me
                    this: are you the one who tried to
                    run me down?

                                      REGINA
                    Don't be silly.

      She stands out of the way for Sam to enter.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    That's not an answer.

                                      REGINA
                          (calling)
                    Howard!  She's back!
                          (as Samantha enters)
                    You can use your old room -- you
                    remember where that is, don't you?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Well, no, I don't.

                                      REGINA
                    Just guess.  It'll be fun.

      And as the door closes, we imagine we can hear Samantha sigh.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                    END OF ACT FOUR
