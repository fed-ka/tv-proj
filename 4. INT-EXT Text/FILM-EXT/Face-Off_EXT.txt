Disjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and
fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal:
JON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus.
On the adjacent
unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5).
Clutching a balloon,
Matty waves at his dad.
A happy moment, like so many
certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching
them THROUGH...
SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES
wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the
target.
They round the bend and disappear...
MATTHEW
Loses his grip on the unicorn.
Archer reaches over and
pulls him into his lap.
They happily ride together...
As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer...
Now we see the sniper.
CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient,
aggressive, sexual.
His finger closes around the
trigger.
BOOM!
A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back.
Bleeding... he
drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the
carousel.
His eyes desperately searching... searching...
searching... until he sees --
Matthew lies on his back -- still.
Slowly, Archer
reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see
COLOR for the first time...
Blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son...
TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full
color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating
away.
HANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS:
FBI BRIEFING ROOM
Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below
is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his
eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession.
CAROUSEL HORSE
sweeps by, as if marking time itself...
HOLY PLACE
Smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden
cross.
A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer.
The
glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a
light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb.
This
is no chapel... but an atrium.
Somewhere.
And as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's
Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device.
ANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE
sweeps by...
ARCHER
pockets his FBI badge, then holsters his gun...
CASTOR
sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in
front of it.
Totally hidden.
BRIEFING ROOM - CASTOR'S MUGSHOT
is on a computer screen.
His criminal dossier scrolls by
endlessly:
bombings, assassinations, mercenary
kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire...
Rookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully.
Other
agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid-
maps, man phones, etc. amid the take-out cartons and
coffee cups.
These people are on high alert.
ARCHER
Any follow-up from L.A.P.D.
Intelligence?
BUZZ
No, sir, nothing yet.
ARCHER
Get them on the phone -- now.
What about S.I.S. and our airport
teams?
WANDA
We've had everything from psychics
to satellites on this.
Even if
Castor was here... he must have
slipped the net by now...
ARCHER
He's here!
And we're going to
keep looking until we find him!
A silence descends on the chastised team.
As they go
back to work, veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer
aside.
TITO
Jon, these people have been
working round the clock -- you
gotta cut them some slack...
Archer considers his best friend's advice -- then...
ARCHER
I'll cut them some slack when I
cut myself some slack.
Archer marches out -- slamming the door behind him.
The marquee proclaims:
INTERNATIONAL CHURCH CHOIRS 18th-
21st:
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.
Castor exits -- politely holding the door for a beat cop.
A sleek Cadillac pulls in... stopping next to a Land
Rover.
LARS MUELLER -- a muscular, crystal-eyed jar-head -- gets
out of the Caddy.
An instant later -- LUNT MUELLER --
emerges from the Rover.
They are identical twins.
The men scan the airport carefully, then open the rear
doors of their respective vehicles.
Castor emerges from
the Caddy -- Armani clad.
Exiting the Rover is Castor's younger brother POLLUX TROY
-- skittish, brilliant, paranoid -- a human hummingbird.
POLLUX
You're 26 minutes late.
The
casing didn't fit -- right?
I
knew that cheap-shit Dietrich
would rip us off...
CASTOR
Oh, God -- !
POLLUX
What!?
CASTOR
I forgot to turn the damn thing
on!
POLLUX
You're kidding, right?
(to the twins)
He's kidding...
(grabs Castor
by throat)
... are you fucking kidding!?
Castor hugs Pollux lovingly.
Pollux squirms like a kid.
CASTOR
Bro -- everything went fine.
POLLUX
I hate when you call me bro.
Pollux heads for the jet.
Castor hands Lunt a wad of
cash.
CASTOR
Thanks for babysitting.
LUNT
Anything else?
CASTOR
I'll contact you when we get the
rest of the money.
(turns to leave)
Oh, and stat away from downtown.
The inversion layer's going to be
pretty thick around the 18th.
The twins nod... then take off.
Castor heads for the
jet.
Behind the wheel is Jon Archer.
Beside him is Tito.
BACK TO ARCHER
CASTOR
It's Archer.
(gun to Pilot's
head)
Go, dammit!
Suddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castor's hand.
he turns
around to see... the Flight Attendant behind them --
holding a smoking pistol.
This is Agent WINTERS.
WINTERS
F.B.I.!
Throttle down, captain!
But Castor elbows the throttle up.
The jet lurches
forward, throwing Winters off balance.
Pollux tackles
her as the jet picks up speed.
Heavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded
into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda.
POLLUX
Where's my brother?!
I want to
see my brother!
The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man,
flanked by two bodyguards.
Bullying through the media,
Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the
devastation.
Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded
on the ambulance.
A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face.
LAZARRO
The oversight committee would've
roasted us for this one -- thank
God it paid off.
Damn fine work.
ARCHER
Real fine, Victor.
Especially the
casualties.
Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three
bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked.
Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the
bodies.
Instinctively, the two men close ranks.
Archer grabs the
Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back.
LAZARRO
Classified information.
No
photographs.
Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and
leads him away from the media... and the carnage.
LAZARRO
You okay, Jon?
(off Archer's nod)
Then go home.
Tell Eve.
ARCHER'S HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET
A renovated Craftsman.
Sipping a carton of milk, Archer
pulls into the driveway.
He sits, gathering his
thoughts.
Words etched in the granite wall read:
IN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS
OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES
IN THE LINE OF DUTY
Archer watches as a workman engraves the last of the
three new stars among so many others -- each one honoring
the dead.
BRODIE
Didn't Castor give any clue where
the bomb might be?
ARCHER
Only one person knows -- his
brother Pollux.
And he'll keep
his mouth shut until it blows.
BRODIE
We could plant an agent in his
cell -- get him to spill the
location.
ARCHER
Pollux is way too paranoid.
The
only person he'd talk to about
that bomb is Castor himself.
And
dead men can't talk.
Brodie and Miller exchange a knowing look.
BRODIE
There might be a way around
that...
FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S BODY
Tubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice.
Archer slowly gets out of his car.
Trudging toward the
front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot.
His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile.
Tito drives into the Hoag compound.
Archer's beside him, juggling Castor's dossier:
documents, photos, etc.
TITO
Jon, this is goddam insane.
You
can't do it.
Archer says nothing... it's too late for debate.
Tito
parks.
The men get out and head for the lab.
TITO
You haven't got a chance in hell
of fooling Pollux.
Castor drinks,
smokes and walks around with a 24-
hour hard-on.
He's nothing like
you --
ARCHER
Don't worry... If Hoag can do half
what he claims, I'll get Pollux to
talk.
Archer reaches for the door -- Tito stops him.
TITO
It's not that simple, Jon...
Becoming another person --
especially him -- nobody can come
all the way back from that... not
even you.
Archer considers his friend's words... He toys with, then
removes, his wedding bang.
ARCHER
Keep this for me.
As Tito takes the ring -- a caring, but concerned look
passes between the two friends.
Tito tosses a pistol.
Archer catches it with his right
hand.
But to Archer's surprise, Tito frowns.
TITO
Nice catch.
But you used the
wrong hand.
He takes the pistol away -- and slaps it in Archer's left
hand.
Then Tito shoves him -- challengingly.
TITO
Shoot me.
(as Archer
doesn't move)
Shoot me!
Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead.
TITO
You want to be Castor Troy?
If
you hesitate for a breath, you're
finished!
Now -- shoot me!
Kill
me!
Archer holds the gun unsteadily.
Tito is disgusted.
TITO
You can't do it... because Castor
is tougher than you...
BOOM!
The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's
head.
Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's
still there.
Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination.
Clear and calm.
God's night.
Someone's God anyway.
Armed agents take their positions around a helipad.
A
jet-black helicopter drops from the sky like an angry
wasp.
As Lazarro watches -- Tito escorts out a heavily-manacled
"Castor."
Two armed agents leap from the chopper and
take charge of "Castor."
He follows them pliantly,
until --
TITO
Watch this hard-case -- he'll bite
your nuts off if he gets the
chance!
Archer gets the message.
He starts to resist the agents
and must be muscled into the chopper.
He's manacled
down.
Eye contact between Archer and Tito -- both aware of this
very real point of departure.
The CHOPPER DOOR SLAMS
SHUT.
It lifts off like a twister and SCREAMS away.
The watching team breaks up, wanders back to work.
LOOMIS
What a week for Archer to go on a
training op.
Maybe we should try
to contact him.
WANDA
Forget it.
He's knee-deep in
Georgia swamp by now.
They pass Brodie and Miller, who watch the chopper
disappear over the horizon.
So far so good.
An insanely starry night.
Van Gogh's night.
The night
he cut off his ear, anyway.
A RANGE ROVER SCREECHES up.
At gunpoint, Lars and Lunt
manhandle Hoag into the lab.
Police VEHICLES ROAR into position.
Squads of police
evacuate throngs of people.
CLOSEUP - BOMB TIMER - DAY
TICKS down to less than two minutes.
Working as a unit, the BOMB SQUAD carefully remove the
bomb's casing.
Inside, the complex guts glow evilly.
The men are tense, cautious -- and way out of their
league.
BOMB LEADER
Jesus... Any suggestions?
TECHNICIAN
Yeah... run
Castor pushes up his blast visor.
He looks grim.
BOMB LEADER
It's protected by a vibration
detector... One touch and...
CASTOR
Evacuate your team, Captain.
BOMB LEADER
Sir, you can't disarm it --
CASTOR
Just go!
The bomb squad hustles out.
Waiting until he's alone,
Castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its
switch.
The bomb's glow dies instantly.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - TIMER
stops at 26 seconds.
BACK TO SCENE
Not satisfied, Castor starts it up again -- running the
timer down to four seconds.
That's better.
Castor basks in the attention of the gathered media.
REPORTER RICE
The apparent target was a group of
Supreme Court justices -- due to
speak here today.
(thrusting microphone)
Mr. Archer, do you have any idea
who planted it?
CASTOR
That's classified.
But if he's
listening I have a message for
him:
(directly into
camera)
Nice try.
Now you know who's
really in charge.
Castor, carrying grocery bags, comes into the back yard
where Jamie practices free throws.
He watches her miss.
CASTOR
How about a game of horse?
JAMIE
Don't make me beat your butt
again, Dad.
It's harmful to my
developing psyche.
CASTOR
Afraid you'll lose?
Castor crisply sinks a free-throw.
Jamie glares, takes
the ball -- and tosses an air-ball.
CASTOR
'H.'
Jamie sneers at him.
He buries another one.
CASTOR
Try putting a higher arc on the
ball... and square your shoulders
to the basket.
Begrudgingly, she listens -- and sinks a clean shot.
Pleased, she nods.
HONK!
A BMW pulls into the driveway.
JAMIE
Gotta go.
Karl's here.
Jamie trots over to greet KARL (17) -- a clean-cut
preppie.
Opening the car door dor her, Karl waves,
smiling at Castor.
Castor studies Karl carefully, not
liking what he sees.
Archer's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world.
A sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the
bird...
PULL WAY, WAY BACK to reveal:
The prison's in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what
appears to be just an abandoned, rusty oil rig platform.
Archer rushes over to a transport chopper.
INSIDE COCKPIT
Archer searches for the keys.
No go.
He throws
switches.
Nothing works.
Guards pour out of the hatch -- FIRING.
Archer leaps
from the chopper and jumps over the side to the
platform's --
LOWER LEVEL
He lands hard on the slanted, corrugated shed roof and
rolls to the ground.
He grabs a high-pressure hose --
and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards
close in.
Archer BLASTS the guards with the WATER CANNON --
knocking Walton and others into the sea.
Archer upends a
stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards.
Archer spots:
TUGBOAT
pulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea.
Archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail --
where the end of a crane's hook is tagged back.
Under
FIRE -- Archer frees the hook, which swings away from the
platform.
Hanging on to the hook, it swings him out over the ocean.
At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into...
CHOPPY SEA
He pulls himself into the ZODIAC and frees it from the
tug.
It ROARS off.
The nylon craft zips through the waves -- approaching San
Pedro Harbor.
The ENGINE SPUTTERS... low on gas.
ARCHER
Come on... come on...
Archer senses something... He looks up and...
Whoosh!
Something swoops down -- but it's just a
pelican.
He FIDDLES with the ENGINE -- which finally DIES.
Archer
grabs the oars -- about to start rowing when --
Another swoop!
This time it's the prison chopper.
Archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor.
An
idea.
WIDE SHOT
The chopper settles over the Zodiac.
Wind and water swirl around Archer...
CHOPPER
Walton, drenched but obviously rescued, has archer in his
sights... He starts to FIRE his MACHINE GUNS...
ZODIAC
BULLETS RAIN down on the boat -- destroying it -- as
Archer dives into the rolling swells...
INSIDE CHOPPER
Walton RAKES the debris -- shredding it.
The chopper does a final circle of the wreckage... then
moves off... its ROTOR WASH THRASHING the buoy.
UNDER BUOY
Archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy -- sucking
air.
Heading for the car, Castor is about to light up when --
EVE
Last night, I thought -- this
isn't my husband.
He pockets the smoke.
Eve is there, dressed somberly.
EVE
Then I woke up in the middle of
the night -- and found you passed
out in the study.
CASTOR
I couldn't sleep -- you roll
around a lot.
(jingles car keys)
Anyway, I'm late.
EVE
Jon, you know what day it is.
I
know it's difficult for you, but
we still have to go.
CASTOR
Can't we skip it just this once?
I gotta 'protect and serve', you
know.
EVE
'Protect and serve' later.
You're
going.
CASTOR
Okay, if you insist.
But -- you
drive.
He climbs into the front seat beside her.
A pastoral, hilly area near the coast.
CASTOR
So who's this Karl creep Jamie's
been seeing?
He's a little old
for her, isn't he?
EVE
I don't know... they're about the
same ages we were when we met.
(smiles)
Remember the all-night dentist?
CASTOR
Sure, how could I forget.
(changes subject)
By the way, you never said
anything about last night...
He moves closer, stroking her hair as his BEEPER sounds.
EVE
Aren't you going to get that?
He turns his beeper off, then touches her lips with his
finger.
Without knowing exactly why, Eve tenses up.
EVE
Jon -- this is hardly the time or
place.
Castor looks around in surprise because he sees she's
driving into --
SPRAWLING MEMORIAL PARK
They drive through the gates -- passing a church marked
"ST. MARY'S-BY-THE-SEA."
Nearby, the OCEAN ROARS.
It's beautiful here, striking and sad.
Now on foot,
Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of
graves -- with no idea where she's leading him.
Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone.
Castor
joins her and reads the etched marble stone:
Matthew Archer, Age 5
Beloved Son & Brother
We Cherish You Always
Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker.
EVE
Happy birthday, Matty.
She places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark...
a little bulldozer... a spaceship.
Overwhelmed with
grief, she collapses into Castor.
EVE
He took our baby, Jon.
He took
our little boy.
FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S FACE
He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy
whose mother is weeping into his chest.
The ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly
returns Eve's embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the
victim's pain.
CASTOR
Stop crying... stop crying...
stop ...
Something bobs up in the surf.
Archer is thrashed ashore
by the breakers... he crawls gasping onto the sand.
He
takes a few breaths -- then staggers up onto the beach.
Archer's heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon
taped across Tito's front door.
Some teenage cholos
notice him -- so Archer keeps right on going.
The automatic door lifts -- revealing Tito's old Buick.
The big V-8 RUMBLES as Archer pulls out.
He doesn't get
far as... menacing CHOLOS block his way.
CHOLO # 1
Where are you going?
CHOLO #2
Ten bucks he's the guy who popped
Tito!
The Cholos surround the Buick.
Archer's cornered like an
animal as the angry teens pound on the windows.
Archer HITS the GAS -- scattering all except Cholo #1 who
jumps on the hood.
Archer SLAMS the BRAKES -- sending
the guy flying.
He lands hard, but is only shaken up.
As Archer roars off, Cholo #1 pulls out his cell phone.
CHOLO #1
9-1-1?
I want to report a stolen
car and don't put me on hold!
Archer drives on -- listening to KFWB.
RADIO REPORTER (V.O.)
... the escapee is considered
extremely dangerous.
If you have
any information concerning the
whereabouts of Castor Troy...
He SHUTS it OFF as he sees in the distance:
HIS OWN HOME
FBI and LAPD vehicles are parked in front.
No way he's
getting near there.
In his rearview mirror Archer spots a cop car
approaching.
He quickly turns a corner as the cop slowly
cruises by.
ARCHER
No, Jon... you have to think like
Castor.
Where would he go...?
Archer gets an idea.
But as he drives on -- the cop car
backs up -- and reappears INTO FRAME.
Dietrich locks up his chic art gallery.
He gets in his
Lexus and drives out of the parking lot.
Dietrich slows down to check out the forensics team
swarming all over Tito's parked Buick.
Dietrich quickly
averts his face as he spots... "Jon Archer" inspecting
Tito's Buick.
DIETRICH
Jon Archer... some poor schmuck's
in big trouble.
ARCHER
Yeah -- me.
With surprising speed, Dietrich yanks a pistol from
someplace and jerks around --
Archer -- hunkered down in the back seat -- stares into
the barrel of Dietrich's pistol.
DIETRICH
Jesus Christ, Castor.
ARCHER
Drive.
And punch up your
cellular -- I need you to make
some calls.
DIETRICH
You're gonna get me busted!
ARCHER
You're already busted, Dietrich.
It's just a matter of time before
they pick you up.
Dietrich snakes the car past the crime scene and speeds
off.
DIETRICH
Man, when you came to me about
that bomb -- I knew I should have
blown you off... but that's my
fucking curse -- I just can't say
no to a friend.
ARCHER
You can't say no to money.
DIETRICH
That's my other curse.
Cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low-
rent streets.
Emerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo,
Fitch and their sexy girl friends, LIVIA and Cindee.
Curious, Castor approaches the car, keeping a safe
distance.
He can see Jamie inside, struggling with Karl.
JAMIE
No... Karl, please.
He "shushes" Jamie -- but doesn't stop pawing her.
JAMIE
My father -- he's got a gun --
he'll -- he'll --
KARL
(pulls open belt)
That wimp won't do shit.
SMASH!
The passenger WINDOW EXPLODES inward.
Castor
drags Karl out by his hair.
Jamie scrambles out and
flees toward the house as...
CASTOR
Who are you to call Jon Archer a
wimp?
Castor heaves Karl into the WINDSHIELD -- SPIDER-WEBBING
it.
Somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind
the wheel.
The Beemer lurches away.
Using night-vision goggles, Pollux watches Sasha close
her drapes.
Visible in the b.g. on the sofa -- is
Archer.
POLLUX
(into cell phone)
-- I thought he might visit some
old friends of yours.
And bro, if
I didn't know better -- I'd swear
this guy likes being you...
Their silhouettes are visible against the shades.
PULL BACK...
Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes.
CASTOR
(into cellular)
We've got him sighted.
Okay,
Pollux, pull out.
BUZZ
What makes you so sure this guy's
gonna set up his own brother?
CASTOR
I've never been more certain of
anything.
Get everyone in
position.
Remember -- shoot to
kill.
Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue."
BUZZ
You heard the man -- let's saddle
up!
Archer slams out of the interior stairwell -- but BULLETS
force him to take cover behind the cupola.
Pollux FIRES at him from the other side.
Archer RETURNS FIRE -- driving Pollux back.
Stand-off.
POLLUX
Remember me?
Your 'baby brother'?
Trying to get the drop, Pollux carefully crawls onto the
top of the cupola.
POLLUX
You tricked me into telling you
things I never told anyone...
Archer hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the
crown.
POLLUX
Now take it to your grave.
Archer FIRES his PISTOL -- into the glass cupola -- and
SHATTERS the GLASS beneath Pollux's feet.
The cupola
disintegrates beneath his weight.
He plunges down
into --
ROTUNDA
Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the
floor at his feet.
CASTOR
Pollux...
Pollux is almost gone.
Castor looks up and sees --
ARCHER
Peering down into the rotunda.
CASTOR
OPENS FIRE --
ARCHER
Ducks the bullets as he disappears.
Castor desperately holds Pollux -- to no avail.
Pollux
slips away... and dies.
He turns to Loomis...
CASTOR
Get a medic -- now!
LOOMIS
Forget him, sir.
It's only Pollux
Troy...
Castor snaps.
Without hesitation, he jerks up his GUN
and PUTS a BULLET right in the middle of Loomis's
forehead.
Castor looks at the dead kid -- his rage barely abated
as -- Buzz and Wanda arrive on the scene and see Loomis's
body.
WANDA
What happened?
CASTOR
What the fuck do you think
happened?
Castor Troy just
shot him!
(beat)
What are you waiting for?
Go!
After Buzz and Wanda take off -- Castor gathers Pollux up
in his arms -- totally devastated.
Castor peers down over the city... trying to collect
himself.
He lights up a smoke... planning his next move.
His meditation is broken as a police chopper circles
above.
MATCH CUT TO:
LAPD choppers circle... squad cars prowl... cops and FBI
agents set up roadblocks.
The city is being sealed off.
Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming
undone... wobbly, wild-eyed... he suddenly picks up a
trash can and carries it down the street in front of his
face.
Pedestrians gawk at this madman.
What's he doing?
Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store.
He swings the trash can.
SMASH!
The store's WINDOW
SHATTERS.
An ALARM BLARES.
Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned.
Then
several youths leap into the window and start pulling
merchandise out of the store.
Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle.
An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb.
A cop leaps
out and chases as the looters scatter.
The driver stands at his door, radio in hand.
Sensing
something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister
of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt.
Archer sprays him in the face.
The cop gags and sags.
Archer quickly slips behind the wheel.
Inside:
Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows
darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside.
He
HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away.
Archer slows the squad car.
Up ahead:
Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main
road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic.
Archer pulls off the road, out of sight.
He flips open
the portacomp and starts to type rapidly.
Archer watches as the checkpoint of cop cars pulls apart
and screams east on the main road -- passing Archer.
Once the armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west.
A plank in the fence swings aside as Archer slips into
the yard.
He peers out from behind the garage.
A cop sits in a lawn chair, tuning a POLICE-BAND RADIO.
Archer approaches the bird feeder.
Quietly, he sticks
his hand inside -- and searches for the key.
Just when he grabs it -- CAW-CAW -- an annoying BLUEBIRD
hovers over Archer.
The cop looks over -- but Archer is
gone.
All Lars sees is the bird.
As Eve gets the key in her car door -- a hand grabs her.
She stifles a scream -- then sees... the two COPS.
COP
Sorry, Dr. Archer.
Where are you
going at this hour?
EVE
There's been an emergency at the
hospital.
COP
One of us will have to escort you.
EVE
Fine...
(a beat)
But please don't wake my
husband... he's exhausted.
Nothing happening here at 4 A.M.
Nothing indeed.
The
bored Cop keeps watch outside -- as Eve hustles in.
Castor gets into his car as he confabs with the twins.
CASTOR
Stay here.
Watch her like a hawk.
LARS
Think she knows?
CASTOR
Who cares?
She's going to be dead
by tonight anyway.
They're all
going to be dead.
The wife, the
kid... and the father.
Archer waits as Sasha appears with a long case.
In the
b.g., Adam plays on the Ranch House porch with Dietrich.
ARCHER
How's the boy?
SASHA
His ears are still ringing -- but
he'll be okay.
Archer opens the case.
Inside is a sniper rifle.
SASHA
The truck's all gassed up.
Look, Caz, there'll be F.B.I.
agents all over that place.
Maybe
I can talk my brother into helping
us.
ARCHER
'Us'?
No, Sasha -- believe me,
this isn't your fight.
He turns to leave -- but her look draws him back.
He
kisses her -- not passionately, but nobly.
ARCHER
Thanks...
She watches him as he walks off toward the truck.
Dressed in staid black, Eve joins Castor at the limo.
CASTOR
Where's Jamie?
EVE
That's what I'd like to know.
She
stole fifty dollars from my purse
and took off.
Castor's eyes narrow -- trying to read Eve.
EVE
Don't act so stunned, Jon.
You
know how hard it is to get that
girl into a dress.
CASTOR
I'll deal with her later.
EVE
Good.
Because I am fed up.
A crucifix gleams in the sun... and anchoring the
crucifix is... a headstone.
Like so many others -- except this headstone is Matthew
Archer's.
And hidden behind it is -- Jon Archer.
He
finishes assembling the sniper rifle.
For a moment he acknowledges Matthew's grave... the
regrets giving way to determination.
He looks down from
his vantage point onto --
At the foot of the cemetery knoll.
Rows of chairs...
white flowers... mourners.
A yacht is docked at the
breakwater.
INTERCUT WITH:
ARCHER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE
peers down through scope -- seeing...
Castor and Eve as they emerge from their limo.
Eve glances around, searching for Archer.
She comes eye-
to-eye with Lars -- who is watching her every move.
Archer TRACKS Castor and Eve as they sit in the front
row.
The ceremony begins.
PRIEST
We are here to celebrate the life
of Victor Lazarro.
We all know
him as a man who dedicated himself
to defending this great nation --
first, as a highly decorated
admiral -- then, as west coast
director of the F.B.I.
But not
all of you know what a deeply
spiritual man he was.
It was his
wish that his Requiem Mass be
performed in Latin.
(a beat)
In Nomine Patris, et Filii et
Spiritus Sancti.
Amen...
The PRIEST begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass.
ARCHER
fills the trank-dart with sedative.
PRIEST
continues the solemn ritual.
PRIEST
Domine, de morte aeterna, in
die illa tremenda quando caeli
movendi sunt et terra...
EVE
checks her watch... barely lifting her eyes away...
Castor absently pats her knee.
She's forced to return
focus to the service.
ARCHER
chambers the dart, twists a knob on the range-finder, and
carefully peers over the crucifix.
THROUGH SCOPE
Archer TRACKS THROUGH the mourners -- and FINDS Castor.
As the cross-hairs neatly cube his head...
BACK TO SCENE
We've come full circle from Matthew's death:
with Archer
the sniper and Castor the target.
The Priest's emotional reciting of the rites climaxes.
PRIEST
Requiem aeternam dona eis,
Domine... Amen.
FULL SCREEN - TRIGGER
Archer's finger wraps around -- he starts to squeeze...
POV THROUGH SCOPE - FIGURE
crosses behind Castor, blocking Archer's shot.
Archer's
finger freezes -- as the figure turns -- hair tumbling
away from her face.
It's Jamie.
AT SERVICE
Eve stiffens as Jamie sits down.
JAMIE
Thanks anyway, Mom --
(slides her $50)
But I wanted to be here for you...
and Dad.
Castor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing.
He simply takes Jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in
hers.
The honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles,
commencing their 21-GUN SALUTE as --
ARCHER
steadies himself, re-aims the sniper rifle.
He hears MOTION behind him.
Someone's coming and fast...
but this is his only chance.
Off-balance, Archer
squeezes --
THFFFT!
The SILENCED TRANK-DART explodes from the
barrel.
FOLLOW DART
Screaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide.
It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during
the 21-GUN SALUTE.
ON KNOLL
THUMP!
Archer is cracked across the head.
He slumps
down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters
his ear.
As the saluting GUNS FIRE in the b.g. -- we
don't know when, or if, this pistol fires...
AT SEA-SIDE SERVICE
The honor guard presents the urn to Mrs. Lazarro.
Fearful, Eve chances a glance around -- wondering what's
gone wrong.
PRIEST
The admiral's family will now take
his ashes to the sea...
As Mrs. Lazarro and her grown children proceed to the
docked yacht, Castor touches his ear-phone...
getting a message.
His eyes alight on a boathouse... adjacent to the
service.
CASTOR
(into headset)
Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car
around, then meet us at that
boathouse...
Guests head for their cars.
Eve seizes the moment and
steps over to Wanda and Buzz.
EVE
Wanda -- I need to talk to you.
WANDA
(reads her face)
Sure... what's wrong?
But then Eve looks past Wanda -- and sees Lars looking at
her -- tightening his "friendly" grip on Jamie's
shoulder.
EVE
Never mind --
CASTOR
Come on, baby.
I've got a
surprise for you.
Wanda and Buzz watch as they head up toward the
boathouse.
Lars and Jamie pull up in the car.
Lars listens to his
headset -- knows something is wrong.
LARS
Don't fucking move...
Among the last to leave -- Buzz and Wanda snap alert.
Over the CRASHING of the WAVES -- did Wanda hear
something?
Eve rushes to the car -- it's empty.
Jamie is gone.
EVE
Jamie?
Jamie!
BULLETS SHRED the WINDOWS behind her.
being scattered at sea.
Castor and Lars RIDDLE Sasha.
She drops.
Archer FIRES
back -- killing Lars and driving Castor back.
Archer leans beside the mortally-wounded Sasha.
SASHA
... Help Adam... don't let him end
up like us...
She dies in his arms.
Wounded, Dietrich crawls over.
Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror...
DIETRICH
Sasha -- !
BOOM BOOM BOOM!
Castor wastes Dietrich.
Archer BLASTS
back -- driving Castor outside.
Archer pursues.
Eve runs smack into Wanda and Buzz -- they're on the run.
WANDA
We heard gunshots --
EVE
Wanda, I've got to tell you
something.
Something crazy...
Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats.
Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun.
Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths.
Hearing a NOISE behind him --
BOOM!
Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair
hull.
He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when
Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two
steps -- until --
Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps.
The men collapse hard.
Castor's pistol clatters across
the yard toward the docked boat.
Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging
their fingers deep into their throats.
They throttle
each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is
dislodged.
His VOICE CHANGES, ECHOING with garbled.
STATIC.
ARCHER
Give up, Castor.
People are going
to find out.
CASTOR
Not if I kill you first.
They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from
the docked boat and picks it up.
Archer and Castor stop
dead in their tracks because --
Jamie appears, holding the pistol.
CASTOR
Give it here, Jamie.
ARCHER
No, Jamie.
Don't do it!
Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now...
Both speaking in Archer's true voice.
And nobody is more confused than Jamie.
ARCHER
Listen to my voice, Jamie.
I'm
your father.
CASTOR
It's a trick, Jamie.
I'm your
father.
Jamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled.
CASTOR
Shoot him, Jamie.
ARCHER
Jamie...
CASTOR
Shoot him!
Jamie FIRES.
Archer reels -- as a slug grazes his
shoulder.
Castor snatches the PISTOL from Jamie's hand.
CASTOR
You dunce.
No kid of mine would
miss so badly.
He aims the gun at Archer's head.
WANDA (O.S.)
Hold it.
Wanda and Buzz have burst onto the terrace -- their guns
leveled.
Eve and more agents are right behind.
CASTOR
Just saving the taxpayers the cost
of a trial.
So take a hike.
WANDA
You're both under arrest until a
D.N.A. test proves who's who.
CASTOR
I'm ordering you to back off!
Several agents waver -- unsure.
But not Wanda and Buzz.
WANDA
Put the gun down --
BUZZ
-- Now!
CASTOR
(beat)
Can't blame me for trying.
He grabs a shocked Jamie -- shoving the gun under her
chin.
Archer struggles to his feet as --
Castor -- using Jamie as a shield -- backs out the gate
to the garden.
Archer follows -- cautiously.
CASTOR
Say goodbye to Daddy --
Jamie whips out the switchblade -- sinks it into Castor's
thigh and twists.
She dives away.
FIRING wildly, Castor
staggers back through the gate.
CASTOR (O.S.)
You ungrateful delinquent!
OUTSIDE GATE
As Castor turns and staggers away -- he runs smack into a
confused security agent.
CASTOR
Give me your weapon -- now!
The agent hands over his UZI -- and Castor PLUGS him.
BOATYARD
Archer and Eve make sure Jamie's okay.
JAMIE
(to Archer)
Who are you?
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?
Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open.
CASTOR
limps away from the boatyard, towards the slips -- alive
with sunbathers and yachters.
Castor hustles along until he finds what he's looking
for --
Twin Cigarette BOATS -- racing boats -- being TUNED UP by
their suntanned crews.
He jumps into one of the boats.
BOAT CAPTAIN
Hey -- !
Without even looking, Castor SHOOTS the guy dead.
In a
flash -- Castor THROTTLES up the BOAT.
He sees --
CASTOR'S POV
Archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat.
CASTOR
FIRES -- peppering the dock.
Archer knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the BAIT
HOUSE BLOWS UP behind him.
Archer rolls into the boat --
FIRING.
Castor's hit!
A slug grazes his shoulder.
He grabs the
THROTTLE -- taking off.
ARCHER
FIRES UP the second BOAT -- in pursuit.
Castor BLASTS
back -- SHATTERING Archer's BOAT COMPASS.
CIVILIAN BOAT
speeds toward him -- causing a near-miss.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Running parallel, Archer and Castor BLAST at EACH OTHER
at point-blank range.
Their boats smash and pound each
other.
A police boat closes in on them.
Castor FIRES at the police -- obliterating both crew and
boat.
The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's
craft.
Archer's BOAT plows up and through the other.
EXPLOSION!
Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the
water.
The boat lands right next to Castor's.
Archer and Castor resume their battering... approaching
a --
TUG
pulling a barge.
Castor forces Archer into its path.
At the last
moment...
Archer leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as --
KA-BOOM!
Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which
EXPLODES.
CASTOR
swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off.
Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip.
But the boat hits a wave...
Castor loses the gun -- which skids away.
Archer slips,
his head hanging over the side.
Castor tries to ram
Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time.
Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it.
WHUNK!
It sinks
into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around
his neck.
As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts
Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain.
Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water.
Archer tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds
toward --
PIER
Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT
BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings.
But as they slug it out...
ANOTHER ANGLE
WHAM!
The BOAT careens off a piling -- and ROARS
straight for the shipyard.
COLLIDING with a shoreline
obstruction --
The BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow...
Archer and Castor go flying... onto the beach.
Archer and Castor lie dazed... then stir.
Castor sees
the pistol lying half-buried... he reaches for it.
But --
Archer gets it first.
He aims it at Castor as they rise.
CASTOR
You won't shoot me, Jon.
I'm
unarmed...
ARCHER
Okay, I have a confession to
make... but you aren't gonna like
it... You're right, I won't shoot
you.
Not in the face anyway.
BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest!
He jerks and
reels -- dropping to his knees.
He looks at Archer in
total disbelief.
Then he sinks to the ground and lies
still.
Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop.
Then he turns
and sees an FBI chopper heading his way.
Relieved, he
turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone!
Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning
stabilizing screw.
Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the
leg.
He buckles... but keeps going.
Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to
bury his face on the spinning blade.
CASTOR
It'll never be over, Jon... every
time you look in the mirror...
you'll see my face...
They struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer,
closer -- slicing into "Archer's" cheek.
At the last
instant...
Archer reaches the anchor-chain.
He wraps it around the
screw -- stopping the whirling blades.
Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer
moves.
Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his
wedding ring.
Just when he almost has it off -- Castor
suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight.
Eye contact between the two men.
Castor smirks, his
grasp slackening... as he finally fades away.
Archer
lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own
finger.
ANOTHER ANGLE
The chopper lands.
Buzz and Wanda rush over.
BUZZ
You okay, Archer?
ARCHER
What did you call me?
WANDA
He called you 'Archer' -- sir.
Archer finally realizes -- they actually mean him.
He
smiles -- Jon Archer's long lost smile.
FBI med-teams strap Archer onto a gurney.
Castor's inert
body is beside him.
EVE
Hang on, Jon... they're bringing
in their top surgical team from
D.C...
ARCHER
(re:
Castor)
How is he?
EVE
No life signs at all.
He's a
turnip.
ARCHER
That's what they always say...
He passes out as the FBI medics load him onto the med-
evac chopper.
Wanda prevents Eve from climbing aboard.
WANDA
I'm sorry, Eve.
You can't come.
(to Buzz)
Take her home.
EVE
But he's my husband!
WANDA
But he works for us.
Wanda gets on the med-evac chopper; it lifts off, leaving
a furious Eve and a confused Jamie behind.
JAMIE
Will Dad be Dad again?
EVE
I hope so, honey.
JAMIE
And you guys say my life is
screwed up...
In the swirl of dust, they watch the chopper fly away.
As the family heads inside, the door closes, shutting us
out.
