      BLACKNESS. 

      A small BLUE DOT appears, slowly growing. We realize we re: 

      EXT. SPACE11

      Earth plummets past, revealing the pale, glowing face of-- 

      THE MOON.

      Its ragged surface fills FRAME. CAMERA WHIZZES PAST a busy 
      MINING SITE, ablur with activity, settling a mile away:

22EXT. MOON S SURFACE 

      A MOON BUGGY idles. TWO ASTRONAUTS in bright orange 
      spacesuits work on a crashed satellite. 

                                  MARTY
                    It s toast. 

      MARTY THURGOOD, 21, is the prosaic American astronaut. All 
      the right stuff: clean cut, square-jawed and confident. Right 
      now, he s elbow deep in the satellite. 

                                  LEON
                    How does that happen? Old age? 

      LEON, 45, is the opposite of  astronaut : unshaven, unkempt 
      and uncomfortably corpulent. 

                                  MARTY
                    Sabotage. 

      Marty plucks out a hair-thin strand of silicone with 
      mechanized pliers. The end is SPLIT and SINGED. 

                                  LEON 
                    Probably Russians...  

                                  MARTY
                    They are history s villains. 

      Marty peers at the underside of the satellite, an odd shaped 
      ROCK catching his eye. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Check this out.

                                  LEON
                    It s a rock.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 2.


      Brushing the Moon dust away, the rock is brown. If you didn t 
      know any better, you d think it was a piece of wood.

                                  MARTY
                          (intrigued)
                    No... it s a root.

      Marty quickly bounds away, tracing the path of the 
      underground root. He stops suddenly, awe covering his face. 
      Leon steps up beside him, eyes widening.  

                                  LEON
                    What... is that?

      A BRIGHT RED FLOWER stands stark against the drab white of 
      the Moon s loam, from which it s apparently sprouted.

                                  MARTY
                    It s a flower...

      The men stare, captivated. At a loss. With a small shrug, 
      Marty plucks the flower. Immediately, a RUMBLE deep in the 
      Moon. He looks from the flower in his hand to Leon.

                                  LEON
                    Do we have earthquakes on the moon?

                                  MARTY
                    Not by definition...

      A GIANT FIREBALL ERUPTS from a vent in the Moon s surface ten 
      feet from them, sending them stumbling back. As quickly as it 
      shoots up, the fire disappears in the vacuum of space. 

      Marty turns and bolts back for the buggy, Leon right behind.  

      Suddenly: WHUMP! The ground shudders again, then DISAPPEARS! 
      Marty, Leon, moon buggy, satellite -- everything in a half-
      mile radius is swallowed by a yawning SINKHOLE. 

      A tenuous moment of stillness... before-- 

      A MASSIVE, SILENT EXPLOSION turns the sinkhole inside out -- 
      rocketing everything it just ingested, along with with a 
      healthy portion of the Moon s rocky penetralia, into SPACE.

      All of it shoots into the firmament, fodder for what will be  
      the Moon s very first debris-ring. OFF THIS DISASTER:

33EXT. SPACE 

      From within the beautiful, blue effusion of the Earth s 
      casually decanting atmosphere--

      FOOOSH! A SLEEK SHUTTLE glides lithely by. The ship s tail 
    fin sails past, revealing an art-deco red and white logo: 
       HUSSY GALACTIC.  *

                                                                            CUT TO:

    THE SAME LOGO, now embossed on a capped drinking glass. 
      WIDENING, REVEAL:

      INT. HUSSY GALACTIC SHUTTLE44*

    The glass rests upon a tray, which rests upon a well-
      manicured hand which FLOATS gracefully through the luxurious 
      cabin, encircled by mahogany tables and plush chairs.

    The cabin is empty, but for ONE MAN seated toward the back. 
    His eyes are focused out the window on the quickly receding 
      Earth, grief stricken across his face: 

    IAN THURGOOD S (35) outward appearance bears no suggestion of 
    the manic, chaotic analysis always running in his head. 

    He looks up as his drink arrives, grief evaporating.  

                                  EVE
                      Compliments of Hussy Galactic.  *

    EVE BROWNING, 35, is smart, savvy, eccentric and exudes the  *
      rakish confidence that comes from being unfathomably rich.

    Ian quickly, almost unnoticeably gauges Eve. 

                                  IAN
                    You must be Eve Browning. *

                                  EVE 
                    I m so sorry for your loss. 

    She takes a seat next to Ian.

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                    I can t imagine losing a brother 
                    then being asked to investigate 
                    what caused the explosion you lost 
                    him to.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 4.


                                  IAN
                    Who. What caused it is for the 
                    forensic scientists. I m here to 
                    find out who caused it. 

                                  EVE
                    I d want revenge, too. 

                                  IAN
                    Justice. 

                                  EVE
                      State-sanctioned revenge is still 
                    revenge. 

      Ian smiles, impressed with her. 

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                    So what part of the state is 
                      sanctioning you? 

                                  IAN
                    I guess you could say I work for 
                    myself. 

                                  EVE
                    It s only been eighteen hours since 
                    the explosion. I didn t receive a 
                    blank check to fly an independent 
                      contractor up here. Everybody 
                    answers to somebody. 

                                  IAN
                    Unless they re you, of course. 

                                  EVE
                    I answer to the shareholders. 

                                  IAN
                    You own the majority share.  

      Eve s turn to smile. The joust continues. 

                                  EVE
                    I answer to my father s legacy. And 
                    his father s. The Browning family  *
                    has poured generations into 
                    bringing the Moon to the people of 
                    Earth, and you still haven t 
                    answered my question.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 5.


                                  IAN
                    When I catch whoever s responsible, 
                    they ll answer to the Air Force 
                    Office of Special Investigations. 

      She rises, studying him. 

                                  EVE
                    I hope you find your justice. 

      She smiles sympathetically, then departs. Ian exhales, face 
      going slack. Hyper-control of your emotions is hard work. As 
      remorse creeps onto his face, UPCUT TO:

      Ian tries to feel comfortable in his freshly dawned spacesuit 
      as he waits to disembark, getting the lay of the land from:

                    You couldn t have chosen a better 
                    time to visit on the Moon. Solar 
                    winds are steady at 324.2 
                      kilometers per second with a 
                    density of .6 protons per 
                      centimeter cubed. That translates 
                    to a balmy 107 degrees centigrade 
                    in the sun -- so keep that visor 
                    down. On behalf of Hussy Galactic,  *

      the airlock, clad in a chic, retro golfing outfit.

                                  IAN
                          (re: his clothes)
                    Going to take some getting used to.

                    forth and eliminate. Just -- no 
                    solids.

      She pushes a button on his suit, and a PLASMA HELMET wraps 
      around his head. It has a light green sheen to it. 

                                  IAN
                    How come you don t have to wear a 
                    thousand pounds of clothes?  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 6.

      The AIRLOCK DOOR SLAMS OPEN. Ian s eyes go wide as he looks 
      towards the unsuited Eve. She smiles, unaffected.

                                  IAN
                    You don t need oxygen?

      She steps out into the stark black-and-white world of:

66EXT. MOON S SURFACE 

      A little PUFFT! of exhaust coughs out from her attractive 
      hairpin every few seconds. Ian joins her.

                                  EVE
                      Form-fitting, oxygen recycling

                    Omega testing. I am wearing it.  *

      She taps on his helmet.

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                    You still get oxygen from your 
                    suit. Don t run out.   

      She gestures just off the dock. Below, Armstrong and Aldrin s 
      original landing site, complete with flag, footprints and the 
      plaque they left behind, all preserved as a monument. Beyond, 
      the under-construction Hussy Dome looms in the distance.  *

                    That yours?

                                  EVE
                    Yes. And when it opens to the 
                    Moon s first recreational visitors 
                    in three months, we ll finally be 
                      delivering on the commitment made

                    The Moon and her helium aren t just

                    sky to commemorate mankind s 
                    greatest accomplishment and remind 
                    everybody we re capable of more.  

                                  IAN
                    Very inspirational. 

                                  EVE
                    It s going to stay that way. That 
                    little lander didn t just carry two 
                    men to the Moon, it carried the 
                    promise of bringing the Moon to 
                    everyone on Earth, and I m not 
                    going to let sabotage, revenge or 
                    justice break that promise.   

      Eve offers a polite smile. Ian nods, respect growing. 

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                    Good luck with the General.

      She nods to a metal elevator in the side of a nearby rise. A 
      red, white and blue sign above it reads: 

      U.S. PROPERTY: NO TRESPASSING. 

      OFF IAN, POP WIDE. The MOON FILLS FRAME, ROTATING SLOWLY.

                    The entire Moon is just bigger than 
                    Africa, and the five countries 
                      scratching helium-3 out of its 
                    green cheese share an area no 
                    bigger than the Sahara.

      WIDEN FURTHER TO REVEAL we are now:

77INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - GALE S OFFICE 

      The Moon is actually a highly detailed hologram, floating  
      between Ian and GEN. GALE LYNN WINEHART. He s 50, hard as 
      nails and could kick the crap out of just about anybody. 

                                  GALE
                    The Japanese are our allies, the 
                    Indians don t have the tech for 
                    this kind of attack and the 
                      Brazilian-Mexican Coalition 
                    would ve needed outside help. 

      As he speaks, A HOLOGRAM FLAG APPEARS in the space around 
      Ian s head, enlarging and expanding to show quick 
        demographics and images of each country s base.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 8.

                    That leaves the Russians.

      With a wave, Gale sends all but the RUSSIAN FLAG to various 
      positions on the surface of the virtual Moon.

                                  IAN
                    The Russians? We re not even on 
                    their radar. They ve got no motive.

                                  GALE
                    Which is why we re focusing on our 
                    own backyard. Whatever country s 
                      responsible had inside help.

                    The U.S. economy s up cripple creek

                    white collar criminals who chose 
                    manual labor here over prison time 
                    on Earth. 

                                  IAN
                    Smart people who did something 
                    stupid and have to work for free. 

                                  GALE
                    These are the  indentured servants  
                    who fit the profile to go fifth 
                    column.

      Ian s eyes are fixed on one of the mugs: MARTY. 

                                  IAN
                    Why are they suspects if they re dead?

      With a gesture, Gale sweeps away the other heads. Ian s left 
      staring into the glassy eyes of his dead brother, but his 
      expression betrays no emotion.

                                  GALE
                    Martin Thurgood was engaging in 
                      suspicious activity directly above 
                    the epicenter of the blast and 
                      immediately preceding it.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 9.


                                  IAN
                    He d have to be a pretty stupid 
                    terrorist to blow himself up.  

                                  GALE
                    Stupid is a terrorist s lingua franca. 
                    So until we recoup his body and prove 
                      otherwise, he s swimming laps in the 
                    suspect pool.  

      He looks from the hologram Marty to Ian: 

                                  GALE (CONT D)
                    You coming here is a mistake. 
                    You re compromised. 

                                  IAN
                      Compromised suggests an intimacy I 
                    didn t share with my brother.

                                  GALE 
                    Then you must be hobbled by regret. 
                    Either one comes at the cost of 
                      objectivity.  

                                  IAN
                    You wanted me to see that mug shot 
                    in the hope that I would crack 
                    because you don t want an outsider 
                    running an investigation you think 
                    you should be in charge of. I don t 
                    crack. I find answers. How did this 
                    happen and who s to blame. You say 
                    the Russians, but you don t really 
                    say why, which suggests to me you 
                    know something you re not sharing, 
                    and that makes you, not me, the one 
                    who s compromised. 
                          (beat)
                    Now, I suggest we both place our 
                      competency concerns aside and focus 
                    on answers. Starting with the one 
                    that explains why the Russians.

      Gale drills a hole right through Ian, who stares right back. 

                                  GALE
                      Tranquility Station sits on the

                    The Russians are atop the smallest, 
                    but have the most high-tech 
                    drilling operations.  HIGH MOON 06/12/1310.


                                  IAN
                    They re running out of gas.

                      milkshake. 

                                  IAN
                    And you re letting them? 

                                  GALE
                    We have them red-handed and you 
                    better believe we re going to bend 
                     em over a barrel. But their straw 
                    has to be discovered  organically , 
                    to protect certain assets.  

                                  IAN
                          (dawning on him)
                    You ve got a spy.

      A BRIGHT, PINK SILK suddenly WIPES FRAME, accompanied by the 
      advent of SITARS and TAMBOURINES. WE ARE: 

      INT. INDIAN PALACE - NIGHT88

      The LARGE, PINK SCARF is whisked by one of SEVERAL BEAUTIFUL 
      INDIAN WOMEN as they dance in a spectacular rotunda. 
      Traditionally clad INDIAN MEN sit on luxurious rugs, playing  
      the music -- a BOLLYWOOD cover of STYX S  GRAND ILLUSION. 

      For all of the grandeur, the distinct resolution suggests 
      we re seeing STOCK FOOTAGE of A BOLLYWOOD DANCE ROUTINE. 

    In the middle of the dancers, ONE MAN, distinctly not stock 
      footage, begins to sing:

                                  STAN
                          (in Russian)
                    So if you think your life is 
                    complete confusion / Because your 
                    neighbor s got it made...

      This is STANISLAV (STAN) STAVIN, 33. He moves with Gene 
      Kelley elegance amidst the dancers.  

                                  STAN (CONT D)
                    Just remember that it s a Grand 
                    Illusion, and deep inside we re all 
                    the same! 

      A SMALL GROUP of RUSSIANS, all clad in mining attire, laugh 
    and cheer him on as they drink tea from thermoses.    HIGH MOON  06/12/13 11.


      Behind him, a gritty UNIFORMED OFFICER named TROFIM TROFIMOV, 
      35, literally WALKS right THROUGH THE DANCING WOMEN and up to 
      a SMALL BOX, emanating beams of light. 

      At the push of a button, the lights turn off, the music stops 
      and all things Indian DISAPPEAR -- including Stan s outfit. 
      Now also clad in mining clothes, he s in the middle of:

      INT. MINE D-237 (CAVES)99

      Stan snaps to attention in front of Major Trofimov. The other 
      Russians follow suit. Trofim paces slowly before his 
      soldiers, none of them moving under his withering gaze. 

      He stops before Stan. They speak in subtitled Russian. 

                                  TROFIM
                    What s the special occasion, 
                    Corporal?
                          (off his silence)
                    You wouldn t be singing and dancing 
                    in the wake of calamity unless 
                    there was a very special occasion. 

                                  STAN
                    Just... an impromptu old world tea *
                    house, Sir. Since the accident, 
                    morale has--

                                  TROFIM
                    Accident? The Americans were 
                    attacked. *

                                  STAN
                    Who would do that? Who could --

                                  TROFIM
                    Who is less important than who they 
                    think. 

      He gestures to the tunnel around them. 

                                  TROFIM (CONT D)
                    And here we are, on the verge of 
                    stealing their helium. What do you 
                    suppose the Americans would say 
                    about that?

                                  STAN
                    That it s convenient we use 
                    soldiers as miners, for one thing. 
                          (then)
                    Did we do this, sir?   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 12.


      Trofim reels on him. Places a hand on his shoulder. The 
      calmness of it is pretty intimidating.

                                  TROFIM
                          (a threat)
                    That is how rumors are started.

                                  STAN
                    Yes sir.

      Before Trofim can walk away though --

                                  STAN (CONT D)
                    It s just-- we don t need to steal 
                    helium-3. The sun launches it into 
                    space, the Moon swiffers it up. 
                    It s renewable. So maybe this 
                    tunnel was built for... something 
                    else. 

      Everybody freezes, afraid Trofim s about to wale on him. 

                                  TROFIM
                    We re mining faster than the sun 
                    can refresh. Everyone is digging 
                    deeper. 
                          (then)
                    The Moon-boom glory days are over. 
                    Prep this siphon tunnel for 
                    immediate demolition. The Americans *
                    can t discover this tunnel. *
                    Especially not now. *

    As the group breaks up, CUT TO:

      CLOSE ON: AN ASTRONAUT, the reflection of a bright yellow box 
    can be seen in the thin plasma of her helmet. As she shifts, 
    so does the glare -- allowing us our first glimpse of 

      YAMA WINEHART, 24, cute but rugged, direct but charming. 
      WIDEN to REVEAL she s:

1010EXT. SPACE - THE DEBRIS RING 

    She attaches the YELLOW BOX to a burned-out piece of MOON-
      BUGGY. In front of her, the infinity of space is blurred by 
      spinning Moon rocks and broken mining equipment. 

    She pauses, feeling uneasy, like she s being watched. She 
      looks over her shoulder, and we see she s surrounded by --

      A FIELD OF INTERSECTING LASER BEAMS stretching back to the 
      Moon s surface.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 13.


                                  YAMA
                    Marker 7-1-1 coming online... Now. 

      She flips a switch on the yellow box and BZZOOUU, another 
      LASER BEAM shoots back toward the surface. 

                                  YAMA (CONT D)
                    Velocity, rotation, altitude place 
                    this in locus 276. More Moon Buggy. 

      She continues in silence. The only sound is her own breath. 
      It s eerie. Wary, she glances over her shoulder, just as --

      AN ASTRONAUT DRIFTS PAST HER.  

      She GASPS, but quickly composes herself when she sees the 
      dead, twisted face inside the suit -- LEON, the astronaut 
      from the Teaser. She shudders... then notices something else:

      A few yards away, a large CURVED PIECE of SCORED METAL. She 
      quickly attaches another YELLOW LASER MARKER to it. 

                                  YAMA (CONT D)
                    Marker 7-1-2, code for priority. It 
                    looks like ordnance.  Repeat, 
                    Marker 7-1-2 is a piece of a bomb! 

      She stops as she sees something floating behind the ordnance. 

      Small. Red... A FLOWER. 

      It cartwheels in place, mesmerizing. Ethereal to the point 
      that its reality is dubious. Yama stares, transfixed.

      She gingerly grabs the delicate flower, but no sooner do her 
      fingers wrap around it than a shadow comes over her. 

      Yama glances up to see what blocked the light. ANOTHER DEAD 
      ASTRONAUT floats toward her. 

      She reaches out to push it away, but its limp arm suddenly

      GRABS HER BACK! 

      She SCREAMS as the ASTRONAUT CLUTCHES for her, LETTING GO OF 
      THE FLOWER as she tries to wrench free. 

                                  MARTY
                    Stop hitting me!  *

                                  YAMA *
                    You re alive! *  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 14.


      We get our first clear look at MARTY -- haggard but alive. As 
      he bear hugs onto her for dear life: 

                                  END OF ACT ONE  HIGH MOON 06/12/1315.


                                        ACT TWO

1111INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - INFIRMARY 

      Marty, cleaned up but banged up, recounts his tale. 

                                  MARTY
                    My com-link was busted so I bounced  *
                    from one dead guy to the next, using 
                    their oxygen to stay alive. 

      ARMING AROUND, we find Ian across from him.

                                  IAN
                    And now here you are.   

                                  MARTY
                    And now here you are. 

      Ian meets Marty s eyes, then softens. They share a look 
      rarely shared between brothers, especially these brothers. 
      Ian clutches Marty s hand. Marty s a little taken aback, but 
      appreciative. He s never seen this much emotion from Ian. 

                                  IAN
                    This is a second chance.  I m going 
                    to do better. I m going to be a good 
                    brother.  Well, a better brother.

      But Ian s emotion gradually caves back to neurosis. He 
      withdraws his hand and the moment is gone. 

                                  MARTY
                    Here we go. 

                                  IAN
                    Okay, look. I love you and I m glad 
                    you re alive. 

                                  MARTY
                    Glad we got that out of the way. 

                                  IAN
                    But you re the sole survivor of a 
                    massive explosion, there s Moon 
                    buggy footage of you tampering with 
                    an unknown object at ground zero 
                    and I m looking for an inside man. 

                                  MARTY
                    This your idea of  better ? 
                    Accusing me of being a terrorist?   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 16.


                                  IAN
                    Your excuse you re not is that you 
                    saw a flower. 

                                  MARTY
                    And we re back! It s only been, 
                    what, like, two years? And in two 
                    minutes, you re trying to get 
                    inside my head. 

                                  IAN
                    Because I need to know if you re 
                    working for the Russians and you 
                    won t just tell me if I ask you.  

                                  MARTY
                    Uhhh... yes I will: no I m not. Has 
                    it occurred to you that being 
                    raised by a brother who s a mind-
                    reading swami ruined my ability to 
                    tell a convincing lie? 

                                  IAN
                    Or it made you better. You really 
                    committed to that flower story. 

      Marty leans back, rubbing his eyes. Already exasperated.

                                  MARTY
                    The whole Moon could be a plant. It 
                    could ve spent the last billion 
                    years squeezing its little plant 
                    parts as hard as it can to sprout 
                    that one single flower. And this 
                    might be the only point for another 
                    billion years to prove it but you 
                    won t unclench long enough to even 
                    consider it.

                      Validating your hallucinations 
                    would only make me seem collusive 
                    or desperate and I m already going 
                    to look bad just talking to you.  

                                  MARTY
                    To who?

      CUT TO GALE, seated behind his large desk in:

      INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - GALE S OFFICE1212

      He stares coldly at Ian, standing across from him.   HIGH MOON 06/12/1317.


                                  GALE
                    Contact with your brother was an 
                    absolute breach of protocol. 

                                  IAN
                    We ve already had this discussion --

                                  GALE
                    Your brother showing up alive is a 
                    game changer. 

                                  IAN
                    My mandate is two pronged. Prong 
                    one, find the party responsible for 
                    the helium mine explosion, and 
                    parties are no fun when only one 
                    person shows up, so I ve still got 
                    work to do even if Marty is 
                    involved. Prong two, make sure 
                    nothing like this happens again. 
                    The fine print there is that I m 
                    going to be here until I ve 
                    installed a security apparatus that   
                    makes your base impregnable. I am a 
                    fixture, General. 

                                  GALE
                    Your boss in Special Investigations 
                    disagrees. You re done. 

      Gale swings the door open. Instead of leaving, Ian pushes 
      some buttons on the wall. A moment later a hologram of 
      SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE JONES appears. 

                                  IAN
                    Sorry to bother you, Mr. Secretary, 
                    but the General here is playing 
                    politics and trying to get me 
                    shipped home. 

                                  JONES
                          (to Gale)
                    I ve got enough poly-ticks to 
                      exterminate without you adding to 
                    my woodpile.  

                                  GALE
                    My apologies, sir.

                                  JONES
                    This whole mess is 100 percent under 
                    Thurgood s jurisdiction. 
                                  (MORE)  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 18.

                                  JONES (CONT'D)
                    I ll talk to Special Investigations 
                    about it personally. You give him 
                    whatever he needs. Am I clear?  *

                                  GALE *
                    As a bell, Sir. *

                                  IAN
                    Thank you, Sir. 

      Jones blinks out of existence. Gale s seething. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Have all files on Marty and reports 
                    from your Russian spy sent to me.  *

      OFF GALE, CUT TO:  

1313EXT. MOON S SURFACE - TERMINATOR 

      The SUN CRESTS over the horizon, inching back the terminator 
      (the line where the sun s light meets the Moon s dark side). 

      Suddenly: BUH-THUNK! A SMALL METEORITE crashes into the 
      Moon s dust. As it settles, we get a clear view of the 
      projectile:  TITLEIST.  It s a golf ball. 

      A Moon Buggy rumbles up and GALE piles out, grabbing a GOLF 
      CLUB. He pays no heed to the SMALL RED LIGHT BLINKING in the 
      darkness beyond the terminator, like the puff of a cigarette 
      in a dark alley. Instead he lines up his shot. 

                                  GALE
                    You re running out of oxygen. 

      The terminator recedes with the rising sun, exposing a pair 
      of boots in the darkness.

                    I always carry a spare.   

      The sun reaches the man s face, revealing STAN -- the Russian 
      Karaoke singer, now speaking perfect English. He pops in his 
      back-up O2 container and his blinking red light turns green.

                    They haven t turned it on yet. 

      Gale looks up, confused.

                    Then who the hell else is stealing

                    day his well-connected brother 
                      coincidentally arrived. Whole thing

      Gale swings back his club and THWACK! the golf ball 
      disappears in a cloud of Moon dust, MATCH CUT TO:

      The DUST kicked up by a MOON BOOT stamping down. We are:

      EXT. MOON S SURFACE - SINKHOLE1414

      Marty and a Sergeant named HORTON stand on the precipice of 
      the giant sinkhole.  

                                  MARTY
                          (wary)
                    How come my brother didn t join us? 

                                  HORTON
                    This isn t exactly an official, on-
                    the-books sort of thing. He s 
                    trying to help you prove your story 
                    without compromising himself. 

                                  MARTY
                    Sounds like my brother, all right.   *

      Marty moves away from the sinkhole. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    The flower was growing over there. 

      Horton follows him, then pulls out a small device and holds 
      it to the ground. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Ground penetrating radar? 

                                  HORTON
                          (nodding)
                    There s a cavern beneath here...

                                  MARTY
                    There were no mining tunnels this 
                    far out, right?

                                  HORTON
                    Not even close. 

                                  MARTY 
                    The fireball came out of that vent 
                    there. Maybe where there s a 
                    flower, there s a garden...  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 21.


      Marty and Horton peer into the vent. 

                                  HORTON
                    You go first. 

                                                                          UPCUT TO:

      INT. LUNAR CAVERN1515

      Marty s helmet light cuts a sharp line of white into the 
      black void of the cave as he lowers himself down.  

      He lands on terra-firma and looks around. The walls of the 
      cave around him SPARKLE BLUE with EXOTIC MINERALS. Deeper 
      into the darkness, far away, he sees something GLOWING. 

                                  MARTY
                    Sergeant? Hey Sergeant? I m 
                    unhooking and going deeper... 

      As he reaches the end of his rope, he unhooks from his rappel 
      wire and heads toward the glowing.

      EXT. MOON S SURFACE1616

      Horton glances over the edge of the vent. 

                                  HORTON
                    I m right behind you... 

      But instead, he rises and walks back toward his buggy.

      INT. LUNAR CAVERN1717

      Marty squints down at the far off glowing. His helmet light 
      goes on the blink. He taps at it, trying to get it back on 
      when

      SOMETHING MOVES BESIDE HIM, scaring him spitless. 

      He frantically hits at his helmet light again, finally 
      getting it to illuminate

      A HANDFUL of THICK, PITHY TUBULES fingering up from the 
      ground to the ceiling.   

                                  MARTY
                    Sergeant, you gotta see this! 
                    There s roots...
                          (trailing off)
                    Or something.  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 22.


      Marty reaches out for the roots, but THEY RECOIL FROM HIS 
      TOUCH, moving like kelp in the low gravity. Marty jerks his 
      hand back, anxiety heightening. 

      He notices a strange, BIOLUMINESCENT GLOW where the tubules 
      grazed against him. Before he can look more closely-- 

      The ROOTS SWAY AGAIN -- parting. Marty leans in for a closer 
      look when HIS LIGHT DIES AGAIN. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    You gave me a pretty ratty 
                      spacesuit!

      When he manages to get the flickering light back, he s 
      startled backwards by

      AN INDIAN FACE STARING AT HIM THROUGH THE ROOTS!

      Marty barely dodges as the MYSTERY FIGURE lunges fiercely at 
      him with a knife. 

      The Moon s low gravity and the intermittent strobing of 
      Marty s light lend an otherworldly, almost delirious energy 
      to their leaps, swings and lunges. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Help! Sergeant! Get in here!

      Marty manages to disengage the Assailant s helmet -- but to 
      his shock the sudden lack of oxygen doesn t affect the 
      Indian, who uses his momentum to STAB Marty. 

      Marty counter punches, sending his attacker reeling and the 
      knife clattering to the ground.

      The Assailant disappears into the dark, leaving Marty -- 
      blood and oxygen slowly cascading from his suit. The green 
      tint of his helmet begins pulsing red.

                                  SUIT
                    Leak detected. 

      Marty tries to cover the leak with his hand, but to no avail. 
      The red light in his helmet only blinks faster and faster. 

      He painfully, frenziedly searches the ground for something...

      THE KNIFE. He picks it up. Shakes his head. But the oxygen 
      pouring out of his suit demands action.

      He slides the blade tip into his suit. He closes his eyes and 
      with a deep breath, pushes the knife back into his flesh!  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 23.


                                  SUIT (CONT D)
                    Leak contained.  

      Leak plugged, he collapses back against the wall. Breathing 
      hard, trying and failing to control the pain. At length, he 
      puts his hand on a nearby rock to help him up, but the rock 
      shifts. He looks closer, eyes widening. 

      That s no rock... It s A STRING OF HIGH TECH EXPLOSIVES. 
      Armed. Ticking. 

      Marty howls in pain as he gallops toward his rappelling line. 
      He hooks in, hits the retract button and shoots up, popping 
      onto-- 

1818EXT. MOON S SURFACE 

        KABOOOOOOOOOOM! A COUGH OF MOON DUST BELCHES OUT RIGHT AFTER 
      HIM. Marty, gasping in pain, collapses, the fresh blood on 
      his suit standing stark against the white Moon. 

      OFF MARTY: 

                                  END OF ACT TWO  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 24.


                                      ACT THREE

      INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - INFIRMARY1919

      Ian rubs his head in frustration as an EMT bandages the hole 
      in Marty s gut. When the Medic moves aside, Marty spies his 
      brother for the first time. He looks away shaking his head. 

                                  MARTY
                    Just say it. Stop chewing on it in 
                    your head and say it out loud. 

                                  IAN
                    Do you have any idea how this looks?

                                  MARTY
                    Like I was attacked by an assassin, 
                      presumably because I saw something 
                      I shouldn t have. Like A FLOWER!

                                  IAN
                    You snuck into a crime scene and 
                    survived another massive explosion. 
                    It looks like you re working for 
                    the Russians. You might as well 
                    have a uni-brow and a bottle of 
                    vodka.

                                  MARTY
                    Point your bigotry somewhere else.  *
                    The guy who attacked me was an 
                    Indian.

      Ian stares blankly, unsure. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    What? I suppose you think I stabbed 
                    myself, too.

                                  IAN
                    You did. 

                                  MARTY
                    Yes! To plug the leak in my suit 
                    after I was stabbed the first time! 

                                  IAN
                    That sounds insane! Everything you 
                    say comes off like a dumb criminal  *
                    trying to come off like some hippy-
                    dippy pacifist!  I wasn t planting 
                    a bomb, I saw a flower.   I stabbed 
                    myself because an Indian made me.   HIGH MOON 06/12/1325.


      Marty glares at Ian, who grimaces, grappling with himself. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Fine. Let s pretend I m completely 
                    gullible and irrational. You ve got 
                    60 seconds to explain how a flower 
                    could possibly grow in a vacuum. 

                                  MARTY
                    How would I know?! Even if lunar-
                    botany was a thing, it wouldn t be 
                    my thing! I just saw it!

                                  IAN
                    No thing is your thing. That s your 
                    problem, Marty.

                                  MARTY
                    Just because I don t need to 
                    dethrone you as the Great Potentate 
                    of the Psyche doesn t mean I m not 
                    driven. The Moon, I love. Being on 
                    it, doing my small part to tame it 
                    is all the purpose I need. 

                                  IAN
                    Your calling is being indentured 
                    labor to pay off a felony 
                      conviction. Dreams really do come 
                    true. 30 seconds. 

      Marty lies back, shaking his head. 

                                  MARTY
                    This is why I left.   

                                  IAN
                    First of all, you didn t leave, you 
                    were arrested --

                                  MARTY
                    I got arrested so I could leave. 

                                  IAN
                    -- Second, I m doing everything I 
                    can to help you, but it s hard to 
                    help somebody who goes out of their 
                    way to appear guilty.  

                                  MARTY
                    It was the guard you sent to  help  
                    that ditched me--  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 26.


                                  IAN
                    I didn t send a guard. 

                                  MARTY
                    What do you mean you didn t send a 
                    guard? 

                                  IAN
                    What version of me have you seen in 
                    the last 21 years that would send 
                    some lackey, that I don t know, and 
                    you don t know, to lead you into 
                    the area that everybody thinks you 
                    blew up! 

      Ian takes a breath, getting his composure. ON him, CUT TO:

      INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - GALE S OFFICE2020

      Gale pours himself a Scotch, glaring down his nose at Ian -- 
      who stands beside Horton, calm, cool and collected.

                                  HORTON
                    I was at my post all night, sir. 

                                  GALE
                    Security footage proves it. You re 
                      dismissed, Sergeant. 

                                  IAN
                    Quick question before you go. Can 
                    you hold your breath for two hours?

      Horton looks at Gale confused. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Security footage may show you at 
                    your post, but oxygen logs say you 
                    weren t breathing. Are you a 
                    hologram right now?

      Ian pokes him sharply. He s real, and knows he s caught.

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Who are you working for, Horton?

      Horton looks to Gale, but gets a stony stare back. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    Why are they after Marty?

      Horton weighs his options and quickly decides on the truth:  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 27.


                                  HORTON
                    Something he said in his 
                      debriefing. I don t know what.

                                  IAN
                    Who? Russians? Indians? Sergeant?

      Horton s head suddenly twitches before: PUKH! A muffled 
      explosion in his brain causes his eyes to bulge out and his 
      skull to briefly expand and contract. Smoke wafts out of his 
      nostrils and ears as he collapses, dead. 

      Gale quickly kneels beside the dead Sergeant, whose 
        whackadoodle eye rolls back in forth in his head. 

                                  GALE
                    I haven t seen a brain bomb since 
                    the war.  

                                  IAN
                    Nowadays they can be rigged to 
                    explode based on specific 
                      neurological signatures. 

                                  GALE
                    Like when a mole is about to give 
                    up the goat. What was that about 
                    Indians? 

                                  IAN
                    Marty said an Indian stabbed him 
                    when he was busy not causing the 
                    last explosion. 

                                  GALE
                    Your pain-in-my-ass dipstick little 
                    brother is either working for the 
                    same people who did that --

      Gale gestures to Horton.

                                  GALE (CONT D)
                    -- or he s a hapless patsy. You got 
                    a damn lot of work to do convincing 
                    me it s door number two, or it ll 
                    take more than the Secretary of the 
                    Air Force to keep you on my Moon.  

                                  IAN
                    Fair. Let s start with this: brain-
                    bomb knew about Marty s debriefing. 
                    Who have you talked to about it, 
                    Russian, Indian or otherwise?   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 28.


                                  GALE
                          (beat, realizing)
                    My Russian spy may be compromised.

      INT. MINE D-2372121

      Stan and the other miners carefully rig explosives around the 
      mine. He places the last one, and turns to the mine s mouth, 
      where Trofim stands. Their Russian is subtitled:

                                  STAN
                    That s the last of them, Sir. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Very well. Evacuate to the safety 
                      perimeter. 

      The miners file out, but Trofim grabs Stan by the arm. 

                                  TROFIM (CONT D)
                    Not you. 

      Stan s eyes dart nervously: uh-oh...

                                  TROFIM (CONT D)
                    Show me where you were drilling 
                    last week. 

      Stan nods, then walks deeper into the mine, around a bend, 
      and past a Moon buggy. Trofim follows. Stan gestures to a 
      recess in the mine wall. 

                                  TROFIM (CONT D)
                    I want to see the exact spot. 

      Stan grimaces, but approaches a scored section of cave. 

                                  TROFIM (CONT D)
                    Dig. With your hands. 

      Stan does. Something shiny falls to the ground. A RING. Stan 
      picks it up, smiling. Trofim smiles back, familiar, at ease. 

                                  TROFIM (CONT D)
                    Just because the Moon s never going 
                    to be the same doesn t mean we have 
                    to change. You like it?

                                  STAN
                    It s perfect.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 29.


                                  TROFIM
                    I m sorry I ruined your song. 

                                  STAN
                    You can ruin all the songs you want 
                    if this is how you re going to 
                      apologize.

                                  TROFIM
                    I didn t think you could be bought 
                    so easy. 

                                  STAN
                    Ha. You couldn t afford me till 
                    now. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Anybody asks, you ve got a man back 
                    home. We have to be more careful 
                    than ever. Everybody s watching 
                    everybody so close now. 

                                  STAN
                    We ll work around it.

      POP close on the RING, as Stan s finger slides into it. 
      WIDENING, find the two men have moved inside:

2222INT. MOON BUGGY 

      Trofim and Stan smile at each other. As they lean in for a 
      kiss, WE PULL BACK, through the FOGGY WINDOWS of the Buggy. 

                                                                    TIME CUT TO:

      INT. MINE D-2372323

      Trofim piles out of the buggy, followed by Stan-- a few 
      passionate moments have passed. The two smile at each other.

                                  TROFIM
                    Give me a good head start. 

      As he disappears around the bend, a SHADOW lurks up behind 
      Stan and WHUMP! A MAN in BLACK knocks him unconscious. 

2424INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - HOLDING ROOM 

      A BLACK BAG whisks off Stan s head. He blinks under the 
      glaring lights, the blurry image of Ian and Gale coming into 
      focus. He tries to move, but his hands and feet are shackled.

                                  IAN
                    Hello, Stanislav.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 30.


                                  STAN
                          (to Gale)
                    Are the shackles really necessary?

                                  IAN
                    If you arranged to have Martin 
                    Thurgood killed. 

                                  STAN
                    I steal mining technology and drill 
                    bits. I don t kill people.

                                  GALE
                    Nobody else knew about his 
                      debriefing. Had you mentioned his 
                    name to somebody?

                                  STAN
                    Nobody. 

      Ian studies him, gauging. Then:

                                  IAN
                    Let s assume you re just a bad spy 
                    and not a murderer. Why would the 
                    Russians attack the Americans? 

                                  STAN
                    They spent a lot of rubles building 
                    a tunnel to filch U.S. helium, which 
                    they now have to tear down. They 
                    gained nothing from the attack. 

                                  IAN
                    They only gained nothing if the 
                    sole something was helium. But 
                    there s lots of somethings worth 
                    killing for on the Moon. Food. 
                    Water? Love. Revenge. Air...

      Stan s tell is too subtle for us to catch, but Ian sees it. 

                                  IAN (CONT D)
                    So the Russians want oxygen. 

                                  STAN
                    The Russians want to control the 
                    Moon, but they can t because Eve 
                    Browning supplies everybody s  *
                    oxygen. If the Russians were going 
                    to attack anybody, it would be her.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 31.


      Ian digests that, but changes tack, tossing a small hologram 
      from the wall to Stan. It s a 3-D model of the ordnance Yama 
      found in the debris ring. 

                                  IAN
                    Know what this is?

                                  STAN
                          (holy smokes)
                    Wasn t used for mining. 

                                  GALE
                    These are the bombs that caused the 
                      explosion. 

                                  STAN
                    This is Indian tech.  

      Ian s ears prick up at the mention of Indians again. 

                                  GALE
                    Indian.

                                  STAN
                    Yes, sir. That greenish-white sheen 
                    is a magnesium-phosphorus coating. 
                    The Indians coat their explosives 
                    with it so they can blast through 
                    titanium. 

                                  IAN
                    You know an awful lot about Indian 
                      technology that nobody else even 
                    thought existed. 

                                  STAN
                    I thought you thought I was working 
                    for the Russians. Now I m an Indian 
                    spy? At this rate I ll be back to 
                    being American any minute now. 

      Gale nods Ian to the door. Ian lingers, studying Stan a beat. 
      He sees something, and Stan knows it.

2525INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - GALE S OFFICE 

      Gale and Ian are alone.

                                  GALE
                    My most trusted man and your most 
                    trusted man both just cried Indian.  *  HIGH MOON 06/12/1332.


                                  IAN
                    The difference between me and my 
                    brother and you and your spy is 
                    that he s lying to you. 

                                  GALE
                    I trust a highly decorated war hero 
                    on my payroll over some helium-
                    hacking felon any day, which is 
                    moot in this point since they re 
                    saying the same thing.

                                  IAN
                    Yes. About the Indians. But he s 
                    lying about working for you. You 
                    have an Indian problem and a 
                    turncoat problem. 

                                  GALE
                    My best agent did not blow us up 
                    for anybody. I ve known him for *
                    fifteen years. We were in the war 
                    together, for crying out loud.

                                  IAN
                    Which is why you re trying so hard 
                    to believe him. 

      As they continue:

2626INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - HOLDING ROOM 

      Stan peers intently at the ordnance, concentrating. CAMERA 
      DROPS BELOW THE TABLE to see what s really on his mind:

      STAN S LEFT HAND IS SLOWLY SPINNING IN 360 DEGREE CIRCLES. 

      After a couple of rotations, it DROPS OFF HIS WRIST -- 
      unscrewed. The hand lies on the floor a beat before: 

      IT SPRINGS SUDDENLY TO LIFE, standing on all fives like 
       Thing  from the Aadams Family. FLIP! The pointer finger pops 
      open and a LASER begins slicing through his ankle shackles.

      PLOP! His right hand drops to the floor, then starts moving 
      quickly toward the door.

2727INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - HALLWAY 

      Ian and Gale walk briskly back toward the interrogation room 
      just as  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 33.


      CLANK! The door suddenly locks. Gale and Ian share a 
      surprised glance. Gale looks through the window in the door 
      to see Stan kicking his legs free of his shackles.

                                  GALE
                    Sonnuvva --

      He s already working to override the lock. Eric stares at  *
      Stan s scrambling hands. *

                                  ERIC *
                    You know he could do that?  *

                                  GALE *
                    Nobody can do that. *

      The door partially opens. Gale s got his side-arm drawn as  *
      they fly into:

2828INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - HOLDING ROOM 

      Stan immediately throws his (handless) arms up.  *

                                  STAN *
                    Don t shoot! *

                                  GALE *
                    Show me your hands! *

      ANGLE ON the ceiling, where Stan s hands surreptitiously  *
      remove an air vent. A LIGHT ON EACH WRIST SUDDENLY FLIPS FROM  *
      RED TO GREEN, causing-- *

      Stan to lurch. *

                                  GALE (CONT D) *
                    I will shoot you.  *

      STAN SUDDENLY LAUNCHES INTO THE AIR! THUNK! THUNK! His stumps  *
        magnetically return him to his hands, 25 feet up. With a  *
      heave-ho, he hoists himself into the vent and disappears. *

      Gale and Eric stare agape. OFF THEM: *

                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - INFIRMARY2929

      Marty, bandaged stab wound exposed, is shackled to the bed 
      with some high-tech handcuffs. A GUARD sits nearby.  

    The door opens and YAMA slides in on a thought-controlled, 
      modified Segway. She wears sleek bionic leg braces.  

                                  YAMA
                    Give us a sec, Corporal? 

    The Guard checks Marty s wrist restraint, then steps out. 
      Yama steps off her Segway, moving awkwardly.  

                                  MARTY
                    You seemed much more... able-bodied 
                    up there. 

                                  YAMA
                    It s the infirmary s artificial 
                    gravity. I m a ninja in Moon g s.

                                  MARTY
                          (realizing)
                    Wait... you mean you re Baby Prime?  

                                  YAMA
                    First and last kid born on the Moon 
                    and living proof artificial gravity 
                    isn t fetus-friendly. I m Yama 
                    Winehart and --

                                  MARTY
                    Winehart? As in-- Baby Prime... is 
                    the General s daughter... is you? 

                                  YAMA
                    I need you to tell me about that 
                    flower.

                                  MARTY
                    And I need you to tell everybody 
                    about it so I stop sounding like a 
                    whacko. 

      POV: Somebody watches them from behind the air-vent... Stan?

                                  YAMA
                    If I m going to vouch for a 
                    convicted felon, I want cold, hard 
                    evidence in my hand -- again.  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 35.


                                  MARTY*
                    Again?*

                                  YAMA*
                    I had the flower in my hand till *
                    you floated along and knocked it *
                    out. *

                                  MARTY
                    How do I know you re not going to 
                    take my cold, hard evidence and 
                    leave me hanging by my felonious 
                    toes? 

                                  YAMA
                    Because if it s real, you and I 
                    shared a singularly spiritual 
                      experience. We saw life in the 
                    lifeless and that is a gift we have 
                    a duty to protect. We re bonded. 
                    Whether we like it or not. 

      Marty sizes her up, gauging. 

                                  MARTY
                    Little churchy. But... There was 
                    some kind of glowing gunk on my 
                    smart fiber, pee-filtering 
                      spacesuit. Like, pollen or sap or 
                      something. 

                                  YAMA*
                    Where s your suit now?*

                                  MARTY*
                    Evidence locker, probably. *

      Yama nods. She opens the door stops short at the sight of the  *
      dead Guard outside. She looks up just as 

      THE INDIAN ASSASSIN FROM THE CAVES appears in the doorway, 
      rolling her quickly backward and deftly disabling her braces.

                                  MARTY (CONT D) *
                    GUARD! HELP! SOMEBODY! *

      The Assassin lets Yama collapse into a nearby chair, turning  *
      his attention to Marty as he pulls out a GARROTE. *

      Before he can strike -- WHAM! The Indian is waylaid by  *

      STAN! The Indian quickly regroups, charging for Stan... but 
      before they collide -- HE VANISHES INTO THIN AIR with a loud 
      POP! Yama, Stan and Marty all exchange bewildered glances.   HIGH MOON 06/12/1336.


                                  YAMA
                    What... just happened to that guy? 

                                  STAN
                    Don t know, but--
                          (to Marty)
                    Everybody thinks I m trying to 
                    knock you off, so keeping you alive  *
                    is my number one priority.  *

      Stan deftly DISABLES Marty s wrist restraints.  *

                                  STAN (CONT'D) *
                    Consider yourself in protective  *
                    custody. *
                          (off his wariness) *
                    Not exactly like these people are  *
                    doing a bang up job.  *

                                  MARTY *
                    Good point. *

      Marty nods, pulls himself out of bed.  *

                                  MARTY (CONT D) *
                    But you gotta help me find  *
                      something. *

                                  YAMA
                    Are you nuts? We don t even know 
                    who he is!

                                  MARTY
                    I ve been blown off the surface of 
                    the Moon, stabbed, blown up again, 
                    almost strangled and had my ears 
                    popped by a disappearing assassin! 
                    I like my odds with a guy who s  *
                    good reputation needs me alive.  *
                    Besides, if he wanted to kill me,  *
                    he wouldn t have saved my neck.  *

                                  STAN
                    Why do the Indians want you dead? *
                    Or should I say, what do you want *
                    me to help you find? Same thing, *
                    right?*

                                  MARTY*
                    I saw a flower growing on the Moon. 

      Stan is skeptical, so--*  HIGH MOON 06/12/1337.


                                  YAMA*
                    I saw it, too. In orbit. *

                                  MARTY*
                          (covering for her)*
                    No she didn t. *
                          (to Yama)*
                    You re a bad liar. *

                                  STAN
                    You re the bad liar. *

      He THUMPS Marty on the forehead with a flick. Turns to Yama:

                                  STAN (CONT D)
                    But he s got the right idea. You 
                    should probably keep your lips 
                    zipped if you don t want to end up 
                    in the same boat as him.  *

      Stan pulls the vent duct cover off the wall. *

                                  MARTY*
                          (off Yama)
                    You said it. We have a duty. 

                                  YAMA
                    You don t even have a plan. What *
                    good is duty with no plan?*

                                  STAN
                    I have a plan. All roads lead to *
                    India.*

                                  YAMA
                    And how do you get out of here? *
                    Trash chutes? 
                          (off Stan)
                    If you hack the doors they ll be on 
                    you like stink. Ironically, stink 
                    will also be on you like stink. 

      She starts drawing in the air with her finger. A STRING OF 
      NUMBERS appear on MARTY S SLEEVE. 

                                  YAMA (CONT D)
                    My access code to everywhere in

                    Not just for the Moon.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 38.


      Marty smiles and winks, then dives into the vent. Stan starts  *
      to follow when Yama stops him:  *

                                  YAMA *
                    You still didn t say who you are. *

      Stan smiles, reassuring. As he does, we POP ECU to one of the  *
      whiskers on Stan s chin. There s a miniscule CAMERA LENS on 
      the end. CAMERA PUSHES CLOSE ON the LENS and --

      POV, chin s-eye view: Yama, now fish-eyed by the tiny lens. 

                                  YAMA (CONT D)

      REVERSE TO REVEAL: *

      INT. HUSSY GALACTIC SHUTTLE3030 *

      The scene has been live-streaming into the shuttle, where 
      Stan s real boss has been watching it. EVE s eyes narrow.

                      Immediately. 

      She glances out the WINDOWS at the Moon below. CAMERA FOLLOWS 
      her GLANCE, dropping STRAIGHT DOWN, TO:

      INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - LAB3131

      Yama has Marty s suit, still in its evidence bag, on her 
      space-desk. She breaks the evidence seal and carefully pulls 
      the suit out, spreading it across her work space. 

      As she lays it out, her fingers brush across the sleeve with 
      the BIOLUMINISCENT GOOP on it. Before she can react, the GOOP  
      ABSORBS into her SKIN. 

      She curses under her breath, looking over the suit for any 
      more of the stuff, but finding none. Crap! She looks again at 
      her fingers, but the stuff is GONE. OFF HER:

3232INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - INFIRMARY 

      Security is thick. TECHS and INVESTIGATORS examine 
      everything. Ian and Gale are in the midst of it.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 39.

                    They re not working together. 

      They turn to find Yama walking up, all hepped up.  

                                  YAMA (CONT D)
                    I mean, they are now, but they 
                    weren t earlier. I mean  earlier  
                    earlier, not like,  three hours 
                    ago  earlier. Though they weren t 
                    then, either. They clearly were 
                    meeting for the first time. What?

      Gale and Ian are staring at her. 

                                  GALE
                    How are you standing? 

      Yama looks at herself, leg-brace-free and suddenly aware 
      she s not feeling the effects of the artificial gravity.

                                  GALE (CONT D)
                          (calling out)
                    Dr. Lake. 

                                  YAMA
                    No no. I m fine. You know, I 
                      accidentally took two caffeine 
                    pills and forgot I had a pot of 
                    coffee this morning. I m just too 
                    hyper to feel like a six hundred 
                    pound heifer.

      Ian spots her glancing at her hand, nervous. 

                                  IAN
                          (to Yama)
                    Did you happen to see when the 
                    security cameras were disabled? 

                                  YAMA
                          (shaking her head)
                    Maybe the Indian assassin did it 
                    before he attacked? Or whoever that  *
                    guy was. He seemed wily.  *  HIGH MOON 06/12/1340.


                                  IAN
                    Wily enough to get out through the 
                    trash chutes without setting off 
                    any alarms. Why were you in the 
                      infirmary, by the way? 

                                  GALE
                    Trees don t grow on the Moon, 
                    Thurgood, so whatever you re 
                    barking up is actively wrong.  *

      Gale steps between them, waving over the Doctor. Ian s eyes 
      never leave Yama. 

                                  GALE (CONT D)
                    I still want the doctor to give you 
                    the once over. 
                          (then)
                    No more coffee. 

      She gives a little nod. As the DOCTOR approaches, Ian pulls 
      Gale aside. 

                                  IAN
                    Java jitters don t give people 
                      superhuman strength.

                    There s only two eggs in our 
                    basket. My spy and your brother. 
                    And right now, they re heading 
                    right for an Indian omelette.

                                  IAN
                    Trash chutes were opened with a 
                    universal access code. Your spy 
                    have one of those?
                          (off him)
                    Remember that speech you gave me 
                    about being compromised?

      Gale grimaces, now on the other side of the coin. 

                                  GALE
                    So I trust my daughter and you 
                    trust your brother. Let s go get 
                    answers from the folks that neither 
                    one of us has a fig s worth of 
                    loyalty for... 

    Ian sees Gale s asking for his trust. He nods. As the two men *
      head out of the Infirmary:  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 41.


      EXT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - ESTABLISHING3333

      Emergency lights cast an unnatural glimmer over a deep crater, 
      filled with stilled mining drills and abandoned Moon buggies. 
      Various man-made ledges on the crater s steep wall lead into 
      the base beyond, and portend a similar silence within. CAMERA 
      SWOOPS THROUGH THE MAIN AIRLOCK and INTO:

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - CONTROL ROOM3434

      Arches and domes are walled with bright, intricate patterns 
      and rest under the pensive eyes of ornate Hindu iconography.

      THE ENTIRE BASE IS UTTERLY, EERILY EMPTY.

      Echoing in the emptiness, a lone WOMAN S VOICE SPEAKS IN 
      HINDI: Eve Browning, on the main view screen. She finally  *
      repeats in English:

                                  EVE
                    This is Eve Browning for Indra  *
                      Ravimurtha. Please respond while 
                    this is still a diplomatic call. 

      ARMING AROUND, the only people there are Stan and Marty. 

                                  MARTY
                    Where is everybody?  

      Stan picks up a broken mug. The floor is littered with 
      similar dropped items.

                                  STAN
                    Let s go find your secret garden.

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - SANCTUARY3535

      The room is dominated by a magnificent, terrifying statue of 
      the eight-armed SHIVA. Marty stops suddenly, face paling. 

                                  MARTY
                    Is that statue breathing on me?

      He s focused on Shiva, whose cold, stone eyes stare back. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    That thing s breathing on me. 

      Stan switches spots with Marty, immediately feels the 
       breath.  Marty moves to the side of the statue, examining 
      the arms. Each hand has an eye carved into it -- one eye has 
      a hollow pupil.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 42.


                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Check this out. 

      Stan does. AN ELECTRONIC LOCK-PICK EXTENDS FROM HIS MIDDLE 
      FINGER into the eye. A second later, THE EYE ROTATES 180 
      degrees and --

        SKKKKHHHHHH! The enormous effigy slides to the side, 
      revealing a small egress behind. Stan smiles, nods Marty in.  

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    I don t do first. 

      Stan enters, Marty reluctantly following into:

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA - CAVE SYSTEM3636

      A same strata of BLUE SPARKLING MINERALS he saw in the Moon 
      Vent cave surround them. 

                                  MARTY
                    This looks exactly like the  *
                    interior of that shaft of death I  *
                    climbed into by the sinkhole. 

                                  STAN
                    Could be connected. Indians might  *
                    be siphoning U.S. helium. 

                                  MARTY
                    That even possible? 

                                  STAN
                    It s been known to happen. 

      Marty notices the muddy imprints of flowers on the wall. 

                                  MARTY
                    Check this out -- Flowers.

      Marty examines the imprints, smiling, awestruck, almost. They 
      crumble under his touch. 

                                  STAN
                    Maybe the Indians figured out how 
                    to grow crops in Moon mud. Or 
                    they re trying to create oxygen. 

                                  MARTY
                    This is some heavy science. Game-
                    changing, Moon-shattering, big 
                    money, I d-kill-me-too science.   HIGH MOON 06/12/1343.


                                  STAN
                    It s going to take more than some 
                    crumbling dirt to shake the pillars 
                    of creation. Like, say, an actual 
                    Indian to confirm what s really 
                    going on. 

                                  MARTY
                    Yeah... where is everybody?

      Some rocks SKID behind them. Stan pushes Marty against the 
      wall. The silhouettes of TWO ARMED MEN inch toward them. 

      One of the men spots Stan, and issues sharp, stern commands-- 
      in RUSSIAN. Stan s face slips into immediate confusion. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Russians. 

                                  STAN
                    Trofim? 

      Stan shines his light on the two men, sure enough revealing 
      TROFIM with a RUSSIAN PRIVATE named FILIPOV. OFF TROFIM:

      EXT. MOON S SURFACE3737

      Filipov and Trofim frog march Marty and Stan toward their 
      waiting buggy. Filipov and Marty have similar confused 
        expressions. Trofim is silent, glowering. 

                                    FILIPOV
                    Sir... why is the corporal in 
                      handcuffs? And who--   

                                  TROFIM
                    Because he s a spy.

                                  MARTY
                          (to Stan)
                    What s the deal with you two? 

      Stan realizes something. Stops suddenly, turning. 

                                  STAN
                          (to Trofim)
                    You put a tracking device in the 
                    ring, didn t you? What kind of 
                    partner does that?  

                                  TROFIM
                      Apparently it s a good thing I did.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 44.


                                    FILIPOV
                    You two are partners? 

                                  MARTY
                    What s going on?

                                    FILIPOV
                    Partners in what?

                                  TROFIM
                    We re not partners. Not any more.

                                  MARTY
                      Everybody s getting louder...

                          (lightbulb)
                    Oh my God, you re both spies. 

      He stops and pulls his gun. 

                                    FILIPOV (CONT D)
                    Surrender your firearm, sir. 

                                  MARTY
                    Whoa...

      Trofim draws his gun. 

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Whoa!

                                  STAN
                    Everybody take it easy now. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Stand down, Private. That s an 
                    order.

        THUMPTHUMP-CRUUUUUNCHH! They all reel around as a GIANT 
      SHADOW CRAWLS OVER THEM. 

                                  MARTY
                    WHOA!

      A GIANT, 50 FOOT TALL TYRANNOSAURUS REX-LOOKING ROBOT JUST  *
      CRUSHED THEIR MOON BUGGY UNDER ITS HUGE FOOT!

      Stan and Trofim exchange a bewildered look. Marty is already 
      bolting as fast as he can. T-REX spots him and chases him--  *

      ITS GIANT FOOT COMES DOWN RIGHT ON TOP OF MARTY - and keeps 
      right on going, never breaking stride.    HIGH MOON  06/12/13 45.


      Stan winces, running to the spot of should-be squish, but 
      there s nothing -- MARTY IS SIMPLY GONE! 

      Stan stares agog as THE ROBOT LUMBERS AWAY. 

                                  END OF ACT FOUR  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 46.

      Filipov has his weapon trained on Stan and Trofim.

                                  FILIPOV
                    Somebody needs to tell me what in 
                    the name of the Volga is going on! 
                    Why was I just attacked by a... a  *
                    dinosaur?? *

                                  STAN
                    You ask that like we know. 

                                  FILIPOV
                    FREEZE!

      Trofim was inching toward Filipov. His finger tightens around 
    the trigger when: 

      STAN S DISEMBODIED HAND suddenly pops a small NEEDLE OUT OF  
    ITS MIDDLE FINGER and into FILIPOV S NECK, KNOCKING HIM OUT. 
      Trofim, more confused than ever, turns to Stan.

                                  TROFIM
                    What are you?

    OFF TROFIM:

      INT. TRANQUILITY STATION - AIRLOCK3939

      Gale, Ian and a half-dozen SPACE MARINES are in the airlock, 
      putting on spacesuits and locking/loading their weapons. 

                                  IAN 
                    Six of us. Six thousand Indians.

                                  GALE
                    Time to take a stand. 

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    Blink that trigger happy glint out 
                    of your eyes, the Indian Base has 
                    been abandoned. 

      Gale and Ian turn to find Eve has entered the airlock. 

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                    The Indians don t appear to be  *

                                  IAN
                    Could another base be hiding them?

                                  EVE
                    No one has requisitioned the extra 
                    oxygen it would take. There s no  *
                    bodies. No sign of trauma.

                    Thousands of people don t just 
                    vanish into thin air. There s no

      Ian has been studying Eve. 

                                  IAN 
                    You didn t come here to tell us 
                    that. 

                                  EVE
                    I beg your pardon but I most 
                    certainly did. 

                                  IAN
                    Then the question is why you came 
                    here, seeing as we would ve found 
                    all this out ourselves. 

      She smiles wryly -- too smart to keep lying to Ian. 

                                  EVE
                    There s a team of Russians already 
                    inside the Indian Base. 

                                  GALE
                    Since when did you start guard-
                    dogging the Russians?  

                                  EVE
                    Since I found out you were racing 
                    to the Indian Base guns cocked. The 
                    Moon can only handle one 
                      international incident at time. 

                                  GALE
                    So you lied.

                                  EVE
                      I stalled.   HIGH MOON 06/12/1348.


                                  IAN
                    My experience on the Moon so far 
                    has been that there s one sixth the 
                    gravity of Earth and roughly the 
                    same quotient of truth, and 
                    stalling is just one more way to 
                    avoid it. In fact, literally the 
                    only person I ve spoken to who has 
                    been honest to the point of 
                    absurdity is my brother, and if 
                    you re satisfied the Russians have 
                    had time to abscond, I d like to go 
                    find him! 

      OFF IAN, locking his ammo clip into his rifle:

      CLOSE ON MARTY, illuminated only by the glow of his helmet, 
      he s equal parts terrified and confused. SERVOS WHIRR and 
      PNEUMATICS BUZZ AROUND him. He is:

4040INT. THE GIANT ROBOT 

      A series of CLANGS and WHIRS precede the opening of a SIDE 
      HATCH. Marty suddenly finds himself face-to-face with:

                                  MIKIKO
                    Lunar Japan welcomes you.  

      MIKIKO KOBIYASHI, 20. Beside her -- YAMA!

                                  YAMA
                    Still just for the Moon. 

      Marty, stunned, climbs into the cozy cockpit, where Mikiko 
      dispenses tea out of the shell of a discarded robot.  

                                  MARTY
                    I thought everything Japanese up 
                    here was fully automated. 

                                  YAMA
                    It is. Mikiko s supposed to be in 
                      hibernation.  

                                  MIKIKO
                    I wake up when something breaks. 
                    Like... the Maytag Man.

                                  MARTY
                    What s broken now? 

                                  MIKIKO
                    Just the rules. I didn t come to 
                    the Moon to sleep. 
                                  (MORE)  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 49.

                                  MIKIKO (CONT'D)
                    Plus, I have unlimited tools to 
                    build lots of toys. Besides T-Rex,  *
                    I m also building working replicas 
                    of Tricerotops and Stegosaur so I  *
                    can stage large scale robot theater 
                    for people on Earth to watch with 
                      telescopes. 

      Yama turns to Marty. 

                                  YAMA
                    I found that glowing pollen from 
                    your suit --

      She holds up a hand, tamping down his excitement.

                                  YAMA (CONT D)
                    But -- it s gone. Ish. I... 
                    absorbed it. By accident. 

                                  MIKIKO
                    It made her go bananas. 

      Marty studies them both. 

                                  MARTY
                    You seem pretty cool with the fact 
                    your liver might be choking on 
                    lunar hemlock right now...

                                  MIKIKO
                    We scanned her bodily humors.

      Mikiko hands him a sheet of paper.

                                  MIKIKO (CONT D)
                    She s full of nothing but the blood 
                    and guts of Yama Winehart.

      With a wave of Mikiko s leather glove, the paper PIXILATES in 
      his HAND and DISAPPEARS.  Marty looks at Yama, wary.

                                  YAMA
                    I m fine. If anything, it made me 
                    feel more... connected to the Moon. 

                                  MARTY
                    Uh... I respect your need for a 
                    vision quest or whatever, but look 
                    at the Indians. Oh wait. You can t, 
                    cause they re all gone. 
                                  (MORE)  HIGH MOON 06/12/1350.

                                  MARTY (CONT'D)
                    I m just saying -- maybe it s time *
                    to get your dad and his unlimited *
                    resources to dig for flowers so you *
                    don t end up like them...  *

                                  YAMA
                    His  resources  come from Hussy *
                    Galactic. If he knows, it s a nano-
                    second before Eve Browning finds *
                    out, too.

                                  MARTY
                    Even better. She seems to be as 
                        bleeding-heart-passionate about 
                      protecting the Moon as you. 

                                  YAMA
                    Our versions of protecting the Moon 
                    are two totally different schools 
                    of thought. Like, I don t want to 
                    turn it into Las Vegas. 
                          (then)
                    Finding this flower is a discovery 
                    for science. Not business. It s a *
                    discovery for us to make. 

      Marty nods, starting to get it. 

                                  MIKIKO
                          (smiling)
                    T-Rex digs. *

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - CONTROL ROOM4141

      Stan tries to get a consoles working. Trofim supervises.  

                                  STAN
                    Remember when the Moon was a quiet 
                    place to fraternize and have a 
                    little romance?

                                  TROFIM
                    Just fix the emergency beacon.

                    We obviously got bigger things here 
                    to fix. 

      Trofim grabs a coffee mug and violently launches it against 
      the floor next to Stan. He gestures to it, livid.

                                  TROFIM
                    You cannot fix something that s

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - SANCTUARY4242

      FILIPOV blinks back to consciousness. He s been shackled to 
      the giant Shiva statue. As struggles against his restraints, 
      he fails to notice:

      SHIVA S EIGHT ARMED SHADOW SHIFTS ON THE FLOOR BEHIND HIM. It 
      MOVES AGAIN, dancing almost, finally catching Filipov s eye. 
      He freezes, angling his head up slowly, controlling his fear. 

      His EYES WIDEN quick as his MOUTH, flying open with a SCREAM!

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - CONTROL ROOM4343

      Both men react immediately. Stan s off like a shot, Trofim 
      right behind. They race into --

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - SANCTUARY4444

      -- and stop cold. All that s left of Filipov are HIS HANDS, 
      STILL SHACKLED TO SHIVA. 

                                  TROFIM
                    His hands aren t supposed to do 
                    that.

      Stan nods to the trail of blood -- it leads directly into the 
      caves beyond the Shiva. As the taunting eyes of the carved 
      stone dare them to enter:

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      IAN S EYES, cold and calculating as they drink in--

      EXT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - ESTABLISHING4545

      Gale, Eve and the Marines are with him. As they march in, 
      wary, UPCUT TO: 

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA -- CONTROL ROOM4646

      Gale and his men move quickly into the room, clearing it 
      quickly and efficiently. Nothing to be seen here. 

                                  GALE
                    I want these consoles fired up and

      Ian inspects the console Stan was working on moments before. 

                                  EVE
                    Somebody else had the same idea.   HIGH MOON 06/12/1353.


                                  IAN
                    Russians. I m going to head for the *

                    Indians. 

4747INT. MOSHKA KILAA -- RAVIMURTHA S OFFICE 

      Large panoramic windows encircle this crow s nest office, 
      looking out on the crater below and the star-field above. The 
      cherry wood furniture and plush burgundy carpets are 
      amorphous phantasms and colorless shrouds under the pall of 
      the emergency lighting.   

      Ian and Eve are in the doorway. Eve crosses to the desk,  *
      opens the drawer. She procures a sheaf of real paper. 

                                  EVE
                    I haven t seen real paper since I 
                    was a girl. 

                                  IAN
                    Two kinds of people use paper.  
                    Romantics and spies afraid of being 
                    hacked. 

                                  EVE
                    There s certainly nothing romantic 
                    about oxygen logs. According to 
                    this they haven t used any oxygen 
                    for three months. Must be a hoax.

                                  IAN
                          (inhaling deeply:)
                    Tastes like oxygen. Maybe they 
                    figured out how to make it 
                      synthetically.

                                  EVE
                    Maybe they thought they did and it 
                    poisoned them.

      Her hairpin coughs exhaust. Ian considers her point a quick 
      beat, then deliberately engages his own helmet. As they talk--

      A FACE OOZES OUT OF THE SHADOWS behind them, as if emerging 
      from a pool of oil. 

      Ian senses it, turning to face it and pushing Eve behind him 
      in the process. There, in the darkness, stands the imposing 
      silhouette of AMBASSADOR INDRA RAVIMURTHA.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 54.


      Eve steps forward, recognizing him: 

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                      Ambassador -- Ravimurtha?

      She takes a step toward him, but thinks better of it.  

                                    RAVIMURTHA
                    Eyes...

                          IANRAVIMURTHA
      Sir -- What happened here? Darkness...

                                  EVE
                    Where are the others? 

                                    RAVIMURTHA
                    They re here. Eyes... in the  *
                    darkness. 

                                  IAN
                          (sotto, to Eve)
                    I can t see his eyes...

                                    RAVIMURTHA
                    I see them. And they see you.

      The Indian suddenly opens his eyes, revealing the TWO EMPTY 
      SOCKETS BEHIND! His EYES are GONE! 

      Ian pulls Eve back just before --

      The SHADOWS SEEM TO GROW AROUND RAVIMURTHA, SWALLOWING HIM. 
      With a sickening POP! he VANISHES COMPLETELY. 

      The inky shadows out of which Ravimurtha s face first crowned 
      now seem to be thickening, growing further into the light. 
      Ian and Eve instinctively back toward the door when Ian gets 
      an eerie tingle down his spine...

      He lets his eyes drift skyward, trying to control his terror 
      when he sees the beautiful star-field above has been replaced 
      by 

      DOZENS OF DISEMBODIED HUMAN EYES LOOKING DOWN UPON THEM.

      As Eve matches his gaze, DOZENS AND DOZENS MORE EYEBALLS 
      START POPPING OPEN, STARING IN FROM THE WINDOWS AROUND THEM. 

      OFF THESE EYES IN THE DARKNESS:

4848INT. MOSHKA KILAA (INDIAN BASE) - CAVES  

      Stan and Trofim follow the trail of Filipov s blood -- until 
    it abruptly stops in the middle of the caves. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Why would it stop? Maybe he was 
                    loaded onto a transport or --

    He stops suddenly as DRIP... A TEARDROP of BLOOD splatters 
      onto his suit. Looking up, he can t see through the  *
      penetrating darkness above him.  *

    Out the shadow -- an UNEARTHLY HISS. *

                                  STAN *
                    Filipov?*

      Without taking his eyes away from the shadows, Trofim hands  *
      Stan a gun.  *

    Out of the black just above them, a GROTESQUELY TWISTED ARM  *
      SUDDENLY STRETCHES OUT -- FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND  *
      ANOTHER. It s like a real life Shiva is trying to pull itself 
      through a tear in the shadows. 

      Stan and Trofim turn and bolt. 

      Behind them, a giant, silhouetted something FALLS OUT OF THE 
      RIFT IN THE SHADOW and INTO EXISTENCE. 

      Alternately glancing back, their helmet lights capture 
      flashes of WHATEVER S CHASING THEM as it cartwheels closer 
      and closer: A GIANT CEPHALOPOD of a MAN, with MULTIPLE LIMBS 
      and FACES, BEARING DOWN on THEM.  

      POP! It vanishes. POP! It s back, CLOSER. POP! Gone again as 
      the men race back into

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA -- SANCTUARY4949

      They head for the Control Room door. Stan tries it. 

                                  STAN
                    It s locked!

                                  TROFIM
                    Use your special hands!

                                  STAN
                    I am!  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 56.


      The HISSING behind loudens as the MONSTER POPS into existence 
      nearly on top of them. Just then -- the door flies open, Stan 
      and Trofim falling right into:

      INT. MOSHKA KILAA -- CONTROL ROOM5050

      Stan kicks the door shut and engages the lock.

      Catching his breath, he turns to find a HALF-DOZEN MARINES 
      with their WEAPONS POINTED RIGHT AT HIM. Gale stands at their 
      center, cold as ice. Ian and Eve are beside him. Eve betrays 
      no sign of knowing Stan.  

      Before anyone can speak:

      WHUMP! Something crashes into the door. WHUMP! AGAIN! The 
      Marines shift their guns between Stan and Trofim and the 
      Door. WHUMP! Everybody takes a step back.

                                  GALE
                    What is that? 

                                  STAN
                      A giant... human cephalopod. 

      WHUMP!! One more hit at the door and then silence. 

                                  GALE
                    What in the high hell were these  *
                    people doing here?! *

                                  IAN *
                    Where is my brother? 

                                  STAN
                    A 50 foot robot stepped on him. 
                    It s been a strange day. 

      Gale knows exactly what that means: 

                                  GALE
                    Somebody get Japan on the horn. And 
                    handcuff them and get  em --

                                  MARINE
                    Sir -- he doesn t have hands...

                                  EVE
                    They re over here. 

      Gale turns to find one of Stan s disembodied hands holding a 
      grenade, the other holding the pin.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 57.


                                  STAN
                    Weapons down. 

      Gale gauges him a minute. He nods to his men, who comply. 

                                  STAN (CONT D)
                          (to Trofim)
                    Get the door.

      Stan and Trofim back slowly out of the room, GRENADE TOTING 
      HANDS FOLLOWING. As soon as they re gone: 

                                  GALE
                    Stick a cork in every blowhole this 
                    base has and stop them before they 
                    get out!

      As his men mobilize, Eric turns to the now operational 
      console and hits a couple of buttons. A HOLOGRAPHIC SECRETARY 
      OF THE AIR FORCE JONES suddenly appears. 

                                  JONES
                    Thurgood. This is the emergency 
                    line.  

                                  IAN
                    Sir, you need to you implement 
                    Section 361 immediately.

                                  JONES
                    How, exactly, did an isolated 
                    explosion mushroom into a 
                      quarantine of the Moon? 

                                  IAN
                    An entire colony of people is 
                    missing. There are reports of... 
                      impossible biological entities. I 
                      personally witnessed a man 
                    disappear into thin air beneath the 
                    gaze of ten thousand de-socketed 
                    human eyeballs and everybody here 
                    is breathing oxygen of an unknown 
                    origin. Whatever s causing all this 
                    is some kind of something that 
                    should be contained. 

      Jones knows he s right, but he hates it. 

                                  JONES
                    You damn well better deliver me 
                    some answers soon. And keep this 
                      Quarantine business quiet!  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 58.

      INT. THE GIANT ROBOT5151

      YAMA, rubbing her hands together where the goop absorbed. 
      Marty and Mikiko are absorbed in the big monitors showing the 
      Robot s hands digging through Moon dirt. 

                                  YAMA
                    We keep assuming the flower s new. 
                    Maybe it s super old, but it s 
                    always just fed off helium trapped 
                    down deep in the Moon. 

                                  MIKIKO
                    Yes! We mined its food, it grew out 
                    further and further until it pooped 
                    through the surface. 

                                  MARTY
                    Popped. 

                                  YAMA
                    That would account for why every 
                    country s helium yields are 
                    dropping like a rock on Earth.

                                  MARTY
                    We re on the verge of explaining 
                    how a flower can grow in a vacuum. 
                    If my brother were here, I d 
                    politely tell him to  suck it. 

      Yama and Mikiko glance at him. He s a little too excited.

                                  MARTY (CONT D)
                    Brothers make terrible fathers.   

                                  YAMA
                    I m sure you were a delight. You re 
                      relationship sounds so healthy. 

                                  MARTY
                    I said  politely.   And this coming 
                    from the girl who calls her dad 
                     the General. 

                                  YAMA
                      Difference is I love the General.

                                  MARTY
                    I love Ian. But my head s not big 
                    enough for both of us. 
                                  (MORE)  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 59.

                                  MARTY (CONT'D)
                    He s always got so much riding on 
                    being right, and he s so freaked 
                    out he s gonna be wrong, that he 
                    has to mentally eviscerate 
                    everybody around him so his brain 
                    doesn t eat itself. And that means 
                    a lonely life for Ian. 

                                  YAMA
                    Sounds like regret.  *

      Marty looks down, feeling for his brother. He shakes it off. 
      With a grin:

                                  MARTY
                    Not being able to keep your own 
                    secrets was no way to go through 
                    puberty and it s sure no way to go 
                    through life.  

                                  MIKIKO
                    There! Check it out...

      They all peer closer at the black dot in the white dust. Yama 
      leans back, gravity of the situation really sinking in. 

                                  YAMA
                    Imagine if we do find... something. 
                    Nobody ever thought first contact 
                    would be with a plant. 

      As the robot s metal fingers prod it, the DOT WIDENS. Grains 
      of Moon dust pour into it. That s no flower, it s a SINKHOLE!

                                  MARTY
                    Back up back up BACK UP!!

      As the giant ROBOT IS SWALLOWED, tumbling into BLACKNESS:

      Marty and Yama are both unconscious in the rubble of T-Rex.  *
      Mikiko squints at their twisted forms. She opens her mouth to 
      speak, but can t. WIDENING, we see... 

      A PIECE OF ROBOT PROTRUDES FROM HER TORSO. 

      Suddenly, she CRACKLES, like a bad TV signal, before BLINKING 
      OUT OF EXISTENCE -- a hologram.

5353EXT. MOON S SURFACE - SINKHOLE 

      Mikiko s safe and sound back at the rim -- the fail-safe. A 
      safe distance away, she strains to see down the hole:

5454INT./EXT. MOON BUGGY 

      STAN and TROFIM bobble along. Stan offers Trofim his canteen. 

                                  STAN
                    What? You re gonna let yourself die 
                    of dehydration to spite me?

      Trofim relents, takes a swig. Stan looks relieved. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Where are we going? We can t go 
                    back to Russia.

                                  STAN
                    The Americans clearly aren t throwing 
                    open the doors anytime soon.

      Trofim shakes his head. 

                                  TROFIM
                    I can t sit by and watch you betray 
                    my country. I also can t turn you 
                    in or you ll be executed. 

                                  STAN
                    You could join me. 

                                  TROFIM
                    I m not a traitor.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 61.


                                  STAN
                    The Americans and Russians have 
                    been trying to kill each other 
                    forever. That doesn t fit into Eve 
                    Branson s utopia, so she keeps the 
                    peace. With me. 

                                  TROFIM
                    Guess you should ve been watching 
                    the Indians. 

                                  STAN
                    That s why we re hiring.  

                                  TROFIM 
                    Noble causes are subjective, and 
                    I ll always be loyal to my country.  

      Trofim leans back, rubbing his head, suddenly feeling woozy. 

                                  TROFIM (CONT D)
                    So what am I supposed to do? 

                                  STAN
                    Forget any of this happened. It s 
                    the only way to fix everything.

      Stan s up to something. Trofim looks at him, then the water 
      he was just drinking, realizing he s been drugged.

                                  STAN (CONT D)
                    The last 24 hours will be gone when 
                    you wake up. 

      As he gets groggier, Trofim shakes his head -- but behind the 
      disappointment lies the subtlest hint of relief in his eyes. 
      As he slumps over, Stan catches him and kisses the back of 
      his head. As Trofim s eyes shut, CUT TO:

      INT. HUSSY GALACTIC SHUTTLE5656 *

      Ian sits silently beside Gale. Eve enters from the cockpit. 
      TWO SPACE MARINES sit nearby.

                    What exactly were your brother and 
                    your daughter hoping to dig up?  HIGH MOON  06/12/13 62.


                                  IAN
                    I think a little grim silence might 
                    do us all some good.

                                  EVE
                    Evading is an even greater enemy of 
                    the truth than stalling, Agent 
                    Thurgood. And its our allegiance to 
                    secrets and lies that that landed 
                    us in his hassle.

                                  GALE
                    You holding everyone s oxygen for 
                    ransom is what caused this  hassle. 

                                  EVE
                    Without my oxygen, you d be mining 
                    helium with a hammer and sickle for 
                    your comrades in Baza Kedr. I 
                      single-handedly prevented a Russian 
                    monopoly in space, then I 
                      sacrificed sound business practice 
                    by letting everybody get a free 
                    slice of the Moon-pie. That 
                    idealism failed. Now you get to 
                    work for me, transparently, to 
                    deliver the future our forebears 
                    promised, or I bowl you over. 

      With that, she turns and exits again, giving a GLOBE of the 
      MOON a derisive spin as she goes. As it ROTATES WILDLY:

5757INT. SINKHOLE 

      Yama s eyes flutter open and quickly extricates herself from 
    the rubble. She climbs over to Marty. 

                                  YAMA
                    Did you die? 

                                  MARTY 
                    You wish. How far did we fall?

                                  YAMA
                    I can t see the hole above us. 

                                  MARTY
                    I m stuck. 

      Yama grabs a piece of metal to use as a lever. The robot 
      doesn t shift enough for Marty to wiggle free. 

                                  YAMA
                    That was the best you could do?   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 63.


                                  MARTY
                    Maybe if your little tyrannosaur 
                    arms had some meat on them --

                                  YAMA
                    Shut up and save your oxygen. How 
                    much oxygen do you have, anyway?

      Yama studies the various tunnels winding around them.

                                  MARTY
                    I know what you re thinking, but 
                    you wander off into one of those 
                    caves you ll be lost forever. 
                          (then)
                    Mikiko ll send help.

                                  YAMA
                    It s my fault you re in this mess. 

                                  MARTY
                    It s your fault I m even alive! 
                    You ve already saved me three times. 
                    It s starting to get embarrassing. 

      The red light in Marty s helmet starts blinking:

                                  SUIT
                    Three minutes to oxygen depletion. 

                                  YAMA
                    Three minutes?!

                                  MARTY
                    I snuck out of the American base, 
                    like, four hours ago now. 

                                  YAMA
                    I m going to find a clean signal to 
                    the surface. Mikiko will have extra 
                    O-2.  

                                  MARTY
                    Yama, don t --

                                  YAMA
                    Don t die!

      She bolts. Marty slows down his breathing, tries to stay calm 
      as the red light blinks faster and faster, until --

      It stops flashing. Marty s eyes flutter shut. Immediately:   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 64.


                                  SUIT
                    Oxygen levels replenished. 

      Marty slowly blinks his eyes open again. He smiles faintly at 
      the blurry image above him: Ian. Marty jars upward. Gale, 
      Eve, Mikiko and the Space Marines are there, too. 

                                  MARTY
                    Ian... We were looking for the 
                    flower.

      They stare at each other a moment. Utter relief. Suddenly, 
      Ian lurches forward and pulls Marty into a tight embrace. 

                                  IAN
                    I know. I believe you. 

                                  GALE
                    Where is Yama?  

                                  MARTY
                    She s not with you?  *

      Ian s eyes say it all. Gale spins around, looking at the 
      myriad of tunnels around them. OFF HIS DESPAIR: 

      INT. CAVES5858

      Yama, guided only by the blinking red light on her helmet, 
      trips and stumbles as fast as she can through the caves. She 
      looks behind her. Ahead. To the side. Up. Down. It s all the 
      same. Lost. Black. Scary. She pushes herself on. 

                                  YAMA S SUIT
                    1 minute to oxygen depletion. 

      She runs, now. Panic bubbling. Breathing in gasps till 
      there s nothing left to gasp. She stumbles, but pushes on. 

                                  YAMA S SUIT (CONT D)
                    Oxygen depleted. 

      She collapses, grasping her chest. Lungs on fire. She starts 
      dragging herself on the ground. Won t quit till she s dead. 
      Slower... slower... she pushes with her ankles alone, teeth 
      gritted. Using the pain to stay conscious...

      Until she can t. She lies, still. The death of a hero, bathed 
      only in the dim red glow of her helmet. Her glassy eyes are 
      about to blink shut for the last time, until they come to 
      rest on

      A SINGLE RED FLOWER GROWING A FEW YARDS AWAY.   HIGH MOON  06/12/13 65.


      As she lies watching it, the FLOWER FLUTTERS in a BREEZE. 

    Her eyes bulge and with one last heave of strength, SHE 
      DEACTIVATES HER HELMET, GASPING AS FRESH AIR FILLS HER LUNGS!

      YAMA WINEHART IS BREATHING ON THE MOON. 

      Relief pours over her as she pulls herself to the flower. The 
      breeze sends her hair across her face. 

      She turns in the direction of the draft, a small RAY OF LIGHT 
      cutting through a small hole in the rocks. She places her eye 
      to it, but can t see much. She grabs a rock and starts 
      bashing until she s able to push through, into:

5959INT. THE LOTUS CAVES 

      A jungle. Plants, water, fruit, vegetables, grass. Some of it 
      familiar, some of it alien. Lunar Eden. 

      Yama s mouth falls open, joy washing over her. OFF HER, THE 
      KEEPER OF THE MOON, CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK -- then SPEEDS 
      UP -- giving breadth to the true immensity of the CAVES... 

      YAMA DISAPPEARS into the tapestry of exotic plant life as 
      CAMERA PULLS AWAY FASTER and FASTER, now TRACKING over A 
      STEAMING RIVER of LIQUID METHANE. 

      Illusory strange shapes whirr by: some look like walking 
      trees, others the bones of some unknown animal, but the SPEED 
      of CAMERA, THE VAPOR from the river and the DENSE FOLIAGE 
      BLUR the CAVES  SECRETS beyond any certainty. 

      The RIVER finally CASCADES OVER A PRECIPICE, into a 
      bottomless VOID. It s here, in the darkness --

      SEVERAL SETS OF SHIMMERING EYES POP OMINOUSLY OPEN.

      OFF THESE EYES IN THE DARKNESS: 

                                      END OF SHOW
