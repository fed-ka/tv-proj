      Aubrey walks along the quai, utterly sad -- the boat follows 
    her on the river, then pulls ahead. Her eyes are wet, the 
      music ascendant:

                                       BROKENHEARTED  FRENCH VOCAL
                    Que deviennent les coeurs bris es     
                    Qui ont aim s et qui sont 
                      maintenant s par s?  
                    Je sais que je vais trouver
                    Quelque instants de s r nit    mon 
                    esprit, peut  tre

      Young lovers embrace at the balustrade by the river, making 
      Aubrey s loneliness as she passes by seem even sadder.



      Aubrey continues up the narrow sidewalk, so oblivious in her 
      sadness that a young man must step into the street to let her 
      pass.  The music diminishes as the sound of a busy outdoor 
      cafe comes up.


      WINE POURING INTO A GLASS: ITS COLOR AN UNAPPETIZING PURPLE

                                  WODDY (O.C.)
                    How can you drink that swill?

                                  JIMMY (O.C.)
                    What?



    At the  Chapeau Noir,  a sidewalk cafe the style of 
      Philosophes or La Chaise au Plafond, WODDY, a somewhat 
      pretentious European playboy type, bickers with an American, 
      JIMMY, while HAL, good-looking but somber, remains silent.                                                                                      3.


                                  WODDY
                    C tes du Rh ne swill.

                                  JIMMY
                    Well, it s cheap.

                                  WODDY
                    The whole point of coming to the 
                     Chapeau  is the Bordeaux, which is 
                    good as well as cheap.

      Jimmy looks around:

                                  JIMMY
                    No, it s the surroundings I like.

    On surrounding cafe terraces are many attractive women. 

                                  WODDY
                    Lots of places have attractive 
                     surroundings;  this one has a 
                    good, cheap Bordeaux--

                                  JIMMY
                    Not as cheap as the C tes du Rh ne.

                                  HAL
                    Oh, give me a break!  Cheap 
                      Bordeaux!  Cheap C tes du 
                    Rh ne!...   You re broken records -
                    talk about something else!

    A pause; the others are surprised by his vehemence.

                                  WODDY
                    And... how are you?

    Hal says nothing.

                                  JIMMY
                    In a funk.  Another  rupture. 

                                  WODDY
                    Omigosh, not again.
                          (smiling, to Hal)
                    How many times has she dumped you? 

                                  HAL
                    It s not  dumping  -- they were 
                    break ups.

                                  WODDY
                    How many times has she broken up 
                    with you? Twenty? Thirty?                                                                                      4.


                                  HAL
                    It was nothing like that.
                          (pause)
                    Maybe sixteen... Or seventeen.

                                  WODDY
                    A European man would never put up 
                    with that. 

                                  JIMMY
                    Oh.  There are no break ups in 
                    Europe?

                                  WODDY
                    Of course -- but to put up with 
                    such a woman? They have a sixth 
                    sense about whom they can push 
                    around and how far. With an 
                    American guy they know they can get 
                    away with pretty much anything.

                                  JIMMY
                    That s... known?

                                  WODDY
                    Yes, of course. American men are 
                    notorious milksops.

                                  JIMMY
                    Yeah -- it s notorious.  But... 
                    Clemence is breathtakingly  
                    attractive if otherwise 
                      problematical. 

      Woddy makes a skeptical face.

                                  WODDY
                    Uh, I could never be interested in 
                    a woman her age -- skinny and dried 
                    out.

                                  JIMMY
                    Well, Hal did manage to burrow 
                    himself  deeply within the French 
                    beast.  

                                  WODDY
                          (smiling)
                    What?

                                  JIMMY
                      Penetrating French society -- which  
                    few of us accomplish or even 
                    seriously attempt.                                                                                      5.


                                  WODDY
                    I don t see how that s an 
                    achievement.

                                  JIMMY
                    Well, between all of us only Hal 
                    did it.  
                          (to Hal)
                    How did you and Clemence even meet?

    Hal recollects -- getting sentimental, dangerously so.

                                  HAL
                    Through Fritz--  

                                  WODDY
                    Fritz Becker!?  

                                  JIMMY
                    You can actually meet nice people 
                    through Fritz...  Not just 
                    criminals.

                                  HAL
                    It s true...  It was three summers 
                    ago; I was at a low point--

                                  WODDY
                    You re always at a low point.

                                  HAL
                    No, but even lower -- the pits: 
                    marriage over, family moved out, no 
                    one I knew in town. It s one aspect 
                    of expatriate life rarely talked 
                    about -- how horribly lonely you 
                    can get. I don t think it s just me 
                    -- a lot of people go through it.
                            (continuing)

                                                                      PICTURE CUT:

      Audrey stumbling along another street.

                                  HAL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    There s a feeling of being hollowed 
                    out, not wanting to bother the few 
                    people you might know and maybe too 
                    sad to see even those you do... 

    She passes a couple of young lovers lingering there, making 
    her own solitariness seem more stark.                                                                                      6.


                                  HAL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    It s a feeling you might have in 
                    childhood but forget as an 
                      adult...until it comes back, a void 
                    inside which seems as if it ll 
                    never fill again.


      TIGHT ON JIMMY S FACE CONTEMPLATING THE  VOID. 

                                  WODDY
                    That does sound pretty bad...



    The three at their cafe table, Woddy less impressed:

                                  WODDY
                    ...but what happened with Fritz?

    Hal recollects himself.

                                  HAL
                    Well, Fritz suggested we meet at 
                    the Flore -- which normally I d 
                    have avoided as he s either 
                    impossibly late or doesn t show up 
                    at all.  But as I hadn t seen 
                    anyone in days...



                                  HAL
                    What?

                                  WODDY
                    Oh, come on: you couldn t be more 
                    of a Yank cliche.
                          (parodying Fritz s French)
                     Madame, est-ce que vous pouvez
                    voir un Am ricain solitaire l -bas? 
                    Il a peut- tre command  une vodka
                    tomate... 



                                  HAL 
                    It turns out Fritz was in 
                    Versailles with some girl but 
                    wanted me to wait for him at the 
                    Flore.

                                  JIMMY
                    Typical.



    Hal walks along with his satchel.

                                  WODDY (V.O.)
                    What nerve.

    Hal slows and stops at a bookstore.

                                  HAL (V.O.)
                    I wasn t about to wait -- but on 
                    the walk back to my place did 
                    dawdle a bit.

    Hal browsing in the bookstore -- or standing, face buried in 
    a volume.

                                  HAL (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    To be honest I wasn t anxious to 
                    get home.



    Hal strolls along the Seine -- the beautiful deserted summer 
      atmosphere.  The sound of car brakes.

                                  FRITZ (O.S.)
                    Cooper!  Cooper!  

    Hal turns; FRITZ BECKER calls from a dark green Mercedes.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    Bastard!  You didn t wait...  Come 
                    on, get in!



    The three as before:

                                  JIMMY
                    What nerve.

                                  WODDY
                    It s not nerve.  It s insanity.



      Fritz scrambles back in the car.                                                                                    10.


                                  HAL (O.S.)
                    Well, he did get the girl s number 
                    and dated her for a while. 

    ON WODDY:

                                  WODDY
                    So.  Anyone can do that.

      BACK TO THE CAR, as it leaves town.

                                  HAL (O.S.)
                    We were heading to a dinner party 
                    at his friend Rufo s house in 
                    Nanterre--

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                    There are  houses  in Nanterre?

                                  WODDY (O.S.)
                    There are people named  Rufo? 



                                  HAL
                    Well, actually, they call them 
                     chalets. 



    The Mercedes proceeds haltingly through the depressing 
      quarters of Nanterre, which is most of it.

                                  HAL (O.S.)
                    But we ended up completely lost.

                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
                    It s probably better to have an ex-
                    Mossad driver in Jerusalem -- than 
                    Nanterre.

                                  FRITZ
                    Could I borrow your phone?

    Hal thinks a moment and then, reluctantly, hands Fritz his 
      phone.

                                  WODDY (O.S.)
                    Omigosh, dangerous handing someone 
                    like Fritz your phone.                                                                                    11.



    The Mercedes poking hesitantly into a driveway.

                                  JIMMY (V.O.)
                    I thought  chalets  were, like, ski 
                    lodges.

                                  HAL (V.O.)
                    No,  chalet  is what stand alone 
                    houses are called here.

                                  MARKEETA
                    Fritz!  Tu arrives!



      Markeeta approaches to greet Fritz and Hal; she had been 
      sitting with some lovely women -- they move chairs to make 
      way for the arrivals.  

                                  FRITZ
                    You re all mothers, n est-ce pas?  
                    This is my friend, Hal -- he s 
                    lonely and craves the company of 
                    maternal women.

    A positive reaction from the attractive young mother types:  
      CLEMENCE smiles and makes way for Hal to sit near her; her 
      English is especially charming:

                                  CLEMENCE
                    Is that true, Hal, you crave our 
                    company?



      Aubrey, the girl followed earlier, eyes still moist, walks 
      along the winding street as it opens up onto the cafes of the 
      Rue du Tresor.

                                  JIMMY
                    So you fell for her right away?

      Aubrey sits at the table nearest them.

                                  HAL
                    Pretty much...                                                                                      12.



    Hal and Clemence deep in conversation.

                                  HAL (O.S.)
                      ...Clemence had recently gotten 
                    divorced so had all kinds of sad 
                    stories.



                                  WODDY
                    Oh, yes,  sad stories  -- Americans 
                    love those.

                                  JIMMY
                    A lovely face and sad story...  
                    Hard to resist.

                                  HAL
                          (worldly wise now)
                    Yup.

                                  AUBREY (O.S.)
                    Merci.

      One word but the accent is discernable; Hal notices Aubrey at 
      the adjacent table.

                                  HAL
                    Excuse me -- is anything wrong?

      Aubrey stares at the  carte  with tears on her cheeks; she 
      shakes her head.

                                  JIMMY
                    Anything we can do?

      She remains sad and silent.

                                  WODDY
                    I d suggest the Bordeaux -- it s 
                      surprisingly good for the price.

      Aubrey can barely speak; finally she gets out:

                                  AUBREY
                    What I d really like is Sangria.

                                  WODDY
                    Oh, puke, no!
                          (regretting his harshness)
                    Why not try a, uh, kir?... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    13.

                                  WODDY (CONT'D)
                    Chilled white wine with a bit of 
                    creme de cassis.  A bit sweet but 
                    good -- and not expensive.


      TIGHT ON: A SHOT OF DEEP PURPLE LIQUEUR BEING POURED INTO A 
      WHITE WINE

      WIDER: The Waiter puts the kir on his tray with other drinks.


    The waiter carries the tray out to serves Aubrey.

                                  AUBREY
                      ...Everything was wonderful until I 
                    got in Paris.  Then he found he 
                    couldn t write with anyone in the 
                    apartment.  

                                  JIMMY
                    What s his name?

                                  AUBREY
                    Frederic [pronounced the French 
                    way].  First he asked me to use the 
                     chambre de service  during the day 
                    -- because he has such trouble 
                    concentrating--

      Aubrey stops abruptly as if about to cry again; she takes a 
    sip of the kir.  Jimmy fills in the pause:

                                  JIMMY
                    I ve had that -- not being able to 
                    work when someone s in the 
                    apartment.  The problem is, I can t 
                    work when there s no one either.

                                  WODDY
                    Have you thought of getting a 
                    rabbit?

                                  JIMMY
                    No.  But I ll consider it.

    Hal sees that Aubrey seems to have recovered.

                                  HAL
                    So you re just killing time until 
                    Frederic finishes his writing 
                    day...                                                                                    14.


                                  AUBREY
                    No.  

    She again stops as if to avoid crying and takes another sip.

                                  WODDY
                    Good, right?

      Aubrey nods.  Woddy signals the waiter for another round.

                                  JIMMY
                    When you say it  was wonderful  
                    with Frederic, when was that?

                                  WODDY
                    No, she said it  had been 
                      wonderful. 

                                  JIMMY
                    Okay, but when was that -- the 
                    wonderful part.  Because I think I 
                    missed it.

                                  AUBREY
                    In Miami.  We met at Art Basel -- 
                    it was wonderful.  Frederic 
                      immediately wanted me to move to 
                    Paris to live with him; I d just 
                    broken up with my boyfriend so 
                    getting away seemed like a good 
                    idea.

    The waiter comes with a round of drinks and a dish of olives.

                                  JIMMY
                    I think that s true -- when you 
                    have a serious break up, putting 
                    the Atlantic Ocean between you can 
                    be very helpful.

                                  WODDY
                    What about the Pacific?

      Jimmy thinks a moment.

                                  JIMMY
                    Don t know.  Never tried it.

                                  HAL
                          (to Aubrey)
                    I m sorry, you were telling us what 
                    happened.

      Aubrey takes a sip, collects her thoughts and continues:                                                                                    15.


                                  AUBREY
                    Well, for weeks after I got here we 
                    were like that with me mostly 
                    upstairs -- but still together.  
                    Then this week Frederic said he d 
                    be away several months, a project 
                    in Lyons, and subletting his 
                    apartment.  

                                  HAL
                    What?  Out of the blue?

      Aubrey nods.

                                  AUBREY
                    I asked if I could still use the 
                    kitchen since I m taking the 
                    Escoffier course but he said no. 

    She can t go on.  She takes some sips of the kir.

                                  JIMMY
                    What a creep.

                                  AUBREY
                    He s not.

                                  WODDY
                    Hal got dumped too -- now he just 
                    mopes around listening to Al Green 
                    songs.

                                  AUBREY
                          (offended)
                    I wasn t  dumped.   Frederic just 
                    isn t used to living with anyone.

    Hal gets a text message -- he reads it.

                                  JIMMY
                    Clemence?

    Hal nods.

                                  JIMMY (CONT D)
                    I thought her break-up ethos was 
                    never to initiate communication, 
                    only the occasional painfully 
                    laconic reply--

                                  HAL
                          (quietly)
                    She was replying.                                                                                    16.


                                  WODDY
                    You sent her a text?

    Hal nods.

                                  WODDY (CONT D)
                    Sap.

                                  JIMMY
                    Omigosh!  Forget her!

                                  WODDY
                    That s not going to happen.

                                  JIMMY
                     Madame Cauchemar. 

                                  AUBREY
                    What s that?

                                  JIMMY
                     Mrs. Nightmare  -- Hal s ex, she s 
                    very pretty but completely 
                    unstable.

                                  HAL
                    Not completely.

                                  JIMMY
                    That kind of relationship?  It 
                    could kill you... That happens.  
                    People die.  

                                  WODDY
                    I don t understand it: she s very 
                    skinny.

    A phone rings -- Hal s.  He stares at the number, then 
      answers French style:

                                  HAL
                    Allo, Hal a l appareil.

      Woddy laughs.  From the phone a faint voice shouts.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                    Yes, Fritz -- speaking of the 
                    devil...  
                          (to the others)
                    Party tonight --  Ten-thirty... 
                    Better, eleven.  Maybe dessert. 
                          (to phone)
                    So, we re your second class 
                    friends, invited after dinner?
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                          (to the others)
                     No, third class. 
                          (to phone)
                    Would it be okay if we brought a 
                    beautiful American girl along?...
                          (he smiles, nods)
                    Okay,   bient t...

    Hal hangs up.

      PONT DE NEUILLY METRO STATION:

      point to 8.20:]

              http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BVOruJjI2A

                                  HAL (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    He said to get off near the end of 
                    the train.



    The four walk along the dark avenue; Hal reads his notes.

                                  HAL
                     Left onto Rue de l Eglise. 

                                  JIMMY
                     Eglise  -- that means  church!  

      There is a church ahead. They turn left, continuing up the 
      residential street; Aubrey seems to be both smiling and 
      crying.                                                                                    18.


                                  HAL
                    Are you crying?

      Despite evidence to the contrary Aubrey shakes her head  no. 

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                    Well, that s too bad -- because if 
                    you cry, I won t have to.

                                  WODDY
                    Hope Fritz isn t in one of his 
                     moods.  Did you tell him I was 
                    coming?

                                  HAL
                    You heard the call...  Seemed best 
                    not to specify.

      Doubt briefly pierces Woddy s usual self-regard.



      Music and raised voices come from the upper floor of a 
      building up the street.  They look to each other; Aubrey 
      seems apprehensive.

                                  HAL
                    Yes.  Terrifyin .

      Aubrey tries to smile.



      He finds Aubrey alone there, her arms wrapped around herself 
      in the chill while still managing to hold onto a champagne 
      glass.

                                  AUBREY
                    Does summer never come?

                                  HAL
                    Yes.  Once all hope s been lost.

      He notices Aubrey s teary face.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                    Three summers ago I was having a 
                    bad patch when it actually got hot.  
                    It can get hot here.                                                                                    27.


                                  AUBREY
                    You had a bad patch?

                                  HAL
                    Yeah -- I was just thinking about 
                    it this afternoon -- I was still 
                    fairly new in town; then suddenly 
                    everyone I knew left and I had this 
                    crazy attack of loneliness...

      Aubrey listens intently.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                    The  yawning void,  as they say.  
                    It was terrible.  Seemed no way to 
                    stop it, no way to get a foothold 
                    at all.

                                  AUBREY
                    What happened?

                                  HAL
                    Sort of petered out as mysteriously 
                    it began.

    Now Aubrey s really interested:

                                  AUBREY
                    How?

                                  HAL
                    Well they say:  all you need is one 
                    friend. 

                                  AUBREY
                    Who says that?

    Hal thinks.

                                  HAL
                     They  do...  But maybe it s more 
                    just being distracted -- because...

      Fritz steps out onto the balcony with a champagne bottle.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                    ...I don t think I d call Fritz a 
                     friend. 

      Fritz refills Aubrey s glass.

                                  FRITZ
                    I m the best friend you ll ever 
                    have!  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    28.

                                  FRITZ (CONT'D)
                    And I m going to do you one of the 
                    greatest favors anyone will ever 
                    do!

                                  HAL
                    Oh no... 
                          (slips some Euro bills out 
                          his wallet)
                    ...how much do you need to borrow?

                                  FRITZ
                    Put that away -- I m too apt to 
                    take it.  No, I feel responsible 
                    for having introduced you to 
                    Clemence -- but think I ve found 
                    the means to free you.

                                  HAL
                    I m  free.   

                                  FRITZ
                    Oh sure.
                          (laughs)
                    You re the freest person 
                      imaginable.

                                  HAL
                    No.  It s over.

                                  FRITZ
                    Well, I think I have the lever to 
                    help you get you over her-- 

                                  HAL
                    The lever?

                                  FRITZ
                    Yes -- and the lever is a lady.

    He glances to Aubrey.

                                  FRITZ (CONT D)
                    While you re with Justine I ll 
                    introduce this lovely girl around.
                          (to Aubrey)
                    What are your views on the 
                    monarchy?



    The same street seen earlier.  Dancing can be glimpsed on the 
      upper floor of Fritz s building.  On the street in the 
      foreground three guys in hoodies and the hip-hop clothing 
      style of the  banlieue  or projects cross the frame.



    As the party continues on the upper floor above Hal, Woddy 
    and Jimmy walk away from the building -- Aubrey with them.

                                  JIMMY
                          (to Woddy, angry)
                    Thanks a lot.

                                  WODDY
                    No big deal.

                                  JIMMY
                    No, it was a big deal -- we finally 
                    get to a decent party and are 
                    beginning to meet great people when 
                    some jerk thinks it s a good idea 
                    to call a drug dealer.

      Woddy walks in silence for a few moments.

                                  WODDY
                    I didn t think it was a good idea. 
                    It was more a compulsion.

                                  JIMMY
                    I finally meet a terrific girl -- 
                    then have no chance to even get her 
                    number.

                                  WODDY
                    Yeah, that was stupid -- you should 
                    always get the number right away.

                                  HAL
                    Oh brother.

    At the taxi stand ahead an enormous line has formed -- with 
    no cabs in view.

                                  HAL (CONT D)
                    At least you could ve gotten us 
                    kicked out earlier -- before the 
                    metro closed. 

                                  JIMMY
                    Omigosh, now we ll never get home!                                                                                      37.


                                  WODDY
                    What a bunch of whiners!  No wonder 
                    women can t stand you -- they hate 
                    that.

                                  HAL
                          (to Aubrey)
                    Is that true?

                                  AUBREY
                    What?

                                  HAL
                    Do you hate whiners?

      Aubrey thinks seriously.

                                  AUBREY
                    No, in fact, I m perversely 
                    attracted to them.

      Vindicated, Hal and Jimmy smile at Woddy.

                                  WODDY
                    But it is a perversity.

                                  AUBREY
                    Frederic was a whiner to some 
                    degree; you know, not being able to 
                    work with anyone in his apartment.  

                                  JIMMY
                    And you still like him?

                                  AUBREY
                    Sure.

                                  JIMMY
                          (to Woddy)
                    You see.

                                  WODDY
                    That means nothing.

      As they linger on the cab line the situation looks bleak.

                                  HAL
                    I think I ll walk.

                                  JIMMY
                    Walk to the Marais from here?  
                    That s, like, hours.                                                                                    38.


                                  HAL
                    I don t think it s that far.

                                  WODDY
                    It s incredibly far.  You re crazy.

                                  HAL
                    I could use the walk.

    Hal seems serious about it; he takes out a small MP3 player 
    and some earbuds.

                                  JIMMY
                    Oh, I see: a walk and cry.
                          (to Aubrey)
                    Crying is Hal s favorite thing.

                                  HAL
                    No. It s one of my favorite things.

      Hal puts on his earbuds: a thumping, portentous rhythm comes 
      on low.

                                  WODDY
                    Al Green?

      Hal shakes his head.

                                  HAL
                    Motown.

      The others watch Hal go; Woddy shakes his head.

                                  WODDY
                    He could very well die.



      Jimmy Ruffin s  I ve Passed this Way Before  plays on Hal s 
      MP3 player and the soundtrack as he trudges through the 
      beautiful wet streets.



      The music continues as Aubrey, Jimmy and Woddy ride in the 
      back of a speeding cab; then a view of the streets they race 
      through while the camera rises over the city as the credits 
      roll.
