      She s wearing a sorority sweatshirt over a short dress.

                    Listen, have you guys seen a scarf? 
                    Holly thinks she left it out here--

                                  HOLLY
                          (to Winston and Schmidt)
                    It s my favorite scarf because it s 
                    a circle so you don t have to think 
                    about which end goes on the right 
                    or the left. My therapist gave it 
                    to me, she s so nice--

      Nick s phone GOES OFF. He reads the text then puts it back in 
      his pocket.

                    Who was that? Was it that whore 
                    from last night who kept touching 
                    your shoulder like a whore?

                    Let me see your phone.

      She reaches into Nick s pocket. Nick squirms away, pulls the 
      phone out of his pocket and throws it against the brick wall.

                    I saw a bug. So.

      Holly exits, pissed. When she s gone, Nick begins picking up 
      the broken pieces of his phone.

                      Obviously. Because when a lady 
                    spends the night, it is imperative 
                    that you keep track of her personal 
                    effects. I put valuables in plastic

                    Yeah, sleeping with Schmidt is like 
                    getting arrested in a lot of ways.

                    Oh glory be! Nick, are you asking 
                    for my help? I m flattered...

                    I know, Winston, I know this sucks,

                    having consensual sex with Cece, 
                    and he lied about it for two 
                    months. He s better than us.

                    Yeah, we know. We were there in the 
                      beginning.


      Jess is doing some awkward stretches trying to get ready to 
      run. Cece walks up sheepishly in her running clothes.

                                  CECE
                    Hey babe.

                    let me run with you. 

      Cece starts to try and run with Jess, Jess runs the other 
      direction to get away from her.

                    Just let me come on this run--

      Cece meets up with her, and Jess turns around and tucks her 
      head down and runs up the ramp of a MOVING TRUCK and takes 
      the ramp away so Cece can t follow her.

      Cece comes out of Schmidt s room. She opens the refrigerator

                    means I now know that all three of

      area. Cece tries to intimidate Jess by doing a complicated 
      stretch. Jess tries to do the same and bumps into someone.

                    just thought they lived at the same 
                      apartment. I m going in the hood.

      Nick puts his hood up.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    No! Do not hood me! Nick, listen to 
                    me, you chubby chubster. You can do 
                    this. Take one at a time. Don t say 
                    more than you have to. I believe in 
                    you.

      Schmidt pulls off Nick s hood as the girls bear down on him.

                                  WILLOW
                    Why didn t you call me?

                                  MEGAN
                    Why didn t you tell me you hooked 
                    up with my roommate?

      Nick hesitates. Deep breath. He turns to Willow:

                                  NICK
                    Willow, I didn t call you because I 
                    had a family emergency. 

                                  WILLOW 
                    Aww. Is everything okay?

                                  NICK
                    Yes.

                                  NICK (CONT'D)
                    And Megan, I didn t tell you about 
                    Willow because you and I shared an 
                      experience that was so beautiful 
                    and intense, for a moment I forgot 
                    there was anyone else on the 
                    planet.

                                  MEGAN
                    Oh. Okay.

      A beat where they wait for Nick to say something. He doesn t.

                        WILLOW*MEGAN*
      Well, we ll see you later.Bye.

      They return to the race. When they re gone:

                      WINSTONNICK
      Where did that come from?I m trembling. I m trembling.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Nick, that was so good, my pants 
                    just got tight.

                                  NICK
                    Oh god, now I hate me as much as 
                    I ve always hated you.


      Jess runs wildly: her limbs are flying and she s weaving all 
      over the road. Up ahead, Cece is jogging comfortably.

                                  JESS
                    Cece! Cee--! I can t breathe.

      Jess puts on a burst of speed and manages to pull even with 
      Cece. Cece, not even breathing hard, looks over at Jess.

                                  JESS (CONT D)
                    I... realized... why you didn t... 
                    tell me about... Schmidt.
                          (then)
                    You... like him.

      Cece stops running, but Jess is running at a walking pace.

                                  CECE
                    What?

                                  JESS
                    You... thought the shirt... was 
                    funny! The shirt, Cece! You 
                    obviously like him. That s...

                                  JESS (CONT'D)
                    the only explanation for 
                      thinking... that was funny.

                                  CECE
                          (hitting Cece)
                    Oh, god. You re right.

                                  JESS
                    And that s why you didn t tell me. 
                    You knew that I would know. And you 
                    weren t ready... to admit that to 
                    yourself.

                                  CECE
                    Can we just say I didn't tell you 
                    because I'm a total bitch? I'm much 
                    more comfortable with that.
                          (a beat, she smiles)
                    I might like Schmidt.
                          (then, dead serious)
                    You cannot tell anyone.

                                  JESS
                          (smiling)
                    So it s a secret only I know?

      ANOTHER RACE PARTICIPANT passes them:

                    Heads up. I m peeing.


      Nick, Schmidt and Winston are waiting at the finish line. One 
      half of the street has been re-opened to traffic. The event 
      organizers are packing up the tables and tents. One of the 
      organizers tries to take down the finish line, which is 
      deflating. Winston stares daggers at him until he backs away.

                                  NICK
                    Here they come.

      We see Jess, slumped on Cece s shoulder. As the guys hold up 
      the deflating finish line, Jess finishes the race. 

                                  EVENT ORGANIZER
                    Can I take down the finish line 
                    now?

                                    WINSTON
                    Yes. Yes you can.

                                          ACT FOUR


      Cece drinks a coffee. REVEAL: Winston sits across from her.

                                    WINSTON
                    Why? Why, Cece?

                                  CECE
                    Why am I sleeping with Schmidt?

                                    WINSTON
                    Is it a pity thing? Is he sick? Is 
                    he going to die and he s not telling 
                    us? Did you accidentally kill 
                    someone together? Is he blackmailing 
                    you?
                          (then, horrified)
                    Is it really good? No, no, it can't 
                    be good, so that s out. 
                          (then)

                    Can you talk about it?

                    Are you in danger? Is he holding 
                    you against your will? Blink twice 
                    at me. Has someone kidnapped a 
                    member of your family? Are you a 
                      scientist? Is it an experiment? Are 
                    you really Mayan and this is the 
                    first sign of the apocalypse? Are 
                    you tired of being  turned on ? Do 
                    you have a mole fetish?  
                          (pointing at her shirt)
                    Are you a man? Are you hiding your 
                    candy?

                          (genuine)
                    Honestly, I don t know why.

      She gets up and starts to exit.

                    Is it huge? Let me rephrase that...
