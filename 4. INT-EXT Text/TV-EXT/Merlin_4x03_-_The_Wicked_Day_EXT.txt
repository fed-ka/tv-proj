      The square is a hive of activity. A caravan of colourful 
      carts is being unloaded by ACROBATS, DANCERS, JUGGLERS, 
      STRONG MEN and JESTERS. 

      An ACROBAT back flips off a wagon and lands on his feet. 
      JUGGLERS practice their routine, sending batons high into the 
      air.

      SQUARE) - DAY 1. UK/FR.

      MERLIN and ARTHUR look down into the Main Square. MERLIN s 
      impressed, ARTHUR less so.

                                  MERLIN
                    Did you see that?

                                  ARTHUR
                    It s a man throwing some sticks in 
                    the air.

      MERLIN takes in ARTHUR s mood.

                                  MERLIN
                    What s wrong?

      ARTHUR pulls a face...

                                  MERLIN
                    It s the anniversary of your birth. 
                    A huge feast is being held in your 
                    honour. You have dancers, jugglers 
                    and acrobats to entertain you. It 
                    must be a terrible burden. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Perhaps I m just less easily 
                    impressed than you, Merlin.

                                  MERLIN
                    I m really looking forward to it.

                                  ARTHUR
                    That s because you have the mind of 
                    a child.

      ARTHUR heads out.

                                  MERLIN
                          (to himself)
                    And yet I m still more intelligent 
                    than you.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     1A.


      ARTHUR doesn t look round as he calls out...

                                  ARTHUR
                    I heard that.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SQUARE) - NIGHT 2. UK/FR.

      TOWNSPEOPLE hold a candle-lit vigil in the Main Square. 
      MERLIN stands at the window, staring down at them. ARTHUR 
      enters, crosses over and looks out of the window...

                                  ARTHUR
                    What s going on?

                                  MERLIN
                    It is a vigil for your Father. 
                    The people wish to share their 
                    grief.  

      ARTHUR frowns, unsettled...  

                                  ARTHUR
                    Why are they behaving like my 
                    father is already dead? There is 
                    still life in his body...

                                  MERLIN
                    They re preparing themselves for 
                    the worst.

      ARTHUR steels himself.

                                  ARTHUR
                    They can give up hope, but I will 
                    not.

                                  MERLIN
                    I know it s hard to accept. I 
                    wish it wasn t so, but there is 
                    nothing more that can be done.

      ARTHUR looks thoughtful, then...

                                  ARTHUR
                    There is a way to heal my father. 

                                  MERLIN
                    How?

      ARTHUR hesitates, then fixes MERLIN with a poignant look.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     22.


                                  ARTHUR
                    With magic.

      MERLIN s stunned as he takes this in.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      The sun rises over Camelot.

      MERLIN and ARTHUR ride up to a fork in the path. MERLIN 
      stops. He s uncertain which path to take. ARTHUR s 
        unimpressed.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You re lost, aren t you Merlin?

                                  MERLIN
                    No. I m just getting my 
                      bearings...
                                  (MORE)                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     26.

                                  MERLIN (cont'd)
                          (choosing a path)
                    It s this way...

      Through the trees, ARTHUR spots a hut off the other path 
      (it is the same charcoal maker s hut we saw in episode 2).

                                  ARTHUR
                    So what s that hut over there?

      MERLIN sees the hut, realises he was about to take the 
      wrong path, attempts to cover.

                                  MERLIN
                    Right. I was going to take this 
                    path and loop round. Or, we can 
                    go this way. 

      ARTHUR reacts, disbelieving. ARTHUR and MERLIN ride toward 
      the hut.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR and MERLIN dismount. ARTHUR eyes the hut curiously.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Are you sure this is the right 
                    place? It looks like a charcoal 
                    maker s hut.

                                  MERLIN
                    The old man can hardly make a 
                    living by practising magic. I 
                    think a lot of sorcerers are in 
                    the charcoal business.

      ARTHUR doesn t look entirely convinced by this as he walks 
      up to the front door. MERLIN looks round, wondering how 
      he s going to work the deception. ARTHUR realises MERLIN 
      hasn t followed him.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Are you joining me, Merlin?

                                  MERLIN
                    We don t want to overwhelm him. 
                    He probably doesn t get many 
                    visitors. I ll stay out here and 
                    watch the horses.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I have never met anyone who is so 
                    scared so often. Scream like a 
                    big girl if there s any trouble.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     27.


                                  MERLIN
                    Don t worry. You ll hear me.

      ARTHUR shakes his head, disbelieving, as he turns and 
      knocks on the door.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      MERLIN s hurrying into the trees when ARTHUR re-emerges 
      from the hut.

                                  ARTHUR
                    There s no one here. Are you sure 
                    this is the right place?

                                  MERLIN
                    I m absolutely certain of it. I m 
                    sure he ll be back soon.

                                  ARTHUR
                    How d you know when he ll be 
                    back?

                                  MERLIN
                    He s a doddery old man. He can t 
                    have gone far. If you want his 
                    help, you ll just have to wait 
                    for him to return.

      ARTHUR suddenly takes in that MERLIN was heading off into 
      the trees.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Where are you sneaking off to? 

      MERLIN s put on the spot, thinks on his feet.

                                  MERLIN
                    I need to pee.

      ARTHUR s disturbed by the revelation.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     28.


                                  MERLIN
                    So unless you want to watch me, 
                    you should wait inside the hut.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Why would I want to watch you?

      MERLIN gestures toward the hut.

                                  MERLIN
                    There s the hut. Make yourself at 
                    home.

      ARTHUR eyes MERLIN suspiciously, then turns and heads back 
      inside the hut. MERLIN reacts, exasperated. He hurries 
      behind a tree. He peers out to check that ARTHUR hasn t re-
      emerged, then focuses as he starts to incant the 
      transformation spell...

                                  MERLIN
                    Miht dagena, bepecce me. Adeaglie 
                    pisne gast min freondum ond min 
                    feondum!

                                                                          CUT TO:



      OLD MERLIN emerges from the hut and hurries into the trees. 
      OLD MERLIN hides behind the same tree as before and takes 
      out a vial of liquid...

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR emerges and looks round. There s no sign of MERLIN, 
      or OLD MERLIN. ARTHUR grows uneasy and reaches for the hilt 
      of his sword as he scans the trees.

                                  ARTHUR
                      Merlin...?

      Silence. A crack of twigs. ARTHUR spins round. MERLIN 
      emerges from behind the tree, once again his youthful self. 
      ARTHUR s suspicious.

                                  ARTHUR
                    What were you doing?

      MERLIN s put on the spot.

                                  MERLIN
                    Peeing.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (disturbed)
                    You mean to say you ve been 
                    peeing all the time I was in 
                    there?

      MERLIN s forced to nod.

                                  MERLIN
                    I really needed to go.

                                  ARTHUR
                    There is definitely something 
                    very wrong with you, Merlin. 

      ARTHUR turns to mount his horse. MERLIN breathes a sigh of 
      relief that the deception was successful. 

                                                                          CUT TO:                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     33.



      ARTHUR and MERLIN dismount. MERLIN hurries off. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    Where are you going?

      MERLIN s put on the spot...

                                  MERLIN
                    I have some errands to run for 
                    Gaius.

                                  ARTHUR
                    They ll have to wait. I want you 
                    to prepare hot water, fresh 
                    bandages and anything else you 
                    think we might need. Everything 
                    has to be ready for this evening. 

      MERLIN heads off, daunted by the growing list of things he 
      has to do. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR has just told GWEN of his plans. She looks shocked.

                                  GWEN
                    You re going to use magic?

      ARTHUR nods, solemn.

                                  ARTHUR
                    It is my father s only hope. 

      GWEN looks worried, but doesn t voice her concerns. ARTHUR 
      sees her hesitation. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    You think I m mad, don t you?

                                  GWEN
                    No. Who am I to say what you 
                    should do?

                                  ARTHUR
                    And yet it is your opinion I 
                    value above all others.

                                  GWEN
                    I m flattered, but perhaps I m 
                    not the best person to ask. If it 
                    weren t for sorcery, my own 
                    father would still be alive.

      ARTHUR nods, solemn.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Of course. My mother also died 
                    because of magic. 

      ARTHUR stares out over Camelot.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Magic has cast a shadow over my 
                    life from the moment I was born. 
                    Perhaps it is time to step out 
                    from under that shadow. I don t 
                    believe everyone who practices 
                    magic is evil. 

                                  GWEN
                    Perhaps that is true.                           MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     38.


                                  ARTHUR
                    Then isn t it time we stopped 
                    treating them like they are? 
                    Sometimes I feel our judgement 
                    has been clouded by hate, and 
                    fear. 

                                  GWEN
                    That is a courageous attitude.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I m not sure if it s courageous, 
                    or foolish. I still don t know if 
                    I m doing the right thing. 

                                  GWEN
                    You are not a fool, Arthur. You 
                    have a good heart. And good 
                      instincts. You have to trust 
                    those instincts. Sometimes that 
                    is all any of us can do.

      ARTHUR nods as he takes this in.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      ARTHUR waits impatiently by the lower gate. He hears a 
      sound and spins round to see OLD MERLIN emerging from the 
      darkness.  

                                  ARTHUR
                    I d started to think you weren t 
                    coming.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    I gave you my word. And here I 
                    am.                          MERLIN IV ep 3 Amendments 08.06.11     41.


                                  ARTHUR
                    We must hurry.

      ARTHUR heads off, away from the palace, taking OLD MERLIN 
      by surprise.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    I m led to believe that the 
                    King s Palace is that way?

                                  ARTHUR
                    I can hardly be seen walking 
                    through the main gate with a 
                    known sorcerer.

                                  OLD MERLIN
                    So you are already going back on 
                    your word. You promised that I 
                    would no longer have to live in 
                    fear. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    You re forgetting that you have 
                    yet to heal my father. When you 
                    have, I will give you all that I 
                    promised. 

      OLD MERLIN takes this in. They head off.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      The warning bell rings out across the moonlit square. 

                                                                          CUT TO:



      AGRAVAINE gallops up, dismounts and hurries inside.

      The sun rises over Camelot. The start of a beautiful day.
