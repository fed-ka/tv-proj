                                              TEASER

          FADE IN:

  11INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

          The candy aisle.  Seven year old TOBEY (carrying a small*
          plastic football) scans the awesome array before him. *
          Until a spit-covered finger comes into frame and pokes*
          into his ear.*

                                        TOBEY*
                        Stop it!*

          He swats away the hand of smiling MICKEY, ten... scooting*
          away down the aisle...

                                        TOBEY*
                          Mom...!*

          But he stops face to face with a  wire magazine rack filled*
          with tabloids.  The one before him bears the headline*
          (among others) "Psychic Smith: Savior or False Prophet?!" 
            Accompanying, an unflattering photo of Johnny with an
          angry red pentagram drawn on his forehead.  Jennifer Lopez
          is also on the cover.  Tilting up in a POV shot to see
          JOHNNY grabbing a large bottle of soda from the
            refrigerator...

          Tobey turns to his brother, eyes wide: it's him!  The guy*
          on the magazine cover.  Mickey grabs the front copy of*
          the rag and looks up at Johnny and down at the pic to
          confirm this sighting.


          ANGLE WITH JOHNNY

          Johnny is immediately aware of the four eyes staring at*
          him (Tobey is scared, Mickey intrigued)... and it's not
          like you ever get used to this but this isn't new to Johnny
          any more... he smiles and nods an acknowledgement hoping
          that'll be enough... but as he moves away around a corner
          and out of view of the kids, leans down to grab a bag of
          potato chips from the bottom shelf, the two boys appear*
          around the aisle at his face level... Mickey is still*
          holding the tabloid...

                                        JOHNNY
                        How ya doing?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - TEASER - REV. 9/30/02 GRN2    2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        MICKEY
                                (deadpan, a la The
                                Sixth Sense)
                        I see dead people.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dry)
                        Cool.

                                        TOBEY
                                (pulling at his brother)*
                        Come on...
                                (to Johnny)
                        He's lying...

                                        MICKEY
                        Shut up...

          Johnny moves away toward the checkout stand... Mickey
          pursues...

                                        MICKEY
                        Hey, Johnny, did you really predict*
                        'J-Lo's failed romance' like it
                        says?

                                        WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Hey!

          The clerk begins to ring up Johnny who would just like to
          get out of here... the kids jump a mile.  They turn to
          see their MOTHER behind them, glaring.

                                        MOTHER
                        How many times have I told you
                        not to talk to...

          But as she glances at Johnny, she immediately recognizes
          him... her face turns fearful for a second before she can
          regain her social mask...

                                        MOTHER
                                (beat)
                          ...strangers.

                                        TOBEY
                        It's Johnny Smith, mom...








                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - TEASER - REV. 9/30/02 GRN2    3.


  1CONTINUED: (2)1

                                        MOTHER
                                  (acknowledges, to*
                                  Johnny)*
                        I'm, I'm sorry.  I hope they didn't-
                                (to kids)
                        Wait in the car.  Now.  I'll be
                        out in a minute.

          She nods uncomfortably to Johnny and disappears around an*
          aisle to quickly finish her shopping...*

                                        MICKEY
                                (exit line, to brother,
                                not loud)
                        I bet he doesn't even know Jennifer
                        Lopez.

          The boys are out.*

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to the clerk, not
                                  serious)
                        We hang out whenever she comes up
                        to Maine.  Me and J.
                                (beat)
                        Lo.

          The clerk doesn't get the joke... gives Johnny his change. *
          Johnny looks at the bizarre picture of himself on the
          tabloid cover, decides to turn the magazine over, and as*
          he does we RAMP to his face...*


1A1AA JOHNNY FLASH - EXT. STORE - DAY

          The two boys are throwing the small, plastic football*
          outside.  (Note: By flash, we mean a tiny fraction of a*
          vision, i.e. Johnny seeing future Allison in the grave in*
          the pilot.)*


  1B1B*CUT BACK TO JOHNNY - CLOSEUP - INT. STORE

          Reacting.*


    1C1C*ANOTHER FLASH - EXT. STORE - TOBEY

          running into the street to catch a pass, hears a blare of*
          a horn, looks up in horror as he sees a truck trying to*
          brake, skidding toward him - we never see impact. (Again:*
          a fraction of a vision, very very fast.)*          DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - TEASER - REV. 9/30/02 GRN2    4.


  1D1D*RESUME JOHNNY - INT. STORE

          already running out the door...*


  1E1E*EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER - CLOSE ON TOBEY

          running into the street to catch the ball, a horn blares,*
          Johnny bursts into the frame and pushes him out of the*
          way (what else can he do?) and then he turns... SEES the*
          truck, SKIDDING toward him...*

  66INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

          CRASH!  The ER doors explode inward as Johnny, conscious
          but sedated, is wheeled in on a gurney, a cervical collar
          round his neck.  The EMTs hand Johnny off to an E-R DOCTOR 
          who immediately checks the EMTs' clipboard as a nurse
          puts an IV in Johnny's arm.  The doc shouts out orders:

                                        E-R DOCTOR
                        Get a CBC, Chem 20, Pt, Ptt and
                        type and cross him for six units. 
                        Get D-dimers and fibrinogen, too.
                                (checks blood pressure)
                        Oh, boy.  BP is 80 palp.  Heart
                        rate 130 and very thready.  I
                        think he's going into DIC.  I
                        need six units of Cryo, stat!

          A nurse pulls away from the moving medical center, rushes
          towards a door in the ER.  WE follow her.  Sign on the
          door reads BLOOD BANK.


  77INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          She arrives back at Johnny's gurney as the team shifts
          him over to a table.

                                        E-R DOCTOR
                        Okay, hang the saline and Cryo
                        and infuse wide open.  Repeat the
                        CBC.  Repeat all the labs...

          The nurse piggybacks a large bag of saline and a smaller
          100cc bag of a cloudy, yellow-white liquid onto the IV.


          CLOSE - THE CLOUDY LIQUID

          flows into the clear IV.  It streams down the IV, heading
          for Johnny's arm.  And as it hits...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  88INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          The world is blurry, slowly focusing.  A circular mass in
          the center slowly reveals itself to be Bruce's face, as
          the focus sharpens.  He's looking right at us.  Smiling.

          JOHNNY lies in a hospital bed, slowly waking, looking up
          at Bruce.  His face is slightly bruised, arms bandaged. 
          Other than that, he doesn't look so bad.  But his
          expression is pained...

                        Please tell me it's not 2009.

                        I will be sued for it.   

          Johnny suddenly feels odd, not a headache exactly but
          sort of like a vertigo feeling... nothing too radical but
          it makes him catch his breath as we RAMP to his face and
          he sees a vision of the recent past...  


  99INT. TENT ATTACHED TO BLOODMOBILE - DAY - VISION

          Johnny is lying on a cot wearing out-of-fashion clothes
          in a large, clean canvas tent.  He glances down at the
          needle and tube in his arm, and the stream of red flowing
          through it.  He's donating blood.  In the background, a
          desk calendar indicates the date is November 14th.

          He looks to the person giving blood in the cot next to
          him.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL that one cot over... is Johnny. 
          Johnny #2, wearing khaki pants and a bright yellow polo
          shirt, smiles back at Johnny #1.

          DOLLY OVER TO REVEAL another cot, with another Johnny! 
          This one wears torn black jeans and a black T-shirt.  He
          grimaces as a NEEDLE in stuck into his arm.

          In fact, the whole place is filled with Johnnies!  Six of
          them, to be precise, along with two nurses (who are not
          Johnny).  One Johnny (in a fancy suit) sits on a cot
          filling out forms, while two more Johnnies, one in ragged
            clothing, and one in women's clothing, lie on their cots. 

          (Note: Johnny, in the vision, is not self-aware.  In other
          words, his actions or expressions cannot comment on the
          scene.  Also, a reminder: Johnny never uses his cane in a
          vision.)  The vision ends.


  1010INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - RESUME

          Johnny is utterly stunned.  Never seen anything like it.

                                        BRUCE
                        Let me guess: you saw a six figure
                          out-of-court settlement...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (disturbed)
                        Get Dr. Gibson.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, it's all covered by insurance
                          anyway...

                        Just... get the doctor.

          Bruce reacts and starts to leave...


  1111INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER - A PENLIGHT

          is shining into Johnny's POV... it's being held by the
          attractive DR. JANET GIBSON, 33.  This is Johnny's new
            neurologist, a specialist with a dry sense of humor and a
          good heart.  She sees a lot of people with grim prognoses
          so someone like Johnny, a miracle kid, is a welcome change
          for her.  She enjoys exploring the mysteries of his mind. 
          She can't wait for him to come back with some new problem.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Why does every doctor insist on
                        shining a light in my eyes?  I
                        don't see these things with my
                        eyes...

          She finishes... moving back to see Bruce observing...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Your eyes don't know that.  I can
                        always detect pupillary fluctuation
                        after you've had a vision...

          She looks at the chart... smiles, chuckles... Johnny looks
          at Bruce curiously... (and they're saying this with her
          in earshot so she's in on the conversation...)

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's laughing at my chart, Bruce. 
                        Why is she laughing?

                                        BRUCE
                                (for her benefit,
                                  ribbing her)
                        Dr. Gibson is famous around the
                          hospital for her twisted sense of
                        humor.        

          She continues to chuckle, shakes her head with amusement...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now she's shaking her head and
                          laughing.  This is not good.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Good?  You're a walking laboratory
                        of the mind, Johnny Smith.

                        That sounds a lot like a Chinese

                        When your insides were battered
                        around in the accident, you
                          developed DIC -- Disseminated
                          Intravascular Coagulation, it
                        just means that, temporarily,
                        your blood wasn't clotting like
                        it should.  So you were given
                          Cryoprecipitate which gets your
                          clotting back on track.  Cryo is
                          a pooled blood product made from
                        plasma.  The amount you received
                        would have come from six or so
                          different people.

  1212EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  1313INT. JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          It's the alarm clock.  Johnny's hand slaps down on it,
          turning it off.  He opens his eyes.  Kicks his feet over
          the side of the bed... (Note: Johnny is about 90% recovered
          by now.)

                                        JOHNNY
                          Morning, everyone.

          He yawns, stretches... and as he does he feels a vision
          coming on... as we begin a sequence that will introduce
          us to the players in our scenario.  In each vision, Johnny
          finds himself in the role of the person who gave blood...


  1414INT. BOOKSTORE - STACKS - DAY - JOHNNY/JONAH

          stands there with a notebook and pen.  He is being berated
          by his boss.  We will learn that JONAH is an aspiring
          writer who has dreams of being the next Stephen King. 
          But for now, he is a miserable clerk in a bookstore. (It's
            important to note that Johnny doesn't know Jonah or anyone
          else by name; the names are included here for clarity and
          tracking.)  Johnny/Jonah is dressed in a bright yellow
          polo shirt and khakis.  The MANAGER of the store has a
          jacket and tie.

                        You don't want to work here...?

          The vision ends (that is, this shouldn't suggest the
          scenario is continuing in Johnny's mind concurrently.)           DEAD ZONE: PRECIPITATE - ACT ONE - REV. 9/25/02 WHT2  12.

          Johnny emerges on the edge of a vast pedestrian plaza,
          bordered by stores, restaurants, businesses.  It's a few
          blocks long, full of people.  He turns excited, manic.

          GONG!  Clock strikes one.  Johnny sees a clock tower rising
          above the plaza, the tallest structure around.

          A RUMBLING NOISE grows.  Johnny recognizes the sound,

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here, here's some money.

          Mort watches as he takes out his wallet... and several
          twenties...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's all yours.  Under one
                          condition...

                                        MORT
                                (is this about sex?)
                        Look, I don't want no trouble... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...That you let me take you to a

                        I'm fine... if I could just have
                        enough for a bowl of soup...

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a beat)
                        I'm worried about you.

          And if it seems to us and to Mort that there's a strange
          intimacy in this scene, good, because for Johnny there
          is... Mort doesn't trust him for a second... he studies
          him for a beat then...

                        Why would someone like you be
                        worried about someone like me?

                                (glancing at his sign)
                        You fought for your country, didn't
                        you?  Isn't that reason enough to
                        care?

                                        MORT
                        I can name you a couple of
                        Presidents who didn't care.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's your name?

                                        MORT
                                  (suspicious)

                        Did you sell some blood to the
                        red cross a few weeks ago, Mort?

                                  (defensive)
                        There's nothing wrong with my
                        blood.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.

                                        MORT
                          I wasn't sick then... And I didn't
                        sell it!  I donated it because
                        the country's in a war, you know? 
                        We need blood.

          Johnny reacts, turns to see Bruce dragging a horrified
          homeless guy along with him... but now Bruce sees Mort
          emerging from the alcove...

          They begin to walk.  Sotto exchange as Bruce and Johnny
          hang back a few steps --

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you touch him?

                        He's really sick.  I think it's a
                        pretty good bet that...

                                        BRUCE
                        You didn't touch him.

                        No.

                        You're gonna have to touch him.

          Johnny looks up at Mort who's walking a few feet in front
          of them now... the idea of touching him is not at all
            appealing... but he catches up and pats Mort on the back
          of the neck with his hand...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're gonna be okay, Mort...

                        Yeah, yeah, I really got to quit

                          promising myself for years.

          Johnny rejoins Bruce...

                        So?

                        So he's got a temperature.  That's

                        A good feeling... like a good

                        Just a good feeling.  I mean of

                        who was clearly at risk... you

                          Think... like a regular 'think'
                        or like Johnny thinks...

          But Bruce looks at Johnny, realizing he isn't paying
          attention.  Because he's going into a vision.


  5757EXT. PLAZA - DAY - VISION - ONE FLUID SHOT

          On a bench, lonely Bob/Johnny sits consoling pregnant
            Shari/Johnny.  They're sharing popcorn with the birds. 
          Then Shari/Johnny looks up to see... a hulking tattooed
          horror of a man (CLYDE) riding in on a monster Harley,
          climbing down and moving angrily down the stairs towards
          them...

            Suddenly, Johnny/Messenger breezes by on his bike and
          does a dangerous jump down the stairway... leading us to
            Fatty/Johnny coming out of a drugstore where he's got a
          small box of pink bismuth pills for TUMMYACHES that he's
          opening... but pauses as his attention is drawn skyward
          where he sees --

          sees a half dozen clerks and workers... all of them wearing
          bright yellow polo shirts and khakis.  It's the store
          uniform.  Off his reaction...

          And he tears off after the messenger, gone.  In his wake,
          all the customers look at their oysters with new eyes and
          slowly begin to push plates away...  The waiters react...

          as he runs past a fat man wearing a tie we've seen before
          in Johnny's visions and as we stay with Fatty, he walks
          into the seafood restaurant...

          Johnny is moving deeper into the store, trying to guess
          which one of the yellow-shirted clerks is his guy... when
          he hears a voice he recognizes and a conversation he's
          heard before in a vision --

                                        MANAGER (O.S.)
                          ...yeah, yeah, you want to write
                        books, not sell them.  Sure, Mr.
                        Stephen King should be very worried
                        right about now.  Don't let me
                        catch you again in the stockroom
                        writing your dumb stories,
                          understand?  Go help our customers
                        find some real books.

          A moment later, JONAH the book clerk, 22, over-skinny and
          over-tired, the portrait of a stressed out struggling
          novelist emerges from the book stacks... followed a beat
          later by the manager who moves away... Johnny pretends to
          be browsing with some books for a moment... as he studies
          Jonah a beat then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Scuse me...

                                        JONAH
                        Can I help you find what you're
                        looking for, sir?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (glances at Jonah's
                                  nameplate)
                        I'm looking for you... Jonah.

          Jonah reacts.  Me?  What can he be talking about?  Johnny
          tries to ease into his explanation...

                                        JOHNNY
                        My name is Johnny Smith.  I'm

                        who you are!  I've read all about
                        you.  Your visions.  Very cool.

                        I've gotten to know you a little
                        over the last couple of weeks.

          Jonah is bursting with feelings that he hasn't been able
          to share with anyone and now here is this guy who's
          reaching out to him... this psychic who, in the familiar

          But at the same time, he looks over and sees the manager
          giving him the eye... he picks up a random book as though
          to show it to Johnny, turns his back to the manager...
          Johnny plays along as needed... much of this is sotto...

                        list someday.

                        rest of my life in a bookstore -

                        I can't say you're going to be a
                        successful writer.  But I can't
                        say you're not, either.  I really
                        have seen some of your stories. 
                        They're not bad.

                        Ten books.  Not bad.  What'd he
                        buy?

          For the first time, Jonah looks at the book in his hands. 
          It's the Star Trek: Insurrection hardcover novel, marked
          down for the bargain table.

                                        BOOKSTORE MANAGER
                          Finally.  I never thought we'd
                        move those.

          The bookstore manager hands Jonah some mail that came in
          for him...

                                        BOOKSTORE MANAGER
                        Hey, by the way, Hemingway, I
                        told you not to get your mail
                        sent here.

          Jonah looks at the return address.  "Beyond the Grave
            Magazine"...  Jonah rips it open...

          frowns as his heart sinks... and any optimism that Johnny
          Smith brought into his life is fading quickly away...
          he's not safe yet.  


  7272EXT. PLAZA - SAME TIME

          Johnny moves as quickly as he can towards the opposite
          end of the plaza.  He looks at the clock tower.  Two
          forty.  Johnny picks up the pace.

                        Hi...

          They look up... who would be so rude?   Revealing Johnny...

                        Johnny Smith, maybe you've heard
                        of me.  Visions.  Past, present,
                        future.  Can we cut to the chase
                        here?  

          He squeezes between the incredulous couple on the bench...
          holding both their hands, perhaps yield a tiny sound effect
          on his touch... they exchange an incredulous glance... 
          {And let me try to explain the rules here so we all
          understand: Johnny has interceded now and can see a new
          future for them.  But now that he's involved, the
            circumstances are changing every instant until he
          disconnects and if a wrong move is made, the consequences
          might still turn ugly.)

                        You two are meant for each other. 
                        Every other relationship up to
                        this point has been meaningless. 
                        Bob, your loneliness has come to
                        an end.  Shirley, you'll never
                        date a jerk again.

                          Whatever.  Bob's going to be your
                        Lamaze partner.  And he's going
                        to be the perfect father, going
                        to every little league game and
                          changing the messiest of diapers.

                        After you each move out of your
                        respective apartments you'll buy
                        a cute little two bedroom Cape
                        Cod that will be somewhat out of
                        your range, but a second mortgage
                        and a promotion will keep you
                        warm and happy there for years to
                        come, surrounded by your loving
                          children....

          Now, the ROAR of an engine.  He glances towards the street,
          and sees...


          A HARLEY

          And sitting atop it, CLYDE, the tattooed monster coming
          towards the couple on the bench in Johnny's vision.  Shari
          reacts at the sight of her angry boyfriend.

          Bob and Shari (and Bruce) are startled.  Clyde is on way
          across the yard now... murder in his eyes...

                        Johnny OOF!

          The OOF comes as Clyde lands a solid body blow to Johnny's
          stomach.  Johnny goes down.

                                        BRUCE

          Bruce races towards Clyde.  WHAM!  Clyde knocks Bruce
            backwards with one huge swipe.

          Now Clyde heads towards Shari and Bob.

                                        SHARI
                          Clyde... don't do this...

          Clyde ignores her...

                        You heard her, Clyde.

          And grabs Clyde's arm and in a stunning series of Aikido
          moves - known as Nikyo, Ikkyo, Koshi Nage - uses Clyde's
          weight to throw him over his hip.  Clyde ends up on his
          back, on the ground, not far from Johnny and Bruce, also
          on the ground.

8686A JOHNNY VISION - THE DOMINOES WHICH ARE ABOUT TO FALL...

          (This vision will utilize both the array shot we used in
          the Vietnam vision in the pilot, and the quick reverse
          effect we used to backtrack Malcolm's steps in "Enemy
          Mind" -- except this time the action moves FORWARD.)  We
          start at normal speed with:

            SHARI/BOB

          at the flower stand, kissing... Shari holds a bouquet of
          flowers that Bob just gave her... Johnny stands behind
          them, watching.  We follow this action for only a second
          or two, when Shari, feeling generous in her new found
          happiness, whimsically decides to hand a flower to FATTY,
          who is carrying a boxed pizza... Fatty, touched by this
          unexpected gift, takes the flower, and we FREEZE.  (Note:
          Johnny is NOT frozen...)

          Johnny absorbs this significant moment.  The messenger is
          visible in the distance at the top of the stairs...  Then
          the action UNFREEZES, rolls forward at normal speed for a
          second, and then we FAST FORWARD.  The crowd of people
          whips by.  Fatty heads down the stairs, and then we FREEZE
          again...

          Johnny walks down the stairs through the frozen people
          and hovering pieces of litter and blowing leaves to find...


          FATTY - FROZEN

          humorously, Mort's friend sitting next to him is covered
          in the EXACT same gear -- obviously Mort spent Johnny's
          money on both of them).  Fatty already gave Mort's friend
          his pizza, and now Mort's coins are frozen in mid-air,
          half way to a shiny chromed thermos cup Mort is holding
          (another recent purchase at the sporting goods store)...

          The bike messenger is frozen nearby...  Bruce is visibly

          moment for a beat... Then we UNFREEZE as Fatty's coins
          drop into the cup... Mort lowers his cup, then FREEZE...


          THE CUP - FROZEN

          at the perfect spot to reflect a ray of sunlight right
          into the eyes of:


          JONAH - FROZEN

          The ray of light is visible like a laser beam, and Johnny
          follows it over to Jonah who sits on the steps wincing
          from the sudden glare in the eyes.  Then, we UNFREEZE... 
          Jonah reacts to the light, looks up from his notebook,
          SEES the biker coming down the stairs... SEES the Tercel
          coming around the truck...

          FATTY walks down the stairs as the MESSENGER begins his
          high speed cross of the square.

          The TERCEL starts to come around the truck.

          FATTY arrives at MORT and drops money into his cup, the

                          commandment as a major one, for*
                        you know not the reward it will*
                          bring."*

                        ...and now they all go on with*
                        their lives -- Bob and Shari are*
                        taking the plunge into a hottub*
                        right about now, I'm trying not*
                        to peek... Jonah won't be needing*
                        me as a muse anymore, he's found*
                        a real one in the messenger girl...*

                                        BRUCE*
                        You never mentioned she was a*
                        girl.

                                        JOHNNY*
                        You know, things get very confusing*
                        in visions...*

                                        BRUCE*
                        So I noticed... oh, speaking of*
                        the future, Mort might be coming*
                        by...*

                        You know if it ever gets really*
                        cold... I gave him your address...*
                                (off Johnny's look)*
                        You can give him the east wing*
                        for a night or two.  You can use*
                        the company.  He's a great*
                          raconteur.*

          Johnny shrugs, what the hell... rises to leave...*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        I'm meeting Barclay for dinner,*
                        want to come?*

                                        BRUCE*
