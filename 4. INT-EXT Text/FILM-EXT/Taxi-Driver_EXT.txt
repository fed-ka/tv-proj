Weather-beaten
sign above driveway reads, "Taxi Enter Here". Yellow cabs
scuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the
curbs, the wind is howling.
INSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis.
Echoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy
breath and exhaust fill the air.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls into the driveway.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
Each night when I return the cab to
the garage I have to clean the come
off the back seat. Some nights I
clean off the blood.
9.
The Headquarters of the "New Yorkers for Charles Palantine
for President Committee", located at the corner of 50th
Street and Broadway, are festooned in traditional red, white
and blue banners, ribbons and signs.
One large sign proclaims "Palantine". Another sign reads
"Register for New York Primary, July 20.". The smiling
middle-aged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the
bustling pedestrians.
It is LATE AFTERNOON.
INSIDE HEADQUARTERS
A variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor
through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound
of ringing phones.
Seen from a distance - the only way Travis can see them -
those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, well-
groomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields
of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
CAMERA FAVORS BETSY, about 25, an extremely attractive woman
sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several
stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than
skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen,
though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every
man who passes her desk as her mind computes his
desirability: Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional,
material.
Simple pose and status do not impress her; she
seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in
other words, star-fucker of the highest order.
Betsy, putting down the phone, calls TOM, a lanky, amiable
and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk:
BETSY
Tom.
Tom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special
qualities which interest Betsy. He gets nowhere with Betsy -
yet he keeps trying.
13.
Just another of those routine office flirtations which pass
the hours and free the fantasies.
BETSY
Tom, come here a moment.
(he walks over)
I think this canvas report is about
ready to go out. Check it out with
Andy, and if he okays if, have a
copy made for the campaign
headquarters in every county.
(a beat)
And don't forget to add the new
photo releases.
TOM
The senator's white paper is almost
ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
BETSY
Andy usually just sends those to
the national media. The local press
doesn't know what to do with a
position paper until UPI and AP
tell them anyway.
TOM
I think we should try to get
maximum coverage for this new
mandatory welfare program. Push the
issues.
BETSY
(as if instructing a child)
First push the man, then the issue.
Senator Palantine is first of all a
dynamic man, an intelligent,
interesting, fascinating man.
TOM
You forgot "sexy".
BETSY
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
TOM
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
BETSY
Oh, Tom, please.
14.
TOM
Well, for Christsakes, you sound
like you're selling... I don't know
what... cars... not issues.
BETSY
Have you ever wondered why CBS News
has the highest ratings?
TOM
More people watch it.
BETSY
Alright, forget it if you're not
going to be serious,
TOM
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was
just...
BETSY
Just what?
TOM
Kidding around... you know, fun.
Betsy looks toward the street, then back at Tom.
BETSY
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in
a while, you'd get somewhere.
TOM
With who?
BETSY
Alright, now. You want to know why
CBS has the highest ratings? You
their news is any different from
NBC, ABC? It's all the same news.
Same stories. Same order usually.
What, you thought they had good
news for people, right? You thought
that's why people watched CBS? I'll
tell you why people watch CBS.
Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not
the news, not the issues, the man.
If Walter Cronkite told people to
eat soap, they'd do it. We are
selling cars, goddamn it.
Betsy's attention is being distracted by something she sees
across the street. She puts on her glasses and looks out
across the street again.
15.
TOM
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why
don't we run him instead?
BETSY
That's the last. The finish. Period.
Some pople can learn. Some people
can't. And you wonder why we never
get serious----
TOM
Sure we could run him. You realize
he's already of his block
association.
BETSY
(looks across street again)
Have you been noticing anything
strange?
TOM
No, why?
BETSY
Why's that taxi driver across the
street been staring at us?
TOM
What taxi driver?
BETSY
That taxi driver. The one that's
been sitting here.
TOM
How long has he been there?
BETSY
I don't know - but it feels like a
long time.
Travis' cold piercingly eyes Stare out from his cab parked
across the street from Palantine Headquarters. He is like a
lone wolf watching the warm campfires of civilization from a
distance. A thin red dot glows from his cigarette.
Tom exchanges Travis' gaze.
TOM
(determined)
Well, I'll go out and ask him.
As Tom walks toward front door Betsy's eyes alternate
between him and the position where Travis sits.
16.
Tom strides out the front door and walks briskly across the
street toward Travis' taxi.
Travis spots Tom walking toward him and quickly stares up
his cab, then squeals off in a burst of billowing exhaust.
Tom watches the speeding taxi quizzically.
Travis' taxi continues down Broadway.
CUT TO:
Traffic passes.
Travis is striding briskly across Broadway toward the
Palantine Headquarters.
He s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not
jeans) are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed. Under
his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy
league tie. He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in.
Watching Travis enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are
surprised to realize that Travis is really quite attractive.
His deformities are psychological, not physical. He believes
he is cursed, and therefore he is.
Travis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward
Betsy's desk.
Tom walks over to greet him, but Travis
ignores him.
TRAVIS
(at Betsy's desk)
I want to volunteer.
As the CAMERA examines Travis' face more closely, one can
see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient
diet.
TOM
(at Betsy's desk)
If you'll come this way.
Travis elbows Tom off.
26.
TRAVIS
(to Betsy)
No. I want to volunteer to you.
TOM
(under his voice)
Bets.
BETSY waves TOM off with a short gesture, indicating
everything is OK.
He walks away.
BETSY
(curious)
And why is that?
TRAVIS is on his best behavior.
He smiles slightly:
TRAVIS
Because you are the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.
BETSY is momentarily taken back, but pleased. TRAVIS'
presence has a definite sexual charge. He has those star
qualities BETSY looks for: She senses there is something
special about the young man who stands before her. And then,
too, there is that disarming smile. He is, as Betsy would
say, "fascinating".
BETSY
(smiling)
Is that so?
(pause)
But what do you think of Charles
Palantine?
TRAVIS
(his mind elsewhere)
Who mam?
BETSY
Charles Palantine. The man you want
to volunteer to help elect president.
TRAVIS
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man.
Make a great, great President.
BETSY
You want to canvass?
TRAVIS
Yes, mam.
27.
Betsy is interviewing Travis, but she is also teasing him a
little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way:
BETSY
How do you feel about Senator
Palantine's stand on welfare?
This takes TRAVIS back a bit.
He obviously doesn't have the
slightest idea what Palantine's stand on welfare is, in
fact, he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever.
TRAVIS thinks a moment, then improvises an answer:
TRAVIS
Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's
right. People should work for a
living. I do. I like to work. Every
day. Get those old coots off
welfare and make 'em work for a
change.
Betsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly
Palantine's position on welfare. She remain intrigued by
Travis.
BETSY
Well, that's not exactly what the
Senator has proposed. You might not
want to canvass, but there is
plenty more other work we need
done: Office work, filing, poster
hanging.
TRAVIS
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a
real good worker.
BETSY
(gesturing)
if you talk to Tom, he'll assign
you to something.
TRAVIS
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather
work for you.
BETSY
Well, we're all working tonight.
TRAVIS
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at
night.
28.
BETSY
Well, then, what is it you exactly
want to do?
TRAVIS
(bolstering courage)
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be
mighty pleased if you'd go out and
have some coffee and pie with me.
Betsy doesn't quite know what to make of Travis. She is
curious, intrigued, tantalized. Like a moth, she draws
closer to the flame.
BETSY
Why?
TRAVIS
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this
place here in my taxi many times a
day. And I watch you sitting here
at this big long desk with these
telephones, and I say to myself,
that's a lonely girl. She needs a
friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
(smiles)
Travis rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glows.
It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm
unknown even to himself.
Betsy is completely disarmed.
BETSY
I don't know...
TRAVIS
It's just to the corner, mam. In
broad daytime. Nothing can happen.
I'll be there to protect you.
BETSY
(smiles)
All right.
(relents)
All right. I'm taking a break at
four o'clock. If you're here then
we'll go to the corner and have
some coffee and pie.
TRAVIS
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam.
I'll be here at four o'clock
exactly.
(pause)
And... ah... Betsy...
29.
BETSY
Yes?
TRAVIS
My name is Travis.
BETSY
Thank you, Travis.
Travis nods, turns and exits.
Tom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo-
standoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to Betsy. His
manner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was
doing.
Betsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and
says:
BETSY
I'm just going to find out what the
cabbies are thinking.
CUT TO:
Travis is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the
Palantine Headquarters. He checks his watch.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
April 26, 1972. Four o'clock p.m. I
took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee
Shop on Broadway...
Travis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza.
37.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
I called Betsy again at her office,
and she said maybe we could go to a
movie together after she gets off
work tomorrow. That's my day off.
At first she hesitated, but I
called her again and she agreed.
(pause)
Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask
her last name again.
Damn. I've
got to remember stuff like that.
Travis' thoughts are with Betsy, as THREE MEN enter Travis'
cab. He activates the meter and pulls off.
MAN'S VOICE
St. Regis Hotel.
Travis checks the mirror. Scanning across the back seat, he
recognizes the middle passenger. It is CHARLES PALANTINE,
candidate for President.
He must have left the Hotel
shortly after BETSY.
Tom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks
deferentially to Palantine:
TOM
It's 12:30 now. You'll have fifteen
minutes before the actual luncheon
begins.
Palantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an
earlier conversation.
ASSISTANT
I don't think we have to worry
about anybody here committing
themselves until things start
coming in from California.
Travis recognizes his passenger. He puts out his cigarette.
TRAVIS
(interrupting)
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine,
the candidate?
PALANTINE
(only mildly irritated)
Yes I am.
38.
TRAVIS
Well, I'm one of your biggest
supporters. I tell everybody that
comes in this cab that they should
vote for you.
PALANTINE
(pleased; glances to
check Travis' license)
Why, thank you Travis.
TRAVIS
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody
I know is going to vote for you.
(a beat)
I was going to put one of your
stickers on my taxi but the company
said it was against their policy.
PALANTINE
(pleasant)
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned
more about this country sitting in
taxi cabs than in the board room of
General Motors.
TOM
(joking)
And in some other places too...
Palantine, his Assistant and Tom all laugh. Palantine,
quickly reassuming candiorial mien, speaks to Travis:
PALANTINE
Travis, what single thing would you
want the next President of this
country to do most?
TRAVIS
I don't know, sir. I don't follow
political issues much.
PALANTINE
There must be something...
TRAVIS
(thinks)
Well, he should clean up this city
here. It's full of filth and scum.
Scum and filth. It's like an open
sewer. I can hardly take it.
(MORE)
39.
TRAVIS (CONT'D)
Some days I go out and smell it
then I get headaches that just stay
and never go away. We need a
President that would clean up this
whole mess.
Flush it out.
Palantine is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional
bullshitter, and Travis' intense reply stops him dead in his
tracks. He is forced to fall back on a stock answer but
tries to give it some meaning.
PALANTINE
(after a pause)
I know what you mean, Travis, and
it's not going to be easy. We're
going to have to make some radical
changes.
TRAVIS
(turning the wheel)
Damn straight.
TRAVIS' taxi pulls up in front of the Barclay Hotel.
PALANTINE and AIDE get out of the cab. SECOND AIDE stays in
back seat a moment to pay TRAVIS.
PALANTINE looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods
goodbye to TRAVIS.
PALANTINE
Nice talking to you, Travis.
TRAVIS
(calling back)
Thank you, sir. You're a good man,
sir.
Travis' taxi departs.
PALANTINE and AIDES walk up carpet to the St. Regis.
CAMERA CLOSES IN on PALANTINE as he stops, turns back and
watches Travis' departing taxi.
PALANTINE turns back and ascends the hotel steps with his
AIDES.
40.
TRAVIS, dressed to the teeth, walks brightly down the
sidewalk. His face is frehsly shaved, his hair combed, his
tie straightened.
He pauses in a store window to check his appearance.
Under his arm he carries the gift-wrapped Kristofferson
record album.
OUTSIDE PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
BETSY, smartly dressed, waves goodbye to another CAMPAIGN
WORKER and walks out the door to greet him.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS and BETSY are walking down
Broadway toward Times Square. BETSY does not let their
bodies touch as they walk although TRAVIS contemplates
edging closer to her.
Betsy has opened the package and is admiring the record -
or, rather, Travis' sentiment behind giving it.
Travis looks around himself with pride: This is a moment in
his life - one of the few.
BETSY
You didn't have to spend your
money - ?
TRAVIS
(interrupting)
He'll, what else can I do with it
all?
Betsy notices that the seal on the record has not been broken.
BETSY
Travis, you haven't even played the
record?
TRAVIS
(evasive)
Yeah, well my stereo player is
broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
BETSY
Your stereo broke? God, I could
hardly stand that. I live on music.
41.
TRAVIS
I don't follow music much. I'd like
to though.
(second thought)
Honest.
BETSY
(pointing to album)
So you haven't heard this record yet?
TRAVIS
No.
(sly smile)
I thought maybe you could play it
for me on your player.
Betsy's face backtracks a bit. Maybe she was wrong to go out
with this fellow she doesn't know.
She makes a polite laugh.
LATER.
Travis and Betsy are in TIMES SQUARE, turning the
corner from Broadway to 42nd Street. Travis carries the
album under his arm.
They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno
theatre advertising "The Swedish Marriage Manual". The box
office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with
explicit publicity stills.
Offending portions have been
blocked out with black tape.
Travis steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets.
Betsy, befuddled, watches him. She doesn't know what to say.
Travis returns with the tickets.
Betsy still has not fully comprehended what is happening:
BETSY
What are you doing?
TRAVIS
(innocent)
I bought a couple of tickets.
BETSY
But this is a porno movie.
TRAVIS
No, these are the kind that couples
go to. They're not like the other
movies. All kinds of couples go.
Honest. I've seen them.
42.
Travis seems confused. He is so much part of his own world,
he fails to comprehend another's world. Compared to the
movies he sees, this is respectable. But then there's also
something that Travis could not even acknowledge, much less
admit: That he really wants to get this pure white girl into
that dark porno theatre.
Travis makes an awkward gesture to escort Betsy into the
theatre. Betsy looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at
Travis. She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the
turnstile. She thinks to herself: "What the Hell. What can
happen?" She's always been curious about these pictures
anyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent -
she's been raised not to offend her date. A perverse logic
which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like
these.
INSIDE THE THEATER
Travis escorts Betsy to an empty center row. Travis was
right. Couples do go to films like this. There are at least
six or seven other MEN with their bewigged "DATES".
Travis settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch. Betsy
looks curiously from side to side.
ON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is
speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in
a happy marriage.
Subtitles translate her words. Then,
without warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating
on a sterile table-like bed.
Travis watches intently. The color, however, is slowly
draining from Betsy's cheeks. One thought fills her mind:
"What am I doing here?"
TRAVIS
(to himself)
Damn.
BETSY
What's wrong?
TRAVIS
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
That does it. Betsy just looks at him for a moment, then
gets up and starts to leave. Travis, confused, hustles after
her.
He follows her out of the theatre.
43.
ON THE SIDEWALK
Travis catches up with her.
TRAVIS
Where are you going?
BETSY
I'm leaving.
TRAVIS
What do you mean?
Betsy looks at Travis, trying to understand him:
BETSY
These are not the kind of movies I
go to.
TRAVIS
Well, I don't follow movies too
much...
BETSY
You mean these are the only kind of
movies you go to?
The TICKET GIRL watches expressionlessly from the booth.
TRAVIS
This is sort of high class...
BETSY
I mean porno movies.
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
Well... mostly...
BETSY
My God!
TRAVIS
We can go to another movie if you
like, I don't care. I got money.
There's plenty...
Travis gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marquees,
but is interrupted by Betsy:
BETSY
If you just wanted to fuck, why
didn't you just come right out and
say it?
44.
Travis is flabbergasted by Betsy's blunt language. His arm
still gestures toward the marquees, his lips continue to
move, but words do not come out.
Unable to respond to Betsy's question, Travis picks up where
he left off:
TRAVIS
... there's plenty of movies around
here. I haven't seen any of them,
but I'm sure they're good.
BETSY
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and
all that, but I think this is it.
I'm going home.
TRAVIS
(interrupting)
You mean you don't want to go to a
movie?
(a beat)
There's plenty of movies around here.
BETSY
No, I don't feel so good. We're
just two very different kinds of
people, that's all.
TRAVIS
(puzzled)
Huh?
BETSY
It's very simple. You go your way,
I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
TRAVIS
But... Betsy...
BETSY
I'm getting a taxi.
She walks to the curb.
TRAVIS
(following her)
What about the record?
BETSY
Keep it.
TRAVIS
Can I call you?
45.
Betsy looks for a cab.
TRAVIS
(tender)
Please, Betsy, I bought it for you.
Betsy looks at his sad, sweet face and relents a bit.
BETSY
All right, I'll accept the record.
Betsy accepts the record, but quickly turns and hails a taxi.
BETSY
Taxi!
A taxi quickly pulls up.
Travis feebly protests to no one in particular:
TRAVIS
But I got a taxi.
Betsy gives instructions to CAB DRIVER, looks briefly back
at Travis, then straight ahead. Taxi speeds off.
Travis looks around helplessly: A cluster of PEDESTRIANS on
the crowded street has stopped to watch the argument. Travis
looks back at the woman in the porno theatre box office who
has also been following the argument.
CUT TO:
INSIDE TRAVIS' APARTMENT
Travis is sitting at the table. There are some new items on
the table: His giant econo-sized bottle of vitamins, a giant
econo-sized bottle of aspirins, a pint of apricot brandy, a
partial loaf of cheap white bread.
On the wall behind the table hang two more items: A gag sign
reading "One of These Days I'm Gonna Get Organezizied" and
an orange-and-black bumper sticker for Charles Palantine.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
May 8, 1972. My life has taken
another turn again. The days move
along with regularity...
C.U. of notebook: Travis is no longer sitting at the desk.
The pencil rests on the open notebook.
46.
LATER THAT DAY: TRAVIS has pulled his straight-backed chair
around and is watching his small portable TV, which rests on
the upright melon crate.
A cereal bowl partially filled with milk rests in his lap.
Travis pours a couple shots of the apricot brandy into the
bowl, dips folded chunks of white bread into the mixture,
and eats them.
Travis is watching early evening NEWS PROGRAM. TV background
SOUND.
Charles Palantine is being interviewed somewhere on
the campaign trail.
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
... one day indistinguishable from
the next, a long continuous chain,
then suddenly - there is a change.
Betsy is walking down a midtown street when Travis suddenly
appears before her. He has been waiting.
Travis tries to make conversation but she doesn't listen.
She motions for him to go away and keeps on walking.
Travis, protesting, follows.
CUT TO:
Travis is again making his way through the garish urban
night. He stops for a PASSENGER on PARK AVE. A middle-aging
professorial executive.
C.U. TRAVIS: His face is expressionless.
The MAN makes
himself comfortable in the back seat.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
Jackson Heights.
Travis has no intention of driving out to Jackson Heights
and coming back with a fare.
48.
TRAVIS
I'm off duty.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
You mean you don't want to go out
to Jackson Heights?
TRAVIS
No, I'm off duty.
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
Then how come your "Off Duty" light
wasn't on.
TRAVIS switches on the "Off Duty" light.
TRAVIS
It was on.
(gesturing toward top
of taxi)
it just takes a while to warm up.
Like a TV.
TRAVIS doesn't budge. PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER curses to
himself and exits cab. Travis takes off.
POV as Travis' eyes dwell on the young HIP COUPLES coming
out of a East Side movie house.
LATER THAT NIGHT, TRAVIS pulls over for a young (mid-
twenties) MAN wearing a leather sports jacket.
TRAVIS eyes his passenger in rear-view mirror.
YOUNG PASSENGER
471 Central Park West.
TRAVIS' taxi speeds off.
LATER, TRAVIS' taxi slows down as it approaches 400 block of
Central Park West.
Travis checks apartment numbers.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Just pull over to the curb a moment.
TRAVIS turns the wheel.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Yeah, that's fine. Just sit here.
49.
TRAVIS waits impassively. The motor ticks away.
After a long pause, the PASSENGER speaks:
YOUNG PASSENGER
Cabbie, ya see that light up there
on the seventh floor, three windows
from this side of the building?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on 417 Central Park West: TRACKING UP to
the seventh floor, it moves three windows to the right.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
Yeah.
A young WOMAN wearing a slip crosses in front of the light.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
Ya see that woman there?
TRAVIS (O.S.)
Yeah.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
That's my wife.
(a beat)
But it ain't my apartment.
(a beat)
A nigger lives there.
(a beat)
She left me two weeks ago. It took
me this long to find out where she
went.
(a beat)
I'm gonna kill her.
C.U. TRAVIS' face: it is devoid of expression.
YOUNG PASSENGER
What do you think of that, cabbie?
C.U. YOUNG PASSENGER's face: it is gaunt, drained of blood,
full of fear and anger.
Travis does not respond.
YOUNG PASSENGER
Huh?
(a beat)
What do you think of that, huh?
Travis shrugs, gesturing toward meter.
50.
YOUNG PASSENGER
I'm gonna kill her with a .44
Magnum pistol.
CAMERA returns to SEVENTH FLOOR WINDOW. Woman is standing in
the light.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
Did you ever see what a .44 can do
to a woman's face, cabbie?
(pause)
Did you ever see what it can do to
a woman's pussy, cabbie?
Travis says nothing.
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
I'm going to put it right up to
her, cabbie. Right in her, cabbie.
You must think I'm real sick, huh?
A real pervert. Sitting here and
talking about a woman's pussy and a
.44, huh?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on Travis' face: He is watching the woman
in the seventh floor window with complete and total
absorption. It's the same glazed-over stare we saw in his
eyes as he watched the porno movie.
FADE TO:
BROOKLYN STREET CORNER - DAY
Travis stands near the corner wearing his boots, jeans,
western shirt and army jacket.
He pulls his aspiring bottle out of his pocket, shakes three
or four into his palm, pops them into his mouth and chews.
An "Off Duty" taxi pulls up to the curb. Travis gets in.
INSIDE TAXI
Dough-Boy leans back from the wheel and greets Travis as he
enters.
DOUGH-BOY
Hey Travis. This here's Easy Andy.
He's a travelling salesman.
In the back seat, beside Travis, sits ANDY, an attractive
young man about 29. He wears a pin-striped suit, white shirt
and floral tie. His hair is modishly long.
51.
ANDY
Hello Travis.
Travis nods as the taxi speeds off.
Dough-Boy slows down near an economy hotel. Not a flop
house, but not do fancy they care what the guests do in the
privacy of their rooms.
ANDY
This is fine, Dough-Boy
(to Travis)
Pay Dough-Boy here.
Travis pulls a twenty out of his pocket and gives it to
Dough-Boy.
TRAVIS
20 bucks?
DOUGH-BOY
(takes bill)
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice,
Travis.
Travis and Andy get out of the cab and walk toward the hotel.
Dough-Boy pulls away.
As they enter the hotel, they pass a JUNKIE, stoned out and
spread-eagled across the hood of a derelict old blue dodge.
TRAVIS follows WIZARD out onto the sidewalk.
TRAVIS follows
WIZARD as he walks toward his cab.
He has something on his
mind, something he wants to talk to WIZARD about.
TRAVIS
(walking)
Hey Wiz.
WIZARD leans back against the cab.
TRAVIS is about to speak
when he spots a GROUP of BLACK and PUERTO RICAN STREET
PUNKS, ages 12-15, jiving down the sidewalk toward him.
ONE
tosses a spray paint can around his back, basketball style.
ANOTHER mocks as if he's going to scratch a key along one of
the cabs.
69.
WIZARD has no visible reaction.
A flash of controlled anger
crosses TRAVIS' face.
He stares at the BOY with the poised
key.
It is the same look that crossed his face in the
Harlem Deli.
We are reminded with a jolt that the killer
lies just beneath TRAVIS' surface.
The BLACK PUNK must instinctively realize this too, because
he makes a cocky show of putting the key back into his
pocket and be-bopping around TRAVIS and WIZARD.
The YOUNG MEAN-STREETERS continue down the street and TRAVIS
turns back to WIZARD.
Across the street, in the background, a JUNKIE nestles in a
doorway.
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
Wiz?
WIZARD
Yeah?
TRAVIS
Look, ah, we never talked much, you
and me...
WIZARD
Yeah?
TRAVIS
I wanted to ask you something, on
account you've been around so long.
WIZARD
Shoot.
They don't call me the
Wizard for nothing.
TRAVIS
Well, I just, you know...
WIZARD
Things got ya down?
TRAVIS
Real down.
WIZARD
It happens.
70.
TRAVIS
Sometimes it gets so I just don't
know what I'm gonna do.
I get some
real crazy ideas, you know?
Just
go out and do somethin.
WIZARD
The taxi life, you mean.
TRAVIS
Yeah.
WIZARD
(nods)
I know.
TRAVIS
Like do anything, you know.
WIZARD
Travis, look, I dig it.
Let me
explain.
You choose a certain way
of life.
You live it.
It becomes
what you are.
I've been a hack 27
years, the last ten at night.
Still don't own my own cab.
I
guess that's the way I want it.
You see, that must be what I am.
A police car stops across the street.
TWO PATROLMEN get out
and roust the JUNKIE from his doorway.
WIZARD
(continuing)
Look, a person does a certain thing
and that's all there is to it.
It
becomes what he is.
Why fight it?
What do you know?
How long you
been a hack, a couple months?
You're like a peg and you get
dropped into a slot and you got to
squirm and wiggle around a while
until you fit in.
TRAVIS
(pause)
That's just about the dumbest thing
I ever heard, Wizard.
WIZARD
What do you expect, Bertrand
Russell?
I've been a cabbie all my
life, what do I know?
(a beat)
I don't even know what you're
talking about.
71.
TRAVIS
Neither do I, I guess.
WIZARD
You fit in.
It's lonely, it's
rough at first.
But you fit in.
You got no choice.
WIZARD
Yeah.
Sorry, Wizard.
WIZARD
Don't worry, Killer.
You'll be all
right.
(a beat)
I seen enough to know.
TRAVIS
Thanks.
WIZARD gives TRAVIS a short wave implying, "Chin up, old
boy," and walks around to the driver's side of his cab.
WIZARD drives off, leaving the street to its natural
inhabitants.
CUT TO:
FADE IN:
A rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in
QUEENS is draped in red, white and blue bunting.
A CROWD of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the
rally to begin.
Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the
loudspeaker system.
The CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive
metallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques,
stands out in the CROWD.
On the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS
as well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS.
TOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY
stands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER.
TOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to
what he was reading.
Then he returns his gaze to the upper
left, watching something very closely.
72.
After a moment he walks over to the steps where BETSY is
standing.
TOM
Betsy, come over here a moment.
BETSY
What is it?
I'm busy.
TOM
(insistent)
Just follow me.
BETSY excuses herself and walks across the platform with TOM.
As they stand to the rear of the platform, TOM secretively
makes a gesture with his eyes and says out of the side of
his mouth:
TOM
Look there.
(her eyes follow his)
No, over further - get your
glasses - yes, over there.
Isn't
that little guy the same guy that
was bugging you around the office
about a month ago?
BETSY, putting on her glasses, looks closely.
She tries not
to make her stare too obvious.
BETSY
No, I don't think so.
(a beat)
That's someone else.
TOM
Now look more closely.
Look around
the eyes and chin.
See?
See there?
CAMERA CLOSES IN on TRAVIS BICKLE standing in the CROWD: he
has shaved his head to a short stubble.
There he is: brush-
cut, wearing a giant grin, and a large "Palantine '72" button.
Although it is a pleasant sunny day, TRAVIS wears a bulky
bulged-out Army jacket.
TRAVIS looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the
CROWD.
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS walks up to a SECRET SERVICE MAN
standing near the fringes of the CROWD.
The SECRET SERVICE
MAN -- in sun glasses, grey suit, ever-roving eyes -- is
immediately identifiable.
73.
Whenever TRAVIS confronts a symbol of authority, he becomes
like a young boy.
This time is no exception, although one
suspects there is a plan hatching beneath that boyish
exterior.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN, for his part, is about as
talkative as the Sphinx.
TRAVIS
Are you a Secret Service Man?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
(indifferently)
Why do you ask?
TRAVIS
I've seen a lot of suspicious-
looking people around here today.
SECRET SERVICE MAN glances at TRAVIS momentarily.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Who?
TRAVIS
Oh, lots.
I don't know where they
all are now.
There used to be one
standing over there.
(points)
SECRET SERVICE MAN's gaze follows TRAVIS' finger for a
second, then return to TRAVIS.
TRAVIS (CONTD)
Is it hard to get to be a Secret
Service Man?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Why?
TRAVIS
I kinda thought I might make a good
one.
I'm very observant.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Oh?
TRAVIS
I was in the Army too.
(beat)
And I'm good with crowds.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN is starting to get interested in
TRAVIS: he definitely ranks as a suspicious character.
74.
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Is that so?
TRAVIS
What kind of guns do you guys use?
.38's?
The SECRET SERVICE MAN decides it's time to get some more
information on TRAVIS:
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Look, um, if you give me your name
and address, we'll send you the
information on how to apply.
TRAVIS
You would, huh?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
(taking out notepad)
Sure.
TRAVIS
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's
with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E.
I live
at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn,
New Jersey.
Zip code 07410.
(a beat)
Got that?
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Sure, Henry.
I got it all.
We'll
send you all the stuff all right.
TRAVIS
Great, hey.
Thanks a lot.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to a SECRET SERVICE
PHOTOGRAPHER to catch a picture of TRAVIS.
TRAVIS notices
this, and quickly slips away into the CROWD.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS sits at his desk in his APARTMENT, writing.
He wears
jeans, western shirt and empty holster.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
June 11.
Eight rallies in six more
days.
The time is coming.
CUT TO:
NIGHT.
TRAVIS' taxi picks up a FARE in the midtown area and
heads downtown.
75.
LOWER EAST SIDE.
TRAVIS lets off FARE on B Street and cuts
across toward Tompkins Square.
TRAVIS turns the corner when SKREETCH! he suddenly hits the
brakes, causing the cab to rock back and forth.
He has almost hit a YOUNG GIRL recklessly crossing the
street.
She thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her
balance and stares in shock through the front window.
C.U.
GIRL's face.
TRAVIS recognizes her face: it's IRIS, the GIRL in his taxi
a week or so before.
IRIS looks at TRAVIS sharply then
turns and continues walking.
TRAVIS' eyes follow her and she rejoins a GIRLFRIEND.
They
are both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots,
jeans, floppy hats.
And the old come-hither walk is
unmistakable.
TRAVIS follows IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND slowly as they walk
down the sidewalk.
TRAVIS' P.O.V.
He examines them from bottom to top --
boots, legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats.
As TRAVIS rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar
FRINGE OF A SUEDE JACKET standing in the shadows.
The GIRLS
look toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some
unheard comment, and continue on.
IRIS looks back uneasily at TRAVIS' taxi and continues on.
On the corner stand TWO well-to-do COLLEGE STUDENTS, somewhat
out of place in this environment, but making every attempt
to groove on it.
They are high on something or another.
The GIRLS spot the COLLEGE STUDENTS and walk over to them.
They exchange some small talk and walk off together.
There
is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up.
TRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to
continue following the GIRLS and their COLLEGIATE JOHNS.
This is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy.
As TRAVIS slows down to make the turn, he notices ANOTHER
HIPPIE HOOKER who had been watching him watching IRIS and
her GIRLFRIEND.
She walks over to the taxi, loans in the
open left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised
as an innocent question:
C.U. HIPPIE HOOKER.
76.
HIPPIE HOOKER
Hey cabbie!
You comin' or goin'?
TRAVIS quickly turns his face away from her in a combination
of shock, embarrassment and revulsion.
He is the child
caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
The very presence
of this crassly, openly sexual human being frightens and
sickens him.
TRAVIS takes off with a skreetch.
His taxi shoots down the
block.
CUT TO:
A HOT JUNE DAY.
TRAVIS' taxi, the "Off Duty" sign on, is
parked against the curb somewhere in HARLEM.
WHITE COPS,
SECRET SERVICE MEN and REPORTERS, punctuate the otherwise
BLACK CROWDS which walk to and fro in the b.g.
CHARLES PALANTINE's voice can be heard coming from a distant
loudspeaker system.
It is a political rally.
TRAVIS sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in
the distance.
His hair, of course, is still clipped short
and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses.
Even though a
drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, TRAVIS
wears his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the
.38 Smith and Wesson bulge.
A BLOCK AWAY, PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his
uptown campaign headquarters.
On the platform sit an array
of BLACK DIGNITARIES.
Nearby we recognize the SECRET
SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans
the CROWD anxiously.
PALANTINE is speaking animatedly.
He is an excellent
speaker and captures our attention.
He drives hard toward
his arguments, crashes down on his points.
His strained
voice rings with sincerity and anger.
C.U. of PALANTINE as he speaks.
He is dressed in rolled-up
shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face.
PALANTINE
The time has come to put an end to
the things that divide us: racism,
poverty, way -- and to those
persons who seek to divide us.
Never have I seen such a group of
high officials from the President
to Senate leaders to Cabinet
members...
77.
CUT TO TRAVIS: no expression.
PALANTINE's words are barely
distinguishable from a block away:
PALANTINE
(in distance)
... pit black against white, young
against old, sow anger, disunity
and suspicion -- and all in the
name of the "good of the country."
Well, their game is over.
(applause)
All their games are over.
Now is
the time to stand up against such
foolishness, propaganda and
demagoguery.
Now is the time for
one man to stand up and accept his
neighbor, for one man to give in
order that all might receive.
Is
unity and love of common good such
a lost thing?
ALL LIVE SOUND CEASES as TRAVIS' narration begins.
He is
reading from a letter or card he has just written.
As he speaks we see SHOTS of PALANTINE speaking, a seated
row of YOUNG BLACK PALANTINE red, white and blue bedecked
CHEERLEADERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS examining the CROWD and
so forth.
These SHOTS have no direct relationship to the
narration.
TRAVIS (V.O.)
(reading)
Dear Father and Mother,
June is the month, I remember,
which brings not only your wedding
anniversary, but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday.
I'm sorry I
can't remember the exact dates, but
I hope this card will take care of
all of them.
I'm sorry I again can not send you
my address like I promised to last
year, but the sensitive nature of
my work for the Army demands utmost
secrecy.
I know you will
understand.
I am healthy and well and making
lots of money.
I have been going
with a girl for several months and
I know you would be proud if you
could see her.
(MORE)
78.
TRAVIS (V.O.; CONT'D)
Her name is Betsy, but I can tell
you no more than that.
(interrupted)
As TRAVIS reads third paragraph, a POLICEMAN is seen walking
from behind TRAVIS' taxi to his window.
The POLICEMAN's voice come during a pause in the narration.
LIVE SOUND RESUMES.
POLICEMAN
(standing near window)
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.
TRAVIS
(penitent)
Sorry, officer.
POLICEMAN
You waiting for a fare?
POLICEMAN leans his head in window, inspecting the cab.
As
he does, TRAVIS slides his right hand into the left side of
his jacket, ready to draw his revolver.
TRAVIS
No, officer.
POLICEMAN
All right, move it.
TRAVIS starts up his taxi and drives off.
LIVE SOUND again CEASES as TRAVIS resumes reading letter as
taxi drives away.
Travis' cab pulls away from the yellow mass and heads
downtown.
CUT TO:
Travis' cab is parked near a neighborhood Bickford's.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS and IRIS are having late breakfast at a middle-class
EAST SIDE COFFEE SHOP.
It is about 1:30 P.M.
IRIS is dressed more sensibly, wearing jeans and a maroon
sweater.
Her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out.
Seen this way, IRIS looks no different than any young girl
in the big city.
OTHER PATRONS of the coffee shop most
likely assume she is having lunch with her big brother.
They are both having an All-American breakfast: ham and
eggs, large glasses of orange juice, coffee.
90.
Outside here environment, Iris seems the more pathetic.
She
seems unsure, schizy, unable to hold a subject for more than
thirty seconds.
Her gestures are too broad, her voice too
mannered.
We sympathize with Travis' paternal respect.
This girl is in trouble.
IRIS
... and after that Sport and I just
started hanging out...
TRAVIS
Where is home?
Iris removes her large blue-tinted sunglasses and fishes
through her bag for another pair.
IRIS
I got so many sunglasses.
I
couldn't live without my shades,
man.
I must have twelve pair of
shades.
She finds a pink-tinted pair and puts them on.
TRAVIS
Where?
IRIS
Pittsburgh.
TRAVIS
I ain't ever been there, but it
don't seem like such a bad place.
IRIS
(voice rising)
Why do you want me to go back to my
parents?
They hate me.
Why do you
think I split?
There ain't nothin
there.
TRAVIS
But you can't live like this.
It's
hell.
Girls should live at home.
IRIS
(playfully)
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
There is a short, quick silence; TRAVIS' eyes retract.
He
goes on:
91.
TRAVIS
(ignoring her question)
Young girls are supposed to dress
up, go to school, play with boys,
you know, that kinda stuff.
Iris places a large gob of jam on her unbuttered toast and
folds the bread over like a hotdog.
IRIS
God, you are square.
TRAVIS
(releasing pent-up tension)
At least I don't walk the streets
like a skunk pussy.
I don't screw
and fuck with killers and junkies.
IRIS motions him to lower his voice.
IRIS
Who's a killer?
TRAVIS
That fella "Sport" looks like a
killer to me.
IRIS
He never killed nobody.
He's a
Libra.
TRAVIS
Huh?
IRIS
I'm a Libra too.
That's why we get
along so well.
TRAVIS
He looks like a killer.
IRIS
I think Cancer's make the best
lovers.
My whole family are air
signs.
TRAVIS
He shoots dope too.
IRIS
What makes you so high and mighty?
Did you ever look at your own
eyeballs in a mirror.
You don't
get eyes like that from...
92.
TRAVIS
He's worse than an animal.
Jail's
too good for scum like that.
There is a brief silence.
Iris mind continued to whirl at
78 rpms.
She seems to have three subjects on her mind at a
time.
She welcomes this opportunity to unburden herself.
IRIS
Rock music died in 1970, that's
what I think.
Before that it was
fantastic.
I can tell you that.
Everybody was crashing, hanging out
at the Fillmore.
Me and my
girlfriend Ann used to go up the
fire escape, you know?
It was
unbelievable.
Rock Stars everywhere.
That Airplane--that's my group, man.
All Libras.
But now everybody's
split or got sick or busted.
I
think I'll move to one of those
communes in Vermont, you know?
That's where all the smart ones
went.
I stayed here.
TRAVIS
I never been to a commune.
I don't
know.
I saw pictures in a magazine,
and it didn't look very clean to me.
IRIS
Why don't you come to a commune
with me?
TRAVIS
Me?
I could never go to a place
like that.
IRIS
Why not?
TRAVIS
(hesitant)
I... I don't get along with people
like that.
IRIS
You a scorpion?
That's it.
You're
a scorpion.
I can tell.
TRAVIS
Besides, I've got to stay here.
93.
IRIS
Why?
TRAVIS
I've got something important to do.
I can't leave.
IRIS
What's so important?
TRAVIS
I can't say -- it's top secret.
I'm doing something for the Army.
The cab thing is just part time.
IRIS
You a narc?
TRAVIS
Do I look like a narc?
IRIS
Yeah.
TRAVIS breaks out in his big infectious grin, and IRIS joins
his laughter.
IRIS
God, I don't know who's weirder,
you or me.
TRAVIS
(pause)
What are you going to do about
Sport and that old bastard?
IRIS
Just leave'em.
There's plenty of
other girls.
TRAVIS
You just gonna leave 'em?
IRIS
(astonished)
What should I do?
Call the cops?
TRAVIS
Cops don't do nothin.
IRIS
Sport never treated me bad, honest.
Never beat me up once.
94.
TRAVIS
You can't leave 'em to do the same
to other girls.
You should get rid
of them.
IRIS
How?
TRAVIS
(shrugs)
I don't know.
Just should, though.
(a beat)
Somebody should kill 'em.
Nobody'd
miss 'em.
IRIS
(taken back)
God.
I know where they should have
a commune for you.
They should
have a commune for you at Bellevue.
TRAVIS
(apologetic/sheepish)
I'm sorry, Iris.
I didn't mean that.
IRIS
You're not much with girls, are you?
TRAVIS
(thinks)
Well, Iris, I look at it this way.
A lot of girls come into my cab,
some of them very beautiful.
And I
figure all day long men have been
after them: trying to touch them,
talk to them, ask them out.
And
they hate it.
So I figure the best
I can do for them is not bother
them at all.
So I don't say a
thing.
I pretend I'm not even
there.
I figure they'll understand
that and appreciate me for it.
It takes IRIS a moment to digest this pure example of
negative thinking: I am loved to the extent I do not exist.
IRIS
Do you really think I should go to
the commune?
95.
TRAVIS
I think you should go home, but
otherwise I think you should go.
It would be great for you.
You
have to get away from here.
The
city's a sewer, you gotta get out
of it.
Mumbling something about her "shades" again, Iris fishes
through her bag until she comes up with another 99 pair of
sunglasses and puts them on.
She likes these better, she
decides.
IRIS
Sure you don't want to come with me?
TRAVIS
I can't.
Otherwise, I would.
IRIS
I sure hate to go alone...
TRAVIS
I'll give you the money to go.
I
don't want you to take any from
those guys.
IRIS
You don't have to.
TRAVIS
I want to -- what else can I do
with my money?
(thinks)
You may not see me again--for a
while.
IRIS
What do you mean?
CLOSE on C.U. of TRAVIS:
TRAVIS
My work may take me out of New York.
CUT TO:
IRIS' ROOM - DAY
Sport stands beside the bed.
SPORT
What's the matter, baby, don't you
feel right?
96.
Iris is wearing her blue-tinted shades.
IRIS
It's my stomach.
I got the flu.
Sport puts his hand on her hips.
He is slowly, carefully,
smoothly manipulating her.
It's the stone black hustle.
SPORT
Oh, baby, there ain't no flu.
You
know that, baby.
IRIS
Honest, Sport.
Sport puts some slow soul music on the stereo.
SPORT
You're just tired, baby.
You just
need your man.
I am your man, you
know.
You are my woman.
I wouldn't
be nothing without you.
Sport slowly grinds his hips to hers.
Iris starts to move
with him.
This is what she really wanted.
Her man's
attention.
SPORT
I know this may not mean anything
to you, baby, but sometimes I get
so emotional, sometimes I think, I
wish every man could have what I
have now, that every woman could be
loved the way I love you.
I go
home and I think what it would be
without you, and then I thank God
for you.
I think to myself, man,
you are so lucky.
You got a woman
who loves you, who needs you, a
woman who keeps you strong.
It's
just you and me.
I'm nothing
without you.
I can go like this
for ever and ever.
We can do it,
baby.
You and me.
Just you and me.
Sport slowly rubs his crotch into her.
Iris smiles.
She is
happy.
The music rises.
CUT TO:
FIRING RANGE - DAY
TRAVIS stands at the firing range blasting the .44 Magnum
with a rapid-fire vengeance.
97.
He sets down one gun, picks up the next, then the next.
Quickly reloading, he fires again.
The targets spin and dance under his barrage.
The piercing
sound of GUNSHOTS ring through the air.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS places the envelope to IRIS in his mail box.
BACK IN APARTMENT.
CAMERA CLOSE ON revolvers lying on the
table in neat array.
CUT TO:
FADE IN:
SOUND of a political rally: cheering, laughing, a band
playing, talking.
AFTERNOON.
A CROWD of about 500 PERSONS is assembled before
a platform outside a Brooklyn union hall.
A DIXIELAND BAND
is playing on the platform.
C.U. CHARLES PALANTINE's feet climb out of a limousine.
There is a ROAR from the nearby CROWD.
PALANTINE, a bulky SECRET SERVICE MAN to the right and left
of him, pushes his way through the CROWD toward the platform.
Still cameras click, and TV cameras purr.
SLIGHT TIMECUT: PALANTINE is speaking on the platform.
CUT TO:
TRAVIS' empty taxi sits parked a few blocks away from rally.
At this distance, the rally sounds are almost
indistinguishable.
C.U. of TRAVIS' boots walking.
They make their way past one
person, then two, then a cluster of three or four.
SOUNDS
of rally increase.
We see a FULL FIGURE SHOT of TRAVIS: he is standing alone in
an opening near the fringes of the CROWD.
TRAVIS looks like the most suspicious human being alive.
His hair is cropped short, he wears mirror-reflecting
glasses.
His face is pallid and drained of color, his lips
are pursed and drawn tight.
He looks from side to side.
One can now see the full effect of TRAVIS' lack of sleep and
sufficient diet -- he looks sick and frail.
Even though it is a warm June day, TRAVIS is bundled up in a
shirt, sweater and Army jacket buttoned from top to bottom.
Under his jacket are several large lumps, causing his upper
torso to look larger than it should.
He is slightly hunched
over and his hands shoved into his pockets.
100.
Anyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon
TRAVIS and think, "There is an assassin."
TRAVIS pulls the vial of red pills from his pocket and
swallows a couple.
CUT TO:
SECRET SERVICE MAN standing beside the platform, scanning
the CROWD.
It is the same SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke
to at the first rally.
TOM, dressed in a conservative suit,
stands beside him.
PALANTINE is wrapping up his short speech:
PALANTINE
... and with your help we will go
on to victry at the polls Tuesday.
(applause)
TRAVIS begins moving up into the crowd.
PALANTINE (CONTD)
On to victory in Miami Beach next
month
(building applause)
and on to victory next November!
PALANTINE steps back, smiling and receiving the applause.
Then, nodding, at the SECRET SERVICE MAN he descends the
stairs and prepares to work his way through the CROWD.
TRAVIS unbuttons the middle two buttons of his jacket,
opening access to his holster.
With the other hand he
checks the .44 hooked behind his back.
PALANTINE smiles and shakes a few of the many hands
outstretched toward him.
The SECRET SERVICE MAN, scanning the CROWD, spots something
that interests him.
He looks closely.
SECRET SERVICE MAN'S P.O.V.: TRAVIS, his face intense,
pushes his way through the CROWD.
PALANTINE works his way through crowds and cameras.
SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN and
points in TRAVIS' direction.
TRAVIS slips his hand into his jacket.
101.
The SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN converges on TRAVIS from the
side.
TRAVIS and PALANTINE draw closer to each other.
SECRET SERVICE MAN, walking just behind PALANTINE, grabs the
candidate's hand and pulls him backward.
PALANTINE looks
sharply back at SECRET SERVICE MAN who motions for him to
take a slightly altered route.
TRAVIS sees this: his eyes meet the SECRET SERVICE MAN's.
He recognizes the situation.
To his right he spots the
SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN.
TRAVIS' eyes meet PALANTINE's: candidate and would-be
assassin exchange quick glances.
TRAVIS hastily works his way back through the CROWD.
He
hears the SECRET SERVICE MAN's voice call out:
SECRET SERVICE MAN
Detain that man!
