    His options dwindling, Dexter turns away and runs back down 
    the pier.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I don t have much time.  Or to be more 
                        accurate, my sister doesn t have much 
                        time.  He wants me to find them, but 
                        where do I look?  I can t think.  It s 
                      too bright.

    As Dexter races past, STOP on a harsh marina LIGHT, and the 
    screen FLARES TO WHITE --


    FLARE FROM WHITE to RUDY S pleased face.  The wind blows 
    back his hair, his eyes bright with anticipation as he 
    captains the yacht across open sea into the blackness of 
    night.  After a beat, he cuts the engine and hops down to --

    THE DECK, where he nonchalantly steps around the unconscious 
    body of DEBRA.  Her hands are bound behind her with duct 
    tape, her legs bound, as well.  Rudy unzips a large DUFFLE 
    BAG, his back to Debra.

    CLOSE ON DEBRA S FACE -- suddenly, her eyes open.  A split 
    second as she remembers where she is.            DEXTER 112     "Born Free"     Final Draft     10/13/06       2.

    How she came to be here.  Tears of humiliation, shame and, 
    of course, terror spring to her eyes.  

    Struggling against her bonds, she looks around for a weapon.  
    Rudy hears and looks over his shoulder, smiling pleasantly.

                                        RUDY
                      Let me know if the tape s too tight.  
                      No need to be uncomfortable.

                      Oh, I wouldn t want to spoil the 
                        surprise. 

    She strains to see what he s doing.  He notices.

                        Just checking supplies.  Things moved 
                        a little faster than I expected.

    DEBRA S POV- RUDY S DUFFLE BAG

    He digs through the bag, stuffed with clothes and personal 
    belongings, and pulls out deadly knives, a hacksaw.  Finds a 
    roll of duct tape.

                                        RUDY
                      Can never have enough of this.

    He separates the items into a pile.  

    BACK ON DEBRA, trying desperately to calm her fears.  To 
    think rationally.  A beat.

                                        DEBRA
                        This isn t you.

                      No.  There s more.  I ve seen it.

    He looks at her, sees her searching his face for the man she 
    loved.  Emotion, concern, begins to fill his expression.

    She sees a shred of humanity in him, recognizes the man she 
    fell in love with.  Clings to it.

                                        DEBRA

    His tone isn t cruel, just observational, but she realizes 
    he s acting.  She gets exactly how sick he really is.

    He shrugs, oh well, he tried.  His sweet expression vanishes 
    with sociopathic swiftness, and he turns back to his work.  

                                        RUDY
                        Nothing to be ashamed of, Deb.  You re

    She fights tears, not wanting to give him the satisfaction 
    of showing her hurt.

    rises from his desk, turns around, and surveys his place.  
    Desperation mounting.  And then Dexter seriously gets busy.

    In a SERIES OF CUTS, he rips apart his apartment... flips 
    through photo albums... pulls up cushions... yanks out 
    drawers.  Dexter turns his tidy home upside down searching 
    for a clue from Rudy, when suddenly he hears something very

                                        DEXTER
                        Rudy lied about a cut on his lip,
                        Angel head-butted his attacker in the 
                        face... it was just a wild hunch.

                        I couldn t crush Deb s love life on a 
                        hunch.  I had to get the facts.

                        Well here s the fucking facts -- if he 
                        kills her it s your fault.  Now what 
                        else do you know?

    Doakes angrily exits.  LaGuerta puts a hand on Dexter.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Call us if you hear anything.

    Dexter walks her to the front door.  HOLD on Dexter, who 
    watches her for a beat, then looks out at the sparkling bay.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      The truth is I wish they could help.  
                      But I prefer my sister alive, not in 
                        small bloodless pieces.  Rudy wants me 
                      to find him alone.

    As Dexter shuts the door on us --


    OVERHEAD SHOT - cargo cranes loom like abandoned Star Wars 
    props, overlooking acres of metal cargo containers.  Rows 
    upon rows of them creating a giant maze.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        It s in there somewhere.  My 
                        birthplace.  Now what?

    CRANE DOWN to find Dexter, next to his car, studying the 
    shipping yard from the other side of a chain-link fence.

    Dexter pops his trunk and pulls out a pair of BOLT CUTTERS.  
    As he heads to a secluded section of fence, his eyes search 
    the area for any sign of security.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.  With 
                        billions spent on homeland security, 
                      it can't be as easy as a couple snips.

    Dexter starts cutting.  He pauses -- no alarms sound. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      So much for the war on terror.

    He resumes cutting an opening.  A beat later, his CELL PHONE 
    RINGS.  Dexter quickly checks the caller I.D., which says: 
    RITA.  He presses IGNORE, puts his phone away, and continues 
    cutting.

                                        DEXTER S VOICE
                        Hello...  


    Rita, both annoyed and concerned, holds her phone to her 
    ear, watching ASTOR and CODY run around the front lawn.

    She shushes them and they run off.

                                        RITA
                        Okay, well... I guess I ll take them.  
                        This is so unlike you, Dexter.  I hope 
                        everything s alright.

    And she hangs up.  Off Rita, feeling something off -- 


    On the perimeter of the cargo containers, a DOCK MANAGER 
    talks to a TRUCK DRIVER, drinking coffee, shooting the shit.

    A STACK OF PALLETS

    Dexter peers out from behind the stack, eyeing a COMPUTER 
    that s mounted on a rolling stand, not far from the men.  
    Taking a chance, Dexter creeps out and rolls the computer 
    back behind the pallets.

    Out of view now, Dexterquickly punches in the ID code he 
    jotted down:  CBAN-3489. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)

                        I don t like this place.  Something 
                        nameless was born here.  Something 
                        that lives in the darkest hidey-hole
                      of the thing called Dexter.  

    He rounds a corner.  See numbers on the pavement in the low 
    400 range.  He s getting closer.  SLOW as we reach... 436.  
    Dexter stops in front of a REFRIGERATED CARGO CONTAINER, 
    with the same ID code, now faded and chipped, from the 
    photo.  

    His heart hammering, his breath rapid, Dexter steps closer 
    to the door and --

    DEXTER S POV-- THE CONTAINER DOOR

    It BURSTS open in SLOW MOTION.  Out steps --

    HARRY, 30s, in uniform.  He carries THREE-YEAR-OLD DEXTER, 
    wrapped in a blanket, clinging to him.  Harry walks toward 
    Dexter, standing in the middle of a living memory.  Harry s 
    face is grim, having just witnessed the most horrific thing 
    he s ever seen.  Harry calls to someone behind Dexter.

                                        HARRY
                      Get in there!  Somebody else get the 
                        hell in there now!

    Dexter turns... to see two parked patrol cars, circa 1973, 
    with LIGHTS flashing.  Three OFFICERS holding weapons have 
    taken up defensive positions behind their open doors.  On 
    Harry s command, one of them splits off and races into the 
    cargo box.

    Harry stops to comfort Little Dexter, right in front of 
    adult Dexter. 

                                        HARRY
                        It s alright, little guy.  You re safe 
                        now.  Nothing will hurt you -- I 
                        promise.

    Little Dexter wraps his arms around Harry s neck and holds 
    him tighter.  Dexter watches them walk away -- and VANISH.  
    Along with the patrol cars and officers.

    Dexter turns back to face the door again.  It s closed.  
    We re back to REALITY.  Dexter walks to the container door, 
    takes a breath --

                                        DEXTER

    -- and pulls it open.  What he sees shocks him.

    DEXTER S POV - INSIDE THE CONTAINER

    It's stacked to the ceiling with BANANAS.  

    BACK ON DEXTER

    His face falls at the sight of this completely dead end.

                                        DEXTER
                        Shit.

    Reeling, Dexter closes the container door, WIPING TO REVEAL 
    Doakes standing on the other side.

                        Surprise motherfucker.

    Doakes grabs Dexter and shoves him against a container.

    Dexter stares at Doakes evenly, too focused on Debra to 
    engage his usual disguise.

    Abruptly, Doakes PUNCHES Dexter in the gut, knocking him 
    back.  Doakes comes at him again, but Dexter dodges the blow 
    and displays some martial arts skill to strike Doakes, then 
    strikes him again.  As Doakes climbs to his feet he sees the 
    dark truth in Dexter s eyes --

    Before Dexter can respond, Doakes  phone PAGES him.  A beat 
    later, so does Dexter s.  As they reach for their pagers --


    Rudy pops open the trunk to REVEAL Debra inside, legs and 
    hands bound tightly, but kicking and bucking like a feral 
    animal -- and for good reason.  She s lying next to A DEAD 
    MAN.  The side of his head bloody and beaten.  The duct tape 
    covering Debra s mouth has come loose and it looks as if 
    she s vomited.

                                        DEBRA

    But duct tape cuts her off, as Rudy seals her mouth and 
    deftly wraps the duct tape around her entire head.

                      But you re drowning out Fred s radio.

    As the trunk hood CLOSES on Debra s wide-eyed face --


    Dexter pulls up to a Miami-style loft and exits his car.  A 
    small group of police cars and emergency vehicles are parked 
    outside.


    Rita weeds the base of the fruit tree Dexter planted for 
    her.  A shadow moves over her.  She looks up to find a man, 
    BOB HICKS, 40s, wearing khakis and a button-down shirt.  
    Respectable.  Kind face.  He smiles.

                                        BOB HICKS
                      The x-rays that the prison doctor took 
                      of Paul's head.  They showed a skull 
                        fracture.

                      No, you didn t.  After you struck him, 
                      the hospital took x-rays.  No 
                        fracture.  But in prison, fracture.

                        bash his own head against a wall to 
                      get what he wants.

    Rita just shakes her head, disgusted.  Starts for the front 
    door.  Bob follows.

                        Look, if Paul wasattacked -- the way 
                      it happened?  That takes experience. 
                        Skill.  No first-timer can pull that

                        Which is why Paul s accusation is so 
                        ludicrous.  Dexter spends all his time 
                      in a laboratory, for God s sake.

    Dexter pulls his car to a stop in front of a classic 1930s
    Florida bungalow, two bedrooms, simple but nostalgic.  No 
    other vehicles are in sight.

    Dexter gets out of his car, staring at the house.  Is this 
    where he once lived? As Dexter slowly walks up the front 
    lawn,distant CHILDREN S LAUGHTER echoes hauntingly in his 
    head, and Dexter transitions into another living memory.

                                        WOMAN S VOICE
                        Dexter!

    Dexter stops in the middle of the grass and looks ahead to 
    see LAURA MOSER, mid-20s, step out onto the porch.  Wearing 
    jeans and a Creedenceconcert T, she smiles playfully.

                                        LAURA
                      I m gonna find you!

    Laura steps off the porch and walks toward Dexter, standing 
    in the center of his own memory.  As she moves closer, 
    Dexter glances at her fingernails, glistening in the sun -- 
    each one painted a different color.

                                        LAURA
                        Let s see... where can he be?

    Dexter turns to see, right beside him... Little Dexter.  The 
    3-year-old gleefully crouches behind a tree.  Dexter studies 
    him for a beat, the joyful anticipation on his face.

                                        LAURA
                        Dexter?

    Laura walks right past our Dexter, not seeing him.  When she 
    gets close to the tree, Little Dexter jumps out -- 

                                        LITTLE DEXTER
                        Boo!

                      Now where s your brother hiding?

    Dexter reacts like he was gut punched, as he watches his 
    mini dopplegangerrun across the yard and point at a bush.

    LITTLE BRIAN, a beautiful 5-year-old, stands up behind the bush.

                                          LITTLE BRIAN
                        You re not supposed to tell her!

    Little Brian chases Little Dexter, who lets out a squeal and 
    runs away.  Little Brian catches Little Dexter and tackles him.  

                                        LITTLE BRIAN
                      Eat grass, Gumby!

    Little Brian grabs handfuls of grass and drops them on the 
    head of Little Dexter, who s laughing and spitting out grass.

                      You remember now?

    Instantly, the characters in the memory FADE.  Dexter, his 
    universe collapsing and folding into itself, turns to see 
    Rudy standing on the porch.

                                        DEXTER

    Rudy, who we ll now call BRIAN, nods happily.

    Dexter snaps out of his initial shock.

                                        DEXTER
                        Where s Deb?

                        She s fine.  I didn t want to begin 
                        without you.

    Not so sure about that, Dexter strides onto the porch, 
    pushing past Brian and entering --


    Dexter follows Brian, still carrying the knife, around the 
    back of the house to the DETACHED GARAGE.  Brian produces a 
    set of keys and unlocks the side door.  He throws his arm 
    around Dexter s shoulder like the big brother that he is --

                                        BRIAN
                        This is gonna be good.

    -- and guides Dexter inside.


    Doakes runs out and sees there s a TOOL SHED built against 
    the back of the garage where the back door would be.  He 
    races to the shed door.  It s padlocked from the outside.  A 
    WOOD PILE stacked in front of it.As Doakes rapidly clears 
    the wood pile to gain access --

                        breaking in from this side.

    Once he has a free path, he picks up a RUSTY AXE off the 
    ground -- and SWINGS, splintering the shed door.  A couple 
    blows and the latch with the lock falls away.  Holding his 
    gun, Doakes yanks open the door, goes in --

    IN THE SHED

    There s no sign of Brian.  Just some lawn mowers and a piece 
    of PLYWOOD on the dirt floor.  Instinctively, Doakes lifts 
    the plywood -- to reveal a DEEP HOLE in the dirt.

    Overhead, a HELICOPTER passes by, its SEARCHLIGHT probing 
    the woods.  TILT DOWN to find emergency vehicles and police 
    cars parked outside the bungalow, now a crime scene.  Debra, 
    wearing a borrowed EMT jacket, sits with a PARAMEDIC, who 
    flashes a penlight into her eyes.

                      He said he was having second thoughts

    They turn to see Debra, swimming in her large jacket, 
    clutching it around her shoulders, standing behind them.

                        You re questioning Dexter?  As what?  
                      AS WHAT?  A suspect?  Back the fuck 
                      off my brother!  He just saved my

                        every one of you to treat him that 
                        way, godammit.

    She can barely stand, she s shaking so much.  Dexter steps 
    over and puts an arm around her.  As he silently leads her 
    toward the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles --


    Rita cleans up the back yard, pulling the kids  toys off the 
    lawn -- balls, bikes, etc.  The phone RINGS.  The cordless 
    phone sits on a patio chair.  She hurries to it, answers --

    Dexter turns off the last light and sits on the bed.

                        After you get a good night s... Deb?

    Debra s back is to Dexter, but she hasn t moved.  He reaches 
    out and gently strokes her hair.

                                        DEXTER
                        Good night, sister.

    Through a small crack in the curtains, someone outside 
    watches the sweet tableau playing inside Dexter s bedroom.

                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


    Dexter lies sleeping on the couch, which he s made a comfy 
    bed.  He fell asleep with the TV on.  Some awful late-night 
    plays.  


    CLOSE on the doorknob.  HANDS deftly pick the lock.  TILT UP 
    to Brian.  He quietly opens the door and peers inside -- to 
    find Dexter asleep on the couch.


    Brian enters and stealthily moves to the couch.  He looks 
    down at the sleeping Dexter.  Threatening.  Ominous.  But 
    this isn t his prey tonight.  Assured that Dexter is asleep, 
    Brian turns down the hallway.  He reaches the bedroom and 
    gently pushes open the door.        DEXTER 112     "Born Free"     Final Draft     10/13/06       52.




    Brian sees Debra still asleep, her naked leg and arm still 
    protruding from under the sheets, sexy and vulnerable.  With 
    a smile, Brian steps to the bed and pulls out his KNIFE.

    He glances out the door, where he has an eye-line to Dexter 
    on the couch, still asleep.  Satisfied, Brian raises the 
    knife -- and PLUNGES it through Debra s heart.  Strangely, 
    Debra s leg rolls off the bed and THUDS to the floor.  With 
    a frown, Brian yanks back the covers to REVEAL --

    -- prosthetic LEGS, ARMS, and a HEAD artfully laid out, with 
    a pillow in the middle, to look like a woman asleep.  Before 
    Brian can react -- a GARROTE swiftly wraps around his neck.  
    Dexter stands behind him pulling it tight.

                                        DEXTER
                        Stopped by your prosthetics lab.  Your 
                        work s so good you fooled yourself.

    Brian tries to fight but can t shake Dexter s powerful hold.  
    Losing air, Brian falls to his knees.

                                        DEXTER
                        I know, it s not as elegant as your 
                        blood choke technique -- Deb told me 
                        about that at the hospital.  Where 
                        she s sleeping tonight.  But I can t 
                        afford any mistakes with you.

    Dexter pulls tighter -- and Brian passes out.

    Dexter crosses the lawn toward his car.

    Rita carries the plastic garbage bag out the back door to 
    the side yard.

                        Sometimes I wonder what it would be 
                        like.  For everything inside me that s 
                        denied and unknown to be revealed.

    When she reaches the open trash container, Rita dumps the 
    kitchen garbage inside.  When she closes the lid, she sees 
    fallen behind the trash container... PAUL S SHOE.

                      in hiding.  My survival depends on it.

    Off Rita s shock --


    A CRANE SHOT of a crowd scene.  A much larger gathering of 
    police cars and emergency vehicles are outside, with more 
    MEDIA MEMBERS and satellite news trucks than we ve ever seen 
    on this show.  Off to the side, Lt. Pascal briefs a crowd of 
    reporters around her.

    FIND Dexter pulling his blood kit from the trunk of his car.  
    He closes the trunk and turns to see... Debra pull up behind 
    him.  Dexter stops and watches Debra, IN SLOW MOTION, exit 
    her car.

                      on his carcass.  Mourn him.

    Debra sees Dexter, smiles bravely, and heads over to him.

    When she reaches Dexter s side, they wordlessly fall in step 
    and head toward the entrance of the loft.

                      My tragedy is that I killed the one

                      But I m the only one who mourns him.  

    Dexter looks around at the press, the uniform officers, the 
    forensic techs.A handful of them steal glances at the 
    brother and sister.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)

                      if they knew I was the one who drained 
                      him of his life.

    A COP turns toward Dexter and calls out --

                        Good job in there, Dex!  You sliced 
                      him up good.

    The Cop starts clapping.  An EMT starts clapping, too.

    clap.

                      In fact, deep down, I m pretty sure 
                        they d appreciate a lot of my work.

    Pedestrian bystanders join in the applause, including a

    facing Dexter and Debra, applauding and cheering.

    Debra flashes a smile and proudly raises Dexter s hand into 
    the air like a prizefighter.  CONFETTI and STREAMERS start 
    to fall from the heavens.  Dexter raises his head skyward in
