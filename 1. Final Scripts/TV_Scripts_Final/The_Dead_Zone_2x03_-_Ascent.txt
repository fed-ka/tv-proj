                                              "ASCENT"

          RECAP

          We see the action from the previous week's episode.  Walt
          and Sarah's marriage is in crisis (and we should see a
          clip of the opening scene outside the movie theater which
          we will replay in a new fashion later in this episode). 
          Four kids became trapped in a copper mine which belonged
          to Johnny's family.  Walt and Johnny rescued the kids,
          but Walt was seriously injured.  The last shot we see:
          Johnny touches Sarah and has a vision of Walt in a coffin.

          A CAT SCAN IMAGE IS DISPLAYED AGAINST A LIGHT BOARD.  ITS
          SHADES OF GRAY ARE UNDECIPHERABLE TO ALL EXCEPT...

                                        DR. GIBSON (O.S.)
                        The surgery went well.  Dr. Shaw
                        and I drained the blood from the
                          subdural hematoma.  And he's
                        responding to the corticosteroids.

          A finger points out a small slightly-paler crescent shape.

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                        That's where the hematoma was?

                                        DR. GIBSON (O.S.)
                        Yeah.  I forget you've had some
                        experience with this sort of thing. 
                        Anyway, the swelling is going
                        down, but we'll have to keep a
                        close eye on him.


          INT. WALT'S HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

          Sarah stands at Walt's bedside (Note: We haven't seen
          Walt yet) with DR. GIBSON.

                        The good news is he's breathing
                        on his own and there's no sign of
                          permanent injury to the brain
                          tissue... on film at least.

          Dark circles are forming under Sarah's eyes.  She's running
          on caffeine, not much food and even less sleep.  She's
          been through this before so when she asks the next question
          it is with a dread of the potential answer:

                                        SARAH
                          Shouldn't he be waking up? 

                                        DR. GIBSON
                                (sympathetic)
                          Sarah... he's in a coma.

          Off Sarah's reaction...


  22INT. HOSPITAL - FAMILY WAITING ROOM - EVENING

          JOHNNY has his long legs folded under him as he sits
            uncomfortably at a short coffee table.  He and BRUCE are
          playing SORRY, a ragged board game from the hospital's
            well-used collection, with Little Johnny.  J.J. rolls the
          dice and moves.  He lands on one of Bruce's pieces and
          sends it back home.

                                        BRUCE
                        Not again.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                                  (delighted)
                        Sorry!

                                        JOHNNY
                        The kid's ruthless, Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Loaded dice, man.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        No they're not.

                                        BRUCE
                        Oh no?  You callin' me a liar?

          Bruce playfully gives J.J. some shit.  J.J. LAUGHS.  Johnny
          stares at J.J. for a moment, wondering if the boy will
          ever be this carefree again.  Wondering if it's his fault.

          Sarah enters.

                                        SARAH
                        Hey.

          Little Johnny looks up hopefully.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        Can I see dad?

          Sarah takes a deep breath, pulls a chair over and sits

          down across from him.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah, of course you can.  But, I
                        need to talk to you first.
                                (glances at Johnny)
                        After your dad got hurt the other
                        night, the doctors helped him...
                        get better.  They did everything
                        they could for now.  But, he needs
                        to do some more mending himself
                        so he's, he's... still sleeping.

          Sarah looks up and meets Johnny's eyes. 

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        When will he wake up?  We've got
                        a game on Sunday.

                                        SARAH
                        Well then let's hope for Sunday.

          Bruce and Johnny exchange a glance.  Sarah gives Little
          Johnny a brave smile.


  33INT. WALT'S HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

          Dr. Gibson is there as Sarah and Little Johnny enter...
          Bruce and Johnny behind them, hanging back by the door. 
          Little Johnny approaches the bed.  Dr. Gibson joins him*
          with her best bedside manner smile.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        I know the bandages might look a
                        little scary, but he's still just
                        your dad underneath... and I'm
                        sure he'd love to hear your voice.


          CLOSE ON LITTLE JOHNNY

          and his eyes can't disguise the stunning impact as we
          move to reveal Walt; his face is bruised; his shoulder
          and ribs are wrapped.  A large white bandage is on his
          head.

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY*
                                (affected)
                        Hey, dad...*

          ON JOHNNY

          at the door watching this heartbreaking scene, knowing
          Walt is going to die.  Gibson moves to him to give Sarah
          and the boy some private moments with Walt...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sotto, to the doc)
                        Can I talk to you?

          They move out to the corridor with Bruce... we stay a
          beat with:

                                        LITTLE JOHNNY
                        You really think he can hear us,
                        Mom?

                                        SARAH
                        Yes, I really do.


  44INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Bruce, Johnny and Gibson... talking quietly... in mid-
            conversation...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hear me out.  There was this great
                        kid, a hockey player, I touched
                        him and I just knew he had a heart
                          condition... I saw something a
                        doctor couldn't see.  Maybe I can
                        do it again.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Do what again, Johnny?  We've
                        identified his injuries.  We've
                        done everything for him we know
                        how to do...

                                        JOHNNY*
                        Doc, if we don't do something,*
                        he's going to die.  I've seen it.*

    4CONTINUED:4

          That thought lingers in their eyes as Sarah and Little
          Johnny come out of the room... Sarah maintaining her brave
          smile...

                                        SARAH
                        We can visit him tomorrow,
                        sweetie... they'll call us if he
                        wakes up before then...

          But she sees the impromptu conference taking place in the
          hallway, her eyes connect with Johnny's and the doctor's;
          she didn't hear the death line but she knows something's
          up...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Mrs. Bannerman, could we have a
                        minute with you?

          But it's hard to talk with the child there... and Bruce
          comes to the rescue... he takes Little Johnny by the
          hand...

                                        BRUCE
                        Come on, Johnny... you owe me a
                        rematch... and I'm checkin' your*
                        sleeves this time...*

          They move away... off Sarah's look...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Johnny wants permission to use*
                        his powers to... diagnose Walt.*

          Sarah looks curiously at Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I might find out something that
                        could help... I can't promise
                          anything but...

          And Sarah can almost sense that they're not telling her
            everything...

                                        SARAH
                        Do you know?  Do you know what's
                        going to happen to him?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lying)
                        No.

          She knows he's lying because he hasn't been able to lie
          to her for thirty years.  And he knows she knows.  A lump
          forms in her throat, making it hard to swallow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just think I should try.

          Their eyes connect for a long beat...

                                        SARAH
                        Okay.

          Dr. Gibson finally nods.


  55INT.  WALT'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny's eyes are fixed on Walt, who has EEG leads attached
          to his head.

                        I've never seen him so still.

          Sarah and Dr. Gibson are standing a little further back,
          as if to give Johnny room to work.

                        I know.  Seems like he's always
                        in motion.

          Dr. Gibson is at a bit of a loss.  It's hard for a board-
            certified physician to hand over the reins to a psychic.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Do you need me to do anything--

          Johnny shakes his head silently as he reaches out and
          grasps Walt's hand.  RAMP TO HIS FACE...


  66INT. MINE SHAFT - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny finds himself standing in a familiar mine shaft
          (from "Descent").  It's dark, damp and spooky.  He looks
          around in disbelief.  He's surrounded by mumbling,
            incomprehensible, whispering LOW PITCHED VOICES... a dozen
          overlapping conversations we can't quite hear... The CAMERA
          zips around him in a dizzying 180, showing us that he
          stands in a central area in the mine.  Several dark
          pathways branch off from here.

  1414RESUME JOHNNY - INT. WALT'S HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

          Johnny stumbles back, still deflecting vision boulders,
          as he breaks the connection.  Walt lies still; no change. 
          Dr. Gibson steadies Johnny.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        You okay?

          Johnny shakes his head.  He's not.  He can barely stand. 
          Dr. Gibson helps him sit.

          Johnny gets it together, but he holds his temples and
          looks like he's still in extreme pain.

                        was just trying to hold onto my

                        But I didn't find a way... I can't

                        Are you sure?

          Sarah and Johnny look to her...  Dr. Gibson RIPS a piece
          of paper off of a monitoring device.  It's the wavy line
          of Walt's EEG.  Johnny and Sarah look at the EEG.  The
          line is a small steady series of bumps until it spikes. 
            Foothills meet Everest.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        This spike is you, Johnny.  It's
                        the moment you touched him.

          Johnny's head is buried in his hands, but he looks up
          hesitantly.

                        I did that?  How?

                        I have no idea.  But this is the
                        first -- and only -- good sign
                        we've had.

                          I finally got him home to bed. 
                        Mrs. Clark is staying with him. 
                        She'll call me when he wakes up.
                                (Johnny acknowledges)
                        And... I've been waking up the
                        top neurosurgeons all over New
                          England.  Amazingly enough, I
                        happen to have the home phone
                        numbers of every coma specialist

                        Again.

          An ironic memory passes through the room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The doc's given me the green light

          And this is getting just a little too close to other things
          in their lives so she quickly moves the conversation back

                        Dr. Gibson says it's too soon to

                        really, really cold.  I guess I'm
                        just a psychic bucket of ice where
                        Walt's concerned.

                        on?

                                        SARAH
                          Nothing's going on.

                        You pick a movie starring The
                        Rock for us to go to and you don't
                        think something's going on...

          He stops and looks at her and then away... studying lights
          of the village... this isn't easy for him...

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Or the dozens of other little
                        things.  Like the surprise lunch
                        dates in the middle of the week. 
                        And watching an entire football
                        game with me and J-J...

                                        SARAH
                        Well, I'm sorry.  I'll try to
                        make more time to ignore you both.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        ...At the same time, the evening
                        phone calls with Johnny Smith

                                        SARAH
                        I had to marry a cop.

          She takes a beat to frame an explanation, an honest
            dishonest one she can live with.

                        We're taking time.  Trying to
                        figure out how we fit into each
                        other's lives... or if we even
                        do.


  2727CLOSE ANGLE ON JOHNNY/WALT

          Losing Sarah.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Funny cause right now, it seems
                        to me you're trying awfully hard
                        to figure out how you fit into
                        our life.  

          And as he looks at her a beat, CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE OFF
          HIS FACE TO REVEAL that we're no longer on the street but
          in... 


          INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY

          As seen in earlier subjective flash; this time: Johnny/Walt
          stands at an automated soup/coffee/cocoa machine.  He
          sniffs the steaming cup the machine dispenses and grimaces. 
          He turns and finds himself face to face with Sarah.  She
          looks tired but she's still radiant.  Johnny/Walt is
          smitten.  She catches him staring, smiles at him for the
          very first time.  A magic moment!

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                          Careful.  I just got a tomato
                        soup with half and half.

          Sarah, the hospital veteran, pushes a sticky button on
          the machine several times.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.  The half and half button
                        sticks so you need to clear
                        everything first.

          Sarah waits for Johnny/Walt to move, but he doesn't. 
          Sarah finally looks at Johnny/Walt... really looks at
          him. She may be sitting vigil for her coma-bound love,
          but there's something about this tall, reserved guy that
          she likes.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT ONE - REV. 11/04/02 GRN       16.


    27CONTINUED:27

                                        SARAH
                        I'm just gonna... try for some
                        coffee here.

          Johnny/Walt shakes it off and steps out of her way.  He
          walks back to a table where his father is waiting for
          him.  This is JOE BANNERMAN, Walt's father.  He has
          thinning gray hair and twinkling brown eyes.  A man whose
          laugh lines most likely come from a lifetime of teasing
          pretty girls.


          ANGLE ON JOHNNY/WALT AND JOE:

          Johnny/Walt sits down; he's still smiling...

                                        JOE
                        What's with the face?

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        I just met the most beautiful
                        woman.

          Joe watches Sarah get her coffee.  He frowns.

                                        JOE
                        Yeah, she's something all right. 
                        I've seen her here before.  She's
                        got a fella in a coma.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Oh yeah?

                                        JOE
                        Girl's got baggage, Wally.

          Walt looks over in Sarah's direction, but instead of seeing
          her, we SWISH PAN TO:


  27A27AINT. HOSPITAL - ROOM

          We look through a doorway into Johnny's coma room.  Sarah
          is sitting silent vigil near the foot of Johnny's bed (we
          don't see Johnny).  Sarah's strength is wavering; a tear
          rolls down her face.  Gene Purdy is there; he comforts
          her.

          As we pull back for a wider view, we see...

          INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

          Johnny/Walt is walking down the hospital hallway when he
          notices the door marked "Smith, J"

          Johnny/Walt pauses in the doorway when he sees Sarah inside
          crying.  Sarah and Purdy don't see him.

          CLOSE ON: Johnny/Walt.

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                        I got a call for Sarah Bracknell
                        today.  A wake up call. 

          And move to reveal that Johnny/Walt is now in...          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT ONE - REV. 11/04/02 GRN       17.


  2828INT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Seen earlier in subjective pov.  The kitchen is shadowed. 
            Everything's in its place.  Sarah sits at the kitchen
          table staring into her empty coffee cup.  Johnny/Walt has
          just entered, sits with her at the table.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        What're you talking about?

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny woke up.

          Johnny/Walt is stunned.  He's literally at a loss for
          words.  In that instant, we realize no one thought Johnny
          was ever going to wake up.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Is he okay?  I mean... functioning?
                        Does he remember things?

                                        SARAH
                          Apparently, he remembers
                          everything.  Like it was yesterday.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Oh...

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah...

          Silence for a beat or two. 

                                        SARAH
                        How can I face him? 


  2929EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF JOHNNY/WALT 

          losing Sarah as he takes that in... he doesn't know how
          to answer, but he can feel the tectonic plates of his
          life shifting.  Johnny/Walt exhales...

                                        JOE (O.S.)
                        Sounds like Sarah's havin' second 
                          thoughts.

          ...as we move to reveal he's now sitting in...

          INT. WALT'S PATROL CAR - DAY

          As seen earlier in a subjective flash.  Johnny/Walt shifts
          out of park as if he'd like to rip the gearstick out and
          beat someone with it.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Dad, she's in shock.  Hell, we
                        both are.  Her old boyfriend just
                        came out of a six-year coma.

          Johnny/Walt looks up at Joe, who's sitting in the passenger
          seat.

                                        JOE
                        Wally, he's not just some
                        boyfriend.  They were engaged. 
                          Childhood sweethearts and all
                        that. 

          Johnny/Walt pulls out and soon we see that they're driving
          along a picturesque wooded road.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        This isn't really helping. 

                                        JOE
                        No.  It's the kind of help you
                        don't want.  It's the truth. 
                        During the war, a lotta men didn't
                        come home, but their wives never
                        got bodies or... whaddya call
                        it... closure.

                        What's your point?

                                        JOE
                        Her feelings for this fella never
                        died.  She tied 'em up in a ribbon
                        and put 'em in a drawer. 

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        But, I know she loves me.

                                        JOE
                        Ayuh.  Pregnant girl.  No
                        boyfriend.  'Course she loved
                        you.  You rode in like a knight

          CLOSE ON JOHNNY/WALT'S FACE: Joe's words are playing on

          ANGLE PAST JOHNNY/WALT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

          to see they're driving into a tunnel... as the darkness
          swallows them up....


  3030INT. MINE TUNNEL - DARK - FINDING JOHNNY

          dressed in his own clothes... standing as he was in his
          first time here... in an intersection of tunnels... the
          chorus of weird, spooky mumbling, whispering voices
          surrounding him again... he's disoriented... uncertain of
          what's happening...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (calling)
                        Walt?

          His voice echoes.  No response.  Just those damn mumbling,
          whispering voices we can't quite hear clearly... and now
          Johnny reacts as he sees --


          NEW ANGLE - JOHNNY IN FOREGROUND

          EERY TENDRILS OF LIGHT DRIFT DOWN THE TUNNEL TOWARDS HIM

          Johnny's face is bathed in the warm, glow of the light. 
          Fascinated, he watches it approach.  It forms a wall which
          shimmers like a silk curtain in a breeze.  And as it
          touches him we may be surprised to see his face blossom
          into unmistakable pleasure - the light feels good - almost
          sexual - as it wraps itself around him... embracing him... 
          DAMN, THIS FEELS GOOOOD... Johnny reaches out and touches
          the wall.  He reacts as if he's just touched a new texture
          of sea creature; he's fascinated, delighted and a bit
            repulsed.  And then Johnny feels his arm being pulled in. 
          He frowns.  It's like a vertical wall of quicksand trying
          to suck him in.          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT ONE - 10/24/02 WHITE          20.

          The NURSE pulls Johnny's hand away from Walt's arm.  Johnny
          JERKS AWAKE.  He's nearly hyperventilating.  His eyes
          blink rapidly as if he can't wake up fully.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why... why'd you pull me out?

          Before anyone answers... blood starts to spill out of one
          nostril... his hand instinctively dabs it... he sees the
          blood on his hand and on his reaction... as medics move

          He seems to be lying down in a dark tunnel.

                                        SARAH
                        The doctor says the swelling's
                          actually going down.  He should
                        be waking up...

                                        PURDY
                        But he's not.

          She shakes her head.

                                        PURDY
                        We've been through this before,
                        you and I.
                                (sighs)
                        What can I say, Sarah...

                                        SARAH
                        I wish you could say "April Fools".

    34CONTINUED:34

          And that's a genuine offer from a man who knows people
          and knows Sarah is carrying a lot of guilt right now... 
          does he suspect what's been going on between her and
          Johnny?  You bet.  But all he cares about right now is
          helping her through a crisis.  She acknowledges with
            appreciation.

          Johnny comes out of the cat scan room... wearing a hospital
          gown that opens in the back... he's holding it closed
          behind him... Purdy reacts to seeing him in a gown...

                                        JOHNNY

                        We've put a man on the moon but
                        still haven't come up with a
                          hospital gown that doesn't
                        completely humiliate you. 

                                        SARAH
                        How do you feel?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was just a bloody nose... I
                        don't know why everyone's so...

                                        PURDY
                                (reacts)
                          A bloody nose?  As a consequence
                        of what...?

                        When he touches Walt, Johnny's
                        visions -- they seem to stimulate
                        Walt's brain...

          But before Purdy can react, Gibson comes out of her control*
          room with results...

          Johnny's calm voice brings everyone back to the big issue.

                        His EEG shows lighter sleep

                        come down and his heart rate is
                        good.  I can't explain why it's
                        helping... but it is.

          That reminds Johnny of --

          Johnny moves away.  Off reactions...


  3535INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny is in a stall behind closed swinging doors as Purdy
            enters...

                                        PURDY
                        Can we talk about this?

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        I saw the light, Gene.

                                        PURDY
                        The light?

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        The white light.

          He comes out, buttoning his shirt...

                        I'm seeing the world he's living
                        in... or the world his mind thinks
                        he's living in.  The light is
                        waiting for him and it's pretty
                        damn attractive, Gene.  I'm going
                        to do everything in my power to
                        keep him away from it.

                        With all due respect, I don't
                        want you anywhere near that white
                        light.  You came a little too
                        close to death yourself not long
                        ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can't stop me.  Not on this
                        one.

                        I know why you're doing this,
                        Johnny.

          Johnny pauses and studies Purdy.  A long beat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then you know I have to do it.

          And exits.   Off Purdy's concerned reaction...


  3636INT. HOSPITAL - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          As before, this time Purdy and Sarah watch through the
          window as the equipment is hooked up to Johnny and Walt,
          who are once again lying side by side.


  3737WITH JOHNNY AND WALT

          as the technician gives him the nod... Johnny reaches out
          and takes Walt's hand... and as they touch, RAMP TO THE
          HANDS... WHICH MORPH INTO:

          One feminine, one masculine.  The grip is tight. And

    38CONTINUED:38

          Moving to reveal a bright maternity room.  There is a
          buzz of activity.  Sarah is in bed with her draped legs
          up in stirrups. 

          Johnny/Walt sits holding her hand beside her as the female
          DOCTOR guides Sarah through the final stage of labor. 

                                        DOCTOR
                        Now.  Push.

            Johnny/Walt's hand is squeezed to the bone as Sarah PUSHES
          for all she's worth.  The doctor grins in triumph as she
          pulls the baby all the way out and clips the umbilical.

          A NURSE steps forward to clean the baby up.  She holds it
          up for Johnny/Walt and Sarah to see.

                                        DOCTOR
                        You've got a handsome little boy.

          Sarah SMILES radiantly.  Johnny/Walt looks from the baby
          back to her.  His smile hinges on hers.


          ANGLE ON JOHNNY/WALT AND SARAH: AS THE BABY IS LAID IN
          SARAH'S ARMS.

                                        DOCTOR
                        Do you have a name picked out?

          Sarah looks to Johnny/Walt.  Johnny/Walt speaks for them
          both.

    40CONTINUED:40

          And Johnny/Walt turns, taking us into a scene with Sarah
          and they're -- 


          EXT. CLEAVES MILLS STREET - NIGHT

          Through the rain, a movie theater comes into view.  It's
          the same street seen earlier, but now it's 1995.  The
          marquee reads "Il Postino".  And Sarah is eight months
            pregnant.  They're walking together under an umbrella...

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                        The doctor told me he's as good
                        as dead.  As hard as it is, I
                        have to accept that.  And I'm
                        trying to, Walt...

          And it sure seems to Johnny/Walt that she's trying to
          reach out to him, opening a door... he looks at her with
          moonstruck eyes...

                                        SARAH
                        I just want you to know that. 

          As in: 'don't give up on me'.  She smiles that magical
          smile... but for a rough and tumble cop, he's awkward,
            uncertain how to appropriately proceed...

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Sarah, I know it hasn't been very
                        long but the time we've spent
                          together... 

                                        SARAH
                        You've been the best friend anyone
                        could ever have in a situation
                        like this...
                                (grin, re: her belly)
                          ...especially a situation like
                        this... I don't know many other
                        men who would've wanted to...

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                                (overlapping, simply,
                                  honestly)
                        I'm not like other men, Sarah. 

                                        SARAH
                                (beat)
                        No.  You're not.

          And that is a simple exchange but it carries the weight
          of Sarah realizing how much he's come to mean to her.  


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT TWO - 10/24/02 WHITE          28.


    40CONTINUED: (2)40

                                        SARAH
                        I don't know what I would've done
                        without you. 

          He studies her and decides to take the chance... he leans
          into her and softly kisses her for the first time... it's
          short but awfully nice... Sarah feels the tug of two
            worlds... but she doesn't pull away...

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        I've been dreaming of that since
                        that first moment I saw you at
                        the coffee machine.

                                        SARAH
                        I know.

          He kisses her again - longer this time - and now he puts
          his arms gently around her and this is everything he ever
          hoped it would be... right here in the rain... with people
          walking by... and it's incredibly romantic...


    4141CLOSE-UP ON THE TWO FACES

          And we begin to turn 360 degrees... and this becomes an
          incredible kiss... because it tells a story just by the
          setting... because now she's wearing a wedding gown and
          we hear people clapping... and now they're naked (this is
          still just a close-up of two faces) and we hear a baby
          crying from another room... and now their kiss breaks and
          we stay on Johnny/Walt's close-up as we LOSE SARAH and
          Johnny/Walt reacts as he hears...

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        I was in a car accident.  Six
                        years ago.

                        I was leaving my fiancee's house. 
                        And I was in a coma for six years.

          ...looking at Sarah... who's at her jewelry box and this
          is just a few weeks ago... she opens A CLEAR PLASTIC EGG
          (the kind you get out of a gumball machine) and takes out
          a small plastic trinket ring.  (NOTE: This is the ring
          Johnny won for her at the fair).  Sarah stares at the
          ring.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        What's that?

          She looks up, surprised at being caught, laughs...

                                        SARAH
                          Nothing.  Just an old keepsake. 
                        I don't know what it's doing in
                        here... 

          She puts it away and casually closes the drawer as...

                        died.  She tied 'em up in a ribbon
                        and put 'em in a drawer.

                        you.  You rode in like a knight
                        in shinin' armor.  Now she's not

                        No, I suppose not.  I'm like the
                        dream that slips out of memory
                        when you wake up.  No one really
                        wants to remember meeting me.

          He turns a corner to find Walt standing mesmerized by the
          wall of light -- it's a virtual recreation of Johnny's
          vision at the end of Act One: Walt's face is bathed in
          the warm, glow of the light.  Fascinated, he watches it
            approach.  It shimmers like a silk curtain in a breeze. 
          And as it touches him, his face blossoms into unmistakable
          pleasure...

          as he remembers... and we move to find Johnny and Walt
          standing in...


          INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY

          The scene we've seen before.  It's the night Walt first
          met Sarah in the hospital cafeteria.  Sarah is at the
            machines, Joe is sitting at a table...

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, I remember.  My dad and I
                        were visiting Grandma Helen after
                        her stroke.  We came in here for
                        coffee.  That's when I saw her...
                        and it was one of those things,
                        you know... I knew... I knew from
                        the moment I saw her...

          Sarah walks in the door and moves toward the machines... 

                                        WALT
                        They say people don't fall in
                        love at first sight... don't you
                        believe it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Talk to her, Walt... go talk to
                        her...

                                        WALT

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure you can... who's stopping
                        you?

          Walt looks at Johnny... exchanges a look with his dad...

          he moves tentatively into the scene, seamlessly joining
          it in progress, like a perfect entrance into a stage
          production. 

          Walt gets his soup then turns.  Sarah looks tired but
          she's still radiant.  Walt is smitten.  She catches him
          staring, smiles at him for the very first time.  A magic
          moment!

                                        WALT
                          Careful.  I just got a tomato
                        soup with half and half.

          Sarah, the hospital veteran, pushes a sticky button on
          the machine several times.

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.  The half and half button
                        sticks so you need to clear
                        everything first.

          Sarah waits for Walt to move, but he doesn't.  Sarah
          finally looks at Walt... really looks at him.  She may be
          sitting vigil for her coma-bound love, but there's
            something about this tall, reserved guy that she likes.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm just gonna... try for some
                        coffee here.

                        want to get him upset at a time

                        To be honest, I'm a little
                          surprised that you of all people
                        would be trying to bring him back.

                        It's nice to know you can be
                        surprised.

                                        JOE
                          Sometimes the right thing is just
                        to let them go... find peace...

                        I know Walt.  Trust me.  He
                          wouldn't like peace.  

          Walt walks back to the table.  Joe seamlessly turns to
          Walt and continues the scene from memory.  Walt doesn't
          even seem to notice Johnny.

                        I've seen her here before.  She's
                        got a fella in a coma.

  5050EXTREME CLOSE-UP ON WALT

                                        SARAH (O.S.)
                        I got a call for Sarah Bracknell
                        today.  A wake up call.

          And move to reveal that Walt is now in...


          INT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Seen earlier.  Sarah sits at the kitchen table staring
          into her empty coffee cup.  Walt has just entered, sits
          with her at the table.  Johnny and Joe stand there
            observing...

                                        WALT
                        What're you talking about?

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny woke up.

          Walt is stunned.  He's literally at a loss for words.

                                        JOE
                          Remember how you felt at that
                        moment, Wally?

          And we could discuss freezing action in scenes as dialogue
            continues with Johnny and Joe and Walt but I'd just as
          soon not -- we can just lose Sarah in a new angle and see
          Walt sitting at the table with Joe and Johnny behind him...
          but Walt should not look directly at Joe or Johnny; he
          should be looking at the scene...

                                        WALT
                        Like my world was coming to an
                        end.

                                        JOE
                        But who could blame her... she
                        loved Johnny her whole life...
                        she even kept that ring he gave
                        her the night of the accident...

          And this time, it's perfectly acceptable to use Joe as
          our transition device... moving from his close-up into...

          Walt enters, looking at Sarah... at her jewelry box just

          a few weeks ago... she opens A CLEAR PLASTIC EGG (the
          kind you get out of a gumball machine) and takes out a
          small plastic trinket ring.  (NOTE: This is the ring Johnny
          won for her at the fair).  Sarah stares at the ring.

                                        WALT
                        What's that?

          She looks up, surprised at being caught, laughs...

                                        SARAH
                          Nothing.  Just an old keepsake. 
                        I don't know what it's doing in
                        here... 

          She puts it away and casually closes the drawer... as we
          lose Sarah and Walt stares at the drawer... talks to Johnny
          and Joe...

                        We could always tell each other
                          everything... and now suddenly
                        we're avoiding the truth... 
                        pretending that life is normal...
                        while a big pink elephant sits in

          Joe glances with a moment of triumph at Johnny --

                        What about her kiss, Walt... is
                        that worth giving up?  Remember
                        just one kiss... the touch of her

  5252CLOSE ON WALT AS HE SMILES

          and we hear the rain and turn into the scene...


          EXT. CLEAVES MILLS STREET - NIGHT

          We hear the rain.  It's 1995.  The marquee reads "Il
            Postino".  Walt and Sarah (eight months pregnant) walk
          along under an umbrella... Johnny and Joe watch from a
          few yards away... they're under an umbrella too; yeah,
          it's silly but strange things happen in the mind...

                                        SARAH
                        I don't know what I would've done
                        without you. 

          Walt studies her and decides to take the chance... he
          leans into her and softly kisses her for the first time...
          it's short but awfully nice... Sarah feels the tug of two
            worlds... but she doesn't pull away...

                                        WALT
                        I've been dreaming of that since
                        that first moment I saw you at
                        the coffee machine.

                                        SARAH
                        I know.

          He kisses her again - longer this time - and now he puts
          his arms gently around her and this is everything he ever
          hoped it would be... right here in the rain... with people
          walking by... and it's incredibly romantic...

                                        JOE
                        Human nature is so predictable. 
                        And ultimately so irrelevant.

                        And nothing in between counts?

                                        JOE
                        Not to me.

                                (sighs)
                        Look at them -- two lost souls
                        who find each other in a time of
                        adversity.  It's a real heart-
                        tugger.  Let them go... a few
                        extra seconds together won't
                        matter.

          Johnny studies the old man... they're now alone in the
          rain...

                        You don't sound like any part of
                        Walt.  I don't think you're a
                        figment of his imagination.

                        Maybe I'm a figment of yours.

                        it has to be over soon, John.

                        I think that's up to Walt, isn't

                        All this back and forth... You're

                        I don't want him getting upset. 
                        He has to accept that it's his
                        time.

                        came.  He called me.  In a manner
                        of speaking.  This would have

                        This... attempt... is all very

                        life... frankly I got tired of
                        waiting...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't have to wait any more...  

                                        JOE
                                (beat, sly)
                        You're right about that, John. 
                        But I'm not in the trading
                          business.

            Suddenly, bright interactive light strikes Joe's face
          from above - it might be lightning from an approaching
            thunderstorm but we suspect not... it's too sustained...
          too eerie...

                                        JOE
                        You see John, the stress on your
                        body right now is far greater
                        than anyone understands... they
                        don't make machines that can
                        monitor what's happening inside
                        you.  This excursion with Wally...
                        it was a nice opportunity for us  
                        to renew our friendship... that's
                        why I let it continue... that's
                        why I let you think you might
                        just be able to take Walt with
                        you... but the truth is, all this
                        time, he's been taking you with
                        him...
                                (beat)
                        And now there's no going back,
                        John.  For either of you.

          Joe puts a sympathetic hand on Johnny's shoulder and on
          his touch... we hear a shrill sound....  BEEEEEEEEP...


  5353INT. WALT'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

          THE SHRILL MECHANICAL ALARM CONTINUES.  Johnny lurches. 
          The alarm is his respiratory monitor.

  5454INT. WALT'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

          A nurse is bagging Johnny, helping him breathe.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                          Separate them. 

          The technician struggles to unwrap Johnny's grip on Walt
          but it's iron clad... as though hanging on for dear life...

                                        TECHNICIAN
                        I can't...

          RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE...


  5555EXT. CLEAVES MILLS STREET - NIGHT

          Johnny finds himself alone on the deserted street... Joe
          has disappeared... the sustained white light from above
          that we saw at the end of the last scene here is increasing
          in intensity... Johnny shields his eyes from the brightness
          as he tries to see what it is... and it is an extraordinary
          sight:


          WIDER

          Johnny in the foreground... as the street and all the
            buildings seem to spring "leaks" of light, splitting
          through tiny holes as though light termites are eating
          away at the very reality of the street itself... this
          memory is falling away into the light...


          JOHNNY

          begins to run from the light...


  5656INT. WALT'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

          Nurses and Gibson working feverishly on Johnny...

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Start an IV on Johnny.

                                        TECHNICIAN
                        He's still not breathing.  IV's
                        in.

                        If he doesn't start breathing
                        soon we may need to intubate.

                          Walt...!

          We move back to see we're in the cafeteria where Walt met
          Sarah... but it's empty... after a beat... the room seems
          to spring "leaks" of light, splitting through tiny holes
          as though light termites are eating away at the very   
          memory of the cafeteria... 


          JOHNNY  

          runs out the door which seems to lead right into...


  5858INT. BANNERMAN KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          as he enters in a continuous move... it too is deserted...
          Johnny reacts... and then they come again: the light
          termites... as the kitchen springs leaks of light... Johnny
          exits...


  5959JOHNNY - CLOSE-UP - RUNNING - INT. BANNERMAN HOUSE

          ...entering --


  6060INT. BANNERMAN BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          where Walt caught Sarah looking at the ring... the light
          termites are already at work here as Johnny enters... but
          it's deserted...

    60CONTINUED:60

          Johnny reacts, runs out of the bedroom...


  6161EXT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Well, you can't even call it night or day anymore... it's
          just weird... like a fire in the sky is washing out our
          vision of the world... it's hot in a photographic sense... 
          almost feels like a nuclear aftermath somehow...

          Johnny bursts out the front door... looking for the kids
          who were chanting but...


          HIS POV - OF THE DESERTED STREET

          no kids... nothing... except, Jesus, dust blowing down
          the street in the wind... as in dust to dust...


          ANGLE - JOHNNY

          begins to run... he doesn't know where... he just has to
          run... 


  6262EXT. DOWNTOWN BANGOR - NIGHT - EXTREME WIDE SHOT

          with the same fire in the sky... a nice big city square...
          Bangor's version of Times Square... completely deserted
          and devoid of life... the small figure of Johnny running
          into the square is barely visible... this is all one
          helluva nightmare...


          CLOSE ON JOHNNY

            breathing hard... and it's getting warm and he's starting
          to sweat a bit... if he's had a jacket on through this,
          he rips it off... he looks over to see --


          JOHNNY'S POV - THE SHERIFF'S STATION

          He runs inside...


  6363INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

          The bullpen is deserted... no light termites yet... and
          Johnny is about to leave except he glances toward Walt's

          office through the window... and there's Walt, with his
          feet up on his desk, his hands behind his head and he
          sits back, thinking, with a smile on his face... he looks
          up and sees Johnny, waves nonchalantly...

          Johnny runs into his office... out of breath...

                        You know, out of everywhere I've
                        ever been my whole life, I think
                        right here behind this desk is my
                          favorite place... I just feel good

                        Then don't leave it, Walt... if
                        you love it here, stay here...
                        behind the real desk...

          Walt studies him a beat... grins, shakes his head...

                        Naw, Dad is right.  It's time to
                        move on.

          The TECHNICIAN who's bagging Johnny shakes his head.

                        He's going into v-fib.

          Dr. Gibson waves away the bag and checks Johnny's carotid
          pulse.  She frowns and gives him a precordial thump to
          the chest.  Checks his pulse again.

                                        DR. GIBSON
                        Still no pulse.  Start CPR and
                        charge paddles to 200.

          Dr. Gibson SHOCKS Johnny.  As she frowns at the result, 
          ANOTHER ALARM GOES OFF... THIS ONE FROM WALT'S BEDSIDE...

                                        TECHNICIAN

                          Doctor!?  He's in v-fib too.

          Walt's monitor shows his heart is fibrillating...

                                        DR. GIBSON

          The light termites punch leaks in the wall... Johnny knows

                        easy for you... and it shouldn't
                        be easy... it's been three days,
                        Walt... three days... and you're
                        ready to move on?  I hung on for

                                (to Johnny, chastising)
                        I asked you not to upset him.

          Joe senses Johnny is moving in a direction he really
          doesn't want this to go... Walt is still back on the

                        go through that again, you know
                        what I mean?  The pain of not

          Walt's ready... he looks to Johnny...

                                        WALT
                        You're not a bad guy, John.

          He reaches out to shake hands... Johnny doesn't offer
          his... the termites are really getting to the wall now...
          but Johnny's been thinking and he's made a decision...

                        Maybe I am, Walt.  You know that
                        ring... that 'keepsake' Sarah has
                        in her jewelry box...

                        anymore...  Sarah brought it over
                        to the house a few weeks ago to
                        give it back...

                        That ring really dredged up some
                          memories, you know... and one
                        thing led to another and...

                        I had sex with your wife.

                          leaving, I grabbed her arm and
                        pulled her to the floor...

          And he steps back and slugs Johnny on the jaw... Johnny
          falls halfway across the room and pain never felt so

          (NOTE: As this fight continues through various scenes, it
          should almost feel like one long PAN shot as Walt and
          Johnny -- and observer Joe -- tussle their way through.)

          Walt charges Johnny, taking them both through the glass
          window of the office and into...

          Walt and Johnny land in a shower of broken glass.  The
          white light termites are still working here, but losing
          power.  Joe watches the men fighting, worried that his
          fish is wriggling off the hook.

          Walt punches Johnny in the stomach.  His knees buckle. 
          Walt grabs Johnny and throws him over the couch into...

          Johnny flies into the pile of boulders which marked the
          cave-in that sparked this odyssey.  Walt approaches and
          gets a swift kick in the stomach from Johnny.

          The fight continues, but Joe looks disappointed.  He senses
          he's lost.  Behind him, the white light holes in the cave
          walls begin to close up... retreating.

          And now the wall of light is behind him, illuminating the

          Walt's on the ground catching his breath.  Johnny struggles
