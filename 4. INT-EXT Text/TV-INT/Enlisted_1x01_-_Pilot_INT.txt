                        Larry King in camo.  I can t punch 
                        Larry King.  Still, your dumb red

                      the Army works.  You got your team 
                      out under heavy fire.  You re a 
                        hero.  Now get out of my face.    
                            (to a fellow officer)

                        Nice job, genius.  You lost a rank 
                      and got booted stateside.  You re

                      me!  Rear D guys aren t even real

                        I served with your father for half 
                      my life.  When he died, I swore I d

                        I had each of you transferred here 
                         cause wherever you were, you were 
                        screwing up.  Derrick doesn t care 
                        about being a soldier at all.  Know 
                        what he did his first week here?

                        Didhe have to pay for it?  Sounds 
                        pricey.

                        son, you had a great career going!  
                      You should be wearing the Medal of

                        That Officer insulted my men.  I 
                        went with my gut.

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                        Well your gut s a dumbass.  And 
                        because of that, now you get to 
                        lead one of my Rear Detachment 
                        platoons.  This unit has a problem.

                      Is it a morale problem?      "Enlisted" Pilot6.


                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                      No, it s a  they re slackers and 
                        dipshits  problem.  Besides, I 
                        don t do morale.  I didn t lose my 
                        foot to a land mine so I could pat 
                        soldiers on the head.

        For emphasis he TAKES OFF HIS FAKE FOOT, puts it on the desk.

                                      PETE
                        I ve never talked with you where 
                      you didn t bring up your fake foot.

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                        When your foot gets blown off by a 
                        land mine, you get to bring it up 
                        whenever you like.

                                      PETE
                      Why do you have a white guy foot?

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                        I have tiny feet, my size only 
                        comes in white.  I want you to 
                        shape up that unit.  We have war 
                        games scheduled with an Italian 
                        platoon soon, I expect you to kick 
                        some Italian ass.

                        Italians come here to train?

                        Lotta countries come here to train.  
                        Turns out the only place as hot and 
                        miserable as the Afghani desert is 
                        twenty miles outside Disney World. 

                                      PETE
                      If all your orders are this easy I 
                        should be out of here and back to 
                        leading real soldiers in no time.  
                        I think I can manage war games.  
                      I m used to playing them for keeps.  
                              (then)
                        I just gave you chills, right?

                      No.  Your second order is to go 
                        find this dog.

                        Walk around base, see if you can 
                      get the little son of a bitch to 
                        show his little son of a bitch 
                        face.

                        Last week I caught an insurgent s 
                        grenade and threw it back at him.  
                      So this is great.

                        Dummy, the mostimportant part of 
                        Rear D s job is taking care of the 
                        families of deployed soldiers.    
                        Whatever they need, you will do.   
                        Someone needs a babysitter?  You 
                        gonna sit babies.  Someone lost a 
                        dog?  You find that dog.  Got it?

        Just then, Derrick and Randy show up at the door.

                      His socks were hanging up on the 
                        telephone wires.  Blown clean off.     

                                      RANDY
                        Were there... feet in the socks?

        Pete nods.  Derrick rolls his eyes, takes note of bartender 
        CASSY (pretty, blue collar).  He starts over to the bar.

                                      DERRICK
                        Well I d love to hear more of the 
                        Adventures of Sergeant Awesome, but 
                      I d rather do some drinking.

                                      PETE
                      We aredrinking.

                                      DERRICK
                      Not enough.

                                      RANDY
                      Let him go.  He likes that girl.

          Derrick sits at the bar and addresses Cassy.

                                      DERRICK
                      My bella, can I get a shot, a beer, 
                      and even a hint of a smile?

        Cassy passes him a beer without a hint of a smile.

                                      RANDY
                            (to Pete)
                      She doesn t like him.

                                      DERRICK
                            (to Cassy)
                        Make it two shots, then.

        Cassy moves off, unwilling to give Derrick the time of day.  
        Across the room, a LOCAL GIRL catches Randy s eye.      "Enlisted" Pilot18.


                                      RANDY
                        Sorry man.  Booty calls.

                                      PETE
                      You didn t just say that, really?

        Randy races off to join the Local Girl.  Jill approaches.

                                      JILL
                      So, Derrick struck out, Randy s 
                        being a sewer dick.  Welcome to 
                        Fort McGee nightlife.

        They both watch as Randy  act dances  a lyric in the song 
          playing (a la  You make a grown man cry  in  Start Me Up. )  
        He looks ridiculous but the Local Girl and her friend laugh.

                                      PETE
                        Girls like that?

                                      JILL
                      He plays the percentages.  Hey, 
                        sorry about earlier.  It s just, 
                        I ve worked really hard to get to a 
                        position that was kinda handed to 
                      you as a consolation prize. 

                                      PETE
                        I agree.  As long as you agree you 
                        have a chip on your shoulder, too. 

                                      JILL
                        A huge chip!  Woman in the Army are  
                        undervalued.  Hell, we just got 
                        cleared to fight.  But I don t need 
                          appreciation.  I m here to work. 

                                      PETE
                      You so want appreciation.

                                      JILL
                        Just a tiny bit of appreciation.  
                        Like a baby toe of appreciation.


        Jill looks over to see Wallace grabbing a drink at the bar. 

                                      JILL
                      Aw nuts, my ex just got here.

          Wallace walks over, carrying a froofydrink and his case.

                                      WALLACE
                        Wassup, Jilly Jill? 
                              (then to Pete)
                      Who are you? 

                                      PETE
                      I m Pete.  What s with the case?    

                                      WALLACE
                        It s for my racquetball racquet, 
                        bro.  I m ranked 7th in the state.

                                      PETE
                      Oh! I m ranked first in the state.  In 
                      not giving a crap about racquetball. 

                                      WALLACE 
                        Attitude, huh?  See my badge?  Says 
                         attach .   Means I m a contractor.  
                        From Washington.  I m more 
                        important than every grunt here.   

                                      PETE
                        This guy, really?

                                      JILL
                      We all make mistakes.  Mine just 
                        wears Antonio Banderas cologne. 

                                      WALLACE
                      So you two are hanging out?  That s 
                        cool.  Last week, I hung with that 
                        chick who banged General Petraeus.  
                        I could ve gotten in there, too.  
                        Unless it s normal for a woman to 
                      do this.  
                              (sexy sniffs Pete s neck)
                        Signed, A. Banderas.

        Randy, who s doing shots with Denise ( Woo! ), calls over:

                                      RANDY
                        Pete, that s Wallace!  He sucks!  
                        Last week Derrick and me filled his 
                        Porschewith packing peanuts!      "Enlisted" Pilot20.


                                      JILL
                        Theydid that?  That s the first 
                        time I ve liked your brothers.

                                      WALLACE
                        Wasn t funny then, isn t funny now!
                              (then to Jill)
                      I m hanging with the Italians if 
                      you want to join.

        He waves and we see indeed there are a bunch of handsome 
          Italians at a table.  One of them sees Pete and yells:

                                      MAIN ITALIAN SOLDIER
                          Voisoldatisonotesticoli!  Haha!

                                      PETE
                        Yeah,  testicle soldier,  got it.  
                        They really need to learn 
                        colloquialisms.

                                      WALLACE
                        Ohhh, you re the new sergeant who s 
                        about to crazy-lose some war games.

                                      PETE
                        I feel like I don t need to take 
                        crap from a guy drinking a cosmo.

                                      WALLACE
                        First of all, this is a Velvet 
                        Hammer, as anybody with even a 
                        passing knowledge of the movie 
                         Cocktail  would know.

                                      JILL
                            (to Pete, shrugging)
                        Burn?

                                      WALLACE
                      And I run the war games, dummy.  I 
                        bring in foreign platoons that want 
                      to keep sharp against Americans.  
                        Except they don t like to lose, so 
                        I always match them with a numbnuts
                        unit that can t possibly win.

                                      PETE
                      So we re like the Washington Generals?

                                      WALLACE
                        More like the Washington Privates.

          Wallace, chuckling at his own joke, looks for laughs.        "Enlisted" Pilot21.


                                      WALLACE (CONT D)
                      No one?  Fine.  Anyhow Jill, come 
                        have a drink, you re looking yummy.

                                      JILL
                      Ew!  Nothing aside from cupcakes 
                        should be called  yummy. 

                                      PETE
                      And don t talk down to her.  Jill s 
                        a million times better at what she 
                        does than whatever it is you do.   

                                      JILL
                      Uh, I don t need you defending me 
                        like I m some little girl. Who do you 
                        think you are?  You just got here.

        Jill heads with Wallace to the table.  Pete, frustrated, sees 
          Derrick leading Randy, Denise and Private Sick in more shots.

                                      PETE
                      Do not get hammer-faced drunk!  You 
                        gotta be up at oh-six-hundred.

        As Derrick gives a thumbs up, then does a shot:


        Pete, Derrick and Randy stand before an angry Cody.

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                      Why are you punching their faces, 
                        Pete?  Don t punch their faces.  

                                      RANDY
                      To be honest, it started going 
                        south when Pete said he was 
                        stronger than a Panda Bear.

                                      PETE
                        I never said I was stronger than a 
                        Panda Bear.

                                      DERRICK
                        You re not.

                                      PETE
                        I mean sure, I could probably choke 
                      out a baby panda.

                                      DERRICK / RANDY
                        Incorrect.  / Why would you do 
                        that?!  It s a baby! 

                                      SGT. MAJOR CODY
                        Stop talking!  Just get out.  Not 
                        Pete.  Me and you gotta talk.  


        The on-base market.  Pete s grabbing beer as Jill walks up.

                                      JILL
                        Tough morning with the troops, huh?

                                      PETE
                      We all make mistakes.

                                      JILL
                        Look, I didn t even date Wallace, 
                      it was a hook up- okay, like five 
                        hook ups, maybe six.  Seven tops... 
                        plus a trip to Tampa where we 
                        jetskied together.

                                      PETE
                      Two jetskis or one?  
                              (off her embarrassed look)
                      Oh my God!  It was one!  

                                      JILL
                        He s different than anyone here.  
                      And I liked being with a guy who s 
                      not always trying to protect me. 

                                      PETE
                        That s my problem: I always try to 
                        have someone s back.  I thought 
                        that s what being a soldier meant.

                                      JILL
                      Hey no, you can t say that and walk 
                      off like you won the conversation! 

                                      PETE
                      No, I won.  Cute tea, by the way.

        He pulls a box of Sleepy Time Tea (the one with the Teddy 
        Bear in PJson the label) from her cart.  As he walks off:

                                      JILL
                        I need help falling asleep!  I ve 
                        been having nightmares about a wolf 
                        with my cousin Tina s face on it!  
                      Why am I telling you this?!       "Enlisted" Pilot27.



          Randy s sprawled, asleep.  Derrick is reading.  Pete enters. 

                                      PETE
                        What s up with him?

                                      DERRICK
                      He got mad at himself for letting 
                      you down, did an hour of jumping 
                        jacks as punishment then passed 
                        out.  He cried.  You ever seen a 
                      man cry while doing jumping jacks?  
                      It sounds funny, but it s just sad.  

                                      PETE
                              (sits, opens beers, then)
                      I m sorry I didn t keep in touch, 
                        okay?  I guess I thought about what 
                        could happen, like with Dad...  I 
                        thought if I was distant it d be 
                        easier for you.  I was wrong.   

                                      DERRICK
                      It felt like you didn t need us, 
                      you dick.  We re all we ve got. 

        Pete takes out his PHONE, the one we saw on page one, and 
          scrolls photos as he talks.  The last is of them, as kids, 
        hands on each other s heads.  This is not an easy admission: 

                                      PETE 
                        This is too heavy for Randy to 
                        hear, but you want to know how much 
                        I needed you guys?  I put these 
                        pictures on here.  My favorites.  
                      And I kept this with me so I could 
                        look at them in case, you know, I 
                        thought I was gonna bite it...  So 
                        you d be the last thing I see.  
                              (beat, then)
                        I looked at these a lot, Derrick. 

          A heavy moment as this hits Derrick.  He takes it in, then:

                                      DERRICK
                        You re right, that is waytoo heavy 
                      for Randy.
                              (off Pete s laugh)
                        I saw him cry at a Gap ad, dude is 
                        sensitive.  

                                      PETE

                      Or maybe a plumber.  I have five 
                        solid minutes for a stand up set--

                                      PETE
                      You don t know what you want to do.

                                      DERRICK
                        I have no clue. 

        THUMP, THUMP.  Randy is up doing jumping jacks and CRYING. 

                                      RANDY
                      I m sorry I disappointed you, Pete. 

                                      PETE
                        That s even sadder than you said.
