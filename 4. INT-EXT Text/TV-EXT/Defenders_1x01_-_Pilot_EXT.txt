      Amidst the crowded plaza is LISA TYLER, 29, African-American, 
      attractive, nervous about her first day in court.  

      Pete hurries across Casino Center Blvd. 

                                  PETE
                    You re late.

                                  LISA
                    Me?

      Lisa starts walking with him.  Fast.                                                                                        3.


                                  PETE
                    I m late, you re late.  We re late.  
                          (glances at his watch)
                    Where the hell s Nick?   You ready?

                                  LISA
                    For what?  You haven t told me what 
                    we re doing.      

                                  PETE
                    Didn t Nick?  

      Her worried face says,  no  as they enter --



      Pete exits, no longer rushing.  He smiles at the sun,  does a 
      stretch on the steps.  His PHONE RINGS.  He knows the number:  

                                  PETE (INTO PHONE)
                    Christ sake, Nick.  Big day today!  
                    Where the hell are you?    
                          (pause)
                      What?...What?  
                          (pause)
                    Aw jeez.  No.  Stay.  Stay there.    



      As they exit the restaurant, Pete shoves the manila ENVELOPE 
      at Nick --

                                  PETE
                    -- Lose the photos, okay?  It s 
                      embarrassing...  And stop following 
                    your wife --
                          (handing valet his ticket)
                    -- or I ll file a restraining order 
                    myself.

                                  NICK
                    I really thought things were 
                    looking up.  She was laughing again 
                    like she used to.  I was even gonna 
                    ask her on a date.  

      Pete nods sympathetically.

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    Got tickets to Junior.  Table right 
                    down front.

      Pete s sympathy ebbs...just as his PHONE RINGS. 

                                  PETE
                    Wait...  You got tickets to Junior?  

                                  NICK
                    Does it matter anymore?

                                  PETE
                    Yeah!  I been trying for a month!  

      Pete grabs his ringing phone.

                                  PETE
                    -- Hey Sophe, we re just heading in --     
                          (then, intently)
                    When?   
                          (pause, then)
                    Tell him we re on our way.

      He hangs up.  Looks at Nick.                                                                                      8.


                                  PETE
                    Better get you some coffee.  
                    Collect call from county.  Don 
                    Shepard.       



      Nick and Pete exit the jail on Casino Center Boulevard, the 
      Golden Nugget Casino just down the block.  Pete is excited --

                                  PETE
                    We ve got us a murder trial!  

      Nick is not enthused. 

                                  NICK
                    Yeah...a murder trial.  

      He tosses the manila ENVELOPE in a trash can and moves for 
      the car.  Watching Nick... Pete s face morphs into worry.

                            ACT 1

      VIEW ACROSS ROOF TOPS OF: Downtown Las Vegas, the Golden 
      Nugget Casino, Fremont Street.  

      Boom down to the modest law office building on the corner 
      with the sign  Mancini and Kaczmarek  that s a bit too long 
      for the face of the building.  Pete s Benz approaches.       



      Nick winces in pain as the bright sunlight hits his eyes -- 

                                  NICK
                    -- Ah!

      Pete takes off his dark shades as he steps next to Nick.  
       What a pal,  thinks Nick as he takes them --

                                  NICK
                    Thanks, man.                                                                                      12.


      But Pete is oblivious to Nick.  He s staring at --

      -- drop dead gorgeous porn star, EVA DEMOAN, 6 inch heels, 
      tiny mini skirt.  She exits Mancini & Kaczmarek with ASSOCIATE 
      ATTORNEY, CLYDE DEWITT (65) in a Stetson cowboy hat.   

                                  CLYDE
                    Pete.  Nick.  Eva --

                                  PETE
                    -- Eva DeMoan.  I know.  Big fan.     

                                  EVA
                    Thank you.  

                                  NICK
                    What s up, Clyde?

                                  CLYDE
                    Sites are stealing and marketing 
                    Eva s videos the moment she posts 
                    new work.         

                                  PETE
                          (dramatic)
                    That is wrong.  If there s anything 
                    I can do --  

                                  NICK
                    --  You found the best adult film 
                    lawyer in the business, Ms. DeMoan.  
                    Proud to have Clyde with us. 

      Clyde tips his hat and escorts Eva away.  

                                  PETE
                          (over his shoulder)
                    Loved you in Deep, dark and ...  

                                  NICK
                          (grabbing his arm)
                    Pretend you re a professional.



      Nick and Pete exit.  Pete slaps his partner s back, offers 
      advice --  

                                  PETE
                    Breakfast without the olives 
                    tomorrow?  

                                  NICK
                          (still feeling it)
                    Copy that.  

                                  PETE
                    Take  er easy tonight.  Last chance 
                    for a while. 



                                  PETE
                    Much better, Marco.   Much, much 
                    better product you re hauling --

      -- Pete s looking at a refrigerator truck full of meat.

                                  MARCO
                          (smiling)
                    Don t pay as much.

      Pete puts his big hand on the back of Marco s neck and gives 
      him a fatherly uncomfortable squeeze -- 

                                  PETE
                    -- Does it pay more than they paid 
                    you to clean toilets at Ely?   

                                  MARCO
                          (pulling away, smiling)
                    -- Yes!  No, no, I am not 
                      complaining! 

                                  PETE
                          (proud and pleased)
                    Keeping your nose clean, huh?  

                                  MARCO
                    Keep everything clean or my wife 
                    say no el sexo.  

      Pete laughs.  Marco waves toward the trailer full of meat --                                                                                    19.


                                  MARCO
                    You like meat?

      He climbs up and offers Pete a hand --

                                  PETE
                    This legal?



      Nine year olds battle under floodlights.  KRISTEN MANCINI 
      (37), attractive, recognizable from the surveillance photos, 
      stands near the fence watching her son, SAMMY (9) man first 
      base.  His team jersey reads:  E-Z Checks Red Sox .   Nick 
      walks over quickly from the parking lot.  

                                  NICK
                    Sorry I m late, Kris.  What time s 
                    your class?

                                    KRISTEN
                    I m okay still.  It s 2-2.  Sammy 
                    walked in the third, scored the 
                    tying run.   

                                  NICK
                    He scored?  
                          (calling out)
                    Alright, Sammy!  Way to go!   Atta 
                    boy, champ!

      Sammy looks over bewildered for a moment then turns away.  
      Nick smiles awkwardly at Kris, then tries a segue --

                                  NICK
                    Hey, how about you?  Score lately?

      Bad segue.  Kris screws up her face.    

                                    KRISTEN
                    What s that supposed to mean?  

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    No, I m just, well... a little bird 
                    told me you might a had a date last 
                    week is all and  --

                                    KRISTEN
                    -- Excuse me?

                                  NICK
                          (trying to keep it light)
                    Five-ten, rides a motorcycle?                                                                                    20.


                                    KRISTEN
                    A  little bird ?  What the hell 
                    does that mean?

      Then it dawns on her --

                                    KRISTEN
                    -- did you have me followed?  

                                  NICK
                    What?

                                    KRISTEN (CONT D)
                    Did you have Frank follow me?

                                  NICK
                    I didn t say that.  

      Classic lawyer non-denial denial.  

                                    KRISTEN
                    You did.  Son of a -- 

      -- LOUD CHEERS for a big hit drown out an expletive-laced 
      RANT.  By the time we can hear again, Kris is fishing in her 
      purse for car keys and Nick is working damage control --  

                                  NICK
                    -- Hang on, hang on, Kris, no need 
                    to get all bent outta shape --  

                                    KRISTEN
                    --  A little bird told you.   There 
                    better not be photos  -- 

      -- Nick grimaces, pulls out an envelope --

                                  NICK
                    -- No, Kris, I was just asking 
                    because --

      -- he pulls tickets from the envelope --

                                    KRISTEN
                          (ignoring him)
                    -- It s none of your business if 
                    I m dating or not.  Tell your 
                    little bird to fly into a wall.  

      She turns and wheels toward the parking lot.  Nick slips the 
      two tickets back in the envelope, defeated.                                                                                       21.



      Lisa steps up onto the concrete porch of a sun-blasted stucco 
      house.  Lisa KNOCKS, hard, presuming Eunice Brown is deaf as 
      well as blind.  Finally EUNICE BROWN opens up --

                                  EUNICE
                    Yes?

                                  LISA
                    Eunice Brown?  Lisa Tyler.  I m a 
                    lawyer for Donald Shepard.

      Lisa offers her card, but wary Eunice ignores it.  

                                  EUNICE
                    No.  I said all I m going to say on 
                    it.  I won t get anyone in trouble.

      We HEAR the unmistakable WHINE of a VACUUM somewhere behind 
      Eunice. 

                                  LISA
                    No.  Of course not --

      -- the vacuum s WHINE ends.  Lisa notes the old woman s 
      jitters and decides not to spook her further --

                                  LISA
                    -- I m sorry to have bothered you.  



      As the woman, ANA, stores her bucket into the hatchback --

                                  LISA (O.S.)
                    Excuse me?

      Ana turns.  Polite.  Smiling.  Yes?

                                  LISA
                    I wonder if we could talk?  It s 
                    about the shooting.

      Ana s smile fades.  She is about to fall into the system...



      A few palms sway in the breeze.  Nick looks out, deep in 
      thought.  Rough day in court.  He turns and looks through the 
      sliding glass doors into his living room.  



      Nick carries take-out coffee; meeting Scott in the drive --

                                  NICK
                    Thanks for coming.  You holding up?

                                  SCOTT
                          (looks for reassurance)
                    I m okay.  I guess.  Trial seems to 
                    be goin  good, right?

                                  NICK
                          (wanting to give hope)
                    Today should be good.

      Scott nods, glad of the reassurance.  He hands Nick a KEY.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s weird, I grew up here and I 
                    can t stand to be around anymore.  
                    Just lock up, okay?  Sorry.

      Nick takes the key, watching sad Scott climb into his car...



      Nick EXITS the kitchen door with his coffee cup and photos.  
      He s now on the side walkway, the scene of the crime, when -- 

      -- a harried Pete ARRIVES, in French cuffs and court shoes --

                                  PETE
                    All right, I m here; what you got?

      Nick eyes the homicide scene: a GATE twenty feet down the 
      concrete walk --

                                  NICK
                          (pointing toward the gate)
                    Fight s at the gate --
                          (turning)
                    -- Don s gone inside for the gun, 
                    comes out the back door there --

      -- he points to the KITCHEN DOOR where Don Shepard exited as 
      he fired.  

                                  NICK
                          (walking)
                    Figure Jimmy Thompson is somewhere in 
                      between...about here.  Right?

      He stops ten feet from the back door.  

                                  PETE
                    Okay.  

                                  NICK
                    Don tells the cops he just came out 
                    to scare  em off...when Jimmy rushed 
                    and he fired.
                          (waves Pete over)
                    You re Jimmy.  Start here.  I ll be 
                    Don.  When the door opens, rush me.

      Pete moves into position as Nick walks to the house and goes 
      inside.  He waits until --    

      -- the door opens, Pete,  rushes forward.  Nick quickly 
      raises his take-out coffee and PITCHES it at --

                                  PETE
                          (re: the flying cup)
                    Hey!

      -- Pete TURNS and DUCKS, and the take-out cup THWACKS his 
      shoulder blade --                                                                                    34.


                                  PETE
                    What the hell?  It s a two-hundred 
                    dollar shirt, you jerk!

      Nick eyes the coffee drenching the back of Pete s shirt.

                                  NICK
                    Sorry.  Got another one in the car.

      Nick walks off, focussed.  Pete stands slack-jawed.  What was 
      that?



      Pete walks up from his car as Lisa comes out of the building.  
      She smiles and gives Pete an anticipatory eye lift.  

                                  PETE
                    What?  

                                  LISA
                    Quite the crowd today.   

                                  PETE
                    Yeah?  Where you off to?

                                  LISA
                    I get to spend my morning with 
                    Meredith Carter!    

                                  PETE
                    Lucky you.  Ray McWhorter?
                          (off her nod)
                    She budging?

                                  LISA
                          (shakes her head)
                    Still throwing the book at him.  
                    She have something against 
                    teenagers or is it all of humanity?  



      Pete finds Nick where he expects him.  Pacing on the roof 
      overlooking the south strip.  It s Mancini-Kaczmarek custom 
      before closing arguments.                                                                                       42.


                                  PETE
                    Up all night?

      Nick nods, barely looks up as he launches into his thought 
      process --     

                                  NICK
                    I know Cole s going to hammer 
                      premeditation in his close.    
                          (jabbing his finger)
                     Mr. Shepard made a choice!  It was 
                    a willful act!  He intended harm!   
                    Pete, he s got a real shot at a 
                    second degree murder conviction.        

                                  PETE
                    Second?   Not a chance.  Nick, you 
                    were great yesterday.

      Nick stops, looks at Pete --

                                  NICK
                    Don t kid yourself.  Don s at risk 
                    for 20 to life.  We need to hedge 
                    our bets, protect him --     

      -- He starts pacing again --

                                  NICK
                    So I argue for full acquittal -- 
                    but in case this is a hanging jury, 
                    wants to pin something on him?
                          (levels eyes at Pete)
                    I make damn sure the jury understands 
                    what involuntary means, that Don 
                    didn t intend to kill anybody.         

      Nick wants approval... but --  

                                  PETE
                    Nick, how bout we go in bold with 
                    not guilty?  That s protecting him.  

                                  NICK
                          (sharp)
                    Of course he s not guilty.   What 
                    do you think I m going to argue?   

                                  PETE
                    Sounds like you re going to mealy 
                    mouth it.  

      Tempers flare, they get loud --                                                                                    43.


                                  NICK
                    Wrong!  No!  I just said it -- argue 
                    innocent, school them on involuntary --  

                                  PETE
                    -- We offer the jury an easy 
                    verdict like involuntary, they ll 
                    take it!  I would, if I saw the 
                    guy s lawyers lost their nerve.

                                  NICK
                    You think I m scared?!

                                  PETE
                    Damn right, I think you re scared, 
                    I m scared to death!

      Silence.  They look at each other.  Nothing like a little 
      honesty to deflate tension.  Finally -- 

                                  NICK
                    Yeah...me too.  

      Nick steps toward Pete, earnest, convincing...  

                                  NICK
                    I m not losing my nerve, Pete.  I 
                    think I can hedge the bet without 
                    hurting Don s shot at acquittal.     
                    It s a tightrope but I think I can 
                    walk it.   

                                  PETE
                          (nods)
                    Sounds like you got a plan.  I 
                    trust your gut.   



      Pete and Nick exit, steamed.  

                                  PETE
                          (whispering through 
                            clenched teeth)
                    Screw him.  Stick to your plan. 
                    Instruct them yourself.    



      Nick pulls to a stop in front of his old house.  There s a 
      basketball hoop, a ball on the lawn.   

      Nick moves to open the car door, then stops as he sees 
      Kristen through a first floor window, laughing with Sammy, 
      urging him upstairs.  Nick glances at the clock.  9:10 PM.  
      Sammy s bedtime.  As the lights turn on upstairs, Nick starts 
      the car and pulls away.



      Kristen Manicini, exits a lecture hall chatting with two 
      other students, a dozen years younger than her.  As she waves 
      good-bye she turns to find...  Nick, looking sheepish.    

                                  NICK
                    Hey.

                                    KRISTEN
                    Hey.

      There is an awkward silence, Nick more like an awkward teen 
      than a tough guy lawyer --

                                  NICK
                    I...  I came...  I just wanted to 
                    tell you I m sorry.    

                                    KRISTEN
                    Yeah?  Really?  For what?

      She d still like an answer, an admission.  

                                  NICK
                    I asked Frank to drive by the house 
                    a couple times, make sure you guys 
                    are okay.
                          (admits)
                      I should a told you.  

                                    KRISTEN
                    He wasn t following me?

                                  NICK
                    No.   Course not.  I just worry.

      Kristen s eyes soften.  She smiles a  you big jerk  smile.  

                                    KRISTEN
                    I still should smack you.  

                                  NICK
                    Why?                                                                                      61.


                                    KRISTEN
                    Now you re worried?   Who was 
                    checking all those nights, all 
                    those years, you were too busy to 
                    come home, you know?

                                  NICK
                    I know.  I m doing my penance.  

      Nick reaches into his pocket --

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    But look, I know it s none of my 
                    business if you re dating or not, 
                    but if you are --

      -- Kristen s ire rises again but Nick holds out two TICKETS:

                                  NICK (CONT D)
                    -- Junior s in town.  I thought 
                    maybe you d have a date with me.  

      Kristen looks at him, moved.  Junior is obviously important.  

                                    KRISTEN
                    Junior?   Oh my god.  Where? 

                                  NICK
                    The Sahara.   Like old times.  

      Nick waits.  Hopeful.  But Kristen starts to shake her head --

                                    KRISTEN
                          (gently)
                    No...  Sorry.  I have class and...  
                    it s not a good idea.  Not yet.

      She squeezes his hand, appreciatively, affectionately.  She s 
      leaving him with an extra ticket but not without hope.  Nick 
      nods as Kris prepares to go --

                                    KRISTEN (CONT D)
                    I can t believe I m missing Junior for 
                    biology class!  What a nerd, right?  

      Nick smiles, watches her go, then turns toward his car. 



      -- pulling out and up into the Vegas night --

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      the desert, it s mystery finally revealed:  

      A photo of Nick and Pete standing together 14 feet tall in 
      power suits, uncomfortably stiff and too serious to smile.  
      The copy beside their big heads reads:                                                                                     63.
