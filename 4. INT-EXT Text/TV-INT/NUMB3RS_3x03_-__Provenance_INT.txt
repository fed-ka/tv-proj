  GUARD #1 moves down the Utility Hallway (no art, should look 
  like a service hallway, hence no security cameras).  He 
  arrives at a staircase, turns and heads down the stairs as...  

  A beat later, at the opposite end of the Utility Hallway... 
  an elevator opens.  A THIEF, mask, gloves, backpack, gets off 
  the elevator and moves down the Utility Hallway.  He arrives 
  at a door marked  Museum Personnel Only.   He slides a key-
  card through a reader.  The door CLICKS open.  He enters.


  A/C, ducts, wires, etc.  The THIEF removes a PVR device from 
  his backpack.  Taps into the MUSEUM SERVER.  He hits a button 
  on the PVR device.  The DISPLAY flickers: we see SECURITY 
  VIDEO OF THE EMPTY MAIN GALLERY.  He hits another button, an 
  upper corner display flashes:  RECORD.   MATCH CUT TO:

  monitor to... A STAIRCASE where GUARD #1 is now descending.

  EMPTY MAIN GALLERY, now on the Thief s PVR display, being 
  recorded.  The Thief hits a button, switches to the SECURITY 
  VIDEO OF THE STAIRCASE where GUARD #1 is standing.  


  Satisfied that the Main Gallery is secure, GUARD #1 turns and 
  heads back up the stairs.


  GUARD #2 watches as GUARD #1 ascends the stairs.  He starts 
  to clear the security camera frame, as we...  MATCH CUT TO:


  SECURITY VIDEO OF THE STAIRCASE, but on the Thief s display. 
  GUARD #1 clears security camera frame.  The Thief hits a 
  button on the PVR device, the display flashes:  RECORD.   
  He s now recording SECURITY VIDEO OF THE STAIRCASE, empty.


  Resume GUARD #2 watching the monitors.  On the central 
  monitor, he punches up the MUSEUM STAIRCASE, empty, as... 


  We FIND the Thief descending the stairs to the landing.  He 
  opens his backpack, removes a set of hi-tech telescoping 
  tubes, which he extends and screws into a base.  He then 
  removes a fiber-optic fabric material, attaches it.  He pops 
  smoke, revealing LASERS criss-crossing the gallery.  A set of 
  three closely spaced beams guard the immediate perimeter.


  Resume GUARD #2 watching the monitors.  On the central 
  monitor he punches up the MAIN GALLERY, empty, as...


  Reveal the Thief s rigid-tent construction  fiber-optic gate  
  which he slides into place using an optic levelling device.  
  The lasers arc over the top, completing their circuit.  This 
  first set of lasers defeated, the Thief slides through the 
  gate.  He looks ahead at his target: A PISSARRO PAINTING (of 
  a Paris street).  More lasers criss-cross in his path.  He 
  bends and contorts past the first set of lasers, picking his 
  way through, as...        NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    3.




  Resume GUARD #2 watching the monitors, punching up different 
  camera angles.  The MAIN GALLERY still appears empty...


  The Thief works through the last set of lasers, arrives at 
  his goal... The Pissarro.


  Resume GUARD #2 eyeing the monitors.  He checks a central 
  clock overhead: 2:33 am.  He punches up the Main Gallery on 
  the big central screen, stares at the Main Gallery clock: 
  CLOSE ON THE CLOCK: 2:29 am.  Puzzled, he gets on his radio --

                              GUARD #2
                Hey Jimmy, check out Gallery One, 
                  would ya...
                      (off radio static/silence)
                  ...Jimmy?  You there?

  Off Guard #2, concerned.


  On the landing of the staircase off the Utility Hallway, 
  below a camera, GUARD #1 lies, mouth taped, plasti-cuffed.


  The THIEF presses a button on a hand-held device: four motion 
  sensor lights built into the wall at the four corners of the 
  painting turn off.  The Thief takes down the painting, 
  removes it from the frame, slides it into a velvet bag.  As 
  he attaches this bag to his backpack... AN ALARM SOUNDS!  The 
  MAZE OF LASERS switches off.  OVERHEAD FLOODLIGHTS beam down 
  from above, flooding the Main Gallery with bright light. 


  GUARD #2 descends the stairs, wary.  He arrives at the door 
  to the Main Gallery, finds it open.  He looks up to see... 
  The Thief.  The THIEF pulls a TASER, zaps GUARD #2, takes him 
  down... WE FOLLOW the Thief as he vaults up the stairs to...


  ...the Utility Hallway, where he passes the tied up GUARD #1 
  and races for the elevator.

  He slides a key-card through a reader.  The elevator door 
  opens and he enters.  The door closes and he s gone.

                      (ruminates)
                That Pissarro was our most valuable

                  Actually, the Pissarro was on loan

                Must be a generous guy, loaning out 
                  something so valuable.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                  Actually, one advantage of loaning 
                  a painting to a museum is the 
                savings on an insurance policy -- 
                  assumption being a secure museum is 
                as safe as a bank vault -- I ll get

                The provenance shows a pattern of

                              TOLLNER
                When the Nazis came to power, they 
                passed laws forcing Jews to register 
                  property.  It provided them virtual

  Megan and the museum curator, Ruiz, walk and talk...

                              MEGAN
                Did you know about the Pissarro s 
                  provenance, Mr. Ruiz?

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                  Certainly.  As the museum s 
                curator, I have to know.

                              MEGAN
                Doesn t sound like you were 
                troubled by indications it had once 
                been looted by the Nazis.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                It was a concern.  But we did our 
                due diligence.  The owner s 
                  paperwork was in order.  We were 
                  satisfied with the assurances he 
                provided us.

                              MEGAN
                  Especially given the importance of 
                an acquisition like this one.

                      (beat, eyeing Megan)
                There are many paintings with 
                  problematic provenances, Agent 
                Reeves.  That doesn t mean all of 
                them are Nazi looted art.

                              MEGAN
                Of course, none of those other 
                paintings have increased your 
                admission revenue by fifty percent.

  Ruiz holds Megan s look.

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                I don t deny the Pissarro s been a 
                boon to a small museum like ours.
                      (prickly)
                Maybe the Guggenheim can afford to 
                be more selective, but we can t.

                              MEGAN
                One man s taint is another man s 
                  treasure, is that it?

  Off Megan, fixing Ruiz with a look.

                  Survival.  Pissarro was Jewish, 
                working in Paris at the time of the 
                Dreyfus Affair.  Anti-Semitic mobs 
                were roaming the streets, he feared

                I might have a suspect... 8 years 
                ago, a Mrs. Erika Hellman was 
                notified by the Art Loss Register 
                that the present owner of the 
                Pissarro was trying to sell it --

                              DON
                -- Art Loss Register?

                              TOLLNER
                  A database of lost or looted 
                  artworks.  I ve often seen it come 
                into play with Holocaust claims.  

                              MEGAN
                -- Like this one.  The owner s art 
                dealer checked the Pissarro against 
                the Registry and found Mrs. 
                  Hellman s claim it had been looted 
                from her family by the Nazis...

                              DON
                So, what happened?

                              MEGAN
                She sued the owner -- name s Peyton 
                  Shoemaker -- and lost.  Apparently, 
                there was insufficient 
                  documentation.

  Don seems skeptical.

                There are people she could have 
                paid to do this, Eppes.

                Ness?  He s one of the art thieves 
                Charlie pulled off the database.

                              DAVID
                      (re: his desktop computer)
                The museum records all their 
                security cameras digitally.  I 
                pulled these archived MPEG files 
                from three months ago...

  David punches up the security video.  WE SEE a date-stamped 
  image of JOEL HELLMAN moving around the Pissarro.

                              MEGAN
                ...Mrs. Hellman s grandson, Joel.

                              TOLLNER
                You think he was casing the place?

                              DAVID
                He approached Tucci 3 years ago --

                              MEGAN
                -- About hiring Michael Ness to 
                pull off the theft of the Pissarro.

                              TOLLNER 
                But then Ness got himself caught, 
                couldn t do the job.

                              MEGAN
                Looks like Joel Hellman wasn t 
                willing to take no for an answer.

                                    ACT THREE

  BURN IN:


  Don sits across from Joel Hellman.

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                I don t know any guy named Ronald 
                Wheeler.  Or how he ended up dead.  
                  I haven t done anything.

                              DON
                Then how do you explain your 
                  relationship with Peter Tucci? 

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                That was over three years ago.

                              DON
                About the time the courts decided 
                the case against you... 

                              JOEL HELLMAN 
                I lost my cool.  It was a stupid 
                thing to do...

                              DON
                  I understand how you feel.  I mean, 
                you re all your grandmother had 
                left and you couldn t do anything 
                to help her....

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                They embarrassed her.  Brought in 
                doctors, tested her memory, made 
                her live through things that --

  Joel stops himself.  Don takes out video surveillance stills 
  from the Museum.  Lays them down in front of Joel.

                              DON 
                So you decided to do something 
                about it... 

  Joel s embarrassed that Don has the photos.

                              DON (cont'd)
                These photographs of you at the 
                museum, this wasn t three years 
                ago.  It was three months ago.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    33.

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                I go a lot...  I don t know, 
                somehow it made me feel better to 
                be close to it.

                              DON
                Maybe even better if you had it...

  A beat, as Joel Hellman considers his situation...

                              JOEL HELLMAN
                I told you, I haven t done anything.


  Don enters, Megan, David and Tollner confab...

                              DAVID
                What do you think?

                              DON
                I think he probably thought about 
                stealing the Pissarro three years 
                ago and decided against it.  

                              TOLLNER
                Doesn t look like he made any real 
                efforts to cover his tracks either.

                              MEGAN
                Which leaves the owner, Peyton 
                  Shoemaker, and an insurance scam.  

                              DAVID
                Nice theory, but so far I can t find 
                any paper trail between Shoemaker 
                and our thief, Wheeler.  No payments 
                to a middle man, nothing.

                              DON
                C mon this painting has to be 
                  somewhere.  It can t just disappear 
                into thin air, can it?   


  Amita surveys crime data on a laptop, while Charlie plots it 
  on a pair of diffusion maps showing the world.  WE SEE red 
  pushpins connected by strings (heavier flows of art along 
  specific networks indicated by a higher number of strings 
  along those routes), the largest concentration ending up in 
  China.  Larry enters, takes in the scene.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    34.

                              AMITA
                  ...Here s another.  In 2001, a 
                Degas looted by the Nazis was found 
                in Geneva.  The dealer planned to 
                sell it to a collector in Shanghai.

  Charlie plots it, another pin and string going to China.

                              LARRY
                How goes the Network Diffusion 
                  Probability Model?

                              CHARLIE
                The crime data on the trafficking 
                of Nazi looted art is bearing 
                  significant fruit --

                              LARRY
                -- Poisoned fruit.

                              AMITA
                The numbers are staggering.  The 
                Nazis looted hundreds of thousands 
                of artworks, nearly a fifth of all 
                European art at the time...

                              CHARLIE
                ...A lot of it is still out there -- 
                museums, collectors, dealers...

                              LARRY
                It s appalling...  Blood trade. 

                              CHARLIE
                I m starting to see a pattern, the 
                heaviest flow of artworks running 
                along these networks --

                              LARRY
                -- China seems a prime destination.

                              AMITA
                So we should start concentrating on 
                networks supplying to China.

  Charlie nods.  His CELL RINGS.  He doesn t answer.

                              LARRY 
                You and Alan still fighting?

                              CHARLIE
                It s a standoff.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    35.

                One more chestnut from my 
                  painstaking study of the great 
                  artists...  Did you know Monet s 
                father wanted him to be a grocer?

                              CHARLIE
                Good thing he didn t listen.

                              LARRY
                Fathers imposing their wills on 
                their sons is the stuff of legend.

                              CHARLIE
                This is hardly so grand.  The last 
                message he left equated my refusal 
                to take out the garbage with my 
                supposed commitment-phobia and 
                failure to settle down.  It s nuts.

                              AMITA
                Maybe there s some truth to it.
                      (off Charlie s look)
                ...Just saying.

                              CHARLIE
                      (covering quickly)
                ...Where were we? -- China, right?


  Don enters to find Alan putting out a lasagna.

                                      ACT FOUR

  BURN IN:


  A workshop; TWO WORKERS labor over paintings and sculptures.  
  Megan and David with Arthur Ruiz query PATRICK HOLDEN, 50, 
  smudged fingers, glasses.  He pulls a detailed file card from 
  a drawer chronicling the Pissarro s restoration history.

                              PATRICK HOLDEN
                The painting was taken down June 
                3rd for a cleaning.

                              DAVID
                Who did the work?

                              PATRICK HOLDEN
                Me.  

                              MEGAN
                ...And you also performed the 
                  authentication on the Pissarro when 
                it first arrived at the museum?

                              PATRICK HOLDEN
                That s right.

                              MEGAN
                You re certain that the Pissarro 
                you cleaned June 3rd is the same 
                painting you authenticated eighteen 
                months ago.

                              ARTHUR RUIZ
                  Patrick s been with me for 20 years, 
                I trust his judgment completely.

                              DAVID
                So, there s no chance you missed 
                  something?

                This painting was the most 
                  important piece we ve ever 
                  displayed here...

                              MEGAN
                Mr. Holden?

                              PATRICK HOLDEN
                I m certain that the painting was 
                the same one I examined a year and 
                a half ago.  

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                You have your answer.

  Megan then notices a shelf lined with museum catalogues.

                              MEGAN
                Are you the one who also puts 
                together the museum catalogues?

                              PATRICK HOLDEN
                ...For every exhibition.

                              MEGAN
                The photograph of the Pissarro in 
                the museum catalogue -- when was it 
                taken?

                              PATRICK HOLDEN
                I don t know.  

                              DAVID
                What do you mean, you don t know?

                                ARTHUR RUIZ
                That particular photograph was 
                  furnished by the owner.

                              MEGAN
                You re saying Peyton Shoemaker 
                provided the photo of the Pissarro?

                              PATRICK HOLDEN
                Doesn t always happen, but once in 
                a while an owner loaning a painting 
                does accompany the piece with his 
                own photographic documentation.

  Off which --      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    46.




  Don, Megan, David and Tollner run the facts.

                              MEGAN
                  Shoemaker supplied the photograph 
                in the museum s catalogue when he 
                loaned them the painting.

                              TOLLNER
                ...The same photograph your brother 
                used to determine it was a forgery.

                              DON 
                Which means the painting Shoemaker 
                loaned the museum -- the painting 
                that was stolen -- was a fake.

                              DAVID
                  ...Presuming Charlie s right.

                              MEGAN 
                If the painting was a forgery, do 
                you think Shoemaker knew it?

                              TOLLNER
                      (working the facts)
                ...He may even be the one who had 
                it made.

                              DAVID
                A forgery of his own painting?

                              TOLLNER 
                Often owners have forgeries made to 
                protect their art against theft. 
                But maybe Shoemaker was afraid he d 
                lose the painting another way --

                              DON
                -- The Hellmans.

                              MEGAN
                But Shoemaker won the lawsuit.

                              TOLLNER
                In my experience, these types of 
                claims never really go away.  
                  Collectors shy away from paintings 
                with a taint for that reason... 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #304/41   "Provenance"   SALMON REV   8-28-06    47.

    CONTINUED:3838


                              DAVID
                In other words, if the Hellmans 
                ever found more evidence to support 
                their claim --

                              TOLLNER
                They could go back to court again.

                              DON
                ...So Shoemaker creates a forgery 
                to hedge his bets.

                              MEGAN
                And loans it to the museum to get 
                himself a lower insurance premium.

                              DAVID
                  Shoemaker may even be trying to 
                pull a double scam -- have the fake 
                stolen for insurance, then sell the 
                real painting later on the sly.

                              TOLLNER
                But why steal back the fake 
                Pissarro now?  I mean, it s been in 
                the museum for a year and a half.

                              DON
                      (recalling; to David)
                The tour...  The painting was set 
                to go on a major tour next month.

                              MEGAN
                Which would have meant another 
                  authentication.

                              DAVID
                Fool me once shame on you, fool me 
                twice...

                              MEGAN
                So then where is the real Pissarro?

  Off the question, hanging...

                Look, I worry about it sometimes, 
                too.  I look around and I don t 
                always see the best role models.  
                  Einstein, for example -- he had no 
                time for a home life; so he dumped 
                his wife and married his cousin.

                              ALAN
                I hope this isn t your way of 
                making me feel better...

                              CHARLIE
                I m wrestling with all this, okay? 
                The math, the work with Don, Amita. 
                I m sorry but I don t have it all 
                figured out yet.
                      (off Alan)
                We always knew I was capable of 
                great things.  And in a way, that s 
                a kind of pressure I just don t 
                think you can understand.
                      (off Alan)
                But I did pay the cable bill.

  FBI AGENTS do a search, rifling closets, pulling shelves away 
  from walls, etc.  Shoemaker protests to Megan.

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                You have no right --

                              MEGAN
                -- Actually we have a warrant.

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER 
                This is ludicrous.  You re telling 
                me my painting was a forgery, based 
                on an analysis of a photograph --

                              MEGAN
                -- Which you provided the museum. 
                We ve already notified your 
                  insurance company -- they re 
                  withholding payment.

  Shoemaker looks at Megan, furious --

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                Then I ll take them to court. 

                              MEGAN
                  I wouldn t count on the courts 
                backing your play this time, Mr. 
                  Shoemaker.

                                PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                The Hellmans are behind this, 
                aren t they?  They paid some sleazy 
                math expert who looked at a 
                  photograph and claimed my Pissarro 
                was a fake.  But if they think this 
                is going to get me to settle, 
                they re wrong.

                              MEGAN
                It s an interesting theory, but I m 
                afraid the math consultant works 
                for us.  

                              PEYTON SHOEMAKER
                Why?  Why would I steal my own 
                  painting?  And if it was a fake, 
                why would the Hellman s have fought 
                for four years to get it back?

                Of course there s nothing because I

                If Shoemaker commissioned the fake, 
                then somewhere out there, there s a 
                forger, right?

                Mrs. Hellman s father must have had

                Which means Shoemaker s probably 
                telling the truth.  He didn t know

                looted art, but to exhibit a 
                forgery?

                              MEGAN

                      (in his own world)
                During the first appraisal I had my 
                doubts.  Pissarro s bold strokes of 
                fluid light, the unexpected 
                  granularity, they re unmistakable.  
                The painting was good -- very good  
                -- but it was no Pissarro.

                Maybe for Mrs. Hellman, with the 
                wisdom of years, that s enough.

                              LARRY

                Red meat on the barbecue -- 
                provided we have a barbecue...  
                      (then, to Charlie)
                You got my note, we re out of 
                propane.

                              CHARLIE
                  I figured you d take care of it.
                      (off Alan s look)
                I m kidding.  I got a new tank, 
                we re good to go.

  Alan starts to get up.

                              CHARLIE (cont'd)
                No.  You stay put.  I got it.

                              ALAN
                You re gonna grill? 

                              CHARLIE
                T-bone with Mom s special steak 
                sauce.  She taught me the recipe... 

                              DON
                Need any help?

                              CHARLIE
                Nope.  Think I can handle it. 

  Charlie looks at Alan, smiles, exits.  Don looks at Alan.

                              DON
                Your mom s cousin Anna -- you said 
                she never found anyone, right?

                              ALAN
                That s right.

                              DON
                When you get a chance, if you could 
                give me a list of their names...

                              ALAN
                You re gonna look for them?

                              DON
                I think I d like to try.
