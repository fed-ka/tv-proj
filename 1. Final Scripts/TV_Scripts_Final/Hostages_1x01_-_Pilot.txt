11EXT. SANDERS HOME - NIGHT  

      A bucolic, leafy, residential street in suburban Virginia.  
      Think American Beauty.  Joggers pass.  A dog barks.

      PUSH IN on a large Southern Colonial with a two-car garage 
      and a wraparound porch.  The RUST-COLORED FRONT PORCH SWING 
      squeaks in the wind.  The sound of a TV drifts out...   


22INT. SANDERS HOME, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT  

      The REDSKINS GAME is on, volume cranked up.  CLOSE UPS of the 
      family, sitting on the sofa:    

      BRIAN SANDERS (handsome, crows feet beginning to show), JAKE 
      (15, on the cusp between boy and man), his mom, ELLEN SANDERS 
      (beautiful, takes care of everybody else, neglects herself).  

      A family gathered around the glow of the TV should be a cozy, 
      suburban American scene, right?  But something is wrong here.  
      There is an undercurrent of tension and discomfort... they 
      are sitting in front of the TV, but nobody is watching it. 
      Nor are they speaking, or texting... or anything.  The only 
      motion is the occasional stolen glance among them.  

                                  TV COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
                      ...interception!! What a play! That 
                    was unbelievable! 

      Nobody reacts.  They don t even look toward the TV.  The 
      daughter DANNI (17) enters. Joins the family on the sofa 
      without making eye contact.  Has she been crying?  

      Then the TV clicks off. Silence. WE HOLD for an 
      excruciatingly long beat on the family; nobody speaks, nobody 
      moves.  The floorboards squeak as somebody steps forward...   

      WIDE SHOT - REVEAL FOUR CAPTORS in SKI MASKS surrounding the 
      family with automatic weapons!   

      THE LEAD CAPTOR steps forward.  

                                  LEAD CAPTOR
                    I m not going to repeat myself, so 
                    I suggest you all listen very 
                      carefully...  

      His eyes rake over the family one by one and come to rest on 
      ELLEN. 

      HARD CUT TO TITLE CARD:  

       HOSTAGES                                             12/6/122


      INT. SIBLEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, LOBBY - DAY33

      SUPER:  12 HOURS PREVIOUSLY

      A clutch of reporters and photographers crowd around the 
      podium where PRESIDENT PAUL KINCAID (silver-haired, 
      avuncular) stands at the mic.  ELLEN stands on one side along 
      with various hospital STAFF.

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    ...over 15 million Americans 
                    undergo some form of surgery every 
                    year. As it turns out, being 
                    President of the United States does 
                    not exempt me from joining their 
                    ranks.
                            (self-deprecating smile)
                    It does however give me access to 
                    the kind of medical care that I 
                    believe should be available to 
                    every American... 
                          (a glance at Ellen)
                    So without further ado, let me turn 
                    this over to the woman who will be 
                      performing my surgery, the 
                      infinitely capable Dr. Ellen 
                    Sanders. 

      The President shakes her hand warmly as she steps up to the 
      podium.  She looks out at crowd...  

                                  ELLEN
                    Good morning everyone...
                          (clear, confident)
                    The President has a non-malignant 
                    mass in the upper lobe of his left 
                    lung.  Tomorrow I will resect it.  
                    I've elected to perform the 
                    procedure laprascopically rather 
                    than employing a more traditional 
                    lateral thoractomy.  This will add 
                    an extra hour to the procedure but 
                    it will significantly reduce the 
                      President's recovery time.  Are 
                    there any questions?  

      Several reporters shout out her name:  Dr. Sanders--  until 
      one makes eye contact:

                                  REPORTER #1
                    Dr. Sanders!  You look awfully 
                    young to be a Senior Attending 
                    Surgeon.  How many times have you 
                    performed this type of surgery?                                               12/6/123


                                  ELLEN
                    I ve lost count.  And thank you.  

                                  REPORTER #2
                    How risky is it?  What are the odds 
                    of success?

                                  ELLEN
                    It s a medical procedure, not a 
                    horse race.  I don t give odds.

      Some chuckles from the press corps.  They like her.  And she 
      knows her stuff.

                                  REPORTER #3
                    Dr. Sanders!  How does it feel to 
                    be responsible for the life of the 
                      President?

                                  ELLEN
                    His life is no more important than 
                    that of any of my patients... which 
                    is to say, it s the most important 
                    thing in the world.

      The media eat it up.

      DR. HAROLD SLOAN (Chief of Surgery) edges into the photo op 
      onstage and puts an arm around Ellen s shoulder.   

                                  SLOAN
                    Thank you everybody.  We are very 
                    proud of Ellen s being selected for 
                    this honor.

      Ellen bristles at Sloan s obvious effort to hone in on the 
      spotlight.  But then she makes eye contact with the PRESIDENT 
      across the room.  He rolls his eyes in sympathy and gives her 
      a look--  I know the feeling.  

      They stifle their smiles.  A small, shared moment. 


      EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY44

      The Presidential motorcade pulls away from the hospital.


      I/E. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - DAY55

      Kincaid sits in back with a handful of ADVISORS and his wife 
      MARY.  The First Lady is anxious.                                            12/6/124


                                  MARY
                    ...you don t have to go through 
                    with this, Paul.  You could still 
                    get the Chief Surgeon at Johns 
                    Hopkins.

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    You think I m a fool?

                                  CREASY 
                    I think you re a genius, sir.  

      HENRY CREASY, his Chief-of-Staff, is an old school operative 
      in the mold of James Carville.   

                                  CREASY (CONT D)
                    This puts you way out front on 
                    health care, makes you bulletproof 
                    with patient rights  groups, and 
                    women voters are gonna love this 
                    lady doctor.  She s a great choice.  

    The First Lady glares.  Kincaid just chuckles.

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    Glad to know you care so much about 
                    my health Henry.

                                  CREASY
                    Your approval rating is the measure 
                    of your political health, Mr. 
                    President.   And this is just what 
                    the doctor ordered.

      Kincaid turns to wife, gently reassuring:

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    It s a routine surgery.  She s the 
                    top surgeon at the hospital.  And 
                    it sends a good signal.

                                  CREASY
                          (grins)
                    Call it a win-win.

    The MOTORCADE PULLS plows through traffic on Connecticut Ave.  
      TILT UP to reveal the Washington monument looming ahead.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                            12/6/125


      A PAIR OF BLACK WORK BOOTS MARCH ACROSS A MARBLE FLOOR.

      WE HEAR A WOMAN whimpering. The BOOTS approach and WE FIND 
      the WHIMPERING WOMAN, on her knees.  The barrel of an AR-15 
      ASSAULT RIFLE is placed against her head:

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Shut.  Up.

      She does.  REVEAL WE ARE...


      INT. BANK - DAY66

      Three masked THUGS are holding over a dozen bank employees 
      and customers at gunpoint.  A bank robbery gone bad.

      The THUG LEADER holds the gun to the woman s head.  THUG #2 
      speaks to him quietly, anxiously.

                                  THUG #2
                    What s the plan, man?

      Thug #3 is across the room, peeking out a window-- 

                                  THUG #3
                    Yo. Cops are gatherin  an army out 
                    there!

                                  THUG LEADER
                    They re not gonna make a move as 
                    long as we have the hostages--

      CRACK!!  A SNIPER S BULLET punches through the window and 
      blows THUG #3 off his feet!  Chaos, screams!


      EXT. BANK - DAY77

      A phalanx of Metro police, SWAT and federal agents.

      FBI Agent DUNCAN CARLISLE (dangerous, the kind of guy you 
      want on your side) stands at the make-shift command post.  

                                  DUNCAN (INTO HIS WALKIE)
                    Nice shot.

      A POLICE CAPTAIN comes storming up--

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    What the hell was that?  Who gave 
                    the order to shoot?!                                              12/6/126


                                  DUNCAN
                    I did.

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    Who the hell do you think you are?

                                  DUNCAN
                    The Agent in charge now. 

      He lifts the badge around his neck.

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    This situation is about to explode 
                    and you just threw fuel on the 
                    fire!  I was about to open a line 
                    of communication to start 
                      negotiations.

      He waves a CELL PHONE in front of Duncan s face.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Perfect.  I ll take it from here. 
                    Thanks.

      He snatches the CELL PHONE from the Captain s hand and walks 
      into the middle of the intersection...


      I/E. BANK - CONTINUOUS88

      INSIDE THE BANK the Thug Leader has restored order. A DESK 
      PHONE RINGS.  He snatches it up. 

                                  THUG LEADER
                    You lying cop, son-of-bitch!  I 
                    warned you if a single policeman 
                    tried any-- 

                                  DUNCAN (OVER THE PHONE)
                    The police are no longer in charge.  
                    I m FBI Special Agent Duncan 
                    Carlisle and from this point on, I 
                    am your last, best and only chance 
                    of you walking out of that bank 
                    alive today.  

      The Thug Leader is thrown by Duncan s tone.   

                                  THUG LEADER
                    I have 14 hostages in here! We are 
                    demanding safe transport and--                                            12/6/127


                                  DUNCAN (OVER THE PHONE)
                    Release ten hostages as a sign of 
                    good faith.  Then we ll talk. 

      Click.  The Thug Leader looks up at Thug #2.

                                  THUG LEADER
                    He hung up on me.


      INT. AN ADJACENT SECTION OF THE BANK - DAY99

      A SNIPER TEAM finishes setting up a FLIR (thermal image) 
      scope attached to a laptop.  The image appears: heat 
      signatures of the gunmen and hostages glimpsed through a 
      section of drywall...

                                    SPOTTER (INTO HIS HEADSET)
                    Image is up.


      I/E. BANK - DAY1010

      ON DUNCAN as hears over his earpiece:

                                    SPOTTER (V.O.)
                    ...we have a partial view of the 
                    targets.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Copy that. 

      INSIDE THE BANK

      The two criminals are arguing.

                                  THUG #2
                    ...Tommy is dead!  It s over man, 
                    they ve got us--

                                  THUG LEADER
                    We are not giving up!

      Thug #2 walks away, pissed, hands on his head, gun visible-- 

      INSERT: A THERMAL IMAGE OF THE SAME as he steps into view. 

      OUTSIDE THE BANK

      DUNCAN hears:

                                    SPOTTER (V.O.)
                    We have the shot.  Repeat, we have 
                    the shot.                                            12/6/128


      INSIDE THE BANK

      The phone rings.  The THUG LEADER picks up again.

                                  DUNCAN (V.O.)
                    I don t see any hostages coming out 
                    that door.  Now I m going to count 
                    to three.  

                  THUG LEADERDUNCAN
      What?  I m not sending any One.... Two... Three.
      hostages out!  Not until I 
      get what I want--

                                   DUNCAN (INTO HIS WALKIE)
                    Take it.

      CRACK!  The bullet bursts through the wall in a puff of 
      plaster!  Thug Leader spins in time to see Thug #2 fall!  
      Looks around wildly, panicked-- 

                                  THUG LEADER
                    Okay!  Okay!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. BANK - A FEW MINUTES LATER1111

      Thirteen hostages stream out the front door.  Tears of relief 
      as they are hustled to safety by police.   

      DUNCAN, the POLICE CAPTAIN and others at the command center.  
      The cell phone is patched into a speaker.

                                  THUG LEADER (V.O.)
                    ...that s all the hostages free 
                    except one.  I kept my end of the 
                    deal.  Where s my transport?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Pulling up outside.  It ll take you 
                    straight to the private airfield, 
                    as agreed.   

      Duncan gives a nod and a BLUE 4X4 pulls up in front of the 
      bank.  The DRIVER keeps the engine running. 

                                  THUG LEADER (V.O.)
                    Okay, I m coming out.  Everybody 
                    stay back or this guy s a dead man.

      ALL EYES on the front door of the bank as it inches open...                                              12/6/129


          A frightened-looking BUSINESSMAN in a rumpled suit exits 
      first, his hands held behind his back. The MASKED THUG 
      follows close behind, using him as a human shield.

      COPS, FEDS, SNIPERS watch helplessly as the two figures inch 
      down the steps toward the vehicle.

      ON DUNCAN as he stares intently. Then... he steps around the 
      perimeter and starts toward them!    

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hey!  Hold it right there!

      The BUSINESSMAN and the MASKED THUG look up; the 
      Businessman s eyes go wide as he sees Duncan lift his gun--

      He doesn t have a clear shot on the Masked Thug but-- 

      BANG! BANG!  Duncan shoots the BUSINESSMAN instead.  Screams 
    and shouts of surprise-- POLICE IN BODY-ARMOR spring forward 
    and wrestle the MASKED THUG to the ground.

      DUNCAN walks calmly forward.  He arrives as they pull the ski 
      mask off the THUG to REVEAL... a terrified civilian with his 
      mouth duct-taped shut and his hands tied together!

    PAN OVER to the  BUSINESSMAN  who s hands were not tied 
      behind his back but in fact concealed a pistol.    

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    He switched places with the 
                    hostage...

                                  DUNCAN
                    Boots didn t match his suit.

      ANGLE ON the Businessman s BOOTS... the ones we saw earlier 
    on the Thug Leader.  Duncan turns to go.  

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    You shot a man based on that?  What 
                    if you d been wrong?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (keeps walking)
                    I wasn t.


      INT. HOSPITAL - DAY1212

      Amid the hospital bustle we FIND ELLEN and her friend, LENA 
      KWAN (a no-nonsense resident) at a cheap coffee dispenser by 
      the elevators.  Ellen finishes filling two Styrofoam cups--                                             12/6/1210


                                  ELLEN
                    Sloan already resents me enough--

                                  LENA
                    Because your online ratings are 
                    three points higher than his?

                                  ELLEN
                    --now he s really going to have it 
                    in for me.  He s convinced the 
                    White House passed him over for me 
                    because I m a woman.  He s the 
                    Chief of Surgery.  

      They walk down the hall.

                                  LENA
                    He s also sewed more sponges into 
                    his patients than stitches.  
                    Sloan s a bureaucrat, you re a rock 
                    star.  Embrace your destiny, Ellen.    

      Ellen laughs.  Lena peels off to do her rounds.  Ellen looks 
      ahead and notices...

      A JANITOR (male, 20s) exits her office.  The Janitor moves 
      off furtively as Ellen approaches.  She looks after him for a 
      beat... feels something is wrong, but shakes it off.


      INT. ELLEN S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER1313

      The cluttered space of a doctor who is always in the ER and 
      never at her desk.  Ellen picks up the land line and pauses 
      as she starts to dial--  among the FAMILY PHOTOS on her 
      desktop, one of the 8X10 frames is empty... strange.  She 
      scans her desk for the missing photo distractedly as she 
      dials.


      INT. PENTHOUSE OFFICE FLOOR - DAY1414

      An unoccupied office space with sweeping views.  BRIAN, in a 
      nice suit, and his partner, PETE NICOLS, shake hands with a 
      departing group of BUSINESSMEN.   

                                  DEPARTING BUSINESSMAN
                    ...it s a great space, but I m 
                    afraid it s too big for us.  Thanks 
                    for your time.

      Brian and Nicols nod understandingly as the men exit.  As 
      soon as they are gone, Nicols drops the smile...                                            12/6/1211


                                  NICOLS
                    I thought you had them sewed up?  

                                  BRIAN
                    I thought I did...

                                  NICOLS
                    When you brought me into this deal 
                    you guaranteed me you could lease 
                    the building inside a month, Brian.  
                    It s been four.  

                                  BRIAN
                    I know.  I know... 

                                  NICOLS
                    I trusted you.  Now either you get 
                    this done or I m pulling out of the 
                    deal.  
                          (holds up a hand)
                    End of story.

      Nicols turns to go.  Brian calls after him:

                                  BRIAN
                    C mon Pete, don t be like that.  
                    How long have we known each 
                    other...?  

                                  NICOLS
                          (without stopping)
                    Long enough for me to know when 
                    you re full of crap.

      The door shuts after him, leaving Brian alone... up shit s 
      creek. 

      His cell phone rings.  He fishes it out and checks the 
      number.  Forces a smile: 

                                  BRIAN
                    Hey honey.  How are you?


      INT. ELLEN S OFFICE - DAY1515

      Ellen gives up searching for the photo.

                                  ELLEN
                      Exhausted.                                            12/6/1212


                                  BRIAN (V.O.)
                    I m sorry I couldn t be there for 
                    the Press Conference.  You know I 
                    tried to reschedule the meeting...

      Ellen tamps down her disappointment and cuts him off:

                                  ELLEN
                    It s all right, I understand.  
                          (an awkward pause)
                    How did your meeting go?  

      INTERCUT 

      Brian looks around the empty space.    

                                  BRIAN
                    Great.  It all went perfectly. How 
                    about you?

      HIGH ANGLE POV of her alone. As if we re spying on her...  

                                  ELLEN
                    Oh it was nothing.  I barely had to 
                    speak...  I thought I d come home 
                    early and make dinner tonight.

                                  BRIAN
                    You remember I m coaching lacrosse 
                    after work?

                                  ELLEN
                    Oh right.  Then I ll see you after.   

                                  BRIAN
                    Okay hon.  Love you.

      They both hang up.  Neither one feeling particularly good 
      about the lies each told the other...


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - DAY1616

      A UTILITY VAN is parked across the street.

      ARCHER PETIT (wiry and quick-tempered) and MARIA GONZALES 
      (pretty, tough) are staking out the house.  A NEIGHBOR exits 
      a house next door and walks to his car...

                                  ARCHER
                    What do you think that place would 
                    go for these days?  One point-six?  
                      One-seven?                                            12/6/1213


                                  MARIA
                          (slight accent)
                    Don t know, don t care.  You re not 
                    paying me that well for this gig.

                                  ARCHER
                      Definitely over one-five.  What 
                    kind of a jackass lives in a house 
                    worth that kind of money and drives 
                    a car made in Korea?  It s 
                    downright un-American.

                                  MARIA
                    That s funny coming from a man who 
                    has fought under the color of how 
                    many flags?

                                  ARCHER
                    It s called the free market.  It s 
                      a fundamentally American concept.

      The neighbor drives off in his Hyundai.  Archer begins 
      loading up a tool kit with mysterious high-tech gear.

                                  ARCHER (CONT D)
                    This ll be an in-and-out operation, 
                    fully compartmentalized.  I.D. by 
                    code number only for the next 
                      twenty-four hours. I m three.   
                    You re four.

                                  MARIA
                          (mock offended)
                    I m a four? 

                                  ARCHER
                    You re a ten, honey, that s why 
                    it s such a clever code name.

      He pulls on a repairman s jacket.  Goes to exit the van--  

                                  MARIA
                    Hey... do you trust this guy we re 
                    working for?

                                  ARCHER
                    With my life.

      Archer unwraps a piece of raw STEAK and gets out.  A dog 
      barks.  Archer crosses the street, makes sure nobody s 
      looking, then let s himself in the side-gate with a hidden 
      key.  A beat. The dog stops barking.                                            12/6/1214


      INT. VAN - MOMENTS LATER1717

      Maria climbs into the back.  REVEAL a sophisticated mobile-
      command set up.  She puts on a headset.

                                  ARCHER (V.O.)
                    I m in.

                                  MARIA
                    Copy that.  I m just coming on-
                    line...

      One of the screens suddenly shows an image of ARCHER inside 
      the house.  It s a surveillance camera view of him installing 
      a hidden camera in the living room.

                                  MARIA (CONT D)
                    Image is up. Living room looks 
                    good.

      Archer mugs for the camera.  Blows her a kiss as he steps 
      away. He moves off to bug the rest of the house. 


      EXT. SUBURBAN UNDERPASS - DAY1818

      JAKE SANDERS and his friend KEVIN take advantage of the 
      sloped concrete to practice their skateboard moves.  

        A pimped-out Escalade with a thudding bass rolls up.  As the 
      boys turn to look the driver guns the engine! They leap back 
      as it skids to a halt.  Doors flies open--

      NICO (all sinew and menace) gets out of the driver s side.  A 
      couple of bad-looking BUDDIES follow him.  

                                  NICO
                    Hey. You weren t scared, were you?

      He marches right up to Jake... then breaks into a smile.     

                                  JAKE
                    No way, we knew it was you, Nico.

                                  NICO
                    Yeah right.  You like my new ride?
                          (turns to his crew)
                    Check it out.  These are my new 
                    proteg s here. Yorktown s finest.

      The teens chin nod to the crew.  Nico drapes an arm over 
      Jake s shoulder and walks with the boys.                                               12/6/1215


                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    So how s it going, young man? 

                                  JAKE
                    Great.  Crazy actually. We have 
                    kids coming to us now, seniors 
                    even, asking for a hook up. 

                                  KEVIN
                    We sold almost everything you gave 
                    us.

                                  NICO
                    You boys are gonna go far.  Get 
                    this done, and I ll take you to the 
                    next level. 

      He fakes a slap to Kevin s head-- makes him flinch.  He 
      laughs and heads back to his Escalade.  


      INT. HOSPITAL, INTENSIVE CARE WING - DAY1919

      A MAN walks down the shiny-floored corridor carrying flowers.  
      PULL BACK TO REVEAL DUNCAN -- the hard-ass FBI agent.   

      He arrives at a ROOM as a NURSE (50s) is exiting.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hello Delores.  How s she doing 
                    today?

                                  NURSE
                          (smiles warmly)
                    No change Mr. Carlisle.  But she 
                    always looks a little more peaceful 
                    to me after your visits.


      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY2020

      A WOMAN lies in a coma, hooked up to machines.  Duncan moves 
      to her bedside and speaks softly:

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hello Nina.

      He changes the flowers, sits down beside her.  He strokes her 
      hand tenderly.  We almost feel like we re intruding as he 
      leans over and gently kisses her cheek.   

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Hang in there darling.  It won t be 
                    long now.                                              12/6/1216


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - DAY2121

      SOMEBODY S POV THROUGH A WINDSHIELD - as Ellen pulls up in 
      her Volvo.  Parks and walks up the front porch steps. 


      INT. SANDERS HOME - DAY2222

      Ellen unlocks the door and drops her purse.  

                                  ELLEN
                    Anybody home?

        A scrabbling of nails on floorboards, then A GOLDEN LAB 
      bounds up to her.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    Okay Barkley, okay.  You love me.

      As Ellen walks into the frame.  She gives the dog a biscuit, 
      opens the back door.  As she crosses through the kitchen and 
      into a hallway--

      INT. SANDERS HOME - HALLWAY/DANNI S ROOM - DAY2424

      Ellen walks down the hall off the kitchen.  

                                  ELLEN
                    Danni?  Are you home?

      The door at the end of the hall to Danni s room is ajar... 
      she knocks lightly and opens it.

      DANNI is on her bed, laptop open.  Looks up, removes her 
      headphones.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    Hi Honey.  How was your day?

                                  DANNI
                    Not as exciting as yours.

                                  ELLEN
                    It was just a press conference.                                            12/6/1217


                                  DANNI
                    With the President. 
                          (beat)
                    Did Dad show?

                                  ELLEN
                    He had to work... 
                            (apologizing for him)
                    ...he s got a big deal he s in the 
                    middle of closing Danni.

                                  DANNI
                    Yeah.  Right.

      Danni barely conceals her contempt for her mother s co-
      dependent behavior.  She puts her headphones back on and 
      tunes out.  Ellen is left standing in the doorway for a 
      beat... Finally she retreats, closing the door.

      INTERCUT - SURVEILLANCE VIEW of the SAME.


      EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY2525

      High school lacrosse practice. BRIAN is on the sideline, 
      changed into sweats, coach s whistle around his neck.

      Jake and Kevin are among the players, bringing up the rear as 
      the team runs laps.


      INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER2626

      The kids are lacing up shoes, packing up gym bags, etc.  

                                  BRIAN (O.S.)
                    EVERYBODY GATHER UP!  NOW!

      Brian stalks into the locker room, carrying a BROWN PAPER 
      BAG.  The team quiets down and gathers around.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    I found this hidden in one of the 
                    equipment lockers...

      He holds up the paper bag, then dumps out the contents onto a 
      trainer s table:  several ROLLS OF CASH and a handwritten 
      list of dollar amounts and initials.  

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Somebody want to tell me who this 
                    belongs to?  Cause it smells very 
                    fishy to me.                                            12/6/1218


      PAN OVER the faces of the kids.  Nobody speaks.  Jake and 
      Kevin exchange a worried glance.   

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Tell you what, either somebody 
                    speaks up or this entire team is 
                    going to be punished.

      A long pause.  Kevin looks at Jake -- shakes his head very 
      slightly.  But Jake... stands.  

                                  JAKE
                    It s mine.

      Kevin (reluctantly) follows his lead and stands as well.

                                  KEVIN
                    Ours.  

      Brian turns his gaze on Jake.  Surprised.  Disappointed.  
      Everybody in the room watches to see how Jake will play this.  

                                  JAKE
                    It s beer money.  We took up a 
                      collection, for a party.

      Brian looks to Kevin, who looks down, feigning shame.  

                                  BRIAN
                    That s an awful lot of beer.

                                  JAKE
                    We were gonna buy fake I.D. s.

      Brian takes a deep breath.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Kevin, I m going to have to talk to 
                    your parents...  Jake... let s go.

      He scoops up the cash and heads out. 

      Kevin turns to Jake and mouths:  what the f--? 

                                  JAKE
                    Beats the truth bro.  

      Shoulders his bag and heads out after his father.                                             12/6/1219


      EXT. MALL - SUNSET2727

      DUNCAN walks between the rows of Cherry Blossoms carrying a 
      CHILD S SPONGE-BOB BACKPACK.  He turns to see his five year-
      old daughter SAWYER meandering behind.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Sawyer, can you please walk with 
                    daddy?

      Sawyer shakes her head and stops.  On strike.  Duncan 
      surrenders and walks back to her.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Come on Soy-Soy, don t you want to 
                    see grandpa?  I packed you a bunch 
                    of nice dresses...

      Opens the back pack to show her.

                                  SAWYER
                    I don t want those.  I want my red 
                    Hello Kitty dress!
                          (bursts into tears)
                    When is mommy coming home?  I want 
                    mommy!

      Duncan gets on his knees.  His heart breaks for her.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Do you know mommy and I met right 
                    here, under these trees?  They re 
                    her favorite in the whole world.
                          (Sawyer stops crying)
                    Aren t they beautiful?  

      BURTON DALY (aging warrior with plenty of game left in him) 
      sneaks up behind Sawyer and covers her eyes. She turns:

                                  SAWYER
                    Grandpa!

      She jumps into his arms.  He loves this little girl.

      MOMENTS LATER

      A wide shot of the two men standing to the side of a little 
      playground, watching Sawyer climb up a slide the wrong way.

                                  BURTON
                    Any change in her condition?

      Duncan shakes his head.  They both watch the little girl play 
      for a moment in silence.  Burton sighs heavily.                                            12/6/1220


                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Are you sure you want to do this?

                                  DUNCAN
                    I already am.

      The two men look at one another.  Burton embraces him.

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    Is everything okay, Daddy?

      They separate and look down at the little girl standing 
      there.  Duncan smiles and bends to hug her good-bye.  He 
      holds her for an extra long beat.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I love you Soy-Soy.

      STAY ON DUNCAN as he watches Burton lead her away, holding 
      her tiny hand in his.  Duncan steels himself.


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - NIGHT2828

      Archer and Maria s VAN is now in shadow across the street.  
      Brian pulls up with Jake in a BMW.  Parks in the garage.


      INT. SANDERS HOME, KITCHEN/FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT2929

      Ellen is working on an elaborate dinner-- pots simmering on 
      multiple burners, cookbooks open.  Jake enters. 

                                  JAKE
                    Hey Mom.  What are you doing home?  
                    Did you get fired?

                                  ELLEN
                    I came home early to make dinner.  
                    Is that so unusual. 

                                  JAKE
                    Uh yeah. Barkley!! Hey boy!   

                                  ELLEN
                    I let him out back...

      Brian enters, still scowling at Jake.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    What s wrong?                                            12/6/1221


                                  BRIAN
                          (to Jake)
                    You want to tell your mother or 
                    should I?

      Jake rolls his eyes.  Opens the back door and whistles for 
      his dog.  

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Jake and Kevin took up a collection 
                    to get fake I.D. s and alcohol.  

      Ellen turns to Jake who is already on his way up the stairs.

                                  JAKE
                    Beer.  We were gonna buy beer.

      INT. ARCHER S VAN - NIGHT3030

      Archer and Maria have the whole house wired now.  Half a 
      dozen screens show multiple views of the house.  A cell phone 
      rings:

                                  MAN (V.O.)
                    This is Two.  We are en route.

                                  ARCHER (INTO HEADSET)
                    Copy that, Two.  Three and Four are 
                    already in position. Standing-by.

      He nods to Maria.  She looks more closely at a SURVEILLANCE 
      CAMERA showing Danni, alone in her room, sitting on her bed. 
      Maria turns up the audio.  WE HEAR crying... 

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:


      INT. DANNI S ROOM - NIGHT3131

      Danni cries alone in her room, raw and exposed.  A  DING  
      from her computer draws her attention.  She opens it and sees 
      an invitation to VIDEO CHAT. Clicks  ACCEPT.   A VIDEO IMAGE 
      of her best friend AMELIA (17) pops up.

                                  DANNI
                    Hey.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    Your eyes are all puffy.  You ve 
                    been crying again.                                              12/6/1222


                                  DANNI
                          (through tears)
                    You re so perceptive.  You should 
                    be a detective.

      They both laugh.

      INTERCUT - MARIA in the SURVEILLANCE VAN, tapping into the 
      chat electronically, eavesdropping on everything.

                                  AMELIA
                    Are you gonna talk to your Mom?

                                  DANNI
                    No.  God no.  

      Danni plucks tissues from a box and blows her nose.  Her Mom 
      is the last person she wants advice from.


      INT. JAKE S ROOM - NIGHT3232

      Jake closes the door, dumps his bag, then carefully removes 
      the front panel of the bed s base and pulls out a SAFE BOX.

      He punches in a code and opens it.  Inside are several bags 
      of weed, a small amount of cash and an extra cell phone.  
      There is a TEXT waiting:

      NICO:  YOU MOVE THE REST OF THAT STUFF? 

      Jake types back...  YEA. 

      NICO:  THAT S MY BOY! YOU CAN BRING ME MY $$ TONIGHT. 10PM. 

      Jake grips the phone, uncertain how to respond... starts to 
      type:   TONIGHT S NOT GOOD  but another text comes in before 
      he hits send:

      NICO:  DON T BE A BITCH.  SHOW ON TIME. 

      Jake deletes his own text.  

                                  JAKE
                    Shit!


      INT. KITCHEN/FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT3333

      Brian watches a replay of Ellen s press conference with the 
      President on TV.  Ellen chops vegetables in the kitchen.  
      Looks up over the counter as Brian approaches.                                            12/6/1223


                                  BRIAN
                    You were good.  I m really proud of 
                    you.

      He comes around and takes the knife from her hand.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Let me.  You should relax.  You 
                    have a big day tomorrow.

      He kisses her on the cheek.  She smiles and gives way.

                                  ELLEN
                    I could use a shower before we sit 
                    down to eat.

      Danni enters the kitchen from the hall.  No sign she s been 
      crying or upset.  She s a good actress this one.

                                  BRIAN
                    Hey.  Where are you going?

                                  DANNI
                    Out.  

                                  ELLEN
                    I was planning a family dinner 
                      tonight... I made risotto.

                                  DANNI
                    Save me some.

                                  BRIAN
                    Danni.  It s important to your 
                    mother that we spend some quality 
                    time together. 

      Danni looks aggrieved.  She turns to Ellen.

                                  DANNI
                    Does it even count as  quality 
                    time  if it s compulsory? 

      Ellen is torn.  Doesn t want to stand up to her daughter.  

                        BRIANELLEN
      You re staying--It s not that important.

      Brian and Ellen look at one another -- fundamentally at odds 
      over how to handle their kid.  At home, he s the 
        disciplinarian; she s the doormat.  

      Danni takes the stalemate as an opening and slips out of the 
      kitchen to get her bag.                                            12/6/1224


      Brian shrugs at Ellen as if to say:  that s what you get if 
      you don t put your foot down. 


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - NIGHT3434

      The house is quiet.  The front porch swing sways slightly.  
      PAN TO the VAN parked across the street in shadow.

      WE HEAR A CELL PHONE RING. 

                                  ARCHER (V.O.)
                    This is three.  Go ahead.

                                  MAN (V.O.)
                    This is two.  Arriving on site.

      A NAVY TAHOE crosses the frame-- TRACK WITH THIS VEHICLE as 
      it passes the SANDERS  street and turns down the road 
      bordering the woods behind their house.

      It rolls to a halt ending in a CLOSE UP on the DRIVER: KRAMER 
      DALY (30s, slim, long hair).  He kills the lights.

                                  MAN/KRAMER
                          (into his earpiece)
                    We re in place.  

      INTERCUT - ARCHER and MARIA in the back of their VAN.   They 
      have guns prepped.   

                                  ARCHER
                    Copy that.  Targets are in place.  

      RESUME - AROUND BACK OF THE HOUSE

      Kramer takes a deep breath.  Reaches into a black bag in the 
      center console and takes out a mask.  A gun.  He turns toward 
      the person in the passenger seat who we haven t seen:

                                  KRAMER
                    Are you ready?

      PAN OVER TO REVEAL Number One is -- Duncan Carlisle.   

                                  DUNCAN
                    Let s do it.

      He holsters his gun and pulls on the MASK.  CUT TO BLACK.

      ACT OUT.                                            12/6/1225


      ACT ONE


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - BACK OF PROPERTY - NIGHT3535

      A HIGH VIEW of the HOUSE: the property backs onto a wooded 
      area with a generous quarter-acre set back, enclosed by a 
      high wood fence.  CAMERA DESCENDS through the trees, finds...

      DUNCAN and KRAMER, masked, in black, silently approach the 
      back gate. [Note: each mask will be slightly different, so we 
      can tell the Captors apart.] Duncan easily picks the lock.

                                  DUNCAN (INTO MIC)
                    This is number one.  We re in.

                                  ARCHER (V.O.)
                    Houston, we have a problem...


      I/E. VAN - NIGHT3636

      Archer is looking at the front of the house; he sees Danni 
      walking out the front door. 

                                  ARCHER (INTO HIS WALKIE) 
                    ...the girl just left the house.

      Maria looks up from loading cartridges into guns. 

                                  ARCHER (CONT D)
                    What s the call boss?   

      A beat.  Danni walks down the path toward the sidewalk.

                                  DUNCAN (V.O.)
                    The operation is a go.  Have Number 
                    Four follow the girl.  

      Maria hears the command as well.  She shrugs on a sweatshirt 
      and tucks a GUN behind her back  She moves to exit the van.  

                                  ARCHER
                    Hey.  Don t forget this...

      He tosses her a mask.  She takes it and slips out of the van. 


      INT. JAKE S ROOM - NIGHT3737

      Jake sits by the open window, dialing his cell.  

                                  KEVIN
                    Hey.                                            12/6/1226


                                  JAKE
                    Where have you been?  I ve been 
                    calling and calling--

                                  KEVIN (V.O.)
                    My Mom tripped on me over the beer 
                    thing.  Took away my cell, my 
                    laptop, my ipad... Good thing Nico 
                    got us these extra phones--

                                  JAKE
                    Listen to me.  Nico wants his cash.  
                    Tonight.

                                  KEVIN (V.O.)
                    What?! Did you tell him we don t 
                    have it?

                                  JAKE
                    Kevin.  The guy took a baseball bat 
                    to some college kid who owed him 
                    like 200 bucks.  You want to tell 
                    him we lost twelve hundred? 

                                  KEVIN (V.O.)
                    Shit!  ...we are so dead.

                                  JAKE
                    Just start figuring out where we 
                    can get that money--

      Jake hears a noise in the bushes outside.

                                  JAKE (CONT D)
                    I ll call you later.
                          (yells)
                    Barkley!

      Jake dashes out of the room.


      EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT3838

      IN THE BUSHES - Duncan stills the branch that Kramer swiped 
      with his duffel.  Off his hand signal they split up.

      TRACK WITH DUNCAN as he jogs in a crouch toward the back of 
      the house, careful to side-step the motion sensor for the 
      security light. He knows his way around.

      SIDE OF THE HOUSE - Duncan goes directly to a double hung 
      window at ground level.  It s unlocked.  He slides it open 
      and slips inside.  He leaves it open.                                            12/6/1227


      EXT. DRUGSTORE, LEE HIGHWAY - NIGHT3939

      POV from across the street -- Danni enters the brightly lit 
      store.  Through the glass door WE SEE her glance around, 
      anxious not to be seen by anybody she knows. 


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - FRONT YARD -  NIGHT4040

      Archer moves toward the house, mask in hand.  Glances 
      around... then heads for the side yard. 


      INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT4141

      Danni waits impatiently in the check-out line, clutching an 
      (unseen) item to be purchased.  Her phone rings.  She glances 
      at the number and her face flushes:  her boyfriend BOYD.

                                  DANNI
                    Hey you...

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                    I ve been thinking about you all 
                    day.  What are you doing tonight?  

                                  DANNI
                    I have an essay to write that was 
                    due yesterday, but somebody keeps 
                      distracting me.

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                    Well if you re already late then 
                    what s the hurry?

      Danni stifles a laugh that turns into a little sob.

                                  DANNI
                    I can t talk know. 

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                    What s the matter?

      She sniffs.  

                                  DANNI
                    Nothing.

      He can tell something is wrong.

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                    I want to see you.  Where are you?

      ANGLE ON MARIA watching from one of the aisles.                                            12/6/1228


                                  DANNI
                    I m fine.  I m just at the 
                    drugstore on Lee Highway--

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                    I ll drive over--

                                  DANNI
                    No, I have to go home.

      The SALES CLERK signals Danni to step forward.

                                  BOYD (V.O.)
                    I ll be there in fifteen. Just wait 
                    for me.

      She wants to say yes... finally: 

                                  DANNI
                    I can t.  My Mom cooked all this 
                    stuff for a family dinner... I ve 
                    tortured her enough just by going 
                    out.  I should at least go back and 
                    eat with them. 

      She pays in cash, avoiding the eyes of the Sales Clerk who 
      bags her item.  Danni takes it and hurries off.

                                  DANNI (CONT D)
                    I ll text you when we re done.  I 
                    can sneak out later.

      She moves to the exit.  Maria follows from a safe distance.


      EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT4242

      Jake steps out into the darkness, looking for his dog... 

                                  JAKE
                      Barkley...  Barkley!

      JAKE moves into the shrubbery, parting branches, pushing 
      deeper into the pools of shadow...

      HAND-HELD POV - approaching JAKE from behind, through the 
      leaves...

      JAKE freezes in his tracks as he sees -- Barkley s rear leg! 

                                  JAKE (CONT D)
                    Barkley!                                            12/6/1229


      Jake takes a step forward and sees the dog lying motionless 
      on his side, tongue out.  Suddenly he is grabbed from behind!  
      A powerful hand covers his mouth. 


      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT4343

      Ellen is in the shower, trying to wash away her stress.  As 
      she turns off the water and reaches for a towel, she hears 
      the door open... she turns, covering herself.  Relaxes as she 
      sees it s only Brian.  

                                  ELLEN
                    You scared me.

                                  BRIAN
                    Who d you think I was?

      She smiles and shakes off her nerves.  Their eyes meet 
      through the steam.  They hold the look for a beat... 

                                  ELLEN
                          (offhand)
                    How long till dinner is ready?

        Tentatively, she lowers the towel partway... an invitation?

      A BUZZING SOUND breaks the mood.  Brian looks at his phone.

      INSERT CU ON BRIAN S PHONE --  1 NEW TEXT MESSAGE. 

                                  BRIAN
                    That s the timer for the Risotto.  
                    I have to go turn it off.

      If she suspects a lie, she doesn t show it.  She nods.  Wraps 
      herself back up in the towel.  

                                  ELLEN
                    I ll see you downstairs.

      He leaves.  HOLD ON ELLEN as she catches a sight of herself 
      in the mirror.  She stares at her reflection.  Is she happy?  
      It s not a question she wants to answer...   


      EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT4444

      Maria follows Danni from a distance.  Danni slows as she 
      approaches her house, on edge.  She clutches her shoulder bag 
      and turns to look behind her.  Nobody.  She takes a breath.

      Danni goes to the garage.  Punches in the code and the door 
      rolls up. She disappears inside.  The door starts to close...                                             12/6/1230


      A lithe, dark figure darts from the shadows -- rolls 
      underneath the garage door like a ninja just before it shuts.  

      INSIDE THE GARAGE - MARIA rises.  As the garage door slowly 
      rolls shut behind her... she pulls on her mask. 


      INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT4545

      Ellen finishes blow drying her hair.  A knock on the door.  

                                  ELLEN
                    I ll be right out.

      Another knock.  More insistent.  She turns off the dryer.  

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    I said, one minute!

      A third knock.  She rolls her eyes and finally throws open 
      the door.  Stops dead in her tracks as she sees...

      BRIAN sitting on the edge of the bed.  A MASKED MAN (ARCHER) 
      holds a gun to his head.  She covers her mouth.  

      She turns as A SECOND MASKED MAN (DUNCAN) steps from behind 
      the door.  He points a gun in her face. 


      INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT4646

      Danni enters, sits on the toilet seat, still holding her bag. 

      IN THE B.G. WE HEAR somebody has turned on the TV loudly in 
      the living room-- it s the Redskins game from the TEASER.  
    The sound bleeds through the walls as...

      Danni takes a deep breath and pulls out the item she bought 
    at the drugstore: a HOME PREGNANCY TEST.  She tears it open 
    and stares at it for a long moment.  Frightened...

      Finally she slides it underneath to pee on the stick.  After 
      a few seconds she pulls it out.  Before she sees the result--

      The doorknob starts to turn.  

                                  DANNI
                    Hey-- I m in here!   

      She moves to stop the door but she s not fast enough. It 
      swings open and Danni finds herself face-to-face with a 
      MASKED FIGURE (MARIA) who clamps a gloved hand over Danni s 
      mouth before she can scream.  The HPT stick drops unnoticed 
      into the laundry hamper.                                            12/6/1231


      INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT4747

      Ellen, Brian and Jake are seated facing the TV.  We have been 
      here before.  Again the TV Announcer goes crazy for a big 
      play... again nobody pays attention.  But now we know why.

      Kramer finishes closing all the curtains. Maria leads Danni 
      in to join the others.  Danni blinks back tears and sits. 
      Duncan signals Archer to kill the TV.  

      Then Duncan steps forward and lowers his gun: 

                                  DUNCAN
                    I m not going to repeat myself, so 
                    I suggest you all listen very 
                      carefully.  We have no desire to 
                    hurt you.  We have one specific 
                    goal here.  Once we achieve it, we 
                    will leave you in peace.  But I 
                    warn you; do not test us. Do not 
                    try to be heroes.   

      He looks from face-to-face with his piercing gaze.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Cell phones, tablets, ipods.  

      Maria goes around with a bag collecting all communication 
      devices.  Brian is glaring at Duncan.

                                  BRIAN
                    What do you want from us?

      Archer nudges Brian softly from behind and leans close.  

                                  ARCHER
                    Didn t you get the memo, Bri?  Keep 
                    your mouth shut and do as you re 
                    told.

      Brian looks at Archer with fear and anger... even through the 
      mask WE CAN see that ARCHER is smiling.  Daring Brian to make 
      a move.   

                                  DUNCAN
                    Dr. Sanders.  I need you to come 
                    upstairs with me.

                                  DANNI
                          (panicked)
                    Mom!                                            12/6/1232


                                  BRIAN
                          (starts to stand)
                    You re not taking my wife upstairs 
                    alone--

      THUMP!  Archer shoves Brian back down. In a flash he has his 
      gun pressed to Brian s head.  He cocks it--

                                  ARCHER
                    Didn t I just tell you to shut up?

                                  ELLEN
                    NO!!  Brian!!  Don t. It s... it s 
                    okay!  Danni, Jake, it s all right!  

      She stands up, trying to reassure her family and cool down 
      the Captors who are tense, fingers on triggers.  The kids are 
      terrified, blinking back tears...

      Ellen looks to Duncan. He gives her a barely perceptible nod 
      of encouragement: calm them.  She turns to her family.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    ...I ll be fine.  Everything will 
                    be okay.  Just... do as they say. 

      Duncan gives Archer a look.  Archer lowers his gun.  Brian is 
      breathing rapidly.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Listen to your wife, Mr. Sanders.

                                  ELLEN
                    I ll be right back.

      Duncan takes Ellen by the arm and leads her up the stairs.  
      Her family watch her go.


      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT4848

      Duncan shuts the door behind himself.  Ellen retreats until 
      she runs into the bed.  Looks at him in fear. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    Do you love your family, Ellen?

                                  ELLEN
                    Of course.  Very much... why are 
                    you doing this?                                            12/6/1233


                                  DUNCAN
                    Tomorrow you will be operating on 
                    the President.  He will die during 
                    the surgery.

                                  ELLEN
                    What?  I don t understand.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Yes you do, Ellen.  Tomorrow 
                    morning, you are going to kill the 
                    President of the United States.  

                                  ELLEN
                          (faintly)
                    It s not possible.

                                  DUNCAN
                    It is.  We ve worked out all the 
                    details.  Do this for us, and 
                      twenty-four hours from now it will 
                    be like this nightmare never 
                    happened.  
                          (looks her in the eye)
                    Otherwise we will kill your family. 

      Ellen reacts like she s been punched in the gut.  Literally 
      staggers.  Duncan puts out a strong arm to catch her.  He 
      holds her, their faces close.   

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    So I ll ask you one more time. Do 
                    you love your family, Ellen?

      ON ELLEN as the impossibility of her situation sinks in. 

      ACT OUT.                                            12/6/1234


      ACT TWO


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - NIGHT4949

      All quiet on the suburban street outside.  Meanwhile...


      INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT5050

      The most tense family dinner you have ever seen.  Dishes are 
      passed. Food is chewed and swallowed.  But it s doubtful 
      anybody tastes anything with two masked GUNMEN keeping watch.

      Brian glances at Duncan and Archer.  Far enough out of 
      earshot that he can risk a hushed conversation with Ellen.

                                  BRIAN
                    What did he want?  Who are they?

                                  ELLEN
                    Don t ask me; I can t tell you.

                                  BRIAN
                    It s about the President, isn t it?
                          (off her silence)
                    They re planning an assassination.

      Ellen glances nervously toward the Captors.

                                  ELLEN
                    He threatening to kill you and the 
                    kids...

                                  BRIAN
                    Listen to me Ellen.   You re not 
                    going to be a part of this.  You ll 
                    go to the Secret Service, we ll 
                    find help... 

      He takes her hand under the table and grasps it.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    I won t let them turn you into a 
                    murderer.

      She looks up at him, eyes welling.  She nods in silent 
      agreement.  Glad for his strength.                                            12/6/1235


      INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT5151

      Maria and Kramer descend the steps and locate the PHONE/CABLE 
      PANEL beside the circuit breakers.  Kramer turns on a bare 
      overhead bulb and removes his mask.

                                  KRAMER
                    Number three said you were a top-
                    notch electronics man. 

      Maria removes her mask and shakes her hair out.  

                                  MARIA
                    He must ve been talking about the 
                    guy I replaced.

      Kramer stares. Caught off guard. 

                                  MARIA (CONT D)
                    What?  You thought I was a short 
                    dude with hips?

                                  KRAMER
                    No, I didn t really get a good loo--

                                  MARIA
                    Forget it.

      She smiles at him.  He smiles back.  There s a spark here.  
      Kramer pulls his gaze away.  Opens a tool kit.  

                                  KRAMER
                    Well if you re not the techie, then 
                    I guess I m installing this puppy.

      He takes out a horseshoe-shaped black device.  Puts a 
      flashlight in his teeth and examines the wires... 

                                  MARIA
                    What is that?

                                  KRAMER
                    Signal Interceptor.  Let s us 
                    monitor all incoming and outgoing 
                    digital and analog signals...

      Maria takes the flashlight from his mouth and holds it for 
      him.  He nods thanks.  Then he locates a main cable.  She 
      watches him work out of the corner of her eye. 

                                  MARIA
                    Nice hardware.  I m impressed.                                            12/6/1236


                                  KRAMER
                    ...almost done...

      He activates the device...  and then a YELLOW INDICATOR LIGHT 
      starts to flash on the panel: HOME ALARM.

                                  MARIA
                    Is that supposed to happen?


      INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT5252

      Kramer and Maria (masked again) rush into the room just as 
      the land line rings.  Captors and hostages exchange looks.

      Duncan motions to Ellen: pick it up.  She does.

                                  ELLEN
                    Hello?

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Hi, this is Claire from Security 
                    Capitol.  Who am I speaking with?

                                  ELLEN
                    Ellen... Ellen Sanders.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Good evening Mrs. Sanders, we 
                    received a system alert from your 
                    address.  Can I please have your 
                    password?

      Ellen stalls.  Duncan lifts his gun toward her.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Mrs. Sanders, are you still there?

                                  ELLEN
                    The password is  Ringo Star. 

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Thank you. Please hold.

      WE CAN HEAR the canned  hold music  coming from the phone.  
      Duncan s eyes lock onto Ellen s.  

                                  DUNCAN
                          (quiet)
                    I thought we had an understanding.

                                  ELLEN
                    We do...                                            12/6/1237


      Points the gun at her head.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Then why are you lying?

      Ellen pales.  The hold music clicks off and Claire comes back 
      on the line:

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Mrs. Sanders?

                                  ELLEN
                    Yes?

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    I m sorry but the password you gave 
                    me is incorrect.

      Duncan shifts his gun off Ellen... and points it at her 
      daughter.  

                                  ELLEN
                    Oh.  My mistake... Try Jupiter 89.

      A long beat.  Everybody holds their breath...

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    Thank you.  That s correct.  Is 
                      everything okay?

                                  ELLEN
                    Yeah, sorry.  Rex-- our dog, must 
                    have tripped a sensor somewhere.

                                  CLAIRE (V.O.)
                    So long as you re safe.

                                  ELLEN
                    Thank you.  Good night.

      Ellen hangs up.  Duncan studies her... then lowers his gun.  


      INT. SECURITY CAPITOL CUSTOMER CENTER - NIGHT5353

      REPS in headsets sit in front of high tech monitors at work 
      stations.  A big screen interactive display shows the 
      Disctric of Colombia and the greater metropolitan area. 
      CLAIRE (petite redhead) flags her SUPERVISOR.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    There was a system alert at the 
                    Sanders  residence.  4311 Woodlawn.  
                                  (MORE)                                            12/6/1238

                                  CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    First she got the password wrong, 
                    then she called the dog Rex.

      Claire points to the Sanders  account page that displays a 
      list of residents, including the dog  Barkley. 

                                  SUPERVISOR
                    Who s patrolling that sector?

                                  CLAIRE
                          (hits some keys)
                    It s supposed to be Harris but he s 
                    out sick... there s a replacement.

                                  SUPERVISOR
                    Have him to stop by and do a 
                    routine check.  Just to be safe.


      INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT5454

      Danni and Jake whisper to one another at the dinner table.   

                                  MARIA
                    You two.  Knock it off.

                                  DANNI
                    You took our cell phones.  Our 
                    friends are gonna start wondering 
                    why they can t reach us.

                                  ARCHER
                    You think you re that popular?

                                  JAKE
                    People our age text like every five 
                    minutes.  
                          (under this breath)
                    Don t need to see your face to know 
                    you re old. 

      Archer s head turns-- couldn t hear the comment but doesn t 
      like Jake s tone.  Danni speaks quickly--

                                  DANNI
                    Please. You guys can monitor us; 
                    we ll just say we re sick or 
                      something... 

      Her appeal falls on deaf ears.                                            12/6/1239


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - NIGHT5555

      A car with a CAPITOL SECURITY LOGO on the side pulls up.  The 
      uniformed DRIVER gets out and approaches the front door. 


      INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT5656

      DING DONG!  Everybody startles at the sound of the doorbell. 

      MARIA goes to a window and cracks the blinds.

                                  MARIA
                    Security patrol.

      Duncan turns on Ellen.

                                  DUNCAN
                    What are they doing here?

                                  ELLEN
                    I don t know.  You heard me.  I 
                    didn t say anything on the phone.

      Duncan stares at her for an uncomfortably long beat...

                                  DUNCAN
                    You sure about that, Ellen?

      Ellen squirms under his gaze, tries to keep a poker face. 
      Brian looks back and forth, unnerved by the strangely 
      intimate tone of their exchange-- 

                                  BRIAN
                    Leave her alone.  I ll get rid of 
                    them. 

                                  ARCHER
                    If we want your help, we ll ask for 
                    it.

      Duncan indicates with his gun for Ellen to answer the door.


      EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT5757

      WE SEE the DRIVER from behind, waiting, waiting... The porch 
      swing creaks in the wind. The Driver leans forward to ring 
      the doorbell again.  WE NOTE the GUN on his hip.  Finally--

      ELLEN opens the door partway. 

      INSIDE - REVEAL DUNCAN standing out of sight, gun in hand.                                            12/6/1240


                                  ELLEN
                    Good evening, is there a problem?

      REVERSE on the DRIVER S FACE for the first time; he is the 
      JANITOR we saw leaving Ellen s office at the hospital.  

      Ellen looks at him, puzzled for a moment. 

      QUICK FLASH - ELLEN s POV of the Janitor from earlier.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    You were in my office...

      The Driver hands her a manila envelope.  Then walks away. 

                                  DRIVER (INTO HIS RADIO)
                    4311 Woodlawn is clear.

      Duncan pulls a stunned Ellen back inside and shuts the door.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Open it.

      Ellen looks down at the envelope in her hand.  She opens it 
      without thinking and pulls out--

      THE MISSING 8X10 PHOTO OF HER FAMILY, taken from her desk.  
      It s a holiday greeting that reads  from--  with all their 
      names listed.  Including Barkley the dog. 

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Your dog s name is Barkley, not 
                    Rex; Danni does Tae Kwon Do 
                    Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5; you 
                    call your mother Irene every 
                    Saturday; Jake is allergic to 
                    peanuts.  Do I need to continue? We 
                    know everything about you.  We have 
                    eyes and ears everywhere.  We have 
                    thought of everything.  Are you 
                    starting to understand Ellen? 
                          (his eyes bore into hers)
                    This is your last warning.  

      She nods, shaking. It s a nightmare she can t wake up from.


      INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT5858

      A beautiful dinner remains barely touched on the table.  The 
      family exchange anxious glances as they wait for Ellen.                                            12/6/1241


      BRIAN s eyes land on a steak knife on the table.  He glances 
      up at the guards, waiting for his chance... he reaches for 
      the knife.  Closer, closer... he s just about to grab it--  

                                  DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    Dinner is finished, Mr. Sanders.  
                    You won t be needing that.

      They all turn to see Duncan in the doorway.  Ellen stands 
      behind him, looking defeated. 

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                          (to his crew)
                    Separate them.   

      Kramer leads Jake up the stairs, Maria takes Brian toward the 
      den.  Danni is a slow to rise. 

                                  ARCHER
                    Move.

      Archer pulls her roughly to her feet-- 

                                  DANNI
                    Ow!

                                  BRIAN
                    Take your hands off her!

      Brian rushes over to protect his daughter.  The next actions 
      happen fast:

      Archer shoves Danni aside with one hand and turns to Brian -- 
      stiff arms him in the chest.  

                                  ARCHER
                    Back off!

      Brian fights back, reaches for Archer s throat.  The two men 
      struggle, locked up. A chair topples.  Danni screams. Jake 
      lunges but is restrained by Kramer.

      Archer swings his gun up with his free hand--

                        JAKEELLEN
      Dad!Brian stop!

      WHACK!  Maria clocks Brian over the back of his head with the 
      butt of her gun.  Brian collapses in a heap, knocking a plate 
      from the table which shatters.

      A beat as everybody catches their breath.  Ellen breaks free 
    and rushes to kneel beside Brian.                                            12/6/1242


      She lifts his head, checks his injury...

                                  BRIAN
                          (groggy)
                    I m okay...

                                  DUNCAN
                    Get the kids out of here.



      Maria takes Danni down the hallway to her room, Kramer takes 
      Jake up the stairs, both kids looking back over their 
      shoulders in dismay.

      Ellen glares at Duncan.

                                  ELLEN
                    I need to put some ice on this 
                    before it swells up.  

      Duncan nods.  He turns to Archer.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Let s get him into the den.

      Archer holsters his weapon and bends to help Duncan lift 
      Brian... 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT5959

        Establishing shot of the world s most famous residence.


      INT. WHITE HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT6060

      The First Lady sits up in bed, reading from her iPad, TV on.

                                  MARY
                    There s a website where you can 
                    input your age, weight and the type 
                    of surgery you re having and it 
                    will calculate the risks.

      Kincaid answers from the bathroom, preparing for bed.

                                    KINCAID (O.S.)
                    And there s a website where you can 
                    watch cockroaches dance-- doesn t 
                    mean it s a good use of your time.                                            12/6/1243


      He enters, climbs into bed beside her.  He clicks off the TV.

                                  MARY
                    I m just worried that Creasy will 
                    pull an Al Haig while you re under 
                    and declare martial law. 

                                    KINCAID
                      I wouldn t put it past him.  That 
                    thought alone will give me the 
                    strength to pull through.

      They share a smile and kiss each other good night before 
      turning off the lights.  An ordinary, loving couple... who 
      have no idea what s in store.


      INT. SANDERS HOME, DEN - NIGHT6161

      Brian rests on the sofa.  An ice pack held against the back 
      of his head.  

      Duncan hands him a bottle of aspirin.  Brian takes it without 
      thanking him.  Swallows some dry.

                                  DUNCAN
                    What happened back there was 
                      unfortunate.  And unnecessary.  I 
                    told you before, we didn t come 
                    here to hurt you.  

                                  BRIAN
                          (sneers)
                    I know why you re here.

      Duncan looks at him for a long beat.  Quiet:

                                  DUNCAN
                    Then you understand the stakes.  
                    You are going to cooperate.  And 
                    you are going to tell your wife to 
                    cooperate as well. 

      Brian looks back at him defiantly.

                                  BRIAN
                    Or else you ll beat me more?  Shoot 
                    me?

                                  DUNCAN
                    I prefer not to use force, Brian.

      Duncan produces an large envelope and takes out a stack of 
        PHOTOGRAPHS.  He tosses them onto Brian s lap.                                            12/6/1244


      They are surveillance photos of Brian in a tryst with another 
      woman.  He s having an affair.

      Brian deflates.  All the bravado evaporates.  

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Everybody has a weak spot Brian.

      Cut to black.

      ACT OUT.                                            12/6/1245


      ACT THREE


      INT. JAKE S ROOM - NIGHT6262

      Jake paces back and forth like a caged tiger.  PULL BACK TO 
      REVEAL the masked man (Kramer), standing sentry in the 
      doorway, arms folded in front, holding his gun. 

                                  KRAMER
                    You should do your homework or 
                      something.

                                  JAKE
                    Like I need advice from you.

      He keeps pacing.  Then...

      WE HEAR a muffled  TEXT TONE.   Kramer snaps to attention. 
      Jake freezes; his face drains of color.   

                                  KRAMER
                    Where is it?

                                  JAKE
                    What? 

      Kramer raises his gun.

      The SOUND repeats.  Another text. Definitely coming from 
      beneath the bed.  Kramer looks at the panel on the front of 
      the bed.  Jake knows he s busted.

                                  KRAMER
                    You re hiding a phone?

                                  JAKE
                    I can explain...

      Kramer gestures with his gun.  Jake raises his hands and 
      kneels.  Pulls out his secret safe box.  ANOTHER TEXT.  
      Insistent.  He punches in the code with shaking fingers and 
      opens it slowly.

                                  JAKE (CONT D)
                    Here.  Take whatever you want...

      He offers the box to Kramer who looks inside.  He sees the 
      cash.  The pot.  The cell phone.

      Kramer looks up at Jake.  His expression unreadable.                                            12/6/1246


      INT. DANNI S ROOM - NIGHT6363

      Danni sits on her bed, arms around her knees, stubbornly 
      staring at the wall.  Maria is tipped back in a desk chair 
      across the room, watching her.  Finally Danni can t take it.

                                  DANNI
                    I need to go to the bathroom.


      INT. HALLWAY/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER6464

      Maria holds the door open.  Danni enters.  Maria remains in 
      the doorway.

                                  DANNI
                    Do you mind?  I d like some 
                    privacy.

                                  MARIA
                    You don t need privacy.  I m a girl 
                    under here, in case you hadn t 
                    figured that out. 

      Danni looks around desperately for that HPT stick on the 
      ground.  Can t search for it with Maria standing there.

      Maria waits for her to sit on the toilet. 

                                  DANNI
                    Forget it.  I don t need to go 
                    after all.

      She brushes past Maria and heads back to her own room.


      INT. JAKE S ROOM - NIGHT6565

      Kramer lifts the items out of the box one by one.  He comes 
      to the cell phone last.  4 missed calls.  He scrolls through 
      the texts:

      NICO:  WHERE ARE YOU MAN?

      NICO:  HERE WAITING.  U R LATE.

      NICO:  AM GIVING YOU 10 MORE MINUTES.   

      Kramer looks up at Jake.

                                  KRAMER
                    Who s Nico?                                            12/6/1247


                                  JAKE
                          (terrified)
                    A guy I owe money to. The pot 
                    belongs to him. 

      Another text:  YOU BETTER BE ON YOUR WAY LITTLE MAN! 

      Kramer types a reply:  FAMILY EMERGENCY. CAN T MAKE IT.  CALL 
      YOU TOMORROW. 

                                  JAKE (CONT D)
                    No!  You can t send that-- 
                          (as Kramer hits SEND)
                    Oh shit.  Shit!

      Kramer shuts off the phone and pockets it.

                                  KRAMER
                    You ve got masked men in your house 
                    holding your family hostage and 
                    you re worried about some douchebag 
                    dope dealer?

      He puts the cash and the weed back in the box. Hands it back.

                                  KRAMER (CONT D)
                    Go on. Put away your stash.

      Jake is stunned.

                                  JAKE
                    You re not gonna... confiscate it 
                    or anything?

                                  KRAMER
                    I m not your father, kid. 

      Jake kneels down, opens the panel and puts the safe box away.  
      He sits there for a moment and covers his face with his 
      hands. He s trying to hold it together but he s only 15 and 
      he s overwhelmed.  

      Kramer watches him for a beat. Can see Jake stifling his 
      tears.  

                                  KRAMER (CONT D)
                    What?

      Jake looks up at him.  Dries his eyes.

                                  JAKE
                    Why did you have to kill my dog?                                            12/6/1248


      CLOSE ON KRAMER.  The face is covered but there s a lot you 
      can read in the eyes.  And in Kramer s we see... pity.  


      INT. MUD ROOM - NIGHT6666

      It s dark.  The door opens casting a sliver of light toward 
      us.  Kramer s form fills the doorway.  He steps aside to let 
      Jake look.  Jake s face lights up.

      REVERSE to REVEAL -- BARKLEY.  Sprawled out, snoring.  
      Definitely alive.

                                  JAKE
                    Barkley!

      The dog lifts his head at the sound of Jake s voice and 
      thumps his tail on the linoleum.  Jake goes over and throws 
      his arms around him.

      Kramer looks on.  It seems like he might actually be smiling 
      under that mask.

                                  KRAMER
                    The drugs will wear off by tomorrow 
                    morning.   

      Jake looks up at the masked man standing over him with an 
      expression of deep gratitude and even, maybe, admiration.   


      INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT6767

      Duncan follows Ellen upstairs and into the master bedroom.  
      She takes a pair of sweats from her dresser and he waits 
      outside while she goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.


      INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT6868

      As soon as she s inside Ellen turns on the tap to mask sound. 
      She opens the medicine cabinet and begins rifling through -- 
      all the while glancing nervously over her shoulder.

      She sifts through pill bottles, lotions, band aids... finally 
      she seizes what she is looking for.  A roll of gauze, bottle 
      of rubbing alcohol and a pair of scissors.

    She takes out the scissors -- examines the sharpness of the 
      blades.  Disinfects them with alcohol.  She takes a deep 
      breath and looks at herself in the mirror.   

    She places her hand on the edge of the basin... then inserts 
    her pinkie finger between the blades.                                              12/6/1249


      She presses.  The blades begin to dig into the skin where 
      they would sever the finger at the middle knuckle!

      ON ELLEN S FACE as she closes her eyes... willing herself to 
      go through with it... She can t.  She opens her eyes and sees 
      herself in the mirror.  Can t look at herself.

      She sinks down on the edge of the tub. Broken.  

                                  DUNCAN (V.O.)
                          (raps on the door)
                    Let s go.  Time for bed.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT6969

      The Captors finish piling up blankets and pillows in the 
      living room.  The family is all gathered together now.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Everybody sleeps in here tonight. 
                          (to his crew)
                    Two pairs of eyes on them at all 
                    times.   

                                  MARIA
                    I m good for the first shift.

      Kramer eyes Maria.

                                  KRAMER
                    I ll keep you company.

      Archer s eyes dart between the two of them. Steps forward.

                                  ARCHER
                    Down boy.  I got it.

      Duncan heads for the stairs.  Kramer follows a beat behind.


      INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT7070

      Duncan and Kramer enter and pull off their masks.

                                  KRAMER
                    Did you know he was bringing a 
                    girl?

                                  DUNCAN
                    You ll never see her again after 
                    tomorrow, Kramer.  So for once in 
                    your life just... focus on the 
                    mission.                                            12/6/1250


      They head to a table where several LAPTOPS are set up as a 
      make-shift command center.  Each one shows feeds from the 
        surveillance cameras they have installed around the house.  

                                  KRAMER
                            (matter-of-fact)
                    The son is dealing pot.

                                  DUNCAN
                    We re not here to sort out their 
                    problems.

      Kramer hits a key and toggles through different views.  
      Duncan looks at him for a beat.  Softly: 

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Why d you show him the dog?

      Kramer turns-- sees that Duncan is looking at a view of the 
      MUD ROOM on another laptop.   

                                  KRAMER
                    ...I felt sorry for him.  He s just 
                    a kid.   

                                  DUNCAN
                    They have to fear us.  It s the 
                    only way to control them.

      Kramer nods, admonished.  Duncan softens slightly.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Remember why we re here.  Sometimes 
                    you have to do a bad thing for a 
                    good reason.

      Duncan turns his attention to a laptop that shows a VIEW of 
      the family getting ready to lie down in the LIVING ROOM.  
      Ellen kneels by her kids who are on blankets on the floor.  

      PUSH IN ON THE MONITOR and MATCH CUT TO:


      INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT7171

      Ellen and Brian tuck the children in and kiss them good-
      night.  They are far too old for this treatment, but under 
      the circumstances neither one complains.  

      Ellen lingers for a moment, then climbs in next to Brian in 
      the sofa bed.  She silently grips his hand.  He stares at the 
      menacing silhouette of ARCHER across the room.                                            12/6/1251


      PUSH IN ON ELLEN as she lies back, unable to close her eyes, 
      dreading the arrival of the morning and the impossible choice 
      it will bring.

      ACT OUT.                                            12/6/1252


      ACT FOUR


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - MORNING7272

      The sun comes up on what should be a peaceful suburban 
      enclave.


      INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY7373

      Ellen stares at a masked Duncan who holds a small vial filled 
      with clear liquid.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Roughly five minutes after the 
                    liquid is absorbed in the blood, 
                    you can expect to see a reaction.

                                  ELLEN
                    What kind of reaction?

                                  DUNCAN
                    His system will start to crash.  
                    Follow regular procedures.  Nothing 
                    you do will save him.

      Ellen is appalled by Duncan s casual manner.

                                  ELLEN
                    What s in the vial?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Don t worry.  It won t show up in 
                    an autopsy.

                                  ELLEN
                    You expect me to trust you?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Do you think I want to leave any 
                    traces behind?
                          (looks Ellen in the eyes)
                    You re a smart woman Ellen.  You 
                    can do this.  Keep your head about 
                    you and this will all be over soon.

      Duncan opens a bottle of Advil with a secret compartment; he 
      hides the vial inside and hands it to her.

                                  ELLEN
                    We re talking about killing the 
                    President of the United States!                                            12/6/1253


                                  DUNCAN
                    Don t think of it as killing the 
                      President; think of it as saving 
                    your family.

      He puts his hand on her arm in a gesture that is both 
      threatening and intimate at the same time.   

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    And remember.  We ll be watching.

                                  ELLEN
                    Who are you?

      He doesn t answer.


      INT. FAMILY ROOM - MORNING7474

      Brian sits with the kids at the breakfast table.  The Captors 
      hang back. Jake shovels cereal into his mouth.

                                  DANNI
                    How can you eat?

                                  JAKE
                          (mouth full)
                    I m a teenager.  

      Danni turns away in disgust.  Then whispers to Brian:

                                  DANNI
                          (anxious)
                    Why is Mom upstairs with him?  

                                  BRIAN
                    It s all right.  They re just 
                    talking.

                                  DANNI
                    About what?  What is going on, Dad?

      Brian struggles to come up with a response.

                                  BRIAN
                    Trust me, in a little while this 
                    will all be over.  And we re going 
                    to be okay...  I promise. 

      Duncan leads Ellen down the stairs.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    You should get some food in your 
                    stomach.                                            12/6/1254


                                  ELLEN
                    I m not hungry.

      Danni glances at Jake again and suddenly looks unwell.  She 
      stands and turns to Duncan...

                                  DANNI
                    I really need to go to the 
                    bathroom.  Like, right away.

      Duncan turns to Maria.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I ll take her.  Make sure Dr. 
                    Sanders gets something to eat.


      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER7575

      Duncan gently holds Danni by the elbow as they walk down the 
      hall toward her bathroom.  He looks at her:

                                  DUNCAN
                    Are you okay?

      Danni does not look okay; all the blood has drained from her 
      face and she has broken out in a cold sweat.  She slips past 
      him without answering and latches the door behind her.


      INT. BATHROOM - DAY7676

      Danni rummages through the towel basket and pulls out the 
      lost home pregnancy test.  She looks at it: positive.

    She covers her mouth with her hand, then sticks her head over 
    the toilet and throws up.  


      INT. KITCHEN - DAY7777

      Ellen stands, choking down a bowl of yogurt like a scolded 
      child.  From down the hallway SHE HEARS the sound of somebody 
      pounding on the door.  She wants to go see what is wrong but 
      Maria is watching her--


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY7878

      Duncan raps on the bathroom door.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Danni?  You all right in there!?                                            12/6/1255


      INT. BATHROOM - DAY7979

      Danni is bent over the toilet, retching. A LOUD KNOCK.

                                  DUNCAN (V.O.)
                    Open up!

      Danni wipes her mouth.  Paralyzed by nausea, she can t move.

      DUNCAN breaks through the flimsy latch and sees Danni, 
      kneeling in front of the toilet, pregnancy test in her hand.  
      He can see it is PINK for positive.

                                  DANNI
                    Please don t tell...

                                  DUNCAN
                    It s none of my business.

      Danni starts to cry quietly.

                                  DANNI
                    My boyfriend doesn t know...

      Duncan hands her a tissue.  Danni lifts her head and cleans 
      her face.  She stands and looks in Duncan s eyes.

                                  DUNCAN
                    It s okay.  Take a minute.


      INT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY - DAY8080

      Ellen is rinsing her bowl in the sink.  She has heard the 
      commotion.  She waits till Maria s back is turned and darts 
      into the hallway.

                                  MARIA
                    Hey!

      WE FOLLOW MARIA around the corner.  Gun out, she pursues 
      Ellen who is moving down the hall--


      INT. BATHROOM - DAY8181

      Danni and Duncan s intimate moment is broken by:

                                  ELLEN (O.S.)
                    Danni!

      Danni looks at the HPT in her hand, looks around for a place 
      to hide it.  Finally Duncan reaches out and offers to take 
      it.  Danni slips it into his hand just as Ellen bursts in.                                            12/6/1256


                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    Danni are you okay?

                                  DANNI
                    I m fine Mom.

                                  ELLEN
                    ...Why are you in here alone with 
                    my daughter?

                                  DANNI
                    He was trying to help.  I think I 
                    have a stomach virus.

      Maria appears in the doorway.  Duncan holds up a hand.

      Ellen goes into auto mode, checking Danni s pulse and fever.

                                  ELLEN
                    She s dehydrated.  She needs 
                    liquids.  Now.

                                  DUNCAN
                    We ll take care of her.  You need 
                    to get ready to go.

      Ellen strokes Danni s hair with her hand and looks in her 
      eyes.  Danni s eyes fill with tears.  Ellen embraces her.

                                  ELLEN
                    Don t worry, baby.  It s probably 
                    just the stress.  Try and relax and 
                    get some rest.

      Duncan nods to Maria who takes a step forward.  Ellen tears 
      herself away from her daughter.  


      EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY8282

      The Secret Service advance team gets word over their ear-buds 
      that the President is on his way.  They begin clearing 
      vehicles and pedestrians from the entrance. 


      I/E. PRESIDENT S MOTORCADE - DAY8383

      Moving through morning traffic in D.C.

      The reflections zip by over President Kincaid s face as he 
      stares out the window.  In this private moment, we see the 
      anxiety in his eyes. 

      His wife reaches over and takes his hand.                                            12/6/1257


                                  MARY
                    You okay?

                                    KINCAID
                    Just using my brush with mortality 
                    as an excuse to indulge in morbid 
                      self-reflection...
                          (turns and smiles)
                    It will pass. 


      INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY8484

      The family is gathered.  Ellen comes down, dressed for work.  

      Brian stands.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Can I have a moment with my wife?

      Duncan gives Brian a long look-- a silent reminder of what he 
      holds over his head and what he expects Brian to do. 

                                  DUNCAN
                    Go ahead.


      INT. KITCHEN - DAY8585

      Ellen and Brian enter the kitchen.  Duncan watches them from 
      the family room, giving them some space.  They speak in  
      hushed, urgent voices. 

                                  BRIAN
                    I was wrong.  We have no choice.  
                    You have to cooperate.

                                  ELLEN
                    What about going to the Secret 
                    Service?

                                  BRIAN
                    It s too risky.  We can t take the 
                    chance.

                                  ELLEN
                    We re talking about a man s life--

                                  BRIAN
                    Weighed against the lives of our 
                    children.                                              12/6/1258


      Ellen hangs her head.  Suddenly realizes that she s 
      completely alone now -- her only ally has surrendered.  She 
      moves to leave.  Brian grabs her.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Ellen.  Just do what they want.  
                    Then everything can go back to the 
                    way it was... like this never 
                    happened.

                                  ELLEN
                    Except I m the one who has to live 
                    with it.

      She holds his gaze fiercely. Brian releases her, surprised by 
      the strength in her voice.  She turns and walks away.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER8686

      Duncan and Archer stand by the front entry.  Brian looks on 
      from the other side of the room as Ellen hugs Jake good-bye.  

                                  ELLEN
                    I ll be home soon.   

      Jake nods, too choked up to speak.  Ellen turns to Danni.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    You hang in there.  We ll get 
                    through this together.  All of it.

      Danni looks back at her questioningly; does Ellen know?  Or 
      guess? She kisses Danni and hugs her tight.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    It s time for you to go, Ellen. 
                    Now.   

      Ellen turns and glares at the masked men in her home.  Shares 
      one last look with Brian across the distance of the room, the 
      emotional gap between them even wider... Then she tears away, 
      crosses to the door and steps out into the daylight.


      EXT. SANDERS HOME - DAY8787

      Ellen gets in her car.  Looks back at the house, then down at 
      the  ADVIL BOTTLE  in her hand.  When she lifts her eyes she 
      sees her reflection in the rear view mirror.  

      PUSH IN ON Ellen s eyes, staring into her reflection, looking 
      for an answer.  The wheels are turning in her head.  WE SEE a 
      flash of something... a decision made?                                              12/6/1259


      She shoves the Advil Bottle in her purse and pulls away.


      INT. HOSPITAL - DAY8888

      A BURST OF FLASHBULBS as Ellen runs the gauntlet of media in 
      the lobby.  She puts on a remarkably good game face.

      Hospital security mercifully keeps them from following her 
      into the elevaor.


      INT. CORRIDOR - LATER8989

      Ellen emerges into the hall wearing her lab coat.  WE NOTE 
      that she is clutching something in her right coat pocket.  

      As she pushes through a set of swinging doors she is 
      intercepted by DR. SLOAN.  He falls into step as they walk 
      briskly down the hall, side-by-side.   

                                  SLOAN
                    You ready, Dr. Sanders?

                                  ELLEN
                    Just another day at the office.

      They approach a door flanked by two Secret Service AGENTS.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    A surgeon should always go see the 
                    patient first...
                          (leaving him)
                    Alone.

      The Secret Service hold the door for her.  Shut it in Sloan s 
      face.  He fumes.


      INT. PRESIDENT S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY9090

      The President looks up from some papers he is reading and 
      sees Ellen.  He is sitting up in bed.  He smiles.

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    Well, Dr. Sanders...

                                  ELLEN
                    Mr. President.  How are you 
                    feeling?                                            12/6/1260


                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    You know I am in charge of a 
                    hundred different things that 
                    affect the lives of millions of 
                    people.  I make decisions all day 
                    long, every day. 
                          (smiles)
                    The idea of surrendering complete 
                    control to you for the next few 
                    hours is kind of a relief.

      Ellen returns his smile nervously.   

                                  ELLEN
                    One of the many reasons I d never 
                    want to trade places.

      As she talks, her hand remains in her pocket.  She glances at 
      a nurse s tray with several syringes on it.  

      She lifts an X-Ray and holds it up to the light.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    See that dark patch right there?  
                    That is what doesn t belong in 
                    there.  Luckily for you, it s grown 
                    in a spot we can get at.

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    Very kind of it.

      As the President looks up at the X-Ray, Ellen deftly takes a 
      VIAL from her pocket and swaps it with one on the nurse s 
      tray.

                                  ELLEN
                    The operation itself is relatively 
                    simple.  But we do want to make 
                    sure we get it all out. 

      She lowers the X-Ray.  The President hasn t noticed a thing.

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    I have full confidence in you.

                                  ELLEN
                    Thank you, sir.

      She forces a smile, accepting the compliment.  Trying to keep 
      it together knowing what she is tasked with doing...                                            12/6/1261


      INT. SANDERS HOME - LATER9191

      IN THE LIVING ROOM

      Brian, with an ice pack on his head, sits with the kids in 
      front of the TV.  Archer and Maria guard them.

                                  TV REPORTER (V.O.)
                    ...I m here at Sibley Memorial 
                    where we are just getting an update 
                    on the status of the President...

      TRACK WITH KRAMER as he walks into THE DEN...

      DUNCAN stands alone in front of another TV, his mask off.  
      Out of sight of the others, Kramer removes his mask as well.   

      ON TV - a FEMALE REPORTER stands in front of the Hospital.

                                  TV REPORTER (V.O.)
                    ...we have just been told that the 
                    President will NOT be undergoing 
                    surgery today.

      REVERSE ON DUNCAN - his expression tense as he listens.

                                  TV REPORTER (V.O.)
                    ...he was mistakenly given a blood 
                    thinner only hours before his 
                    scheduled surgery.  It s not clear 
                    how this happened but the error was 
                    caught by the sharp eyes of his 
                    surgeon, Dr. Ellen Sanders...

      INTERCUT - Brian and the kids react to the news.  They 
      exchange glances with one another and the Captors.

      ON TV - there is a commotion at the door to the hospital 
      behind the Reporter. 

                                  TV REPORTER (V.O.)
                    The President s health is in no 
                    danger, but the surgery has been 
                    postponed for two weeks.

      ELLEN emerges from the hospital.   

      KRAMER looks to Duncan... what the fuck just happened?  

      CLOSE ON DUNCAN as he stares at the TV.  He knows exactly 
      what happened.  He stares at:

      ELLEN on TV.  Reporters thrust microphones at her, Police 
      push them back...                                             12/6/1262


                                  TV REPORTER (V.O.)
                          (shouts out)
                    Dr. Sanders!  How do you feel about 
                    this set-back? Are you upset?  
                      Discouraged?

      Ellen pauses.  Turns back to the cameras and looks right into 
      the lens. 

                                  ELLEN (V.O.)
                    I don t give up that easily.

      Ignoring the other questions, she holds that look-- it is for 
      Duncan.  And he knows it.  

      They stare at one another through the TV screen as if they 
      were in the same room... a dangerous game between these two 
      has begun.  The question is... who is going to win? 

      CUT TO BLACK.

      END OF PILOT.
