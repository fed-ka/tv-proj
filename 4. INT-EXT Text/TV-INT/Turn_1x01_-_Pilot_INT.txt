Ben, his shoulder wound dressed, but dirt still on his face,
stares defiantly at his superior, GENERAL CHARLES SCOTT,
territorial and traditional.  

Scott sits across a simple dining room table converted into
a desk.  He does not react to Ben's emotion. 

GENERAL SCOTT
How.

BEN
These weren't Tory Militia, or
Regulars. 

With his good arm, Ben rustles up the Green Jacket and Bonnet
and dumps them on the table.  

BEN (CONT'D)
They were Queen's Rangers, and this
was an ambush planned in advance.

Scott feels the wool bonnet.  Disturbed by this revelation.  

GENERAL SCOTT
Robert Rogers? 
(Ben nods)
It was luck, then.  Bad luck, that
you ran into him.  4.

BEN
Luck had nothing to do with it.  

Beat.  General Scott begins to fill out a commission.  

GENERAL SCOTT
After you see to that shoulder, I'll
assign you new men, new horses. 

BEN
No, Sir.  

Scott stops his quill, looks at Ben.  

GENERAL SCOTT
You're resigning your commission?

BEN
I won't head another reconnaisance
south of Westchester.  I have no
wish to quietly lead more men to
their death.  

GENERAL SCOTT
You think that's my aim? 

Scott angrily draws out a letter from his drawer.  Reads it. 

GENERAL SCOTT (CONT'D)
"I earnestly entreat you to spare no
effort to come at early and true
intelligence regarding British troop
strength, supply levels, naval
reinforcements..." 
(slams letter down)
These are orders.  From General
Washington.  

BEN
The truth on the ground is that
scouting runs are suicide.  We need
to do better.  Sir.

GENERAL SCOTT
Define better.

BEN
All I need to begin with is one man,
to serve as courier between myself,
and a friend in New York.   

GENERAL SCOTT
New York.  After Washington has burned
it to the ground upon our retreat.  5.

The General scoffs.  This kid doesn't know what he's talking
about.

GENERAL SCOTT (CONT'D)
Captain Tallmadge... you want the
truth on the ground?


MARY WOODHULL, 20, cooks breakfast.  A BRITISH REDCOAT walks
into the kitchen, fastening the buttons on his jacket.  He
nods to Mary, respectfully.  She returns the nod, which is
directed at an iron urn.  The Regular pours his own coffee.   

They maintain the unique distance, posture, and tension of
someone living in your house who is neither friend nor family.


Several rough tables are set up.  A staircase leads to the
second floor, where there are rooms to let.  

BRITISH REGULARS mix with TORY TOWNIES at one table, getting
drunk and sharing stories.  One of the Tory farmers, WILL
ROBESON, walks away laughing and approaches the kitchen where
the drinks are served.  Waiting there is SELAH STRONG, 30,
quick tempered and proud, the owner of this Tavern.

ROBESON
Mr. Strong.  Four ales, please.

SELAH
Four shillings, please.

ROBESON
Be a good man and put it on Captain
Joyce's account. 

He nods to the Redcoats behind him.  CAPTAIN JOYCE is rosy
cheeked and holding court.  Selah watches them, silent.

Robeson grins and takes the now free drinks, singing his way
back to distribute them.  Selah glares after him. 

Abe enters the tavern.  Eyes turn to him.  He removes his
tricorne hat and nods politely to the guests.

He makes eye contact with Selah, who registers surprise and
suspicion at Abe's presence.  Abe crosses to him, hat off. 

ABE
Good evening, Selah.  

SELAH
I thought you didn't drink. 

Abe slides a burlap pouch across the bar.   Selah, wary,
peeks inside - it is filled with a mishmash of various
currencies - British pound sterling, Spanish and Portuguese
coins, German guineas.

SELAH (CONT'D)
What's this?

ABE
I said I would repay my debt.

SELAH
We're only halfway through the
season...  8.

ABE
This is only half of what I owe.
(beat)
And all that I can do for now. 

Selah stares at Abe.  The table of British bursts into
laughter (at some other joke - they can't hear Abe).  Selah
ignores them, fixing his stare.  Abe looks down. 

ABE (CONT'D)
Harvest isn't coming in as I hoped.

SELAH
Loopers?  Or Maggots?

ABE
I just need more time.  

SELAH
(considering)
More time.
(as if it's a new
concept)
More time.  Why don't you just wait
till next season?  Perhaps by then
Major Hewlett will have confiscated
the rest of my plantation, and signed
it over to your father.  Then you
could just... pay me back with my
own cauliflower.

Before a stung Abe can respond...

ANNA (O.S.)
Abraham?  

Both men turn.  Descending the stairs is ANNA STRONG, 22,
Selah's wife.  Time seems to stop for Abe as Anna's radiant
smile traps him where he stands.  Selah looks frustrated.    

ANNA (CONT'D)
To what do we owe the pleasure?

SELAH
(edged)
Abe and I were just discussing
maggots.

ANNA
Maggots?

CAPTAIN JOYCE (O.S.)
Mrs. Strong!  Here!  Here!9.

The Redcoats and Robeson TOAST to Anna.  She smiles and nods
her hospitality, while under her smile she sweetly asides-

ANNA
I hear they've been dethroned as
Setauket's reigning pests.
(louder, to Redcoats)
Your rooms are ready, Gentlemen!

Abe smiles at her, then catches Selah looking at him.

ABE
I should be off.

ANNA
Now, wait.  We hardly see you anymore. 
How is Mary?  And Thomas?

ABE
They're well, thank you.  I...

ANNA
You should come for dinner.  At our
house.  The three of you.

SELAH
Anna-

ABE
That wouldn't feel right.

Anna's smile retreats to quite alarm, as if she fears what
Abe will say next.  

ABE (CONT'D)
I owe your husband a great deal of
money, and would be shamed for you
to cook for us while I'm in arrears.

Now it's Selah's turn to look surprised - didn't expect Abe
to admit that.  Anna turns to her husband, taken aback.

ANNA
I didn't know about this.

SELAH
It's a private matter.

ROBESON cries out, standing on his chair, drunk.

ROBESON
A poem!  I have written.  
(MORE)10.

ROBESON (CONT'D)
I should like to dedicate it to the
brave Patriot commander, on the eve
of his retreat, pardon me, his charge
into northern New Jersey.

The British laugh.  Selah fumes.  Robeson reads from a paper.

ROBESON (CONT'D)
"Where are the rebels now?  Pulled
back from the line, a most propitious
sign, for Mrs. Washington, that sow!"

Selah stares at Robeson, furious.  The Redcoats laugh, all
except one.  LT. SIMCOE, black hair, dark eyes, quietly stares
at Anna.  She shakes off the chill, looks away.  

ROBESON (CONT D) (CONT'D)
"Alas, before his return, dear Georgie
must discern, in what place will he
sheathe his saber; I ll dare to opine,
that many months from now - nine,
the evidence will be found in
another s 'labor'; Now a whole army
could be made from this bastardized
Kingdom.  But surely you must all
know; that the joke of it all, is
that his scabbard calls for any puff s
sword he can stow!"

The Redcoats pound the table.  JOYCE laughing the hardest.  

SELAH
(dark, to Anna)
Go upstairs.

ANNA
Selah, don't...

Selah crosses the tavern to Robeson.  

SELAH
Get out, Robeson.

ROBESON
I'm sorry, did I offend your sensitive
liberal twat?

SELAH
You offended my wife.  And you offend
me.  Now leave.

CAPTAIN JOYCE
Come off it, man.  We're celebrating
your King's victory in New York.11.

Robeson jumps down from his chair, gets in Selah's face. 
Abe tenses, steps in front of Anna.  

ROBESON
Though we understand how that might
upset a certain delegate to the
Provincial Congress-

SELAH
Drunk.

ROBESON
Whig. 

His breath wafts into Selah's nose.  Selah grabs his wrist,
crumpling the poem.  Robeson swings with his beer clutching
hand and Selah bats it away.  The beer SPILLS onto Joyce's
lap, staining his breeches.  Joyce goes red in the face.

The Redcoats chuckle, taunting their comrade.

SIMCOE
(in an official voice)
Uniform soiled: twenty lashings.

Joyce EXPLODES out of his chair and grabs Selah by the collar,
pulls him close.  Selah SHOVES Joyce with BOTH HANDS.  He
falls back onto the table.  

Robeson swats at Selah who turns and PUNCHES his teeth out.

The table stands.  Joyce flies into a rage at Selah, charging
him.  He knocks Selah off his feet.  Selah lands hard.

Joyce draws his CAVALRY SABER.  It sings out of his sheathe
with the sound of no turning back.  Anna SCREAMS.  

Joyce rears his elbow back to run Selah through.  Just then
he is GRABBED from behind by ABE.  

ABE
He's down!  He surrenders!

Abe pins his arms back and Joyce grunts in pain, dropping
his sword.  Captain Joyce struggles but Abe pulls his arms
tighter, draws him away from the fight.  He backs right into
a PISTOL pointed at the back of his head.  Held by SIMCOE.

SIMCOE
Release the Captain.  Please.

Abe does.  Captain Joyce turns and gut-punches Abe.  Simcoe
looks disappointed - he might've blown Abe's head off if
given another moment.  Joyce throws Abe to the ground. 12.

Abe locks eyes with Selah.  Joyce begins to kick the shit
out of Abe as the Redcoats and Robeson CHEER AND ROAR.  

CUT TO:


The pews and pulpit have been torn out so that horses may be
stabled inside.  MAJOR HEWLETT himself is calmly disciplining
Captain Joyce, who stands at rigid attention.  Hewlett is
37, confident in his intellectual superiority.

HEWLETT
Law.  Order.  Authority.  We are the
beacon of authority in these colonies,
Captain.  And we bear the burden of
that authority.  

CAPTAIN JOYCE
Yes, Sir.

HEWLETT
"Because authority, thought it err
like others, hath yet a kind of
medicine in itself that skins the
vice o' the top."  Do you understand?

CAPTAIN JOYCE
(not at all)
Yes, Sir.  

Hewlett sagely nods.  Self-satisfied.  Then, briskly:13.

HEWLETT
Conduct Unbecoming.  One hundred
lashes.  Drunk and Disorderly.  One
hundred and fifty lashes.  Colonel
Price shall administer the discipline. 
Dismissed.  

Joyce looks straight ahead, imagining the public humiliation.  


Major Hewlett is attending to his dappled gray horse as
Richard enters and removes his hat.  

HEWLETT
I knew you would come.

RICHARD
I just wished to offer my assistance,
for whatever it may be worth.

HEWLETT
This is not a matter for the
provincial court.  One of my men was
assaulted, and this must be redressed.  

RICHARD
Without question.  But by the look
of Captain Joyce just now, I can
tell there's more to the story.  I
thought I might be able to shed light
on a few facts, in the service of
clarity. 

Hewlett respects Richard, considers him a near equal.  He
also knows why Richard is truly here.  He sighs.

HEWLETT
You weren't there, Richard. 

RICHARD
True.  Direct evidence and testimony
matter most.  But I thought I
should... disclose what I know no
matter how circumstantial or
embarrassing it might be.   

HEWLETT
Embarrassing?  14.

RICHARD
Well, it involves some social history
of Setauket.  Provincial ephemera,
and the passions of young people. 
Probably worthless--

HEWLETT
What history?

Richard, a subtle manipulator, hesitates before moving on,
letting Hewlett get more and more hooked on his lead.

RICHARD
Anna Strong, the wife of Selah Strong,
was engaged three years ago to marry
Abraham Woodhull, when her name was
Anna Smith...

HEWLETT
You mean Abraham your son.  

RICHARD
(moving right past it)
Yes they were childhood friends, you
see.  And the Smiths were also good
family friends.  Until Joseph Smith's
patriot politics drove us to
disagreement.  Anna, unfortunately,
took her father's views to heart,
and so broke the heart of my son,
who was raised to love the law above
all else.
(beat)
"Love will not be spurred to what it
loathes."

Richard waits.  Too far with the Shakespeare?

HEWLETT
So then why would he rush to the aid
of her husband?  A suspected patriot?

Richard sucks his tooth.  This is the embarrassing part.  

RICHARD
Abraham has a... dreamer's heart.  A
romantic heart.  His mother's heart,
to be honest.  And he keeps room in
there for Anna, in spite of her
betrayal.  

Hewlett nods, finding kinship with that kind of character.

HEWLETT
Chivalry.15.

RICHARD
The passions of young people.

HEWLETT
Alas, that love, so gentle in his
view...

RICHARDHEWLETT
...Should be so...Should be so tyrannous
tyrannous and rough inand rough in proof.
proof.  

Not too far.  Just right.


Abe and Selah are bound with rope, under guard.  

The cellar door opens and boots stomp down.  It is SIMCOE.

SIMCOE
Your room is ready.


Abe's wife Mary and his father, Richard, turn as Abe enters. 
Rain begins to hit the window panes.

MARY
Let me see you.

Mary stands and quickly crosses to Abe.  She impatiently
checks Abe's damage as if inspecting a sick horse.   

ABE
I'm alright.
(to Richard)
What are you doing here?

RICHARD
I heard you'd been arrested....  

ABE
How did you find out?

RICHARD
Mary sent for me.  Should I not have
come? 

Abe grunts in pain as Mary presses on his ribs. 

ABE
I said I'm fine. 

MARY
I don't know how you're going to
work in this condition.  

ABE
(to Richard)
You didn't speak to anyone?  Major
Hewlett, perhaps?    

RICHARD
I spoke to your wife.  She told me
about the problem with your crop,
and the way you chose to solve it.  17.

Abe looks at Mary, angry.  She returns his look, righteous
and unapologetic.  Abe needs to sit down.  

He sags into a chair.  Mary quickly goes to the stove and
takes off a plate of warm food and puts it on Abe's lap.

MARY
I warned you about Selah Strong. 
He's choleric by nature.  

ABE
He was defending Anna.  He was
defending his wife.

MARY
I don't know why a woman would be in
that house, at that hour...

ABE
The Strongs own the Tavern.  It's
her tavern. 

Mary makes a shrug, judgmental, infuriating to Abe.

ABE (CONT'D)
It's her Tavern.

RICHARD
Abraham.  You should have come to
me, if you needed specie or credit.

ABE
'Neither a lender nor borrower be.'

RICHARD
I wouldn't have lended.  You would
have worked.  I know butchers on
York Island who'd buy my hogs at
double the market value.  All I need
is someone to run the product into
the city for me... 

ABE
That's your farm.  This is mine.  
(beat, softens)
Besides... I already owe you
everything.  

Richard notes his powers of deflection have been passed on.

THOMAS (O.S.)
Da da?

Thomas, hearing Abe's voice, has crawled into the room.18.

Richard smiles, delighted to see his Grandson awake.

RICHARD
You've been paying me back with
interest.

Mary picks Thomas up, who calls for his Dad.  Richard moves
to hold him.  Mary hands him over.  Thomas WAILS in his
Grandfather's arms, reaches for Abe.

Abe stands with a pained grimace.

ABE
Here.

He takes Thomas from his father.  Thomas throws his arms
around Abe's neck, holds him tight.  

MARY
He must've heard your voice.  He was
asking for you earlier.  

ABE
Bed time.  Bed bed time.

Thomas groans, having gotten what he wanted, transfers back
to Mary, who exits to put him down, leaving the other father
and son to face each other.  

ABE (CONT'D)
Tell me what's happening with Selah
Strong.  

Richard sighs.

RICHARD
Insurrection is a serious charge.

ABE
Even without evidence...

RICHARD
More serious is assault on an Officer. 
That is a matter for military court,
I won't be involved.

ABE
Assault?!  The Captain was drunk. 
He attacked Selah.  

RICHARD
There were witnesses. 

ABE
I witnessed it.  And I'll testify.  19.

RICHARD
No.

ABE
No? 

RICHARD
No.  You will stay as far away from
this as you can.  

ABE
The hell I will. 

RICHARD
I've already come to an understanding
with Hewlett.  

There it is.  As Abe suspected.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
They want Strong.  They'll overlook
your involvement.   

ABE
What understanding?  


Dark, claustrophobic.  Iron-barred windows set in solid brick. 
Shafts of light strike through dank must, finding Abe on a
bed of hay inside a jail cell.  Miserable.  

A KEY works a lock.  A door opens, more light stabs in.  Abe
squints at the silhouette of man in a metal helmet with white
horsehair plume sprouting from its crested peak.  

VOICE (O.S.)
You look thin, Mr. Woodhull.  Is the
harvest that bad?  

Abe recognizes the voice.

ABE
Ben?  

A face emerges from the dark.  Ben Tallmadge, our survivor
from the opening.  In full Dragoon battle dress.     

ABE (CONT'D)
Tallmadge, thank God it's you!

Ben gives him the sign to pipe down.  32.

BEN
Your name came through on a dispatch. 
I set out immediately from camp.

ABE
Can you get me out of this?  Of course
you can, look at you... 

Ben takes off his helmet.  

BEN
Slow down.   

ABE
Ben, you know me.  I'm no smuggler. 
This is the first time I've ever...

BEN
I know.

ABE
Even attempted...

BEN
I told them you were a man of
integrity, and that you would make
every effort to cooperate. 

ABE
Thank...
(beat)
Cooperate?  

BEN
They need to know who your contact
was.  To make sure you weren't giving
aid to the enemy.  I told them that
you would never- 

ABE
The enemy?  Who is the enemy?  The
families in New York who are starved
for fresh produce or the farmers
outside who are starved for...

BEN
Fresh silk?  I hope that's for you
wife...  

ABE
Oh, come on Ben, you know both sides
close an eye to this trade.  Trust
me, the "enemy" did not benefit here.  33.

BEN
I do trust you, Abe.  And I can get
you out.  Just tell me who your
contact was at Frog's point.  

Abe stares at Ben, grows suspicious.  Paranoid.  

ABE
What's your true purpose here?  You
didn't ride all this way just to get
me out of trouble...

Ben produces a sheaf of paper.  Oh, yeah?

BEN
This is a pardon, for your release. 
Signed by Governor Trumbull, who I
convinced that you were a friend. 

ABE
If I tell you who I traded with.  

BEN
This shouldn't be a negotiation.  

ABE
Good.  Because I'm not giving the
name of someone who's just trying to
get by.  And who doesn't deserve to
be thrown in a cell by the same
Congress that declares for our
freedom.   

Ben regards Abe, then nods to himself.  Satisfied. 
Calculating.  Abe can tell he's keeping a secret.  

ABE (CONT'D)
Tallmadge.  Why are you really here?

BEN
As I said, I have a permit signed
from the Governor, for you to return
home.  He signed it after receiving
word from General Washington himself.

Abe sits back.  What the hell is going on here?  Ben notes
his reaction, and leans closer to the bars.  

BEN (CONT'D)
We're of the mind that if you can
smuggle cabbage, you can smuggle
something more valuable.  Information.  

ABE
You've come to enlist me?  34.

BEN
To recruit you.  Congress doesn't
just declare for your freedom, they
fight for it.  I fight for it.  And
men die for it.  

Abe sees the real Ben now, his anger and pain.

ABE
I don't ask anyone to fight for me.

BEN
I ask you.  We grew up together,
Abe, and I remember who you are,
even if you've forgotten.  
(off Abe's look)
I remember three summers ago, sitting
with you and Anna on the bay and
watching you rage like a lawyer
against the bloody Stamp Act.  You
went straight for two hours.  No one
can speak the way you did and not
believe in the cause.  I ask you to
fight for what you believe in.  

Abe is silent.

ABE
I don't know what information I could-- 

BEN
Military.  Number of men, number of
cannons.  Naval transports, whether
they're moving.  If so, where.  What
arrivals.  Whether with men, or
provisions-

ABE
Ben-

BEN
You won't have to risk crossing the
Belt again.  Instead, you'll signal
for a courier.  I have a system worked
out.

ABE
Have you worked out how to explain
my absence?  I was supposed to be
back yesterday, with no one knowing
I was gone.  

BEN
Use the truth.  You were on the black
market.  Both sides close an eye...35.

ABE
I'll need proof of that.  The silk. 
And the twelve pounds.    

Ben stares at Abe.  Then stands, UNLOCKS Abe's cell, and
tosses the money purse at his feet.  It lands with a RATTLE.

ABE (CONT'D)
So that's it?  

BEN
(pointed edge)
You're free.

The door stays wide open, but neither man moves his stare.

END ACT THREE36.

ACT FOUR


Richard sits across a desk from Major Hewlett, as they go
over a ledger together.  Hewlett points to a name.  

HEWLETT
Floyd.  To Colonel Floyd we should
give at least ten.  He's always first
to volunteer service. 

RICHARD
Ten... 
(checking a list)
There are only fourteen field hands
at Strong Manor.  Plus two house
boys and two Maids.  

HEWLETT
So?

RICHARD
So if we're to divide up property
amongst friends, we must be fair and
even in the giving.  No favorites.

HEWLETT
I suppose that's wise... 

RICHARD
We also need to leave some labor to
work the confiscated property.

WHAM.  The door guard, BAKER, hurries in.  

BAKER
Sir, Captain Simcoe at the gates. 
With a Prisoner, Sir.  Related to
Captain Joyce... er... 

HEWLETT
(to Richard)
We'll finish this over dinner.

Richard nods, rolls up the ledger.  Hewlett motions to Baker.

Simcoe marches in with Abe and four Redcoats.  

Richard rises from his chair, stunned.

SIMCOE
We found him wandering.  Looks like
he's been in a fight.  38.

HEWLETT
(dubious)
From three days ago?

RICHARD
Abraham, where have you been?  I've
been looking all over for-

SIMCOE
We'll ask the questions, Judge.

HEWLETT
I'll ask the questions.  
(to Abe)
Captain Joyce was found murdered
this Tuesday morning.  And you haven't
been seen since...

He looks to Simcoe.

SIMCOE
Monday evening, when he was released
from holding.

HEWLETT
Can you explain your absence?  

ABE
Captain Joyce is dead?

HEWLETT
I'll ask once more.  Where were you?  

ABE
With the Americans, Sir.  

Surprise all around.  Richard goes pale.  Somehow this is
worse than admitting to murder.  Abe hangs his head.

ABE (CONT'D)
I set out early Tuesday, before dawn,
to cross the Sound with a cargo of
cabbage from my field.  I aimed to...
barter on the London Trade, and did
so for twelve pound sterling and a
bundle of cathay silk.  On my return
that night, I was overtaken by a
brig sloop off the coast.  The crew
claimed they were Patriots, and that
I defied the authority of Congress. 
Their justice was to beat me, rob
me, and throw me overboard.39.

SIMCOE
Seems they also robbed you of any
proof of your tragic tale.

Abe takes a beat, then begins to reach for his boot.  The
Redcoats close in.  He pauses.

ABE
With your permission, Sir?

Hewlett nods.  Abe painfully takes off his boot, reaches in
and pulls out the long stash of silk.

ABE (CONT'D)
I concealed it before they boarded
my scow.  The money they took.

Richard bows his head in shame.  An Ensign walks the silk to
Hewlett, who inspects it.  Simcoe glares at Abe.

HEWLETT
Why not just sell your cabbage direct
to stores on York Island?  The market
for healthy greens favors the seller
tremendously.

ABE
Because the prices are even higher
on the black.

RICHARD
You damned fool.  Given to greed,
and deserved what you got.  

Abe can't meet his Father's eyes - not because he's ashamed,
but because he's pretending to be.

Baker enters again, breaking the tension.

BAKER
Sir.  Marked dispatch just arrived
for you. 

Hewlett grunts.  Busy day.  He nods, distracted.  A COURIER,
red-faced from his ride, but buttoning up his exhaustion,
walks across to Hewlett and hands him a sealed dispatch. 
Hewlett's eager to read it, but first... 

HEWLETT
Did you take note of the identity of
your assailants?

ABE
I know some of them...40.

Hewlett holds up his hand.  Abe shuts up.  

HEWLETT
Smuggling is a crime, and you will
answer for it.  But more pressing
are the activities of these
privateers.  

RICHARD
Major...

Richard whispers something low to Hewlett, who nods.

HEWLETT
(to Abe)
Return to your home, see to your
family, then report to your father's 
at seven o'clock.  There we'll discuss
names, and other details.
(to Simcoe)
Captain, escort Mr. Woodhull out of
the fort.  Unmolested.  

SIMCOE
Yes, Sir.

Simcoe walks Abe out.  Abe looks at Richard who looks away.  

Hewlett sits down and slices open the dispatch.  He reads it
with interest (we may recognize it as the same piece of paper
that Andre tried to hand Robert Rogers in the alley).   


Major Hewlett, Richard Woodhull, and Abe are finishing dinner
(roast pork).  Abe has cleaned up, wearing a black coat, 44.

black breeches, and a lace band at his throat.  He stares at
his plate.  Hewlett pushes back from the table as a HOUSE
SERVANT pours from a cask of Madeira wine. 

HEWLETT
Excellent, as always.

RICHARD
Credit goes to Aberdeen.  I merely
raise the pork, she performs the
alchemy.  

HEWLETT
(to Abe)
You've hardly touched yours.

ABE
Hard to eat on a guilty stomach, I
suppose.  My apologies.  

A glance is exchanged between Richard and the Major, who
nods "let me take this."  He leans forward, paternal.   

HEWLETT
Abraham.  This is what I could not
say earlier from my... pulpit, as it
were.  I view your crime as a mere
symptom of a more serious disease
afflicting these colonies.  Anarchy.  

ABE
You mean self-rule?

HEWLETT
I mean chaos.  Masquerading as
freedom.  An excuse for criminal
activity, and every-man-for-himself.

RICHARD
Well said.  And it is an illusion. 
Because if these upstarts were truly
concerned for your liberty they
wouldn't encourage smuggling with
one hand and then roll you with the
other.  

Abe nods along.

ABE
We all must pay a tax, the question
is just who will collect.

Hewlett wonders if he should like that response.  Richard
takes a gulp of wine, looks out across the room.    45.

RICHARD
'O God... that one might read the
book of fate, and see the revolution
of the times make mountains level. 
And the continent, weary of solid
firmness, melt itself into the sea...'

Hewlett smiles.  

HEWLETT
Your father is the only man I can
find here with an affection for the
humanities.
(to Richard)
Did you pass your trivium onto your
son?  

RICHARD
Abraham had to concern himself with
the business of our land, after his
Mother passed, and his brothers...

Richard trails off.

ABE
No man is above the law.
(to Richard)
That's what you taught me.
(to Hewlett)
And I'll gladly accept whatever
punishment you deem fit for my
forgetting it.     

HEWLETT
I doubt you can afford to pay the
fine.  It pains me to recommend
imprisonment, but...
(to Richard)
We must have no favorites. 

Not a dig.  More of a "help me out here."  Richard ponders.

RICHARD
There may be a... temporary salve.  
The Carlisle Commission has decreed
all those who swear an oath to their
sovereign will be pardoned after
Congress' defeat.  Which appears
imminent.  

HEWLETT
A public oath.  Yes.  That is ideal.

Abe looks at his father, who smiles genuinely.46.

HEWLETT (CONT'D)
And when it's made clear your
cooperation assisted in the capture
of the enemy, any doubt among your
neighbors will be put to rest.  

ABE
Sir?

HEWLETT
The names.  Of the men who attacked
you.  Remember?

Hewlett beckons to a servant, who brings him paper, and quill
and ink.  Richard nods his encouragement to Abe. 

ABE
They were boys from Hempstead. 
Presbyterians.  They used to trade
at Betts Tavern near the Jamaica
Pass.  Matthew Mitchell, William
Washburne, Daniel Taylor.  And then
another one they called... Simon, I
didn't catch his family name, but he
was a fat one.  Mean.  With his head
shaved to the scalp.   

While Abe reports, Richard's smile slowly fades, as he
realizes that his son is lying.  He alone is attuned to what
that sounds like.  Hewlett is busy scribbling down the names.

HEWLETT
Excellent.  I shall pass this on to
Captain Simcoe, with instructions
that if he should encounter these
men on his raid, he will give them
no quarter.    

Both Abe and Richard are surprised.

RICHARD
Raid?

Hewlett sits back and swirls his wine.  

HEWLETT
The dispatch I received today was
from headquarters.  Intelligence
regarding a rebel safehouse across
the Sound, where the insurgents are
launching their attacks from.  

Abe starts to feel sick as Hewlett goes on, excited.  47.

HEWLETT (CONT'D)
We'll cross at night, just like your
attackers.  Silent approach, bayonets
fixed.  Give them their own medicine.  

RICHARD
Are you alright, son?  Not feeling
true?

Abe looks at his Dad.  Knows that he was lying.

ABE
Just exhausted... from the whole
ordeal.

HEWLETT
Recalling it can't be of help.  Why
don't you get home to your bed?

Abe nods his thanks, queasy.  Maybe he better.  Richard
watches him shuffle out, saying nothing.    


Abe sets down lightly into his childhood room.  His old bed
is still here.  He sneaks through, and then stops.  

Stares at a few TOY SOLDIERS on a dresser, along with a
CHESSBOARD.  He has a sudden pang of guilt.48.


Abe peeks out into the hallway.  He can hear the conversation
between his Father and Hewlett from down the hall.  They're
still in the dining room, now onto dessert.  

Abe steps out carefully, then snaps back as a SERVANT crosses
through the hall on the way to the kitchen.   

Now he creeps down to his Father's room...


...Which has now become the Major's room, as Richard has
moved upstairs.  The Major's wardrobe is in trunks.     

Abe crosses to a desk, pulls the drawers.  Finds the DISPATCH. 
He carefully opens it, and moves to the window, unfolds it,
begins to read and memorize it by the moonlight, eyes
searching out the details...

SMASH CUT TO:


DRUNKEN REDCOATS revel in coarse song.

REDCOATS 
Living off the pickings of the Ladies
of the Town!

Anna, running the place on her own, collects pewter mugs to
clean, tries to ignore the dregs of North London or worse. 
And Captain Simcoe, who comes here just to watch her work.    

REDCOATS (CONT'D)
Don t want a bullet up my bumhole /
Don t want my cobblers minced with
ball / For if I have to lose  em 
then let it be with Susan / Or Meg
or Peg or any whore at all!49.

They laugh and cheer.  Simcoe catches Anna's attention.   

SIMCOE
Another round of cider for my boys.

Anna forces a smile.  Simcoe watches her go into the back.


Dark.  Anna creaks down the steps, sets her candle on a cask. 
She goes to grab a quarter barrel of cider...

When a HAND grabs her wrist and another CLAMPS over her mouth
before she can scream.

ABE
Shhh.  It's me.  It's me.  

Abe holds Anna until she nods.  He turns her to face him.

ABE (CONT'D)
You only have a few moments to bring
that cider back so listen close. 

ANNA
Yes.

Doesn't even know what she's saying yes to.  She's ready. 
It trips Abe up for a second, and then he presses on.  

ABE
Tallmadge devised a way so we could
signal him in secret.  

ANNA
He's coming here?!

ABE
He'll send a courier.  We'll meet on
one of the coves along the bay.   

ANNA
Which one?  

ABE
Whichever one is not being watched.  

ANNA
How will he know? 

ABE
You signal him.  Your home can be
seen from the bay.  
(MORE)50.

ABE (CONT'D)
When you hang a black petticoat from
your peg-line, they'll know I'm ready
to meet.  Six coves, left to right. 
You'll pin up white handkerchiefs to
designate the safe one.  That's where
they'll sail.  Tomorrow you'll put
out four. 
(beat)
And Hope to God someone's watching.

Anna is thrilled and scared at the same time.  

The stairs CREAK. 

SIMCOE (O.S.)
Need help down there?  

Abe shows Anna FOUR fingers, then ducks back behind the
barrels of rum, cider, and beer.  Anna smooths her dress as
Simcoe steps down into the candlelight.  

ANNA
Yes, Captain, thank you.  A bit heavy
for me...

She puts the barrel in his arms and quickly heads back up
the stairs.  He glances around the cellar, then follows.  

A moment later, Abe sneaks out and heads for the trap double
doors to the surface.

FADE TO:


Abe walks inside with it.  Mary is sitting near the stove,
nursing Thomas.  

ABE
I'm sorry.

MARY
Whatever you're doing... don't.  We
can't afford to lose you.  

ABE
We?

MARY
I can't.  

She turns to look at him, with a flicker of vulnerability. 
Then turns back to the heat of the stove.  Abe watches her.


Abe lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, counting the seconds.

He turns his head, looks at Thomas, sleeping.  Mary too,
turned away from him.  He runs a finger across Thomas' cheek.  

Abe carefully extracts himself from bed.  


Abe's eyes wander to the left, making contact with ANNA in
the back of the crowd.  

ABE
And the laws of the Province of New
York...

Mary follows his look to her.  

SIMCOE (V.O.)
FIRE!

IN CONNECTICUT - a volley EXPLODES out.  Shattering windows
and blasting the hell out of the building.   

The front line primes and loads while the back advances -
and waits to let loose ANOTHER burst.55.

ABE (V.O.)
Against all traitorous conspiracies
and attempts... 

Both units CHARGE toward the house.  An ENSIGN kicks in the
front door... it's EMPTY.  

ABE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
..Which shall be made against his
person, Crown or Dignity.

BOOM!  MUZZLE FLASHES light up the trees all around them.    
Several Regulars FALL, caught in an AMBUSH. 

Redcoats scramble and die in the CROSSFIRE.  Simcoe PULLS
HIS SWORD.

BEN TALLMADGE leads his Dragoons and some Connecticut Militia
including CALEB in a charge out of their hiding spots. 

They engage the Redcoats at point blank range, FIRING pistols
and STABBING with bayonets.  It's a slaughter.

ABE  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And I will do my utmost endeavor to
disclose and make known to His Majesty
and his Successors...


ABE 
All treasons, and traitorous
conspiracies, which I shall know to
be against, or any of them.

Richard looks on his son with grave, official scrutiny.  


Powder smoke in the air.  Dead King's Men litter the ground.  

SIMCOE, shot in the stomach and knee, pulls himself on his
belly.  His new "Captain" epaulette dangling off the uniform. 
A pair of muddy boots stop in front of him.  

CALEB (O.S.)
Captn' Simcoe?

He looks up to see Caleb looming over him.  Pistol leveled.   

CALEB (CONT'D)
Abe Woodhull says hello. 

Caleb's SHOT echoes through the trees.  56.


ABE
God save the King. 

The neighbors give cheers.  Some are half-hearted.  Robeson,
staring at Abe, turns and quickly walks away.
