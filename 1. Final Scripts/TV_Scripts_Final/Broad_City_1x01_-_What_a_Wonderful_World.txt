      INT. CARLY S BEDROOM - MORNING
      CARLY ABRAMS (25) sits at her desk, adjusting the settings on 
      her brand new vibrator. It buzzes and rotates. The box reads 
      V Tease with a Post-it:  Tuesday Morning!  

      On Carly s lap top, a video chat invite beeps.

      INT. EVELYN S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
      EVELYN WEXLER (22) bounces rhythmically to a NICKI MINAJ song 
      with her lap top on her bed.

      We INTERCUT between CARLY & EVELYN video-chatting:

                                  EVELYN
                Nicki Minaj, biiiiitch!

      CARLY holds the V Tease above her head, pretending she s 
      stretching so EVELYN doesn t see. 

                                  CARLY
                      (Stretching voice)
                Heeey! What a mor-ning!

      CARLY slowly lowers the vibrator behind her lap top, out of 
      sight. It s still buzzing.

                                  EVELYN
                Okay, before you get into your  cup of 
                  steel-cut oats & half a cup of 
                raisins  that s cooling on your desk--

      CARLY nudges a steaming bowl of oatmeal & raisins just behind 
      her lap top.

                                  CARLY
                I don t eat that anymore.

                                  EVELYN 
                There s a secret pop-up Nicki Minaj 
                concert TO-NIGHT: Bowery Ballroom. 
                Nicki and I are gonna make eye 
                contact. Then you and I get back 
                stage, smoke a blunt with her and 
                maybe Drake, and she ll be like  Aw 
                yeah,  and I ll be like,  Unf unf 
                unf. 

      EVELYN acts out her words, spanking and humping while CARLY 
      pulls out a VACUUM-SEALED BAG of clothes from under her bed.                                                                                      2.


                                  CARLY
                I have like no money. I m WALKING to 
                work today!

                                  EVELYN
                No excuses, girl: I m getting big ol 
                balls of mozzerell  today - kyuh! Git 
                it! Chyeah! Harder!

      CARLY pulls out a HEMP VEST and puts it on as EVELYN 
      continues to gyrate.

                                  CARLY
                Can you just talk... normal?

                                  EVELYN
                      (Staccato)
                        I-am-get-ting-my-paycheck-today-and-I- 
                    can-spot-you-bitch.

                                  CARLY 
                Yeah... I mean, I wish I could, but 
                I m actually already booked tonight. I 
                made a stir-fry for the week, so...

                                  EVELYN 
                STIR. FRY?! Can I talk to the Carly 
                who STOLE A VAN because I think SHE 
                would go to this concert in a second.

                                  CARLY
                Enough with the van! I m not proud of 
                my actions. And anyway, I stole it for 
                less than a day. 

                                  EVELYN
                Carly, you NEED this. You re so stuck 
                in this little routine. What, do you 
                schedule when you jack off?

                                  CARLY 
                Ugh. No! Psh... No.

      CARLY puts on the last part of her uniform, a PATCHWORK CAP. 
      EVELYN s dance moves bump her LAPTOP to reveal a MAN S LEG.

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                Oh my god. Is that Lincoln?

      REVEAL LINCOLN (27), EVELYN s recurring fuck-buddy. EVELYN is 
      straddling him, and her computer has been sitting on his 
      belly.                                                                                      3.


                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                Is he... inside you right now?

                                  EVELYN
                      (Like a Mob Wife)
                What I do in my house is none a ya 
                goddamn business!

      CARLY pinches the bridge of her nose, composing herself.

                                  CARLY
                Aright. Let s make this a rule: I 
                don t want to talk to you while you re 
                having sex. I didn t think that was 
                  something I d have to establish, but 
                  apparently it is. I gotta go. Bye, 
                Lincoln.

                                    LINCOLN
                Peace.

      CARLY shuts her lap top. In EVELYN s bed:

                                  EVELYN
                That was hot, that was cool. That was 
                like a threesome kinda.

                                    LINCOLN
                Yeah, I had a lot of fun just now. 
                      (beat)
                I need to clarify something: can I 
                consider you my significant other?

                                  EVELYN
                You are so emotional I can t even 
                handle it.


                                  END OF COLD OPEN

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. BIRD BIRD BAKERY - LATER
      It s a cozy corner bakery where all ingredients are organic, 
      and the decor is loudly eco-friendly.

      A FRAMED PICTURE hangs on the wall of a uniformed CARLY 
      labeled  Employee That s Been Here The Longest.  She stares 
      at it and sighs when she gets a text from Evelyn:

                Sryyyy u saw me fk <3 luv u

      CARLY shrugs - whatever. She hops off the back counter, 
      REVEALING her ornate drawing of the word  NOSTALGIA  on the                                                                                       4.


      chalk board labeled  Word Du Jour. 

      DEB (50s), the eclectic male owner, wearing the same uniform, 
      enters from the back kitchen. 

                                  DEB
                That word is a rich and meaty choice, 
                Carly. Now how do we inspire nostalgia 
                in every customer s experience today?

                                  CARLY
                      (Sighing)
                Deb, I think I m gonna play it by ear.

      DEB holds up two muffins and they smile as CARLY snaps a 
      Polaroid. A BELL RINGS as a Phylicia Rashad-type enters. 

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                Hi. What can we get for you today?

                                  CUSTOMER
                I ll have three large latt s, two 
                coffees, three buckwheat croissants-- 

      Prepping the order, DEB goes into his version of STOMP, 
      pouring, tossing, bagging, etc, while CARLY reluctantly 
      joins.

                                  CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
                Three whole-grain raspberry chutney 
                linzer tarts. Okay, two hand-milled 
                baker s mini-pies... And four farm-
                  sustainable bacon apple buns.

      DEB drum rolls on the counter and mimics urban sounds. 

                                  CARLY
                Chooo chooo.  Aright, will that be all 
                for you today?

      DEB coughs and nods toward the  Word Du Jour  board - 
      Nostalgia. CARLY rings her up and leans into the CUSTOMER. 

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                You should eat one of those bacon 
                apple buns reeeal slow and think about 
                the past, like your family and 
                  memories. 

                                  CUSTOMER
                O-kay.

      THE CUSTOMER exits. CARLY turns to DEB, smiling. He bows to                                                                                       5.


      her with pride, Asian-like.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. DEALS DEALS DEALS - SAME
      It s a digital loft office for a Groupon-like company. A 
      BANNER hangs in the background: DEALS DEALS DEALS!

      EVELYN rushes in, late as usual and tucks herself into the 
      staff meeting currently under way. ROB (30) her supervisor, 
      and the only one in the office wearing a tie, is running the 
      show.

                                  ROB
                I m not mad at you guys, I m just 
                getting a lot of heat from up top. We 
                gotta get more Pilates and massages. 
                We need some fresh deals...

                                  THE GROUP
                Deals deals.

      AN EMPLOYEE raises their hand.

                                  EMPLOYEE
                I ve been talking to the West Side 
                Segway tours--

                                  ROB
                      (Points at them)
                THAT S what I m talkin  about.

      EMPLOYEE #2 raises their hand.

                                  EMPLOYEE #2
                I m really interested in these D-I-Y 
                ear candling workshops. I think that d 
                be great for us.

                                  ROB
                YES!!!

      EVELYN raises her hand.

                                  EVELYN
                I m really interested in the paychecks 
                and, um, specifically if I could have 
                mine. In this moment.

                                  ROB
                Like I said 20 minutes ago, to 
                everyone who was here, paychecks 
                aren t coming until Friday.                                                                                       6.


                                  EVELYN
                Then I better go make some deals--

                                  THE GROUP
                Deals deals.

                                  EVELYN
                Yeah. Got it.

      EVELYN slinks out of the crowd and into her chair, staring at 
      her COMPUTER, which has a CUT-OUT OF NICKI MINAJ S HEAD taped 
      to the corner. 

      She has several tabs open: Salon Banane, Vajazzling, CARLY s 
      Facebook Page, and Mikala s Maids Cleaning Service. She gets 
      an idea.

      EVELYN opens Craigslist on her browser. She starts posting an 
      ad. We see the first sentence.

                We re Just 2 Jewesses Tryin  To Make A 
                Buck.

      She continues typing as the meeting behind her ends. Rob 
      walks by.

                                  ROB
                Last time I checked, Craigslist wasn t 
                one of our clients.

                                  EVELYN
                      (Throws up hands)
                Ya got me, Rob!

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. BIRD BIRD BAKERY - LATER
      CARLY refills the coffee machine as EVELYN enters.

                                  EVELYN
                Yes!!!

                                  CARLY
                      (Shaking her head)
                No... Stop. What are you doing here?

                                  EVELYN
                Nothing, I m here to get a Carly Corn 
                Muffin. Cuz I need some fuel for the 
                concert tonight. 

                                  CARLY
                Dude, stop trying to convince me to go 
                 cuz I m working--                                                                                      7.



      CARLY leans back to peek into the kitchen. DEB sings to a 
      tray of apricot almond croissants. 

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                There s 48 cinnamon pear crumb tortes 
                I have to place, so...

      A MOUNTAIN OF TORTES sits behind her on a tray.

                                  EVELYN
                Oh yeah, you GOTTA place the tortes. 

                                  CARLY
                Evelyn, I don t think you understand 
                how many things are going on right 
                now. I mean, there s like--

      CARLY taps the coffee machine, an iced tea tub, the cash 
      register, etc.

                                  CARLY (CONT D)
                This is not gonna work. I know what 
                you re trying to do.

                                  EVELYN
                      (Throws up hands)
                  Listennn-uh! I was just strolling 
                through the neighborhood and wanted to 
                see my #1.

                                  CARLY
                And Deb... He counts on me. I can t 
                just leave him.

                                  EVELYN
                It s very clear that you can t part 
                with Deb. 

      EVELYN points to the wall. REVEAL the  Photo Du Jour  
      project, a wall covered in Polaroids of Deb & Carly that they 
      post daily.

                                  EVELYN (CONT D)
                Maybe you two should hook up already 
                so you can shove muffins up each 
                other s butts foreal.

      One of the Polaroids is of DEB smiling, sticking his butt out 
      as CARLY holds a muffin up to it. CARLY is now totally 
      creeped out by the  Photo Du Jour  project.                                                                                      8.

                Fuck.

      INT. BIRD BIRD BAKERY - MOMENTS LATER
      CARLY lies face down on the floor. A CUP OF COFFEE is in one 
      hand, spilled, the puddle growing like blood. The other hand 
      rests gently on a CROISSANT. 

      EVELYN sits at a table pretending to be a customer.

                                  EVELYN
                      (Shouting)
                Hello? Help! Call 9-1-1!
                (Beat.)
                Or maybe don t rush into calling, but 
                check out the situation for yourself!

      DEB rushes in from the kitchen. 

                                  DEB
                Carly? Car. Car. Carly! 

      CARLY fakes waking up.

                                  CARLY
                Woah. I must have fainted. Did I hit 
                anything on my way down? Are the 
                tortes okay? Please tell me the crumb 
                tortes weren t hurt!

                                  DEB
                No, child. Go home and nurture 
                  yourself. You are exhausted from 
                caring. I ve been there.

                                  CARLY
                Are you sure??

                Go.

      CARLY & EVELYN slap five as they exit, each eating a pastry.

      THE GIRLS turn a corner.                                                                                      9.


                                  EVELYN
                Hey, girl.

      EVELYN opens her jacket to reveal VARIOUS OFFICE SUPPLIES 
      taped to the inside, spilling out of her pockets, purse, and 
      pants.

                                  CARLY
                Woah! Where d you get all that?

                                  EVELYN
                      (Mob Wife voice)
                What I do at my place a work is none a 
                ya goddamn business.

                                  CARLY
                You are. In. Sane.

      They pass TEEN SKATERS ON A STOOP.

                                  TEEN #1
                Nice ass, Mommy!

                                  CARLY
                Go to school!

                                  EVELYN
                Tickets are 85 each, then we gotta get 
                an eighth. Plus drinks... We need like 
                200 bucks.

                                  CARLY 
                Wait, my Fishbowl of Change!

                                  EVELYN
                Perfect. Your F.O.C! You down with 
                F.O.C?

                                  CARLY
                Yeah, you know me!

                                  EVELYN
                So we ll head to Queens after we take 
                care of business.

      EVELYN opens her jacket again.

                                  CARLY
                      (Nodding)
                Yep, I saw it.

      EXT. UNION SQUARE STAPLES - DAY
      CARLY & EVELYN run into STAPLES.                                                                                    10.


      INT. UNION SQUARE STAPLES - CONTINUOUS
      THE GIRLS enter, and the ALARM goes off. CARLY puts her hands 
      up like she s being arrested.

                                  EVELYN
                BE. COOL.

      They walk up to the CUSTOMER SERVICE line and wait. SHENAE, 
      an empty-eyed employee, calls on them.

                                  SHENAE
                Next!

      EVELYN dumps the stolen OFFICE SUPPLIES onto the counter.

                                  EVELYN
                I would like to return these items, 
                please. I once owned them personally 
                but have no use for them now.

      SHENAE eyes the girls suspiciously but doesn t care enough to 
      do anything. She rings up the items.

                                  SHENAE
                Your total comes to 135 dollars and 67 
                cents. 

                      EVELYNCARLY
      Yessss.Ho. Lee. Shit.

      SHENAE hands them a STAPLES GIFT CARD. THE GIRLS deflate.

                                  EVELYN
                Uh. Okay, wait. I m sorry, but we d 
                really prefer to get that in cash.

      SHENAE genuinely cracks up.

                                  SHENAE
                Of course you would.

      EVELYN takes the gift card and, defeated, they exit. 

      On the way out, EVELYN looks directly into a security camera 
      and gives it the finger. CARLY joins her. EVELYN exits. CARLY 
      mouths to the camera:  I m so sorry. Have a good day! 

      INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATER
      CARLY & EVELYN just miss the train.

      They spot SHAUN, a mutual friend. He s already waving.                                                                                    11.


                                  SHAUN
                My two favorite ladies, what s goin

                party.

                Yeah, that s crazy! How ya been?

                                  EVELYN
                Good, we re goin  to Asturierrr. 

      SHAUN looks to CARLY for help.

                                  CARLY
                Astoria. How are you, where you 
                headed?

                                  SHAUN
                I m okay. I m goin  home.

      That s awesome.Cool. 

                                  CARLY
                Well, it was awesome to see you.

                                  SHAUN 
                Well, you re still seeing me. What--

                                  CARLY
                It s just that we were gonna walk
                to that end because--

                                  SHAUN
                But we re taking the same train, so--

                                  CARLY
                Yeah, we are, but we need to be at 
                that end of the train for the Ditmars 
                exit.

                                  SHAUN
                I know what this is about. 

                                  EVELYN
                Here we go.                                                                                    12.


                                  SHAUN
                We hooked up and you can t handle 
                being around me because you didn t 
                return my calls.

                                  CARLY
                We re seriously just trying to be more 
                  efficient with our time.

                                  SHAUN
                Cool. I ll just wave to you from over 
                here when we get on the same train--

                                  CARLY
                You re making this like a thing.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. N-TRAIN, MOMENTS LATER
      Seated left to right: CARLY, SHAUN, and EVELYN sit in 
      silence. 

      The train arrives at the next station, and SHAUN puts in his 
      ear buds and walks off.

                                  EVELYN
                You know what they call Black-Jewish 
                babies? Blewish.

                                  CARLY
                Who? Who does that?

      EVELYN shrugs. SHAUN slips into the next SUBWAY CAR.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. CARLY S APARTMENT - EARLY AFTERNOON
      MATT (late-20s) is surrounded by wrappers, crumbs, a gamer 
      magazine, etc. as he plays HALO, yelling into a headset.

                                  MATT
                      (Into headset)
                What are you, Justin, a noob? Tea-bag 
                that son of a bitch! (To THE GIRLS) 
                Hey guys!

      CARLY & EVELYN are disappointed he s there.

                                  CARLY & EVELYN
                  Hey./Hi...

      CARLY walks to the FRIDGE and opens it. Projecting, in a 
      stage voice:                                                                                    13.


                                  CARLY
                Oh. Evelyn, I m so sorry that the 
                CHEESE you wanted is all gone. I was 
                sure I had enough for at least three 
                more days of casual snacking. But I 
                guess SOMEONE ate it. 

      EVELYN doesn t want to be a part of it.

                                  EVELYN
                What are you talking about? Just say 
                it. (Re: Matt) HE S not gonna get 
                hints.

      MATT doesn t. EVELYN S PHONE buzzes and she exits to answer 
      it in the bathroom. CARLY takes a deep breath.

                                  CARLY
                Hey, Matt? So I noticed you finished 
                that cheese of mine. Again. Can you... 
                not? Or... get more?

                                  MATT
                      (Into headset)
                Fire -- dubs! Dubs! Cap it, man! Send 
                those blueberries into camp. (To 
                CARLY) Oh, I m so sorry. I didn t 
                realize it was yours.

      CARLY lingers in the kitchen staring at MATT.

                                  MATT (CONT'D)
                Did you want me to go now? I can throw 
                on some sweats and run out.
                      (Into headset)
                No man, I was just talking to my 
                  roommate.

                                  CARLY
                      (Under her breath)
                Ugh. You re not my roommate. You re my 
                  roommate s boyfriend.

                                  MATT
                What?

                                  CARLY
                Nothing.

                                  MATT
                      (Put his hand over headset 
                        speaker)
                Toilet s clogged, by the way.                                                                                    14.


                                  CARLY
                Okay, cool. (Under her breath) You 
                disgust me.

                                  MATT
                What?

                                  CARLY
                Nothing.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. BATHROOM - SAME
      EVELYN, in her bra, snaps a photo of her BOOBS on her PHONE. 
      She sends it.

                                  EVELYN
                      (Into the phone)
                Sending it now, my Craigslist mystery 
                man.
                (Beat.)
                What does that mean,  TOO BIG? 

      Angry, she hangs up. She notices the toilet s clogged and 
      plunges it.

      INT. CARLY S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
      CARLY stands as still as she can, posing in a checkered 
        button-down, suspenders, bow tie, and crisp slacks. She is 
      holding drumsticks. EVELYN enters.

      INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
      THE GIRLS drag a DRUM SET into the hallway. The building s 
      super and CARLY s next-door neighbor, MS. KRAGG (40s), treats 
      the building like a dorm, and she is the RA. 

      She tacks up a  Walk for Dyslexia  flier on a BULLETIN BOARD 
      that hangs next to her door labeled  KRAGGSLIST.  This is an 
      elaborate, tangible version of Craigslist for the tenants.

                                  CARLY & EVELYN
                What s up, Ms. Kragg./Hey.

                Just making a post on Kraggslist.                                                                                    15.



      KRAGG notices their outfits. 

                                  MS. KRAGG (CONT'D)
                No way! No WAY! Is the band getting 
                back together?!

      CARLY rolls her eyes to EVELYN, who rolls her eyes back.

                                  MS. KRAGG (CONT'D)
                Wait. Wait wait wait. O Neill and I 
                have to be there. This is HUGE. We ll 
                be your roadies.

                                  CARLY
                I mean, I... don t--

                                  MS. KRAGG
                And we ll pay for your cab down there!

      CARLY & EVELYN look at each other.

                                  CARLY
                We literally can t say no to that.

      KRAGG exits into her apartment that she lives in with her 
      roommate, MS. O NEILL. THE GIRLS stay in the hall.

                                  MS. KRAGG
                O Neill, stop the Bagel Bites--

      We hear a BAKING TRAY drop to the ground inside.

                                  EVELYN
                I m stoked for this. We were legit 
                good... right?

                                  CARLY
                Yeah, I m still surprised we never got 
                signed.

                                  EVELYN
                Well, it was old-timey music. We were 
                ahead of our time, retrospectively.

                                  CARLY
                And old people loved us. If old people 
                like you, you re doing something 
                right!

                                  EVELYN
                Old people are like, hot in a way?                                                                                    16.


                                  CARLY
                Like Sidney Poitier!

                                  EVELYN
                Steve Martin!

                                  CARLY
                Richard Jenkins!

                                  EVELYN
                Cicely Tyson!

      KRAGG & O NEILL enter the hallway. KRAGG wears mom jeans and 
      a sequin button-down. O NEILL dons a sherbet-colored velvet 
      sweat suit. 

                                  MS. KRAGG
                Cool, right?!

      THE GIRLS  mouths are agape.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. CAB - LATER
      It s extremely tight as all four ladies squish in the back of 
      the cab. MS. O NEILL holds the SNARE DRUM.

                                  MS. KRAGG
                      (Air quotes)
                We should  do  brunch this weekend. 
                I m a big Yelper, just so you know.

      CARLY looks out the window. EVELYN closes her eyes.

                                  MS. KRAGG (CONT'D)
                I just read about this hot spot, The 
                Toasty Pantry. They re known for their 
                  fri-ta-tas. It s like an omelette... 

      CARLY & EVELYN painstakingly keep quiet.

                                  MS. O NEILL
                We ll pay!

      CARLY & EVELYN brighten up. They look at each other.

                                  EVELYN
                We re free Saturday.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - AFTERNOON
      The FOUR WOMEN set up the DRUMS and performance space near 
      the fountain when JAIME (Hy-may, early 20s), EVELYN s                                                                                     17.


      fashionable gay stoner roommate with a slight Venezuelan 
      accent, approaches. He is visibly stoned.

                                  JAIME
                Special delivery for Evelyn Wexler!

      He takes out of his attach  EVELYN S COSTUME, TAP SHOES, and 
      A BAGGIE OF WEED. EVELYN takes it and hugs and kisses him.

                                  EVELYN
                Jaim , you are the best roommate--

      EVELYN looks to CARLY and leans in to whisper to JAIME so 
      that CARLY doesn t hear.

                                  EVELYN (CONT'D)
                And best FRIEND ever. 
                (Beat.)
                Sooo whenever you re ready to become a 
                citizen, I m still on the table.

      CARLY approaches JAIME as EVELYN exits.

                                  CARLY
                Jaim ! Himmelz. Hymes!

                                  JAIME
                Hey girl.

                                  CARLY
                Are you... stoned?

                                  JAIME
                Yes I am.

                                  CARLY
                Good. Regarding the pot: we can give 
                you that 60 bucks a-s-a-p. OR. Orrrr.

      CARLY takes out from her back pocket the STAPLES GIFT CARD.

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                You could have this Staples gift card 
                that has one hundred and thirty-five 
                dollars on it.

                                  JAIME
                Woah.

                                  CARLY
                I know: it s Staples, what can you 
                even buy there? Only any electronic 
                device you could ever want. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    18.

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                Any office supply known to man. I 
                think they even have food now.

                                  JAIME
                I ll take it!

                                  CARLY
                Any type of paper -- your basic 
                printer, card stock, construction, 
                Post-it. 

                                  JAIME
                Okay, okay, gimme gimme--

                                  CARLY
                Even like big things -- trash cans, 
                rolly desk chairs, lamps--

                                  JAIME
                Please give it to me!

      CARLY hands it over. They turn away from each other.

                        CARLYJAIME 
      Yes!Yesss!


                                                                              CUT TO:

      EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - MOMENTS LATER
      In front of the drums, a SMALL SIGN leans on the FISHBOWL 
      that reads  Honey & the Sweethearts.  

      Both girls are now dressed in Vaudevillian-inspired outfits 
      and speak in Vaudevillian-inspired accents.

                        CARLYEVELYN

      MONTAGE:

      CARLY & EVELYN fake blow into CARDBOARD BUGLES and then smack 
      each other with them, Three Stooges-style.

      CARLY plays the DRUM SET while EVELYN TAP DANCES.

      KRAGG & O NEILL take from-above Facebook pics on a phone.

      CARLY fails at a one-armed push-up with a LITTLE OLD LADY on 
      her back.

      THE GIRLS hold hands and bow. REVEAL CROWD: old-ass people in                                                                                     19.


      wheelchairs and walkers with private nurses try to clap.

      INT. BANK - MOMENTS LATER
      THE GIRLS stand at the COINSTAR pouring change and pushing it 
      through the machine, handfuls at a time.

                                  EVELYN
                You know what I was thinking today?

                                  CARLY
                I really have no idea.

                                  EVELYN
                I really DO want a girl to go down on 
                me.

                                  CARLY
                Evelyn, seriously, you can t keep 
                bringing this up with me. I m not 
                  interested.

                                  EVELYN
                Ugh! I wasn t talking about YOU. 

      CARLY presses buttons on the machine.

                                  CARLY
                Oh really? Because last time--

                                  EVELYN
                Last time was different! I was just 
                checking the temperature. It s a whole 
                new season.

                                  CARLY
                      (Sarcastic)
                Well, then awesome, and thank you so 
                much for keeping me up to date on this 
                whole issue. 

                                  EVELYN
                      (Not sarcastic)
                Well, you re welcome. 
                (Beat.)
                BUT I DO just wanna put out there that 
                I m not necessarily closing this door.

                                  CARLY
                So this IS about ME! If I fuckin  
                ripped your pants off and went crazy 
                on your (air quotes)  pussy,  you d 
                love it. You d die happy.                                                                                     20.


      CARLY collects the receipt that ejects from the machine.

                                  EVELYN
                Psh. J-K. You know, labels are just--

      REVEAL MOM & CHILD, who holds a piggy bank, standing behind

                                  CARLY
                Sorry--

                                  MOM
                No, no. Thank you. This is the exact 
                time AND place I wanted to explain 
                eating a  pussy  out to my 8-year old.

                                  EVELYN
                      (Not sarcastic)
                Oh, perfect!

      EXT. BANK/BAR NONE - MOMENTS LATER
      THE GIRLS each eat a lollipop as they walk on the sidewalk. 
      CARLY fans out the BILLS.

                                  CARLY
                We did GOOD.

      EVELYN opens up her jacket to reveal the bank s PENS AND 
      LOLLIPOPS stuffed into an inside pocket.

                                  EVELYN
                Yes we did.

      CARLY is unimpressed. She stops in her tracks.

                                  CARLY
                Evelyn, look at this.

      They re standing in front of BAR NONE, where a sign in the 
      window reads:

                Happy Hour Special: Drink Like A Fish. 
                If you can finish the fishbowl of 
                beer, it s free!!!

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                Dude, this is a great deal. Perfect 
                  pre-game. We ll be drunk all night!                                                                                    21.

                      (Holding up the fishbowl)
                Oh my god. And we have this already 
                and it s empty. We can just go in!!! 

                                  CARLY
                Wh-- What? Then why would we go in at 
                all?

                                  EVELYN
                Cuz once you finish, it s free. And 
                ours is already empty.

                                  CARLY
                Are you kidding me right now? The only 
                reason we would do this is to drink. 
                We would finish the fishbowl of beer.

      EVELYN S mouth hangs open for too long.

                                  EVELYN
                  OoooOOOoooh.

                                  CARLY
                Are you stoned right now?

                                  EVELYN
                No. (Beat.) Yes.

                                  CARLY
                Ugh, you got stoned without me?

      EVELYN presents one of those one-hitters that looks like a 
      cigarette and hands it to CARLY with the POT.

                                  EVELYN
                Catch up now, bitch.

      EVELYN pushes CARLY into a PHONE BOOTH and holds her jacket 
      up, creating a wall. CARLY smokes.

                                  CARLY
                There s not even a phone in here.

                                  EVELYN
                Don t touch anything!
                (To a passer-by, sweetly)
                Nothing!

      INT. BAR NONE - LATER
      CARLY and EVELYN, stoned and drunk, sip beer out of 
      fishbowls. The group next to them gets up and leaves, and THE 
      GIRLS stare at the empty table.                                                                                    22.


                                  CARLY
                Do it.

      EVELYN grabs a BASKET OF MOZZARELLA STICKS. They chomp on 
      them. Louie Armstrong s  What A Wonderful World  comes on.

                                  CARLY (CONT D)
                Ugh, I love this song.

                                  EVELYN
                Ugh, this is a slave song.

                                  CARLY
                What?

                                  EVELYN
                Yeah, it s widely known by the Black 
                  community that this is a slave song. 
                Cuz he s like,  Thank you, Master, for 
                this, like, beautiful world you ve 
                given me. 

                                  CARLY
                I ve never heard that before.

                                  EVELYN
                Car, I m sorry, but you re just not 
                tuned in.

                                  CARLY
                Yeah, I m not  tuned in  to the world 
                inside your head where this is true.

                                  EVELYN
                It s a thing. It s in a Fugees song,   
                Google it! Wyclef s like,
                        (impersonating Louie 
                        Armstrong)  and I think to 
                        myself- 

                                  CARLY
                Please don t. I m not saying that no
                one has ever thought that but I just 
                don t think it s a thing.

      EVELYN s cell phone rings. RACK FOCUS on a BLACK COUPLE in 
      the booth behind them.

                                  BLACK WOMAN
                I don t know - IS that a thing?

      RACK FOCUS back to EVELYN.                                                                                    23.


                                  EVELYN 
                      (Into phone)
                Hello? Hi. Yes, that makes perfect 
                sense. No acknowledgement, okay. We ll 
                be there a-s-a-p. Thank you, sir!

      She hangs up, excited.

                                  CARLY
                Who was that?

                                  EVELYN 
                I had a back-up plan on the low this 
                whole time. (Making the money 
                  gesture.) Beelz y all!!! Nicki Nicki 
                Nicki!!!

                                  CARLY
                Wait!  

      CARLY combines their fishbowls of beer, and when the coast is 
      clear, she pours it into a POTTED PLANT.

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                      (Whispers to PLANT)
                I m so sorry.

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING
      THE GIRLS, still drunk, arrive at a nice apartment building. 
      They go up the steps, and EVELYN buzzes in.

                                  CARLY
                So can you finally tell me what we re 
                doing?

                                  EVELYN
                Okay, so we are about to clean an 
                  apartment for ONE HOUR ONLY. And we re 
                gonna make 400 dollars.

                                  CARLY
                FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS?! What? This is 
                amazing.

      The DOOR BEEPS: it s open. THE GIRLS enter the building.  
      EVELYN holds the door for CARLY with guilt in her eyes.

      INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
      Walking down the hallway:

                                  CARLY
                Man, 400 dollars! I could quit my job 
                and do this full-time.                                                                                    24.


                                  EVELYN
                  Perrr-haps.

      They get to the door. EVELYN opens it.

      INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
      THE GIRLS enter a dim foyer. CLEANING SUPPLIES sit in the 
      center of the living room in front of them. EVELYN looks 
      around. She takes a deep breath and begins to slide off her 
      suspenders and unbutton her checkered shirt.

                                  EVELYN
                        (Whispering)
                Aright, so I m gonna start taking my 
                clothes off now. It s all part of it.

                                  CARLY
                What the FUCK. I don t understand--

                                  EVELYN
                        (Whispering)
                It s just in our underwear and it s 
                only an hour. I know what you re gonna 
                say--

                                  CARLY
                What? Why?! I m so confused. Why are 
                we whispering?

      EVELYN nods to the far corner of the room where a JOHN WATERS-
      TYPE crouches behind a PLANT. He cracks a little SMILE.

      In shock, CARLY goes for the door. EVELYN pleads, while 
      taking off her pants.

                                  EVELYN
                It s ONE HOUR only. Four. Hundred. 
                Dollars. 

                                  CARLY
                Oh my god. No. No. Ew! This is insane.

                                  EVELYN
                What would you be doing instead, 
                watching Breaking Bad and eating a 
                Smart Ones?

                                  CARLY
                It s a stir fry!

                                  EVELYN 
                We re badass bitches on a wild 
                  adventure right now. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    25.

                                  EVELYN  (CONT'D)
                (Crosses her arms & shakes her head) 
                Where s the Carly who sold mushroom 
                  chocolates?

                                  CARLY 
                She s in college! Are you kidding me?

                                  EVELYN
                Well I didn t get to hang out with 
                her! I m sorry, but you re losing your 
                edge.

      CARLY shakes her head and takes a deep breath.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. APARTMENT - LATER
      Down to their underwear (EVELYN still wears suspenders), THE 
      GIRLS clean throughout the apartment.

      MONTAGE:

      CARLY Swiffers with her ass facing the wall because she s 
      wearing a thong. She holds a pillow in front of her. JOHN 
      WATERS GUY leans out from behind a wall, watching.

      EVELYN, on all fours, scrubs behind the TOILET. JOHN WATERS 
      GUY stands in the doorway. EVELYN tips an invisible top hat 
      to him.

      CARLY drags a bucket of water across the floor, bumping into 
      JOHN WATERS who watches EVELYN. They do the thing of trying 
      to get past each other with clipped movement. It s awkward.

      EVELYN purposely knocks a book off a shelf. She bends down as 
      sexy as she can and turns around. Instead of JOHN WATERS, 
      it s CARLY who is standing there and makes a face: Really?

      CARLY holds a POTTED PLANT as tall as she is in front of her 
      as she vacuums. The clock changes from 7:47 to 7:48. She 
      stops and rushes to put on her clothes. 

                                  CARLY
                Okay, okay, one hour s up.

                                  EVELYN
                Aright, dude, I m acknowledging you 
                now. Party s over. Money, please.

      JOHN WATERS GUY takes a seat on one of the MANY OTTOMANS in 
      the apartment.                                                                                    26.


                                  JOHN WATERS GUY
                      (Baby voice)
                Oh, I m sowwy I don t have any. I m a 
                bad boy.

                                  CARLY 
                What? We just cleaned in our underwear 
                for AN HOUR. You are PAYING us.

                                  JOHN WATERS GUY
                      (Baby voice)
                I don t know. I m just a bay-bee.

                                  CARLY
                      (To EVELYN)
                Can you please put your clothes on?

      EVELYN kicks a lamp, and it shatters on the floor. JOHN 
      WATERS GUY jumps to his feet.

                                  EVELYN 
                How do you like that? You like being 
                scared cuz you re a pissy baby!

      CARLY picks up the BUCKET OF MOP WATER and pours it onto the 
      SOFA.

                                  CARLY 
                I m a menace to society!!!

      EVELYN brings in from the kitchen two WINE SPRITZERS and 
      hands one to CARLY.

                                  EVELYN
                Strip down, pencil dick!

                                  CARLY
                You need to know how it FEELS!

      JOHN WATERS GUY eagerly takes off his clothes and is wearing 
      A PULL-UP DIAPER. THE GIRLS gasp.

                                  JOHN WATERS GUY
                      (Baby voice)
                Uh oh. Am I in twouble?

      CARLY & EVELYN burst into laughter. 

                                  CARLY
                Ho. Lee. Shit. I didn t know this was 
                a thing!

                                  EVELYN
                Oh, it s a thing.                                                                                    27.



      They grab their bags and steal a couple COATS, HATS, a VASE, 
      a MAIL HOLDER, and a WELCOME MAT, all by the door.

                                  CARLY
                These are for services rendered!

                                  EVELYN
                You bad baby boy!

      They exit, laughing. JOHN WATERS bawls uncontrollably.

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT
      THE GIRLS stumble along the sidewalk wearing JOHN WATERS s 
      outer-wear, holding the stolen goods. They laugh as a GROUP 
      OF TEENS walk by. One 5-year old calls:

                                  5-YEAR OLD
                Shake it, cougars!

                                  CARLY
                Change your diaper!

                                  EVELYN
                Go suck on your mom s tit!

      They continue walking.

                                  CARLY
                Evelyn, guess what I realized tonight?

                                  EVELYN
                What?

                                  CARLY
                      (Baby voice)
                I m a pwetty baby. 

      EVELYN throws her head back and shrieks. She sees a huge 
      BILLBOARD OF NICKI MINAJ and shrieks again.

                                  CARLY (CONT D)
                Ohh my god, NICKI!!

                                  EVELYN
                I knew I d see my queen tonight!

      EVELYN plays a NICKI MINAJ song on her phone and the girls 
      throw down the stolen goods and dance their asses off like 
      they re NOT wearing Vaudevillian-inspired costumes and an 
      adult baby s overcoats. People honk and cheer as they pass.

                                  EVELYN (CONT D)
                I fuck the world with a long dick!                                                                                    28.


                                  CARLY
                I do that, too! 

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. JAIME & EVELYN S APARTMENT - NIGHT
      JAIME, in a NEON TANK TOP and LONG-JOHNS, opens the front 
      door. A PIZZA DELIVERY MAN hands him a stack of FIVE BOXES OF 
      PIZZA. JAIME hands him the STAPLES GIFT CARD.

                                  PIZZA MAN
                Pleasure doin  business with ya.

      JAIME shuts the door and walks into EVELYN S bedroom.

      INT. EVELYN S BEDROOM/INT. CARLY S BEDROOM - NIGHT
      We INTERCUT between THE GIRLS video-chatting:

      EVELYN, now in her PJs stands at her laptop as Jaim  lays on 
      her bed behind her eating a slice of pizza.

      CARLY sits at her desk eating BAGEL BITES with a towel on her 
      head. She replaces the  Tuesday?!  Post-It on the V Tease 
      vibrator with one that reads  WEDNESDAY!/Rain date Thursday. 

                                  EVELYN
                I m so lucky to have an elevator in my 
                house. I ll be right back.

      EVELYN presses an invisible button and looks at an invisible 
      watch as she lowers below frame. CARLY cracks up and tokes a 
      JOINT.

      EVELYN pops up with a bag of GUMMY BEARS. 

                                  CARLY
                Gummy bears! Gimme one!

      EVELYN pretend-feeds CARLY a GUMMY BEAR through the camera. 
      CARLY fake-chomps on it. 

                                  EVELYN
                Okay, last thing, I promise. Would you 
                pull the lever for the trap door?

      CARLY pulls an INVISIBLE LEVER. EVELYN falls backward onto 
      her bed, under-frame. She pops back up with a CAN in her 
      hand.

                                  EVELYN (CONT'D)
                Lemon seltzaaa!!!

                                  CARLY
                Hold on, hold on. I got one.                                                                                     29.


      EVELYN tokes on her pipe while CARLY does the classic trick 
      of pulling her thumbs apart. EVELYN cracks up and falls to
