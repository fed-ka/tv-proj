SOUND BOOTH
A few sound engineers and mixers work over recording panels and watch
Hermann and the orchestra as Welles, Toland and Mank enter.
MANK
You read Louella?
Welles shudders
WELLES
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny
upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she
wouldn't know how to spell that
MANK
(reads)
"And how is the country to feel when this industry
continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and
swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't
Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real
Americans deserve work?"
WELLES
(laughs)
Well, at least she's off KANE today
MANK
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's
using code language to the studio bosses.
"Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who
the hell do you think she's talking about?
WELLES
(playfully)
Hedy Lamarr?
MANK
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
beat
Welles' smile fades.
MANK
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio?
The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew"
and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool
they start sweating.
WELLES
(growing tense)
So they're Jews. . .
MANK
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or
later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys
know that there is only one thing this country hates
more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
WELLES
Christ.
MANK
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You
don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's
like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red-
white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it
you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam
Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick
becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna
think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
WELLES
What does this have to do with--?
MANK
(dead serious)
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I
mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from
gettin' out.
WELLES
(sharply)
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what
they're going to do?!
One of the sound technicians turns to Welles:
SOUND TECHNICIAN Sorry, Mr. Welles, I can't really hear
Welles, Mank and Toland quickly decamp to a hallway outside the
recording stage...
INT HALLWAY FOLLOWING
They emerge into the hallway. Mank lights a cigar.
MANK
(quietly)
Let me tell you a story, son
So this was 1924,
right? Hearst was throwing a birthday party for
Thomas Ince, the old movie producer. They were all
on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from
Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was.
This was Hearst, Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin,
Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst notices
Marion slip off with Chaplin -- she was screwing
everyone then -- and the old man goes nuts. Grabs
his revolver and starts shooting. Just like Tom Mix,
standing there blasting away through the fog. Boom -
- boom -- boom -- and Thomas Ince takes a bullet
through the head. So now there's this dead guy lying
on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an
embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice
and quiet and Ince was cremated lickety-split. No
inquest and no police. It was right after this that
Hearst gives Louella her life-time contract. Just to
keep her all hush-hush.
A beat as Mank gazes at Welles.
A beat
MANK
If he had known about KANE before you made it,
you'd be dead already.
WELLES
(weakly)
It's too late. The movie's made
MANK
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other
studio heads--
WELLES
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to
fight for it?!
MANK
(bitterly)
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he
was going to come after us! So we took the chance
anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got
my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what
it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Welles leans forward in a sudden explosion of anger
WELLES
I WILL NOT MOVE ON! Let them do their worst! These
petty tyrants! These monstrous, small men Do they
think they can stop us? I Who are they?! Who are
they?! THEY ARE . .. ACCOUNTANTS I
Bernard Hermann appears at a doorway from the recording stage.
BERNARD HERMANN
We're ready. You want to hear it?
Welles goes with Hermann into the stage. Toland and Mank stand in
silence. Then:
TOLAND
His next picture ... he wants to play Christ.
MANK
Hope he's planning to start with the crucifixion.
76 INT RECORDING STAGE FOLLOWING
Welles sits at the back of the stage, deep in thought
Bernard Hermann raises his baton and prepares to conduct. The opening
shots of KANE -- fog shrouded Xanadu -- are projected on the screen.
Hermann conducts and the orchestra plays.
We watch the first images of the film with the brilliant music.
We pull back to reveal we are at
INT SAN SIMEON. SCREENING ROOM NIGHT
Hearst and Marion are sitting in the plush San Simeon screening room,
surrounded by a passel of dachshunds. Five or six friends are also
spread around the room. Joe Willicombe is also present.
We watch their faces as they watch CITIZEN KANE
During this sequence we hear bits and pieces of KANE as we watch Hearst
and Marion react.
We see Marion's initial amusement give way to a forced neutrality.
We see Hearst becoming increasingly uncomfortable, reacting physically,
almost writhing, as his soul is laid bare. Then his face grows cold.
Drained.
We see Joe Willicombe, offended.
We see the other guests, horrified and afraid to even so much as glance
at Hearst.
Finally, we hear the ending of the movie:
"RAYMOND"
"Throw that junk in, too.
We hear Bernard Hermann's closing music begin to play out
Hearst abruptly stands, the final images of the film washing over his
face.
HEARST
Switch it off SWITCH IT OFF
The film suddenly stops and lights come up around the screening room.
Silence No one looks at Hearst.
HEARST
(quietly)
Would everyone please leave
The guests and Joe Willicombe solemnly file out A pause
MARION
Well -- he got us, didn't he?
She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
MARION
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
HEARST
Marion--
MARION
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his
goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he
married her!
HEARST
This picture--
MARION
(deeply)
I am not that woman.
A beat.
I know what I could have been. I know what I gave up to stay with you.
MARION
(pained)
I mean he's even got the goddamn jigsaw puzzles
She dissolves into sobs. He cradles her in the empty screening room
A beat
MARION
Why did he do that to us?
INT SAN SIMEON. ASSEMBLY ROOM NIGHT
Hearst is as we have never seen him before. He is in a titanic rage.
He paces back and forth violently like a caged animal, becoming
increasingly manic and uncontrolled, clenching his fists and barking to
Joe Willicombe:
HEARST
And now of all times -- NOW -- when I am grasping
on with my fingernails to live at all this Orson We
lies -- this insect -- this reprehensible insect --
has the nerve TO CHALLENGE ME! To show my life as
some cheap sideshow -- A FREAK SHOW -- A DYING,
IMPOTENT OLD FREAK IN HIS CASTLE!
He smashes a collection of figurines and sends them sailing across the
room. Hearst's rage gives way to a darker passion:
HEARST
(intensely)
Mr. Willicombe -- you have seen me in adversity --
you have seen me take on the unions and the Congress
and the railroads -- and we have risen above -- we
have risen above. And if that dog Welles thinks he
can strike at me now -- when he thinks I'm weak when
he thinks I'm vulnerable -- then he does not fully
comprehend the man is facing.
WILLICOMBE Mr. Welles can't know anything about the
difficulties
we're--
HEARST
Get me Louella Parsons, now!
Willicombe picks up a phone and begins dialing as Hearst continues:
HEARST
This upstart -- this puny man -- how does he even
dare to imagine he could comprehend my life and my
world when he crawls with the other insects in the
sewer -- in the dung -- when we control every moment
of his life from the instant he is born to the
instant we decide that he will die! Does he have no
idea of the power that controls him?!
WILLICOMBE
Mr. Hearst, I have Miss Par'
Hearst snatches the phone from Willicombe
HEARST
(on phone)
Miss Parsons, Mr. Hearst. Use the file
He slams down the phone
HEARST
Now get me J. Edgar Hoover
WILLICOMBE It's very late in Washington-
HEARST
Then wake him up!
Willicombe begins to dial
HEARST
(fervently)
That insect thinks he knows me! He thinks he knows
my capabilities! When his neck is in my teeth and
his blood is in my throat then he will know WILLIAM
RANDOLPH HEARST!
INT MAYER'S OFFICE. MGM DAY
Louis B. Mayor's eyes are blinking behind his glasses
In his glasses we can see vague reflections of a series of grainy
photographs showing sex acts and illicit assignations and corpses and
mug shots.
We pull back to reveal Mayer flipping through a stack of photos and
notes.
Louella sits, smoking and supremely confident, across from him.
Mayer finally closes the file and removes his glasses. He rubs his
eyes. He rises unsteadily and goes to a liquor cabinet and pours
himself a stiff drink. He gulps it down and then returns to his desk.
A pause and then he finally looks at Louella
A beat
A beat
A beat.
A pause
LOUELLA
So what do we got here, L.B.? We got faggots and
commies and junkies. We got movie stars screwing
niggers and little girls. We got killers and
perverts and whores.
LOUELLA
We got MGM and Warner Brothers and Columbia and
Disney and Fox.
LOUELLA
We got Jews
LOUELLA
We got Hollywood.
MAYER
(quietly)
What do you want?
LOUELLA
Kill CITIZEN KANE.
MAYER
How?
LOUELLA
I don't give a shit.
A beat
LOUELLA
The boss is working on some stuff and I'm working
on some stuff. Now I want all you boys working on
some stuff. Cause if it looks like this picture's
ever gonna come out -- I start running down the
street with these pictures like a screaming woman
with my throat cut, you follow?
J. EDGAR HOOVER'S OFFICE
DAY
Bulldog-like FBI Director HOOVER sits erect at his desk. Behind him an
imposing FBI Seal catches the light.
He presses a button on his intercom.
HOOVER
Agent McCabe, if you please.
His secretary, clean-cut FBI agent McCABE, enters quickly with a note
pad. Agent McCabe scribbles as Hoover dictates:
ELIZABETH ARDEN SALON. BEVERLY HILLS DAY
Marion sits with Carole Lombard in a secluded section of the luxurious
salon.
A quiet scene.
MARION
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw
the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going
to make me a star.
CAROLE LOMBARD
And he did.
A beat.
MARION
When I was making movies I kept begging him to let
me do comedies. Silly stuff, you know. But Pops
doesn't get comedy too well so he kept putting me in
all those godawful p-p-period dramas.
Carole Lombard smiles.
MARION
I did my best but, well, you know me
CAROLE LOMBARD
Sure
MARION
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is
that I really think I could have been something ...
special.
CAROLE LOMBARD
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You
were a great star and you had a good run. That
oughta be enough.
MARION
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
MARION
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and
everything?
CAROLE LOMBARD
Uh-huh
MARION
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan
Alexander--
CAROLE LOMBARD
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
MARION
But I am That's the killer, honey.
This little girl comes from nowhere and gets discovered by this guy.
And maybe she has some real talent way deep down. But he pays the bills
and he makes the decisions. And somewhere along the way ... she gets
lost.
MARION
It's hell when you gotta look back and say,
goddamn, what I could have been.
JEWELRY STORE. BEVERLY HILLS
Marion enters a posh Beverly Hills jewelry shop. She is wearing
sunglasses.
She nervously goes to the counter and the SHOP OWNER glides to her. For
Marion, the entire experience is humiliating. This results in her
stutter becoming increasingly more pronounced.
SHOP OWNER
May I help you?
MARION
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might
wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important
to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um,
know that--
SHOP OWNER
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you
Marion Davies?
MARION
Yes.
SHOP OWNER
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just
saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the
revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine
picture!
MARION
Thank you-
SHOP OWNER
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss
Davies. Not one of them.
MARION
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
SHOP OWNER
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
MARION
As I said I have some j-j-j-j- (she simply can't
get the word out) that I might wish t-t-to sell and
I wanted an estimate--
SHOP OWNER
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Marion removes the leather pouch from her purse and pours a stunning
collection of jewelry on a black felt tablet on the counter.
SHOP OWNER
(awed)
My Lord. . .
Marion removes her sunglasses and looks at him. Her eyes are red.
MARION
How much for the lot?
EXT RKO LOT DAY
Welles is pursuing Schaefer as they stride through the bustling RKO
backlot.
SCHAEFER
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't
premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with
some bullshit about
WELLES
Then find another theater
SCHAEFER
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to
open the picture
WELLES
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or
Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn
circus tents and--!
Schaefer stops.
SCHAEFER
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the
distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing
with the stockholders in New York who are scared
shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired
myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world
but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll
do what I can to--
WELLES
(desperately)
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
SCHAEFER
Well it' s all you've got !
WELLES
(suddenly)
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury
my movie. They bought you!
SCHAEFER
(turning away)
For Christ's sake, shut up--
WELLES
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
SCHAEFER
(spinning on him)
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm
like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and
Warner? Is that what you think--?!
WELLES
It's just that my movie is so-
SCHAEFER
(savagely)
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your
movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about
that?! Did you ever think about that old man and
Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
WELLES
I didn't--
SCHAEFER
Do you every think for one second that you might
have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For
cutting and slashing everything in your way so you
can have your goddamn movie?!
WELLES
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
SCHAEFER
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that
soulless monster.
Schaefer turns and stomps away Welles stands, lost for a moment in the
dream factory
In a bit of a daze, Welles slowly begins walking through the backlot. A
bustle of loud activity in a corner of the lot draws his attention.
A bulldozer and a dozen workmen are busy tearing down the facade of a
large white mansion. They strip the wood off and toss it into an
incinerator.
Welles sees Schaefer standing before all this activity, deep in
thought.
Welles goes to him and they stand together in silence for a moment as
they watch the house being razed.
SCHAEFER
Recognize
Welles shakes his head
SCHAEFER
It's Tara. From GONE WITH THE WIND
Pause as they watch Scarlett O'Hara's dream mansion being torn apart.
WELLES
It's ... sad
A beat.
SCHAEFER
Not really. It's only a set, after all Just lumber.
.
SCHAEFER
(quietly)
You know, we make all these pictures, we turn em
out one after another, without thinking most of the
time. Just like making toasters or Packards or
toothpaste. But then sometimes ... something amazing
happens and you get a GONE WITH THE WIND.
Or a CITIZEN KANE
SCHAEFER (CONT.)
And no one can ever take that away from you.
They gaze at the destruction of Tara as we hear:
RADIO ANNOUNCER (VOICE OVER)
... and in financial news, rumors continue to swirl
around the head of publishing baron William Randolph
Hearst. . .
INT SAN SIMEON. ROMAN POOL NIGHT
Hearst sits in a wicker chair by the shimmering in-door Roman Pool. But
for Hearst and the single chair, the pool is deserted and has no other
furniture.
Hearst is staring at the gold and blue mosaic of tiles reflected in the
water.
As we hear:
RADIO ANNOUNCER (VOICE OVER, CONT.)
... Sources report that the Hearst Empire is
facing some rocky times ahead as the press lord is
facing mounting debts and shrinking revenues due to
over expansion and fiscal mismanagement that have
resulted in...
The radio voice fades to silence.
The silence continues but for the haunting echo of a lion roaring in
the distance. Then Hearst hears the sound of footsteps echoing on the
tile. He looks up. It is Marion. She walks around the pool to him.
Without a word she hands him a check.
It is made out to William Randolph Hearst in the amount of one million
dollars and is signed Marion Davies.
A long pause. He looks up at her, profoundly moved.
MARION
I started out as a gold-digger, ya know But goddamn
if I didn't fall in love with the guy.
EXT MAYER'S ESTATE DAY
A row of six shining limousines are lined up in front of Mayor's
enormous house. The chauffeurs stand together and chat.
GIMBELS NEW YORK
DAY
The entire two-acre fifth floor of Gimbels is in chaos
A large banner is suspended at one end of the floor; "The Hearst
Collection." It is the first day of the sale and it is mobbed.
Hearst and Marion, alone in a crowd, walk wordlessly through the
mayhem.
Everywhere around them hundreds of eager customers strike like hawks,
snatching up useless junk and treasured antiques.
We see bits and pieces of San Simeon in the jumble
They pass a man and his wife, holding up Marion's -BLESS THIS CASTLE"
sampler:
MAN
Old man Hearst owned this and I'm getting it for
two bits I
Hearst and Marion continue to walk, finally arriving at the section
containing the true, expensive treasures.
Hearst watches as customers pick up and fondle his life.
He glances at a framed front page of the San Francisco Examiner. The
date is March 4, 1887. In a large box on the page is: "IT IS THE ROLE
OF THE PRESS TO COMFORT THE AFFLICTED AND AFFLICT THE
COMFORTABLE.
WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST. PUBLISHER."
HEARST
I can't sell this. How much are they asking?
MARION
(gently)
Pops ... let it go. Just ... let it go
He looks at her. A long moment. He tenderly touches her face.
Then:
HEARST
Yes, I think I shall.
He takes her hand and leads her away as we pull up and take in the
entire fifth floor.
It is a stunning KANE-like image of rows and rows of merchandise piled
high. Of junk and jewels. Of Charles Foster Kane and William Randolph
Hearst.
INT HOTEL ROOM. NEW YORK NIGHT
Welles sits brooding in his hotel room. His invincible energy appears
gone.
He is deep in thought, listlessly shuffling and reshuffling a deck of
cards in one hand.
He aimlessly shuffles through the cards and plucks one out.
WELLES
Six of spades
He glances at the card. It is the nine of hearts.
He shuffles through the cards again and pulls out another card.
WELLES
Six of spades
He looks at the card. It is the two of clubs.
His attention is now fully on the cards. He shuffles them dramatically
and snatches out a card. He looks at it and then tosses it away. He
shuffles again, working the trick, again it fails. He tosses another
card away. He continues, ;' more quickly, to attempt the trick. It
fails again. And ' again.
With a frightened moan Welles flings the entire deck away from him and
bolts out of the room...
EXT HOTEL ROOFTOP NIGHT
Welles emerges from a stairway on the roof of his hotel.
He marches to the edge of the roof and leans against a railing, gasping
for air.
Everywhere below him the shimmering lights of Manhattan twinkle and
flash; cabs and neon and noise. The night sky above him is filled with
stars.
He looks away from the city and up to the stars -- they captivate him
fully. He stares and stares at the impossible chaos of beautiful
lights.
A long moment as Welles gazes at the stars. The city below and the
noise seem to disappear and Welles stands, safe and at peace under the
silent dome of stars.
The stars are reflected in his huge, dark eyes
Magically, the stars in his eyes give way to the vague shapes of men
sitting around a table.
Welles looks at the men.
WELLES
Today.
We pull back to see we are at
INT RKO BOARD ROOM. NEW YORK DAY
Welles stands at the head of a long conference table. Title: APRIL 6,
1941
Around the table are gathered a group of stern businessmen Schaefer is
also present.
Welles looks at the men. And he speaks. For once, his usual
overwrought, theatrical tones are gone.
He speaks simply.
WELLES
Today a man from Germany invaded Greece. He has
already swallowed Poland and Denmark and Norway and
Belgium. He is bombing London as I speak. Everywhere
this man goes he crushes the life and the freedom of
his subjects. He sews yellow stars onto their
lapels. He takes their voices.
In this country we still have our voices. And we can sing with them.
And we can argue with them. And we can be heard. Because we are . . .
for the moment . . . free. No one can tell us what to say or how to say
it, can they? We have no brown shirt thugs here ruling our lives, do
we? No one can take our voices, can they? Because we are free.
I am one voice and that is all. My picture is one voice. Men are dying
in Europe now -- and Americans soon will be -- so that we can surmount
the tyrants and the dictators. Will you send a message across this
country that one man can take away our voices?
So ... who is Mr. Hearst and who is Mr. Welles? Mr. Hearst built a
palace of brick and mortar and starting little wars and corpses piled
high. I built a palace of illusion. My castle Xanadu is a matte
painting and camera trick. It's nothing but . . . a dream.
Today you have a chance to let the dream triumph. For once.
He gazes at them and then slowly walks out of the room
INT LONG HALLWAY. NEW YORK DAY
Welles sits quietly on a bench in a long hallway in a tall building.
Schaefer emerges from an office and goes to him. He sits next to him.
SCHAEFER
We open on May 1st.
Welles slowly nods.
SCHAEFER
Orson, what you said in there. Did you mean it?
Welles looks at him.
WELLES
Does it matter? They believed it
He stands and begins walking away.
SCHAEFER
Orson.
Welles stops, not turning.
SCHAEFER
Yes. It matters.
Welles continues down the hall
INT HOTEL. NEW YORK NIGHT
Title: APRIL 30, 1941 Welles is rushing to catch an elevator as the
doors close
He nips in at the last minute and punches his button. He turns.
The elevator is deserted but for one other person: William Randolph
Hearst.
Welles and Hearst recognize each other instantly. As the elevator
ascends the two men look at each other.
A very long pause as we watch their faces -- the young man and the old
man -- both men of mad grandeur and malevolent passion and stunning
inspiration -- both men of incalculable achievement and measureless
poignancy.
Finally:
WELLES
Mr. Hearst, we've met once before, my name is Orson
Welles and I've got a movie opening tomorrow night
at the Palace. I would be pleased to get you
tickets.
A pause as Hearst regards Welles.
Then Hearst carefully reaches over and presses the stop button on the
elevator. The elevator stops.
An exceedingly quiet exchange:
A beat.
A pause.
HEARST
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
WELLES
Do you?
HEARST
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my
head I could give you a hundred others. I have been
swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a
belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned,
undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private
lives should not be public property.
WELLES
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name
and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip.
In your papers you taught the world how to look
under every rock. I learned at the knee of the
master.
HEARST
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind
of sad future are we two making? A future where men
will do anything to sell their newspapers and their
movies? A future where no price is too high for fame
and power? When we will all scratch each other to
pieces just to be heard?
Can you truly envision such ... horror.
Hearst presses the stop button again and the elevator begins to move.
The doors opens on Hearst's floor and he leaves the elevator.
The doors are about to shut on Welles when he leans forward; and roars:
WELLES
CHARLES FOSTER KANE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED I
The doors shut on Welles and we remain with Hearst as he slowly walks
down the long hotel hallway.
He walks with dignity.
EXT PALACE THEATER. NEW YORK NIGHT
It is the premiere of CITIZEN KANE, at last.
The Palace Theater swarms with tuxedos and dress gowns as the elite of
New York and Hollywood descend from limousines and slowly parade into
the packed lobby.
On the Palace marquee "ORSON WELLES" is spelled out in enormous six
foot tall electric letters. Below that is "CITIZEN KANE" also in
electric letters. Above the marquee is a series of towering, flashing
neon Charles Foster Kanes and the words "IT'S TERRIFIC."
Title; MAY l, 1941
We float down and enter the crowded lobby with the patrons...
INT PALACE THEATER. LOBBY FOLLOWING
We swirl with the throng of patrons in the lobby as they file into the
theater and finally find Welles and Schaefer huddled together nervously
in a corner of the lobby.
They are studiously ignored and snubbed by all the movie people
filtering past.
SCHAEFER
They're cutting us dead, every goddamn one.
They are ignored by a few more people
Beat
WELLES
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
SCHAEFER
Happy birthday.
Mank fights through the crowd
MANK
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants
to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
SCHAEFER
Herman.
MANK
(lighting a cigar)
So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high
muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human
sacrifice.
WELLES
You gonna watch?
MANK
Hell, I know how it ends.
(He calls to a passing stranger)
Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
WELLES
Mank!
MANK
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you,
not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch
of New York actors.
SCHAEFER
(pained)
Oh God. . .
WELLES
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have
I ever lied to you?
Schaefer looks at him for a moment
SCHAEFER
You know something, Orson, you haven't done
anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But,
ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
WELLES
It was fun, wasn't it?
SCHAEFER
(quietly)
It was the best, kid
WELLES
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
SCHAEFER
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
MANK
Shit
WELLES
George...
SCHAEFER
Forget it. Cause you know something..
When I'm an old coot playing dominoes down in Miami Beach fifty years
from now, I'll say, "Hey, you kids ever heard of a guy named Randolph
Hearst?" And they'll say, "Nope. Never heard of him." And then I'll
say, "Hey, you ever heard of a picture called CITIZEN KANE?"
And they
will have. That's enough for me.
Pats Welles arm and goes into the theater
WELLES
(softly)
What have I done?
MANK
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by
the morning. Let's get a drink.
Mank pulls at Welles' arm.
WELLES
But the picture...
Mank stops and looks at him deeply.
MANK
(quietly)
Kid, you know how it ends too. It ends sadly.
He pulls Welles away from the theater and down the street.
We watch the faces
In the flickering blue light we watch the audience as we hear Bernard
Hermann's evocative and haunting opening music to CITIZEN KANE.
We slowly move across a sea of faces as the music plays. For everyone,
especially the movie people, what they are seeing is a revelation and a
revolution. It is a whole new way of seeing the world.
We see their amazement as they are mesmerized -- and their confusion as
they are challenged.
And we see George Schaefer, quietly proud.
Bernard Hermann's opening music continues to play until we finally
hear;
"KANE"
"Rosebud...
And the world of movies is forever changed
INT
DESERTED BAR. NEW YORK
NIGHT
Welles and Mank are sitting in a rundown, deserted bar
WELLES
You know, all this nightmare we went through with
Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably
no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
MANK
Yeah, you're probably right.
A beat. Mank takes a drink.
MANK
I'll tell ya something, kid. When you make your
masterpiece at 26 it's a bitch. I mean. where do you
go from here?
A long pause
Then Welles speaks, softly.
WELLES
Will burn. Burn up. Burn out.
But oh, what a flame
He looks at Mank and toasts.
WELLES
Cheers.
And Orson Welles smiles. Indomitable.
THE END.
