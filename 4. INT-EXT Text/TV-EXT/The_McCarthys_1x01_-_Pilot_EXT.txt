      Sean, Gerard, Jackie, and Ronny play basketball in their 
      fancy wake clothes.  Ronny has the ball.  Sean defends him.

                                  RONNY
                    I don t even want to play!
                          (yelling while shooting)
                    This is a nightmare!

      Marjorie comes outside, still upset that Ronny s moving out.

                                  MARJORIE
                    Ronny, that court s for tenants 
                    only! 

                                  RONNY
                    Oh no!  Don t take away basketball!  
                    The thing I love least in the 
                    world.

                                  GERARD
                    Mom, we can take one car because 
                    Katrina s not coming to the wake.

      Everyone badly feigns disappointment.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    She doesn t like funeral homes.

                                  EVERYONE ELSE
                          (mumbling)
                    She doesn t like anything.

                                  GERARD
                    DON T mumble about my wife!

                                  JACKIE
                    We re gonna be late.  Where s Dad?

                                  MARJORIE
                    On the phone.  Apparently, someone 
                    named Darryl Silver s moving here 
                    from New York and considering 
                    playing for your father s team. 

                                  JACKIE
                          (so excited)
                    Darryl Silver!  DARRYL SILVER!                                                                                      8.


                                  SEAN
                    He s a high school All American!

                                  GERARD
                    Darryl Silver could win Dad s team 
                    their first state championship!

                                  RONNY
                    No one throws a three seconds hail 
                    mary foul shot like Darryl Silver!

      Ronny s siblings stare at him.

                                  GERARD
                    You re just trying to be dumb.  

                                  SEAN
                          (impressed)
                    He almost used  hail mary  right.

                                  JACKIE
                    He only knows that one because he 
                    had a crush on Doug Flutie.

      Ronny nods because she s right.  Arthur comes outside.

                                  ARTHUR
                    It s between me and two other 
                    schools!  Darryl s mom s calling me 
                    later with her decision!  

                                      JACKIE/GERARD/SEAN
                    Darryl Silver!/ He dominates the 
                    boards!/ His threes are legendary!

                                  RONNY
                          (trying to join in)
                    His name is...fun too.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Oh Man, I wish Fatty were here.  I 
                    always thought I d hand my dynasty 
                    off to him when I retire next year.

      Marjorie pats Arthur s back (The McCarthy version of a hug). 

                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    I guess I ll have to hire my new 
                        assistant-slash-successor soon.  
                    But, hey, you don t talk about that 
                    stuff on the day of a man s wake.

                                      SEAN/GERARD/JACKIE
                    Right./ No./ It d be inappropriate.                                                                                      9.


      The three of them bow their heads solemnly.  Then...

                                      SEAN/GERARD/JACKIE (CONT D)
                          (fighting to say it first)
                    I m your guy!/ Pick me!/ I WANT IT!



      Jackie enters and sees a grumpy Ronny in bed with his laptop.                                                                                    27.


                                  JACKIE
                    Ronny, get up!

                                  RONNY
                    No!

                                  JACKIE
                    You ve been in here for almost 
                      twenty-four hours!  I m taking that  
                    laptop.  Porn won t help!

                                  RONNY
                    It s Grey s Anatomy.

                                  JACKIE
                    That s even worse.  Now get up!

                                  RONNY
                    NO!

      She drags him out of bed and throws him into the hallway.

                                  RONNY (CONT D)
                    What the hell?

                                  JACKIE
                    I m crazy strong from the baby 
                    hormones.  Cool, right?



      The party has transformed into a very strange pick up 
      basketball game.  Ronny walks over to Arthur who s watching.

                                  RONNY
                    Wow.  The librarian s playing?

                                  ARTHUR 
                    Yup.  It s three on three, and he 
                    told me he s great in a threesome.                                                                                      34.

                                  ARTHUR  (CONT'D)
                    He also gave me a book. 
                          (off Ronny s smile)
                    Ronny, I m sorry about everything.  
                    You don't have to coach with me.  
                    I'll make do without Darryl Silver. 

                                  RONNY
                          (touched by his dad s 
                            vulnerability)
                    You know what?  I ll do it.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Hey!  Really?!  That s great!  

      Arthur beams while he and Ronny watch the game for a bit.

                                  RONNY
                    I think Gerard should pretend to 
                    shoot and then pass to Sean under 
                    the hoop.  Then Jackie's prom date 
                    wouldn't keep blocking his shots.
                          (off Arthur s look)
                    Hey, after all these years, I ve 
                    picked up some basketball 
                      knowledge.  Just through osmosis.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You have been pretending to be 
                    dumber than you are about sports!

                                  RONNY
                    Yes, sir, I have!

                                  ARTHUR
                    Ha!  So you really do know what 
                    three seconds means!

                                  RONNY
                    Yes, sir, I...actually don t.  
                    Sorry.  Hey, it s just osmosis.  
                    There are huge gaps.

                                  ARTHUR
                    You know, osmosis has worked for me 
                    too.  That s why I know so much 
                    about Judy Andrews movies.

      Ronny smiles.  In the game, Gerard throw an alley-oop to 
      Sean.  The brothers high five and talk trash to the librarian 
      and Tommy.  Marjorie and Jackie join Arthur and Ronny.                                                                                    35.


                                  ARTHUR (CONT D)
                    Jackie, I need a JV coach.  And I 
                    was really hoping to find a 
                    pregnant lady.  Any interest?

                                  JACKIE
                    No thanks!  I m gonna be spending 
                    Friday nights with my Mom!

      Jackie looks thrilled.  Marjorie takes a big sip of wine.  
      When Jackie joins the game, Ronny turns to Marjorie.

                                  RONNY
                    You know, Mom, this whole dating 
                    thing...I just want to find what 
                    you and Dad have.

                                  MARJORIE
                          (surprised)
                    Well, Jesus, Ronny, I hope you can 
                    do better than that.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (laughs, then)
                    You know, Ronny, I think you're 
                    gonna be a pretty good coach.

                                  RONNY
                    Really?  

                                  ARTHUR
                    Yeah.   Cause a coach has to see 
                    the whole court and what every 
                    player needs, and you already kinda 
                    do that with all of us.  You re 
                    good at seeing what we need.
                          (then)
                    You re good at a lotta stuff.  

      Ronny is very moved.  He goes to hug Arthur, who looks  
      startled.  Ronny pulls back at the last moment.    

                                  RONNY
                    I was going to hug you, but I could 
                    see that you did not need that. 

                                  ARTHUR
                          (nodding)
                    Good eye, Ronny.  Good eye.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.


      END ACT THREE                                                                                    36.
