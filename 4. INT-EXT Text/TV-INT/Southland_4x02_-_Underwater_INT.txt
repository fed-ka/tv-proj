    Ben walks in, his war bag over his shoulder, holding a cup of 
    coffee. He watches as WORKERS replace the BROKEN PICTURE 
    WINDOWS and FLAT SCREEN TELEVISIONS that were shot up during 
    the ambush.

    Ben walks over to the wall, right near the locker room door, 
    where there s a MURAL with a COWBOY HAT, a MASKED MAN and a 
    GUN that says ALVARADO DESPERADOS. 

    Ben touches it. There s a BULLET HOLE in the desperado s 
    face, right under the left eye.

                  I m old school all the way. Don t 
                  start none. Won t be none.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Ben and Sammy and Jones sit in the back with the more 
    seasoned P2s. The newer, younger P2s and  boots  sit closer 
    to the front.

    CAPTAIN JOEL RUCKER stands at the front of the room. He s 
    50s, a tall black man, solid as a Georgia Pine. He s holding 
  a sheath of papers. He gives them to a MALE P2, who passes 
    them out. The sheets make their way around the room.

    Sammy scans his and chuckles. Ben looks puzzled. A FEMALE P2, 
    ANAWALT, sitting next to Jones raises her hand.

                                RUCKER
                  You have a question, Anawalt?

                                ANAWALT
                  Why are you handing out McDonald s 
                  applications?

                  Every time you fuck up, you re 
                  gonna fill out another line. As 
                  your new Captain, let me make it

                  step in my house. We re gonna send 
                  the street a message.

    Some of the faces, like Ben, looked jazzed by what Rucker is 
    saying. Others, like Anawalt, look wary.

    Lydia and Ruben walk towards a HOUSE. They both stop at the 
    edge of the driveway. There s another Black and White unit 
    idling behind them as back up. 

    As soon as they reach the driveway, Lydia points down to the 
    ground.

    There are RED SPOTS intermingled with car treads in the 
    driveway. Lydia unbuttons her jacket and unsnaps her gun, but 
    keeps it in the holster. Ruben does the same. 

    Lydia s contact. Ruben is cover. The two UNI s from the 
    backup car stand in the background, just in case. Lydia 
    KNOCKS. Holds up her badge to the keyhole.

    The door opens and Lydia has to look down. A SIX YEAR OLD BOY 
    wearing SUPERMAN PJS with a CAPE opens the door.

                                BOY
                  Hello?

    Lydia bends down. Switches tactics.

                                LYDIA
                  Hi, sweetie. Is your mother home?

                                BOY
                  MOM!

  A young mother, 30s, white, comes to the door. Her name is 
    PAMELA.

                                PAMELA
                  May I help you?

                  I m Det. Lydia Adams with the LAPD. 
                  This is my partner Ruben Robinson. 
                  Do you have a Silver Ford Escape?

                                                                          CUT TO:


    The GARAGE DOOR rolls up. Lydia and Ruben enter. The ESCAPE 
    is parked there, but it s SMASHED on the left side. The hood 
    is heavily dented from an impact.

    Lydia looks down, and sees something underneath the DRIVER S 
    SIDE WHEEL. There are parts of a LEG and a TORSO. Mrs. 
    Williams  FACE, somehow untouched, stares right back at 
    Lydia, eyes open. Lydia jumps back.

                                                                    TIME CUT TO:            SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              7.



    John and Tang walk up the long driveway. They re somewhere in 
    Holmby Hills. This isn t just a mansion. It s a manor. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)            SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              9.

    They walk up to the front door and KNOCK. The door slowly 
    opens. JOSE, a short older man in his 50s, wearing a black 
    coat and tie answers. 

                                JOSE
                  Senora?

    Tang offers her hand.

                  Officer Jessica Tang. Is the owner 
                  of the house available?

                  I m sorry, Mrs. Williams is not 
                  home.

  A TALL WHITE MAN, 40s in jogging gear walks up, coming back 
    from his run. MR. STEVEN WILLIAMS. A few other members of the 
    STAFF walk out. Some look at the SQUAD car in the driveway. 
    Everybody s trying to look busy, but they re really 
    eavesdropping.

                                MR WILLIAMS
                  Can I help you?

                                JOHN
                  Are you Mr. Williams?

                                MR WILLIAMS
                  Yes. Is this about the marijuana? 
                  Because I have a card.

                                JOHN
                  No, sir, it s about your wife.

                                MR WILLIAMS
                  She s with her boyfriend. She won t 
                  be back until tonight.

    John and Tang look at each other.

                                JOHN
                  There was an accident, sir. We re 
                  still investigating the 
                    circumstances. We believe your wife 
                  was hit by a car and killed.

    The information washes over Mr. Williams  face like water. He 
    starts CRYING. 

                                JOHN (CONT D)
                  Would you like to sit down?

    The staff finally drops the pretext that they haven t been 
    listening the whole time. Mr. Williams looks up.

                  She s dead. She s dead!

    John and Tang look surprised. The reaction isn t grief. It s  
    joy. They start hugging each other.

                  La bruja esta muerta!

    Officer Tang looks up and around. John looks at her.

                                      ACT TWO

    FADE IN:


    Lydia and Ruben stand in the corner of the store. There s a 
    BODY at the entrance. Older. Black. Late 40s. The dead man is 
    prone, with a bullet in the center of his forehead, and 
    another one in his chest. 

    Unis have the door roped off. Lydia and Ruben are alone with 
    the store s manager, AMIT, 40s.

                                AMIT
                  The guy came in with a ski mask on. 
                  Went right to the magazine rack and 
                  shot him.

                                RUBEN
                  He run out?

                                AMIT
                  No, he was calm. He walked out. 
                  With a little bit of a limp.

                                LYDIA
                  You know the victim?

                                AMIT
                  Every day he reads Variety. Never

                                LYDIA
                  Hours. Thanks. That s it for now,

    Amit walks off to a corner of the room and pulls out his cell 
    phone. Ruben and Lydia walk closer to the body. 

                                LYDIA (CONT D)
                  Sad. Another broke ass actor.

                  Harold Mack Logan. Former parolee 
                  He s got a rap sheet thick as a 
                  pocket bible.

    Lydia looks at the body more closely. Something s not right. 
    They both look at the body. It s prone on the ground like an 
    abandoned action figure.

                                LYDIA
                  See the marks right there, along 
                  the edges? 

    She walks over to Amit. She moves so quickly, Ruben has to 
    step up his pace to keep up. Amit is still talking.

                                LYDIA (CONT D)
                  Hang up the phone.

    Amit does. Stunned by Lydia s brusque tone.

    Lydia walks away. Amit s hands are raised in protest. Ruben 
    shakes his head.

                  And here I was gonna buy a slushie

    Ruben has CRIME SCENE PHOTOS on the board of the VICTIM, as 
    well as a STILL taken from the SECURITY FOOTAGE from 7-11.

    It s a shot of a MAN, tall, bulky, wearing a SKI MASK. Ruben 
    looks at the masked photo.

                  That despite a huge amount of drug 
                  arrests, Logan never did more than 
                  a two year stretch. Mandatory 
                  guidelines sentencing should have 
                  him in much longer than that.

                  Good place to start.

                                RUBEN
                  That many arrests, that many 
                  enemies, it could take days to 
                  narrow it down. And Logan isn t in 
                  our database as a paid CI.

    Lydia sits down in front of the computer.

                                LYDIA
                  So let s think outside the box. 
                  It s the same skills you used on 
                  the Robbery table.

    She goes to SPYDERFINDER. Puts in the name MACK LOGAN.

                                RUBEN
                  Come on. Google? If it s that easy, 
                  anybody could do Homicide.

    Lydia shakes her head.

                                LYDIA
                  We ll see about that.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    There s a HARD KNOCK on the door. A heavy set BLACK WOMAN in 
    her LATE 30s opens the door and JONES enters, followed by 
    Sammy, Ben, and Anawalt. 

                                JONES
                  I apologize, ma am. Does this shoe 
                  belong to someone you know?

    They enter and see that the place, for a project apartment, 
    looks immaculate. Mirrors, family pictures, a Rent-A-Center 
    couch with the plastic still on it, and respectable 46 inch 
    flat screen TV.

  A GRANDMOTHER, and TWO YOUNG KIDS sit next to a TEENAGER, 
    watching ESPN. They look up at Ben with a nervous expression.

    Ben moves towards the kitchen. Right before he reaches it, he 
    sees a SOCK coming out from under a semi open CLOSET DOOR. He 
    looks across the room at a mirror just before a 

    BASEBALL BAT

    Swings at his head. Ben ducks just in time.

    Ben gets off the floor and charges at the FUGITIVE KID, who s 
    running with one sneaker. He BUMPS the kid against the wall, 
    and the kid drops the bat.

    The kid moves into THE KITCHEN. His left hand is the only one 
    that s cuffed.

    Ben pulls at the kid s shirt and misses. The kid runs to the 
    stove, grabs a skillet and throws it at Ben. It glances off 
    Ben s forearm and hits him with a little grease. 

    Ben comes after the kid as the kid grabs a KITCHEN KNIFE. 

                                BEN
                  Drop it! Drop it!

    But Ben SLAMS into him and the kid drops the knife. Sammy and 
    Jones and Anawalt are behind Ben now. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              22.

                  You could have killed me asshole. 
                  Damn baseball bat?

    Ben bends the kid s arms back. Sammy stands the kid up, 
    backing Ben off. Anawalt walks over to Sammy. She finishes 
    handcuffing the kid.

    Ben looks down at his forearm. It s bruised. Ben walks over 
    to RENEE, the woman who opened the door.

                                BEN (CONT D)
                  He your son?

                                RENEE
                  No. 

                                BEN
                  Brother? Cousin? Nephew?

                                RENEE
                  Don t know him.

    Ben walks over.

                                BEN
                  So you don t know this guy, but you 
                  let him hide in a closet?

    Ben is pissed.

                                RENEE
                  He more my people than you. 

    Ben is livid. Jones pushes him back.

                                SAMMY
                  Come on, Ben. Let s go.

                                BEN
                  Wait and see if we ever respond to 
                  a call over here again.

                                RENEE
                  Ain t nobody asked for you to come 
                  here? Get the hell out of my house!

    She looks at the kid.

                                RENEE (CONT D)
                  You got somebody you want me to 
                  call?

                                KID
                  No ma am. Thank you.

    Ben looks at the kid with disbelief. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              23.

                  Oh, now you re polite? Let s go.

    Jones puts the kids shoe on the ground, steps him into it, 
    and the four leave the apartment with their handcuffed 
    suspect.

    The ten year old rolls up to Sammy. Sammy discretely slips 
    him a five. 

                                COCKY TEN YEAR OLD
                        (whispering)
                  What about my Happy Meal?

                                SAMMY
                  Can t right now. I m sorry.

    The kid spits on the ground. Pissed. Stares holes into Sammy.

                                                                          CUT TO:


                                LYDIA
                  Hey! How are you? Just came to 
                  check on you.

                                GRANNY
                  Darrell went to the store. I always 
                  liked you. Always said had he 
                  married you, none of that other 
                  mess would have happened.

                                LYDIA
                  Yeah. You remember Ruben, right? *

    Granny nods at Ruben.

                                GRANNY
                  Yeah, he got tall.

                                LYDIA
                  Yeah. Darrell borrowed an Ice Cube 
                  t-shirt from Ruben back in the day,  *
                  and he wanted to get it back. You 
                  mind if we go check his room?*

                                GRANNY
                  You ain t gonna find nothing back 
                  there, honey. Just as messy as 
                  always. I m still doing his 
                  laundry.

    Lydia looks at Ruben.

                                LYDIA
                  Mind if we look in the laundry *
                  room, then?*

                                GRANNY
                  Go right ahead. Washer s right by 
                  the kitchen.
                        (beat)
                  You want some lemonade?

    Lydia smiles. Ruben looks nervous.

                                LYDIA
                  Sure.

                  lemonade before my stories come 
                  back on.

    The old lady leaves and Ruben and Lydia walk down the 
    hallway.

                                RUBEN
                  You sure we can do this?*

                  Darrell can t have it both ways. If  *
                  granny s competent enough to be his  *
                  alibi, then she s also competent  *

                                JOHN
                  His clothes smelled like Meth. 
                  Probably loaded with flammable 
                  chemicals.

    John chuckles at that one.

                                DEWEY
                  I wonder what he was watching. Must

                  Easy to tell what you like. Brassy 
                  with lots of silicone or 
                  malnourished and barely legal, 
                  looking like they need a sandwich.

                                DEWEY
                  You got me wrong, baby. I like big 
                  girls. Sofa sized. BBWs man.

                                JOHN
                  What?

                                DEWEY
                  Big beautiful women. More bounce to 
                  the ounce. With some tig ole 
                  bitties?  Nothing like a fat girl, 
                  man. It s kinda like riding a 
                  moped.

                                JOHN
                  A moped?

                                DEWEY
                  Yeah. It s fun as hell, but you 
                  don t want anyone to catch you 
                  doing it.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Ben and Sammy. For once, Ben is in the driver s seat. The sun 
    is beginning to go down. It s what Frankie Beverly and Maze 
    called the  Golden Time Of Day. 

                                SAMMY
                  Rucker could have gotten a lot of 
                  people hurt today.

                                BEN
                  But he didn t. He was proactive, 
                  took charge and made shit happen.

                                SAMMY
                  He bean bagged an old lady.

                                BEN
                  No. He bean bagged an armed 
                  suspect. I didn t even see her 
                  second gun. She s not dead and none 
                  of our people got hurt. That s a 
                  good day.

    Sammy mulls the moment. Not sure if he agrees.

                                BEN (CONT D)
                  Jones with the names. Now she s 
                  Granbo forever.

    Ben laughs. He puts on his sunglasses. He s looking and 
    sounding more and more like  Papa  John Cooper whether he 
    realizes it or not.
                                                                          CUT TO:


    Darrell Miller sits up on a bench. He s fast asleep.

    REVEAL: LYDIA and RUBEN looking at him in a holding tank. 
    They walk back to their desks.

                                LYDIA
                  Sleeping like a baby. He knows the 
                  deal. Might as well rest up for the 
                  trip.

                                RUBEN
                  I was hoping he d be awake.

                                LYDIA
                  You really want him to be innocent, 
                  don t you?

                                RUBEN
                  A little. Mack Logan cost him his 
                  life. Twice. It s ironic that DNA 
                  evidence set him free and put him 
                  back in jail.

                                LYDIA
                  He put himself back in jail. 

    They sit down at their desks. On Ruby s desk there s the 
    PLASTIC BAG with the pair of BLOODSTAINED SHOES, and another 
    with the clothes they took from the first search. 

                                RUBEN
                  Why do you think he kept the shoes?

                                LYDIA
                  If criminals were smart, we d be 
                  out of a job.

                                RUBEN
                  These shoes and clothes are the 
                  only evidence we really have of 
                  anything. If something happened to 
                  them... this whole thing goes away.

    Lydia stares hard at Ruby.

                                LYDIA
                  It s not our job to figure out who 
                  walks and who doesn t.

                                RUBEN
                  We make those judgements all the 
                  time.

                  Absolutely.

                                RUBEN
                  You want him to be guilty.

                                LYDIA
                  I don t want anybody to be guilty. 
                  I wish people would stop killing 
                  each other. But while they still 
                  do, we speak for the dead whether 
                  they deserve it or not.

                                RUBEN
                  Doing the right thing for the wrong 
                  people.

                                LYDIA
                  Sometimes.

    Lydia stands up. She looks at the evidence stacked on the 
    desk. Then back to Ruby. After a beat --

                                LYDIA (CONT D)
                  I m going to get some coffee. 

    Lydia walks out. Ruby picks up the plastic bag and stares at 
    it.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Sammy and Ben are sitting in the Captain s office. It s 
    filled with COMMENDATIONS and pictures of Rucker with 
    everyone from DARRYL GATES and MAXINE WATERS to PRESIDENT 
    OBAMA.

    Ben s staring at one PHOTO in particular. It s a FAMILY 
    PORTRAIT with Rucker, his GROWN SONS, his WIFE, and his 
    daughter. It s KAYA. The one from the pool party.

    Ben smirks. Just his luck.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              45.

                                RUCKER
                  Wipe that smirk off your face. 
                  There s nothing funny about this.

                                BEN
                  No sir.

                                RUCKER
                  We re not talking Black P Stones or 
                  Rollin  60s. We re talking dancing 
                  Catholic School kids. What s the 
                  problem, son? You scared of black 
                  people?

    Ben sits up.

                                BEN
                  My partner was surrounded. The 
                  situation was turning hostile, and 
                  when I saw hands grabbing at my 
                  partner, I tried to move towards 
                  him. The females in question got in 
                  my way, and when one spit on me, 
                  making it an assault, I...

                                RUCKER
                  Punched her. Closed fist. In the 
                  beak. Do you have anything to add 
                  Bryant?

    Sammy nods.

                                SAMMY
                  We were outnumbered. Our tactical 
                  advantage was compromised. Sherman 
                  made a split second decision.

                                RUCKER
                  This is a tough, dirty job. The 
                  system used to give us a lot more 
                  rope, and a lot more soap. But it s 
                  a new age. A video age. People are 
                  always watching us. Everywhere.

    They stand up and shake hands. Ben and Sammy walk towards the 
    door.

                                RUCKER (CONT D)
                  Sherman.

                                BEN
                  Yes, sir?

                                RUCKER
                  Steel yourself. Somebody out there 
                  got it on a cellphone. You re about 
                  to become  that guy  now. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          SOUTHLAND - Ep#402 - YELLOW - 11/09/11              46.

    Ben and Sammy walk out.

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Lydia comes back to her desk. The plastic bags are still 
    there. Lydia smiles, nods to Ruby, right decision.

                                RUBEN
                  I ll take the bags to evidence 
                  control and write Darrell s arrest 
                  report.

    Ruben nods. She nods back. She has a partner.

                                                                          CUT TO:
