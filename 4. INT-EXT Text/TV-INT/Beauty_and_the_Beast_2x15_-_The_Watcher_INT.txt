ANOTHER ANGLE " THE WATCHER S HAND

reaches for a phone setting near a high-powered telescope. He is
unidentifiable except for a high-tech, multi-function black WRISTWATCH. The
WRISTWATCH S ALARM BEEPS TWICE. He starts to dial a number (555-8291). His
attention goes back to the telescope.

A pause, then...

                                WATCHER
        I can see you.

Not fully believing, Cathy does look towards the french doors (and therefore
the telescope).

                                WATCHER
        Hi.

A chill down Cathy s spine. Her glance shoots towards Vincent. The Watcher
lets her squirm an extra second.

                                WATCHER
        Yeah, I can see him too.

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:



Cathy hangs the phone up as if it s on fire, switches the LAMP OFF and is
instantly on the balcony.


Cathy pulls the drapes in the dining room then moves through her dark
apartment to pull the drapes in the bedroom. She grabs her keys. The PHONE
RINGS as she is headed for the door. She waits. After TWO RINGS, the
ANSWERING MACHINE picks up.

                                CATHY S VOICE
                  (on machine)
        You have reached 555-8291. Please

BEEP.

                  (on machine)
        Open the drapes.

Cathy hesitates only a second, thinking  the hell with you,  then exits. STAY
ON THE DOOR as we hear her LOCKING IT O.C. then immediately UNLOCKING IT. She
sticks her hand back in and FLIPS ON THE LIGHT, pulls the door shut, LOCKS
it.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


Cathy is pacing, Vincent contemplative, their sense of safety shattered.

                                CATHY
        There was a call on my machine yesterday, but I didn t think
        anything of it. I thought it was just a prank call.

Cathy shakes her head.

            What would you normally do?

            It s departmental policy to turn
            it over to the police.

            Vincent, we don t know what he
            has, we can t take that chance.

A beat. For Vincent, a sad truth.

                                VINCENT
            Who would believe him?

So much goes unsaid as Cathy looks at Vincent, feels his shame, wishing
she could sheathe him from it. Finally, she goes to him, gently touching
him.

                                CATHY

            ...It was wrong of me to ever come
            to your balcony.

Cathy looks at him sharply,  no  in her eyes.

                                CATHY
            Do you think I ve been wrong every

CLOSE ON - CATHY

sitting at her desk, oblivious to everyone and everything going on around
her. There s a legal pad in front of her where she s penciled various notes.
She is wearing a set of mini-earphones which are plugged into a small
cassette player. She has been repeatedly listening to a phone message from an
answering machine tape, trying to hear something she s missed, to recognize
the voice, identify a background noise... something...

                      WATCHER S VOICE (CONT.)

WE HEAR Cathy REWIND THE CASSETTE TAPE.

She glances at the recorder counter, presses the  play  button.

SOUND: DEAD AIR then ANSWERING MACHINE BEEP.

Just now, Cathy is startled by a man s hand suddenly rapping sharply on
her desk top. She looks up and sees JOE in front of her as she quickly
turns off the cassette player and takes off the earphones, fighting the
urge to wad up her page of notes. Joe is wearing an overcoat, carrying
his briefcase, and holding a half-inch thick computer print-out.

                                JOE
           Forget something this morning,
            Radcliffe?
                    (off Cathy s blank look)
            Brian Crater? His deposition...?

A missed appointment registers with Cathy, her heart sinking.

                                CATHY
           I m sorry.

                                JOE
           It s okay, I got it.
                    (handing her print-out)
            Dave caught me on the way by.
            This is for you.

Cathy knows what it is. She hopes Joe hasn t noticed.

           No. Why?

                                JOE
            Because you missed a deposition,

          and you requested a status list

        We don t know that she is in

Suddenly she can take it no more, makes a move to squeeze through the crowd.

CATHY, propped with her back against a wall near the elevator, unnerved, on
the end of a panic attack. Her eyes dart to other people who were in the
elevator with her, perhaps a couple of glances towards their watches...

Cathy knocks on the door.

          Do you have a second?

Cathy enters.

          Does this have anything to do

            I don t think it s a prior case.

                          JOE
          Is he threatening you?

Cathy hesitates in answering...and that s Joe s answer.

Joe reacts by holding the phone receiver out to her.

there to block the dialing.

    Cathy reaches in, SWITCHES ON THE LIGHT, enters. She locks the door
    behind her, including the chain, glances around, throws her stuff
    down, seeing the ANSWERING MACHINE blinking (one call). She
      tentatively REWINDS THE TAPE, switches to  play.

      curtains blowing gently in the night breeze. Cathy turns and
      reenters the apartment, locking the balcony door behind her, pulling
    the drapes. She does not switch on the living room light. As she
    heads towards the bedroom, she starts to undo her clothes.                                                                            27.

CATHY

pulls the towel around her as she steps out of the shower. She steps
softly, cautiously over to pick up the can of hair spray. She turns off
the shower water. She steels herself, opens the bathroom door, prepared
for the Watcher to be standing in the doorway. No one is there. She enters
the dark bedroom, ready for the Watcher to be on either side of the
doorway.



No one is there. Now, he could be anywhere. The closet door, closed
earlier, is now open. The drapes are open. She makes her way to the
nightstand, keeping her eyes on the room, the shadows, even as she slides
the drawer open. She reaches in, glances down for the gun.

            Him! He was just in here!

Having not seen anyone between the elevator and the door, Joe heads for
the stairwell. Cathy catches him as he throws that door open, in
determined pursuit.

                            CATHY
            No-- he has my gun.

Joe steers Cathy quickly back into her apartment.

Cathy catches a fleeting glimpse of Vincent on the balcony; he steps out

                            JOE
          You know what I m doing.

                            CATHY
                    (going to block)
            No---!

                            JOE
          Yes.
                    (as he dials)
          I m not waking up to a call that
          says this guy got to you.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:



CATHY

is sitting against the back of her sofa, focused on the floor, her mind
disassociated from the room s activity. She is now dressed in casual
clothes.

JOE

is closer to the door, watching her. He hands three twenty-dollar bills to
a LOCKSMITH in exchange for a set of new keys.

                            LOCKSMITH
              It s a good lock. I don t think
              she ll have any problems.

                            JOE
              Thanks.


The Locksmith tests the new deadbolt one last time on his way out.


Nearby, a PLAIN-CLOTHED COP is packing up and closing his fingerprinting
case. DETECTIVE MIKE COHEN enters from the bedroom, putting away his note
pad.

                            DETECTIVE COHEN
          Okay, I think we ve got everything
          we re going to get tonight.

Cohen s entry pulls Joe and Cathy from their thoughts, but
Cathy is as close as she needs to be, does not move with
Joe, Cohen, and the cop to the door.

                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                            32.


CONTINUED:

                          JOE
          Did you find anything?

The cop pauses in the corridor, waiting for Cohen.

                          DETECTIVE COHEN
                  (sensitive to Cathy)
          No, it looks pretty clean. If we do get lucky on any of the
          prints, it won t be until late tomorrow.

                          JOE
                    (nodding)
          If you do come up with something,
            I want the information to go
          directly to Cathy.
                  (a glance to Cathy)
          If you can t find her, then to
          me. No one else.

                          DETECTIVE COHEN
                  ( whatever you say )
          Sure.

                          CATHY
            Thanks, Mike.

                          DETECTIVE COHEN
                  (to Joe)
          You want a cop outside?

Joe looks to Cathy.

  CATHY

                    (already answering
                  Cohen)
          No.

Joe and Cohen exchange a look, Cohen following cop into corridor.

                          DETECTIVE COHEN
                  (for Joe s ears)
          Can t live with  em and---

                          JOE
          ---I know...
                  (ready to close door)
          Thanks, Mike.

Just as Cohen is in the corridor, Joe closing the door behind him, Cathy
has a last thought.


                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                          33.

CONTINUED: (2)

                        CATHY
                (catching the door)
          Mike?
                (Cohen has paused)
          I owe you a favor. Don t file
            a report, okay?

                        DETECTIVE COHEN
                  (reluctantly)
          Okay.

Cohen exits. Joe closes the door, an uncomfortableness between him and Cathy,
both still at the door.

                      CATHY
          Thanks.

                      JOE
              (heading for couch)
            So...what s on tonight?

Cathy catches his elbow, steers him back towards door, grabbing his jacket to
hand him.

                        CATHY
          Nothing.

                      JOE
            Radcliffe ---

                      CATHY
            Thanks for checking up on me.

                      JOE
          I m not leaving. I m sleeping right there,
          on that little-short-dinky couch.

                      CATHY
          No, you re not.

                      JOE
          Yes, I am.

                      CATHY
          No, you re not.

                      JOE
          Why not?

                        CATHY
          ...I have my reasons.

                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                            34.


CONTINUED: (3)

                        JOE
            ...Whatever it is, Cathy, we can
          get you out of it.

                        CATHY
                  (her own meaning/
                    kissing his cheek)
          No, we can t.


Her attitude is unwavering; he s not staying.


                        JOE
          Okay. Lock your door.
                  (gives her set of keys)
          Put a chair in front of it.
          Actually put that couch in front of it.

                        CATHY
            Good-bye. Good-night.

Cathy pushes Joe out the door, closes the door.

                        JOE (O.C.)
          Lock it!


Cathy turns the deadbolt, locks the door securely, turns to lean against

the door.


CATHY S POV - HER APARTMENT


ON CATHY


We see her fear...


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:



ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT. START ON THE TELEPHONE which has been moved to the
coffee table. BEGIN A SLOW PAN to find CATHY S WATCH near the phone; it
reads: 12:15. CONTINUE PAN...over to the front door...past the locks and
knob, shiny in the dark...across the apartment... until we find CATHY next
to the balcony door, the drapes pulled shut. Cathy is looking out between
the drapes with binoculars. The fireplace shovel is propped within ready
reach. Suddenly she reacts to the SOUND OF THE ELEVATOR MOVING, her head
turning sharply, listening, perfectly still...her nerves raw. THE ELEVATOR
moves past her floor without stopping.


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:                                                                            35.


Vincent leans against the wall, his head falling back as he lets out a
deep breath, the pull strong, perhaps stronger than him.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:



START ON the balcony drapes where we last saw Cathy with the binoculars.
She is no longer there. The room is now FAINTLY LIT with one TABLE LAMP.
FIND CATHY sitting on the sofa, her bed pillows propping her up, a blanket
over her legs, which are pulled up, the fireplace shovel nearby. She is
transfixed on

THE DEADBOLT AND DOORKNOB.

EVERY APARTMENT SOUND SEEMS LOUDER THAN USUAL...the WRISTWATCH TICKING...
a REFRIGERATOR HUMMING...A FAUCET DRIPPING...THE ELEVATOR MOVING...
Somewhere far away, outside of Cathy s world, a SIREN drones faintly
through the night. All efforts to sleep have been useless.

MOVE IN SLOWLY ON CATHY

as various SOUND BITES haunt her:

                        WATCHER (V.O.)
                  (from first call)
          I can see you...

CONTINUE TO MOVE IN CLOSER ON CATHY

transfixed on the door...


                          WATCHER (V.0.)
                  (from first call)
          Hi.

CONTINUE TO MOVE IN CLOSER ON CATHY

transfixed on the door...

                          WATCHER (V.O.)
                  (from answering machine)
          Of course, you re with him. Why
          do I even ask?

CONTINUE TO MOVE IN CLOSER ON CATHY

transfixed on the door...

CONTINUED:

SOUND: BEEP-BEEP (FILTERED, IN CATHY S MIND)

CONTINUE TO MOVE IN CLOSER ON CATHY

transfixed on the door...

                          WATCHER (V.O.)
                  (answering machine)
            Whore.

Cathy remains transfixed on the door. We hear The ELEVATOR
ASCEND in the corridor, IT STOPS AT HER FLOOR, THE DOORS
OPEN.

NOW TIGHT ON - CATHY

transfixed on the door, waiting...

                          JENNY (V.O.)
          You died, Cathy...

TIGHT ON - CATHY


We hear THE DOORS CLOSE, THE ELEVATOR MOVING ON. No other sounds from the

corridor.


CATHY S POV - THE DOORKNOB AND DEADBOLT


CATHY

throws the blanket off, is moving, a decision made.

                                                        CUT TO:




Vincent through the light, towards the ladder, to wait...


                                                        CUT TO:




Her jacket on, Cathy unlocks the various door locks and exits the
apartment.                                                                          37-




Cathy locks her door and walks to the elevator, pushes the  down  button and
waits, poised at the door. She glances up at the FLOOR INDICATOR which shows
the elevator is starting to move up from the third floor.

We continue to INTERCUT between Cathy in front of the doors, Cathy
impatiently punching the  down  button, and the Floor Indicator. Once...

                          CATHY
          Come on.

Each time we see the Floor Indicator, the lights indicating a progressive
approach, we get the feeling something is wrong, something evil is coming up
in that elevator, this foreboding only heightened by the fact that Cathy
seems unaware of it.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CATHY S PROFILE

standing just inches away from the elevator doors. She glances up.

THE FLOOR INDICATOR

shows the elevator at Floor Twenty.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CATHY

backing away from the elevator, a sudden bad feeling hitting her.

THE FLOOR INDICATOR

shows the elevator reaching Floor Twenty-one.

ANGLE - THE STAIRWELL DOOR

as Cathy exits into the stairwell.

ANGLE " ELEVATOR

The doors open. Joe exits, dressed more casually, a large, covered styrofoam
coffee cup and a rolled-up  Sports Illustrated  in hand. FOLLOW him to the
corridor chair near Cathy s door. He is set for the night, it appears.

                                                      CUT TO:                                                                            38.



Cathy moving down the stairs, her paranoia growing...our
paranoia growing...Cathy pausing suddenly when she hears a
DOOR SEVERAL FLOORS DOWN FAINTLY OPENING, CLOSING then THE
LIGHT PAD OF FOOTSTEPS GOING DOWN A FLOOR AND ENTERING
ANOTHER DOOR. She moves on.


                                                        CUT TO:




Joe looks up when he hears Cathy s PHONE RINGING in her apartment. He goes
quietly to her door to listen, ready if he senses trouble.

                                                        CUT TO:



Cathy continues down the stairs.

CATHY S POV - STAIRWELL


ominous before her, every landing, every turn, every door, frightening...


She thinks she hears another set of footsteps in the stairwell. After two
or three more steps, she pauses, listening. We hear a FAINT CREAK. It
stops. It might be someone, it might not... Cathy tries to look back up
the stairwell.

CATHY S POV - LOOKING UP STAIRWELL

Seeing nothing out of the ordinary, she moves on, her pace
gradually quickening... -

                                                        CUT TO:



THE PHONE IS STILL RINGING. O.C., Joe KNOCKS AT THE DOOR, anxiously
wondering why Cathy isn t answering, at least, his knocks.

                          JOE (O.C.)
          Cathy?! Radcliffe?!


                                                        (CONTINUED)                                                                          39.


CONTINUED:


Suddenly, THE DOOR IS KICKED OPEN. Joe rushes in, can see by the TABLE LAMP
LIGHT that Cathy isn t in that room. We STAY IN LIVING ROOM as Joe moves
directly to the bedroom and the bathroom.

                          JOE
        Cathy, it s Joe... Cath?

Joe comes back into the living room, grabbing the RINGING PHONE.

                          JOE
        Hello?

                                                      CUT TO:


middle of a pace, carrying her phone.

                          JENNY
        Who is this?


INTERCUT TWO-WAY BETWEEN JOE AND JENNY:

                          JOE
        Who s this?

                          JENNY

      Do you know where Cathy is?

                          JENNY
        No, but she s in trouble.

                                                      CUT TO:




Cathy is racing down the stairs...passing the second floor door...the first
floor door...

Cathy flings the door open, exiting into...


Cathy moves to the nearby STAIRWELL door, opens it, hurries inside...


ANGLE - CAMERA LOOKING UP FROM LOWER LANDING

Cathy shoots in, headed directly downstairs. The door behind her closes to
reveal the WATCHER.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Cathy suddenly grabbed by the Watcher.


                                                      CUT TO:




Vincent reacting, snarling, in motion...

                                                      CUT TO:



Cathy is slammed against a wall, a crumpled white handkerchief tight against
her mouth and nose. She struggles fiercely against the Watcher s might.

                          WATCHER
        You re going to him, aren t you?!
        I knew you would. You ll go to him,
        but you won t come to me!

The chloroformed handkerchief takes effect; Cathy slips towards
unconsciousness.

                          WATCHER
      No more.

                                                      CUT TO:                                                                          41.



The stairwell door blasts open, and Joe shoots out.

                      JOE
                (to DOORMAN)
        Did Cathy Chandler come through

        No---

                (headed back into
                  stairwell)
        Get the cops over here!

                                                      CUT TO:



ANGLE - INSIDE CAR

Having used Cathy s keys, The Watcher whips open the passenger door, stuffs
Cathy inside.

                                                    CUT TO:



Cathy s car screeches out of its parking place, the Watcher at the wheel.

Suddenly Vincent comes out of nowhere. The car barrels down on him, smashes
into him.

CLOSE ON - CATHY

struggling with consciousness, seeing the impact, but unable to act.

                        CATHY
                (her lips moving, no
                sound)
        Vincent...

As she tries to look back...

Vincent is thrown between parked cars, Cathy s car speeding on...

CONTINUED:

Suddenly the STAIRWELL DOOR flies open. Joe rushes out just in time to see
Cathy s car careening out of the garage, Cathy visible in the passenger seat.
Joe exits back into the stairwell. PAN OVER to see Vincent just a few feet
away, pulling himself up, his determination to rescue Cathy outweighing his
injuries.


                                                      CUT TO:



Vincent in motion: racing around a corner, through a tunnel...on top of a
speeding subway.. finally making his way through one of the older tunnels,
the pilings crumbling, the walls caving in, the way treacherous.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:




TIGHT ON - THE THIN AIR POCKET


at the top of the trunk. Suddenly, Cathy s HAND breaks the surface,
frantically groping for air space. Immediately her FACE surfaces gasping for
breath, choking as the water laps over her. As she tries to keep her nose and
mouth in the barely sufficient air pocket...her only chance for life...

                                                      FADE OUT:

                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                          45.


                                      ACT FOUR


FADE IN:


TIGHT ON - CATHY S FACE

her profile barely above the lapping water. The water slightly higher,
filling the air pocket as Cathy s breathing steals the air. Little time left.
Not minutes, moments.

                        CATHY
                    (choking on water, a
                  call for help)
        Vincent.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                              46.



CONTINUE SLOW MOTION...as Cathy slips gently under the icy cold water for
the last time. No fight left.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:



Joe and Cathy exit the elevator, go to Cathy s apartment. The door suddenly
is thrown open by an anxious Jenny.

                      JENNY
        Oh, god, you re all right!
                (immediate embrace)
        I was so scared---

                      CATHY
                  (overlapping)
        What are you doing here?

                      JENNY
        The super said I could wait here.
                (pushing Cathy back
                slightly for a look
                in her eyes)
        Are you all right? Tell me you re
        all right.

                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                          52.


CONTINUED:

                      CATHY
                  (overlapping)
        I m fine. I m fine. I m just
        tired.

Cathy s look finds Joe, giving him permission to leave.

                      JOE
        Can you stay with her?

                      JENNY
        Yes--

                      CATHY
        ---No.

                      JOE
        Yes.
(a hug)
        You scared me, Radcliffe.
                (pulling back)
        Get that door fixed.

                      JENNY
        I ve already called.

                      CATHY
                (mumbled)
        What happened to my door?

                      JOE
                (exiting)
        I kicked it in.

Joe exits, Jenny and Cathy moving into the apartment.



Jenny pulls Cathy into another hug, Cathy discreetly glancing towards the
balcony over Jenny s shoulder.

                      JENNY
        When the police called me, I---

She breaks off, unable to verbalize the awful thought. Instead she looks at
Cathy. They understand without words.

                      CATHY
        I m okay.

                      JENNY
        What can I get for you?

                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                          53.

                      CATHY
        You don t have to stay.

                      JENNY
        I know, but I am---

                      CATHY
          --Jenny---

                      JENNY
        I m staying. Now what can I get
        for you?

                      CATHY
        Something hot. Hot chocolate.

                      JENNY
                (ready to lead Cathy
                in)
        Okay, come on---

                      CATHY
                (holding back, a glance
                to the phone)
          ---Jenny... I have to make a call.

Cathy s attitude and look sends an unspoken message to Jenny.

                      JENNY
          Oh...okay...I ll be in the
        kitchen.

                      CATHY
        Thanks.

                                                      (CONTINUED) -                                                                          54.


CONTINUED: (2)


Jenny exits for kitchen. Cathy waits one safe second then goes onto


THE BALCONY.

Vincent is there, Cathy rushing into an immediate, tight embrace...they can t
get close enough. The FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN warms the horizon.

                      CATHY
        We don t have much time.

                        VINCENT
        I know.

And on the statement of their destiny...
