      KALINDA looks up at a crime scene.  An upscale house.  Ritzy 
      neighborhood.  Surrounded by cop cars.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Bad.

                                  WILL (O.S.)
                    Got it.  See what you can get.

      Kalinda nods, sees DETECTIVE LOU JOHNSON (37), wrestler 
      squat, bullet-headed, tough guy cynical, getting out of his 
      unmarked car.  She catches up to him:

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Hey, Kalinda, what reyou doing 
                    here?

                                  KALINDA
                    I had a deposition get cancelled.  
                    Saw your lights.  What s up?  

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Homicide in the suburbs.  Better 
                    than Cirque du Soleil.

                                  KALINDA
                    Who is it?

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Female, no ID, looks about 20.  
                    Security guard says it s the 
                      babysitter. 

                                  KALINDA
                    What is it, a burglary gone wrong?

    But Johnson stares at her getting under the crime scene tape.  

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Come on.  It s making me nostalgic.  
                    I ve got a police scanner at home 
                    to keep me company.

                    Hey, Kalinda, what s up?  

      Detective ANTHONY BURTON(mid-20s), quietly intelligent *
      homicide cop, hides his ambition under a quipping street-wise 
      ease.  Likes Kalinda.  Likes battling her.

                    Hey, Burton.  Just wanted to see *
                    the professionals at work.

    He opens the door for her.  Johnson stares at Burton.*

                                  DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Civilians aren t welcome.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON*
                    What?  She s a friendly, Lou.  She 
                    scratches our back; we scratch hers.  

      Johnson assents reluctantly.  Kalinda smiles as she enters.


      ...Kalinda standing outside in the night now, yelling over 
    the screech of sirens, squad cars racing off.

                                  KALINDA
                    They re coming to you!  They re not 
                    gonna wait  til tomorrow!  They re 
                    coming to you right now.

      Will looks in on the polygraph test being set up.

                    You have 15 minutes.

    He looks up at him: oy.  Moves faster.  


      ...Kalinda walks with the security guard, Eugene Horner...





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #113     "Hi"     GREEN COLLATED     1/7/10       20.

                    The panic alarm was triggered from 
                    inside?

                                  EUGENE HORNER
                    Yeah-- yes, ma am. 

                                  KALINDA
                    So the alarm wasn t triggered from 
                    someone breaking in?  It was 
                    triggered by someone already in?

                                  EUGENE HORNER
                    Yeah.  That s why they re thinking 
                    the husband did it, because he 
                    could disarm the system.

      Horner is distracted, eyeing a PRETTY BLONDE NEIGHBOR (early 
      20s) heading from her car to her home.  Kalinda eyes him, 
      eyes his interest. 

                                  KALINDA
                    And who else could disarm the 
                    system, Mr. Horner?

                                  EUGENE HORNER
                    Who else?  Beside Mr. Rucker?  
                    Well, the housekeeper.  And, um, 
                    Lisa... the babysitter.

                                  KALINDA
                    Miss Pruitt?

                                  EUGENE HORNER
                    Yeah.  What?  

                                  KALINDA
                    You said  Lisa. 

                                  EUGENE HORNER
                    Yeah, Lisa Pruitt.  Why?

                                  KALINDA
                    What s their housekeeper s name?

                                  KALINDA
                    But you know Lisa s name?

      Horner stops, stares at her.

                      Selectively observant.  You also can 
                    disarm the alarm system, right?  
                    It s not just the housekeeper and

                    You don t need to answer any more 
                    of her questions.

      Kalinda smiles, sees Burtonpulling up in his unmarked car.  *
    She walks alongside him as he coasts toward the house... 

                                  KALINDA
                    So did you find the murder weapon?

                    He lets himself in, tries to rape 
                    her; she resists; he kills her.  
                    Steals her missing red purse and 
                    triggers the alarm on the way out 
                    to make it look like a burglary.

                    Yeah, creepy.

    She takes out her cellphone, starts to text, and...


      Kalinda gets out of her car, rushes toward a college dorm, 
      pauses, sees a police car out front.  Damn.  A little late.


      ...a sighing Kalinda:

                                  KALINDA
                    Well, that would ve been helpful to

      Kalinda, getting out of her car, starts toward the Rucker

                    There was one found in the blood at 
                    the scene.

    And Kalinda hangs up, continues toward the house, goes to the 
      back door.  Not seeing the figure following her.  A dark 
      parka.  Who is it, the security guard?  Kind of spooky.  

      Kalinda peers in the door, sees through the kitchen door... 
    the living room.  The TV set.  Nothing on it.  She hears a 
      noise behind her.  Looks.  No one.  Starts to turn back when 
    she stops.  Sees something.

    In the dirt.  Rain stained.  Slips of paper.  She reaches 
      down.  Picks it up.   Overnight Shipping.  Attempted 
      Delivery.   She studies it.  Sees a  Requested return  check
