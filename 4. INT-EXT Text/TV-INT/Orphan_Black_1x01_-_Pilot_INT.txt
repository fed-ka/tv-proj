      Commuters crowded in sardine silence.  Idle gazes on - a
      girl. Asleep?  Passed out?  She is SARAH, late 20 s, a born
      outsider traveling light, probably in flight. She dreams
      like a dog, animated ...

      A FAT MAN eyes her. So does a LITTLE GIRL holding her MOM's
      hand. 

      Sarah jolts awake, dissociated, freaked out.  Where the fuck
      am I?

      She pulls herself together.  Checks her bag as if used to
      being robbed.  Her knuckles are cut. She takes in the train,
      all those judging eyes. The Fat Man is still leering.

                                      SARAH
                    What?

                                    FAT MAN
                      Wakey-wakey.

                                      SARAH
                    You like sleeping girls, lard ass? 
                    Is that your bag?

      Sarah carries more than a trace of a working class English
      accent, and this is North America.  He turns his back.  She s
      making everyone uncomfortable.  Sarah sees the Mom try to
      shield the Little Girl from it.  Instant regret.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, honey.

      The train squeals into a station.  Doors open. Sarah takes
      the chance to push blindly out, past the Mother.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.


      The train pulls away.  Commuter crush on the platform thins. 
      Sarah s breathing slows, she pulls herself together.

      Okay, assess.  She checks her jeans pockets - a five dollar
      bill and some change.  Cell phone in the inside pocket of
      her beat up leather jacket.  In her purse, a plastic water
      bottle.

      She unscrews the cap, tilts back the bottle and drinks. 
      Then something odd catches her eye.                                                                                      2. 


      ANGLE ON:  OPPOSITE PLATFORM

      A well dressed WOMAN, back turned, crouching down, slipping
      off her heels.  She takes off her suit jacket, folds it
      neatly, places her purse and shoes on the jacket in a neat
      pile on the floor.  A train approaches, rising thunder.  She
      straightens up, turns towards us ...

      THE WOMAN IS HER. Sarah gasps, time slows.  A twin - better
      dressed, different social strata - but identical.

      The bottle falls out of Sarah s hand.  Water leaks out across
      the platform.

      And then the Woman sees Sarah.  A frozen moment of contact
      ... and in her eyes, Sarah sees  - fear, confusion.

      The train roars into the station, and without hesitation,
      the Woman steps off the platform DIRECTLY INTO ITS PATH.

      Blood spatters everywhere.  Brakes squeal.  Commuters scream.

      Sarah stands stock still, her brain overloading.  At her
      feet, blood droplets swirl in spilt water.  She raises a
      hand, wipes a drop of blood from her lip, looks at it on her
      finger ...

      And snaps out of it, noise and confusion rushing back.  She
      starts walking, breaks into a run ...


      Sarah forgoes a crowded ESCALATOR and runs up the stairs
      beside it.  She turns a corner at the top.

      Runs along a wide, tiled HALLWAY, rounding another corner to
      confront ...

      A MOB welling up from the other platform, freaked-out by the
      suicide.  She steels herself, pushes down against them ...


      Sarah emerges against the flow. Train emptying, platform
      clearing, TRACK WORKERS on radios, a few macabre
      RUBBERNECKERS.  Way more blood spatter this side.  Sarah
      walks to where she can see ...

      The body on the tracks:  shattered and contorted, but the
      face still intact, eyes staring -- it s her.

      Sarah rips her eyes away, spots ... the woman s personal
      effects, unnoticed, piled so neatly aside.  She slides over,
      snags the purse.                                                                                      3. 


      Purse in hand, Sarah joins the tail end of the commuter flow
      out.

                                          END TEASER                                                                                      4. 


                                          ACT ONE


      She rifles the purse in a filthy stall.  A wallet, find the
      ID:  Too fucking weird, herself staring back.  Name:

                                      SARAH
                    Elizabeth Childs ...

      Count the money.  $140, into her pocket.  Two phones, one
      expensive, one cheap pink plastic, pocket them.  A big set
      of keys with an electronic swipe card attached.  Take those
      too.  Go back and take the credit cards.  The rest is crap.

      Exit the stall, purse into garbage, cover it with trash.  A
      breath, a moment in the mirror. Wipe away another blood spot.
      Holy fuckin shit.


      A skid bar, almost empty.  Sarah comes out of the bathroom,
      steps to the sketchy BARTENDER.

                                      SARAH
                    Bourbon rocks.

      The Bartender pours, eyes her curiously.

                                      BARTENDER
                    Do I know you?

                                      SARAH
                    Maybe.  I haven t been around for a
                    while.

                                      BARTENDER
                    Yeah.  Thought I seen you before.


      Sarah at a table, four drinks in.  She fidgets, not good at
      sitting still.

      Door opens.  A skinny-assed hustler enters. FELIX, worldly
      beyond his 23 years, all of them gay. He's Sarah's foster
      brother, the closest thing either of them have to family. He                                                                                      5. 


      was younger than her when they emigrated, so he carries no
      English accent unless he wants to put it on. Sarah stands to
      hug him, an air of codependency beneath their banter.

                                      FELIX
                    Oh my God, you look like crap.
                          (hug ends, regard her)
                      Seriously, Sarah -- ew.

                                      SARAH
                    How s life, Felix?

                                      FELIX
                    Operatic.

                                      SARAH
                    Want a Bellini or something?

                                      FELIX
                    Fuck off. This long no see, you don t
                    get to be the bitch.  I do.

                                      SARAH
                    I didn't miss your Birthday.

                                      FELIX
                    I know, totally pedestrian and the
                    only reason I m here.
                          (to Bartender)
                    Guiness, Jack.
                          (then)
                    So.  How s Vic the Dick?

      Sarah drums her fingers.  How much should she tell him?

                                      SARAH
                    I hit him first this time.

      Felix raises an eyebrow.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    With an ashtray, so, you know ...
                    pretty sure it s time to move on.
                          (beat)
                    I'm here for Kira, Fee.

                                      FELIX
                    Mrs. S isn't going to let you just
                    take her.

                                      SARAH
                    She's my daughter, she's going to
                    have to.                                                                                      6. 


                                      FELIX
                    It's been almost a year, Sarah.

      Sarah s not proud of that.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    Not judging, just saying.

                                      SARAH
                    So I'm back, on the run.  The usual
                    Sarah shit, right?
                          (Felix shrugs, kinda)
                    Well on that joyous note, something
                    awfully fucking weird just happened
                    on the subway.

                                      FELIX
                    What?

                                      SARAH
                    I saw a girl kill herself.

                                      FELIX
                    Ew.  A jumper?

                                      SARAH
                          (nods)
                    And she ... She looked exactly like
                    me, Felix.

                                      FELIX
                    Whaddaya mean?

      She pulls the girl s stuff out of her pockets and lines it
      up on the table:  Keys, ID. One pink phone, one black.  Felix
      blanches.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    You robbed her body?

                                      SARAH
                    No.  She left her purse on the
                    platform.

      She slides the drivers license to Felix.  He picks it up. 
      Long pause.

                                      FELIX
                    Okay, that s weird.

                                      SARAH
                    Ya think?                                                                                      7. 


                                      FELIX
                    It s you with a nice haircut ... and
                    a nice address.

      She takes the ID back and examines it again.

                                      SARAH
                    What the hell, Fee?  Did I have a
                    twin sister?

                                      FELIX
                    Well, when you re a poor little
                    orphaned foster wretch, anything s
                    possible.  Or so we tell ourselves.

                                      SARAH
                          (pause, off the ID)
                    I've go to go up to her flat.

                                      FELIX
                    To find out who she is, or to rob
                    the rest of her shit?

      Sarah checks the key ring.

                                      SARAH
                    No car. There has to be a car.

      The black phone rings, startling them.  Sarah checks the
      caller ID:  Art.  Shows it to Felix.

                                      FELIX
                    Answer it.

      As if.  Sarah pockets the phone, gathers the other effects.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    What about Vic?

      She kisses him on the cheek.  He doesn t reciprocate.

                                      SARAH
                    I ll call ya.


      Quiet, Sarah tense, floors ticking upwards.


      Door slides open, Sarah steps out.  Subdued lighting, wide
      and quiet.  She slips to door # 1423, listens carefully. 
      She tries a key, another and another, getting frustrated
      until ... Bingo.


      Sarah softly shuts the door, stays still.  Silence.  She
      edges in ...


      Holy shit, you can see for miles.  A sweet pad, not rich,
      but art on the walls, styley, way out of her league.  She
      explores.


      She passes the fridge, photos on the door:   Beth .  And a
      boyfriend?  One with his shirt off, not bad, but not her
      type.


        Understated, tidy.  Open a closet: girls wardrobe.  Skirt-
      suits, nice but conservative. An athlete too, gym gear.
      Another closet: his.                                                                                      9. 


      They live together. Suits, shirts, fuckin  boat shoes and
      chinos.

                                      SARAH
                    Squares.

      But in Paul's well organized things she spots - a camera.
      She grabs it.


      A big ensuite.  Check the med cabinet: serious prescription
      drugs.  All Beth s - anti-depressants, tranquilizers, a mixed
      bag.  All prescribed by one DR. BOWERS.


      This looks promising.  Fax and printer on the desk, but no
      computer.  A two-drawer file cabinet, rifle it - just bills
      and paper.  Open desk drawers, one by one.  Bingo:  last
      drawer has cheque books, credit card statements.  Pull the
      whole thing out of the desk.


      A dim, open warehouse, high windows, curtains drawn.  Vague
      clutter, art and decay.  Vague decadence: a line of coke
      snorted, clothing roughly removed.

      Two men:  An ND executive type, few features, no soul.  And
      Felix, the bottom, tossed around.  Not exactly pleasure, but
      nothing he d do without.

      LATER: Felix in bed. No conversation, the ND lover dressing,
      drops a few bills on the dresser on the way out.

      Felix gets up in the gloom.  Lights a smoke. He throws back
      a curtain, revealing in detail ...

      Art space, paint splashed.  Canvases and found metal
      sculpture, variations on a fuck you theme.  A lot of it good,
      none of it finished ... and naked Felix heading for the
      bathroom ...


      Shower running.  A loud door buzzer, someone leaning on it. 
      Shower dies off, Felix comes out of the bathroom pulling on
      a robe.

                                      FELIX
                    Okay, okay, okay!

      He unlatches and slides open the rolling metal door ...                                                                                      10. 


      And gets grabbed by the throat by VIC, alias  Vic the Dick ,
      33, a lean, frustrated bundle of see-saw emotion.  Felix
      ain't scared of him, but Vic has him by the windpipe and
      tends to injure.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    Vic?

                                    VIC
                    Where is she?

                                      FELIX
                    Who?
                          (throat grip tightens)
                    Vic?  ... can t ...

                                    VIC
                    Breathe?

      Felix struggles, has to beg.

                                      FELIX
                    Please, Vic ...

      Vic relaxes his grip enough to catch a breath.

                                    VIC
                    Talk.

                                      FELIX
                    I haven t seen her in a year.  I
                    swear to God, I don t want to.  She s
                    not my problem anymore.

      Vic lets him go.  But puts a finger in his face.

                                    VIC
                    Bullshit. 

      He takes off his ball cap to reveal a shaved bald spot and a
      big welt with stitches.

                                    VIC (CONT'D)
                    Tell her this didn t even hurt. 
                    Tell her it makes me happy.

                                      FELIX
                    Vic.  You two are poison.  Why don t
                    you just let her go?

                                    VIC
                    Because I love her you little
                    fuckhead, and we re not finished. 
                    Now where s her kid?                                                                                      11. 


                                      FELIX
                    I m not telling you that, Vic.

                                    VIC
                    She s with your foster mom, isn t
                    she?  Mrs. S or P or whatever.

                                      FELIX
                    You ll have to beat it out of me,
                    I m afraid.  And I ll enjoy it.

      Vic grabs his face.  Felix struggles.

                                    VIC
                    Tell Sarah I m coming back.  She
                    better be here, Felix.


      Cold imported beer in the fridge.  Sarah fishes one out,
      closes the door.  There s a piece of paper magnetized to the
      fridge beneath one of the boyfriend photos - a travel
      itinerary, under the name ...

                                      SARAH
                    Paul ...

      She takes his photo too.


      She turns on the TV with the remote -- a security camera
      feed from the lobby entrance.  Nobody there.  She flicks
      through a few channels to local news, volume low.

       Beth  is laid out On the dining table - Paul s photo on his
      travel itinerary. The pink and black phones. Paul's Camera. 
      She's going through the office drawer, examining credit
      statements, checkbooks, bank books.

      The TV is on, local news, volume low.

      A phone rings - her own.  Check the caller ID, answer.

                                      SARAH
                    Felix.

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      Felix on the phone, examining the bruises on his throat.

                                      FELIX
                    Hi Liz.                                                                                      12. 


                                      SARAH
                    It s  Beth .  My credit is maxed,
                    but I ve got a sweet pad and my new
                    boyfriend Paul is out of town till
                    the weekend.

                                      FELIX (ON PHONE)
                    Well that s handy.  Unfortunately,
                    your real boyfriend, Vic the Dick,
                    is already here.

                                      SARAH
                    Fuck.

                                      FELIX
                    I m fine, thanks for asking.

                                      SARAH
                    Sorry. 

                                      FELIX
                    Not very.  So is she your twin or
                    what?

      Sarah sighs, going through the last effects in the office
      drawer.

                                      SARAH
                    I don t know.  Just a girl who looks
                    like me.  A girl with a pretty nice
                    life.

                                      FELIX
                    If it s so nice, why d she kill
                    herself?

      Sarah s fingers find a seam in the bottom of the drawer.  It
      has a false bottom. She lifts it up to discover -- a bank
      book.   She opens it.

                                      SARAH
                    Holy shit.

                                      FELIX
                    What?

                                      SARAH
                    She s got 150 K in a savings account.

                                      FELIX
                    Uh.  Say again?

                                      SARAH
                    150 K.  In a hidden account.  Felix,
                    this is enough for me and Kira.                                                                                      13. 


                                      FELIX
                    To what, you and Kira?

                                      SARAH
                    Get away. Set ourselves up somewhere.
                    It's not a lot but it's enough to
                    lose bloody Vic.

                                      FELIX
                    Well I want to come.

                                      SARAH
                    Yes.  The three of us. Where, West
                    Coast?

                                      FELIX
                    Uh, first?  Any second someone will
                    ID that body and it s over.

                                      SARAH
                    I know, and banks take a couple of
                    days to process a withdrawal this
                    size.

                                      FELIX
                    You should really get out of there
                    right now.
                          (silence)
                    Vic has eight stitches, by the way.
                          (silence)
                    Hello?

                                      SARAH
                    I m thinking ...

      The television catches her attention ...

      ON TV: A NEWS REPORT

       Commuter Chaos  title.  Footage of stationary trains; crowds
      welling up out of the subway; sidewalks over-crowded with
      stranded passenger.  A reporter on the scene mopping up,
      live after-the-fact.

                                      REPORTER
                    ... all trains are running again,
                    but the jumper remains a Jane Doe.
                    Witnesses describe her as white,
                    twenties, dark-haired and well
                      dressed...

      ON SARAH. A Plan of action forming. Don t analyze, just do.

                                      SARAH
                    Felix, I have an idea.                                                                                      14. 


      Felix is tenuous, knows her too well.

                                      FELIX
                    Oh no ...

                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                      15. 


                                          ACT TWO


      Open on VARIOUS HOME VIDEO OF BETH. She's running a 10K race.
      She's in the finish area, hands on hips, regaining her breath.  

      REVEAL:  The footage is on the TV, which is cabled to Paul's
      camera. Sarah watches intently, soaking in her mannerisms
      and speech.

      More HOME VIDEO footage. Casual moments.  Beth reads a bit
      of a hard ass. Hard shell, soft center. She doesn't smile a
      lot, but when she does it's warm and fragile. She bites her
      nails. She chews gum. In a telling clip taken without her
      knowing, she looks troubled.

      Sarah aborbs her, taking her on, a chameleon shift.

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      Sarah picks a nice power suit from the wardrobe.  Fits
      perfect.  Vamps the mirror, all business, a chameleon. 

      HOME VIDEO:  Holiday footage.  They're in a canoe. Paul behind
      the camera in the bow, shooting backwards as Beth paddles.
      She looks peaceful, enjoying the surroundings. Then she looks
      at the camera wryly.

                                    BETH
                    You gonna give me a hand there,
                      Spielberg?

                                    PAUL
                    After your close up.

      She splashes water at him with the paddle. Jiggle-cam.

                                    PAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you'll get it wet!

                                    BETH
                    Oh, you're breaking my heart.


      In the mirror, Sarah 'becomes' Beth, using her make up,
      styling her hair to match photos stuck to the mirror.

                                      SARAH
                    Oh, you're breaking my heart.

      A phone rings off ...                                                                                      16. 



      Sarah grabs Beth s phone off the table, the black one that
      rang before.  Checks caller ID:  Art  again.

                                      SARAH
                          (as Beth)
                    Sorry Art, whoever you are, I'm
                    leaving town for a while.

      Now she builds Beth a new wallet:  ID, cash, change, details. 
      Fills a new purse:  lipstick, keys, clutter. Finally - bank
      books, cheque book.


      Floors tick off, too slow for Sarah, 3...2...L.


      Doors open on - the same Woman getting her mail. Sarah walks
      straight for them. The little rat-dog starts barking again,
      but as  Beth  gets closer, the dog recognizes her and wags
      its tail.

                                      WOMAN
                    Morning, Beth.

      Sarah spots her name on the mailbox ...

                                      SARAH
                    Morning, Mrs. Elray.

      She bends and gives the dog a pat on her way by.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Morning, Pooker.

      And Sarah s out the door ...


      Felix drinking shit black coffee at the counter, trying to
      find the balls to dial the phone in his hand, nervous knee
      bouncing.

      Felix s knee-bounce is making PETE, an old boy with the
      shakes, chin-dribble his coffee. Behind the counter is BOBBY,
      30, a blue collar Goth Mother, inherited her name with the
      joint.  She swats Felix with a spatula.

                                      BOBBY
                    Felix!                                                                                      17. 


                                      FELIX
                    What?

                                      BOBBY
                    Chill with the jackhammer.  Yer
                    buggin  Pete.

                                      FELIX
                    Sorry, Peter.

                                      BOBBY
                          (pours Pete another)
                    On him.

      Felix turns his back on them and does what he has to, dialing
      a number.

                                      POLICE OPERATOR (O.S.)
                    Police Services.

                                      FELIX
                    Um, hi & there was a girl who killed
                    herself in the subway yesterday?  I
                    think I know her.

                                      POLICE OPERATOR (O.S.)
                    All right, you know a name?

                                      FELIX
                    Yeah, Sarah.  Sarah Manning ...


      Sarah, all business, before a RECEPTIONIST.

                                      SARAH
                    Beth Childs. I have an appointment
                    with the Manager.


      Sarah sits opposite the Manager, STEPHEN RIGGS by his
      nameplate, 40. He looks over Beth s bankbooks and ID.

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS
                    Well I m sorry to see you leave,
                    Beth.  But of course we don t keep
                    this much cash on hand.

                                      SARAH
                    The transaction needs to be verified,
                    that s fine.  I d like it by Thursday.                                                                                      18. 


                                      STEPHEN RIGGS
                    Thursday.  Can I ask where you re
                    going?

                                      SARAH
                    Another institution.

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS
                    Can I ask why?

      She smiles a definite  no .  He clears his throat.

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS (CONT'D)
                    All right, we ll get it processed. 
                    If you please authorize, right here.
                          (Sarah signs Beth s
                            signature)
                    And here.
                          (she signs again)
                    You know, I really recommend a
                    cashier s cheque, rather than carrying
                    this amount of cash.

                                      SARAH
                    Thank you, Stephen, that won t be
                      necessary.

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS
                    Will you be emptying your safe deposit
                    box too?

                                      SARAH
                          (beat)
                    Yes.  Can we do that now?

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS
                    Do you have your key with you?

      Sarah takes out Beth s key ring. He spots the key before she
      does.

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS (CONT'D)
                    Yes, there it is.  This way, please.


      Mr. Riggs uses his key to remove a box from the wall.  He
      puts it on the table for her.

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS
                    Take your time.

      He leaves the room. Sarah opens the lid.                                                                                      19. 


      One file folder. She opens it - nothing negotiable.  Just a
      photocopied birth certificate - Beth s.  Another photocopied
      birth certificate, this one German, for a "Katja Obinger".
      Another for "Allison Hendrix".  

      No time to think about it.  Just take the file, slip it into
      her purse.


      Gets in.  He pulls out fast, shaking his head in silent anger.

                                    ART
                    Where you been for three days? Huh? 

      Sarah plays it tight lipped, pissed off right back.

                                    ART (CONT'D)
                    You better be ready.  Are you ready?

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah, I m ready.

      Silence.  He drives aggressively.

                                    ART
                    Skip the shrink, that s your problem. 
                    You fuck this up, you fuck me.

      He s getting emotional.  She has to say something.

                                      SARAH
                    I know.

      Casting about for clues, she spots a clipboard.  Cop
      paperwork:  Officer Arthur Bell.  Art.

                                    ART
                    We made a commitment.  I crossed a
                    line for you.  Suddenly I can t trust
                    you?  Suddenly I don t even know
                    you?

                                      SARAH
                    Art.

      Beat. The name sticks. Sarah gives him "Beth" attitude.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You're breaking my heart.  Just drive.

      Art glowers.  Sarah stares straight ahead.  This is out of
      control.


      Felix escorted by COLIN, 29, geek-handsome young morgue
      attendant.  Felix is flustered, finds the whole morgue thing
      kind of creatively juicy and a weird turn on. They approach
      the cold room doors at the end of the hall.

                                      FELIX
                    Are they in there?                                                                                      21. 


                                      COLIN
                    Yes.

      Colin is about to open the door, Felix balks, a hand on his
      arm.

                                      FELIX
                    Colin...  Can I call you Colin?

                                      COLIN
                    My mum does.

                                      FELIX
                    Uh huh.  Don t get me wrong, I usually
                    enjoy creepy.  I m just a little ...
                          (flustered)

                                      COLIN
                    Sure.  Take a breath.

                                      FELIX
                          (tries, but)
                    The air in here.  Is that just me?

                                      COLIN
                    No.  It s death.
                          (a smile)
                    You can do this.  It can be a gestalt.

                                      FELIX
                    Oh my.

      Colin opens the door.


      Sarah holds on as Art angrily wheels the car around a corner. 
      Oh Fuck ...


      Sarah s frozen.

                                      SARAH
                    Ho-ly shit.

      It must be shift change, COPS everywhere.  Art waits
        impatiently.                                                                                      22. 



      She holds up and lets Art lead.  The DESK SERGEANT stands as
      they pass, doesn t like either of them. Why are all eyes on
      her?  A few cold glares, a few nods of encouragement from
      the rank-and-file. A dark haired woman out of uniform (ANGELA
      DEANGELIS, 30) makes a fist -  strength 


      Art leads them right to a wiry little Napoleon, cue ball
      bald, waiting outside his office door - LIEUTENANT GAVIN
      HARDCASTLE, 50.  He s got a hate on for Beth.

                                      HARDCASTLE
                      Fashionably late, you call that?

                                    ART
                    She s here, Lieutenant.

                                      HARDCASTLE
                          (to him, then her)
                    You get busy.  You come with me.

      Hardcastle leads her off.  Sarah casts a glance back to Art,
      at his desk.  On the desk adjoining his, a nameplate -
      Detective Elizabeth Childs.  Art nods encouragement.  Real
      concern, her partner, an ally in this skin, but not her own.

      Hardcastle, on the other hand, opens a door into a hallway. 
      He glares back at the hanging squad room.

                                      HARDCASTLE (CONT'D)
                    Show s over!

      He slams the door behind them.


      He marches her down, interrogation rooms on either side.

                                      HARDCASTLE
                    You better have your story down,
                    Childs.

      He stops at a door ajar. Inside, Sarah glimpses a Tribunal:
      An INTERNAL AFFAIRS SUIT, a POLICE CAPTAIN in uniform, and a                                                                                      23. 


      CIVILIAN POLITICIAN, a woman in her 50 s.  Beth's LAWYER
      waits at a table  facing them, her chair empty. Hardcastle
      softens a shade, offers a crack of encouragement.

                                      HARDCASTLE (CONT'D)
                    Stick to your statement, you'll be
                    fine.

      She can t go in there.  Spots a sign down the hall ...

                                      SARAH
                    I gotta use the bathroom.
                          (her general disarray)
                      Lieutenant.

      Hardcastle bristles, but there s a lot on the line.

                                      HARDCASTLE
                    Get yourself together.


      Sarah steps in, alone, reeling.  Pulls out her phone, dials. 
      Waits as it rings, cusses low as she gets a message.

                                      FELIX (V.O.)
                    Whaddaya want?  Leave it for Felix.

                                      SARAH
                    Felix!  Beth is a cop!  I m a cop,
                    Felix!   Abort!


      Felix, mortified/titillated as Colin rolls out a body bag.

                                      COLIN
                    Okay.  Can I call you Felix?

                                      FELIX
                    Yes, please.

                                      COLIN
                    This ll be shocking, Felix. But for
                    her it was instant.

      Felix nods.  Colin unzips the face.  Felix is rocked - he s
      staring at a dead, mangled Sarah.  His knees go weak.

                                      FELIX
                    Ohhhh my God ... toooo weird ...

                                      COLIN
                    It s okay, lean on me.                                                                                      24. 


                                      FELIX
                    Ohhhh my God ... that is so fucked
                    up.

                                      COLIN
                    Here s a chair.

      He sits him down.  Felix wasn t ready for that.


      Sarah s got nowhere to turn.  She desperately needs a plan. 
      Then she spots the liquid hand soap dispenser, clear
      colourless soap.  Ah, shit.  She dismantles it quickly.


      Felix thankfully drinks a glass of water.

                                      FELIX
                    Thank you.  Morgue water?  Delicious.

                                      COLIN
                    Is it her, Felix?

      Felix takes a big breath and nods.

                                      COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Your sister.  I m sorry.

                                      FELIX
                    Foster sister, but close.  We spent
                    our  formulative  years together.

                                      COLIN
                    Well if you ... need anyone to talk
                    to ... over a drink.

      Colin is actually blushing.  Not much surprises Felix, but
      this does.  He reappraises him.

                                      FELIX
                    Well, aren t you an odd duck?


      Sarah emerges from the bathroom.  Death march toward
      Hardcastle waiting outside the hearing room, a slight wobble
      in her step.  She steps right past him and in.


      Sarah nods to her grim Lawyer and sits opposite the Tribunal. 
      They ve been waiting a while.                                                                                      25. 


                                      POLICE CAPTAIN
                    Nice of you to join us.

                                      SARAH
                    Sorry, sir.

      Internal Affairs turns on the tape rig, adjusts the mic.

                                      INTERNAL AFFAIRS
                    All right. Statement of Officer
                    Elizabeth Childs, entering into record
                    her version of the line-of-duty
                    shooting, 7 February of this year,
                    resulting in a civilian fatality. 
                    In your own words please, begin by
                    stating your name.

      Silence.  They wait. Her Lawyer gives her a nod. She opens
      her mouth to speak and closes it again. 

                                      POLICE CAPTAIN
                    Any time, Detective.

                                      INTERNAL AFFAIRS
                    Just relax and tell it like it is.

      Sarah shifts in her seat, sweating, going green ... and then
      the Tribunal scatters as she pukes all over the table.


      Art looks up from his paperwork as the Tribunal Members stomp
      through wiping themselves down with paper towel.  Hardcastle
      peels off from them, also toweling, steps up to Art.

                                      HARDCASTLE
                    Get your partner to the goddamn
                    shrink.

                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                      26. 


                                        ACT THREE


      On DR. ANITA BOWERS, her tired, piercing gaze over bifocals
      and nameplate on piled desk.  Bowers has spent twenty years
      dealing with cops, and a year or so with Beth -- Sarah --
      who's lying uncomfortably on a couch across the room, ready
      to say anything to get out of there.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    It's "not coming back" to you?

                                      SARAH
                    Not really. I know I shot a civilian,
                    but I m missing ...

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    What?  Explain.

                                      SARAH
                    Myself.  I glitched, a break or
                      something. I think I need some ...
                    you know, leave.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    You re under suspension.

                                      SARAH
                    Right.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    But I can declare you Unfit. So
                      circumstances aside, let's start
                    with how you feel about shooting
                    this person you don't really remember
                    shooting.
                          (refers to notes)
                    Maggie Chen. 44. Single, churchgoer.
                    Who you mistook for a wanted felon.
                    And her cell phone for a gun.

      Sarah doesn't want to dig any deeper, just shrugs.

                                      SARAH
                    I feel bad.

      Bowers is deadpan. She checks her watch, settles back in her
      chair.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    A cop like you doesn't just accept
                    unfit. And why are you lying down?

      Sarah realizes she's made a mistake. Sits up.                                                                                      27. 


                                    DR. BOWERS (CONT'D)
                    A year you've been seeing me and you
                    avoid that couch like the plague. It
                    tells me you're acting. And if you're
                    not being truthful, I can't help
                    you.
                          (washing hands of her)
                    So your recent episodes --
                      dissociation, delusions, paranoia --
                    they can all be part of a legal
                    defense.  A very good one.  Just not
                    for a cop with ambition.  If you
                    still want a career, you need me. 
                    Are you hearing that?

                                      SARAH
                    Yes.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    Good. Because your time is up.

      Thank God. Sarah is right out the door.


      Sarah slips out of the office quietly, sticking to the wall. 
      Craning down the hall she can glimpse ...


      Art waiting for her on a couch, her escort, intense as usual.


      Sarah moves the other direction, toward an  Exit .


      She bounds down half a flight at a time, footfalls echoing. 
      Not quite parkour, but she s got moves.  Hits the bottom ...


      A painting underway - the vague corpse of Beth in the morgue,
      Felix working the surface.  Someone lays on the buzzer and
      Felix knows exactly who it is.  He puts down his brush, wipes
      his hands, arranges a handy newspaper, psyches himself for
      an Oscar-worthy drama.


      Vic leans on the buzzer and bangs on the door, murderous.

                                    VIC
                    Open up, Felix!

      The door whips open and Felix grabs him by the throat.  Vic
      is taken off guard, but breaks the grip easily.                                                                                      30. 


                                    VIC (CONT'D)
                    You crazy little fruit leather...

      But before the blows land, Felix stops him cold with animated
      anguish.

                                      FELIX
                    Sarah s dead!

                                    VIC
                    What?

                                      FELIX
                    Dead!  She killed herself!

                                    VIC
                    Bullshit.

      Felix throws him the paper:   Jane Doe Jumper  headline.

                                      FELIX
                    She jumped in front of a train! 
                    Because you are such a fuckin 
                    asshole!

                                    VIC
                          (has the fear now)
                    This isn t Sarah ...

                                      FELIX
                      I identified her body!  She s dead,
                    Vic!

      Felix grabs him, full waterworks.  Vic pushes him off,
      freaking, just where Felix wants him.

                                    VIC
                    Don t fuck with me, Felix!  She told
                    you to say this!  She can t be dead!

                                      FELIX
                      Aaaahhhhh ll prove it to you!!


      Vic leaning heavily on Felix, lets out a strangled gasp as
       Sarah s  body bag, is unzipped by Colin for the second time
      today.

                                    VIC
                    Sarah ... oh, Sarah ...

      He breaks down, keening and pining.  Felix absently pats him
      on the back, far more interested in his new frisson with
      Colin. Off Beth on the slab ...                                                                                      31. 



       Beth  is laid out on the table. Photos, financial details,
      the envelope from the safe deposit box etc. Felix is with
      Sarah, trying to make sense of it all.

                                      FELIX
                    So your  twin, all hopped up on cop-
                      tranquillizers, guns down a innocent
                    Chinese lady. Is that true?

                                      SARAH
                    I don't know. Her partner's covering
                    for her somehow, but he sure doesn't
                    trust her. 

                                      FELIX
                    Yeah, what s she doing with 150K in
                    a hidden account?

                                      SARAH
                    I don t care.  Her life is way more
                    fucked up than mine.  But we can
                    still pull this off.

                                      FELIX
                    We have no choice now.  Vic is keening
                    like a banshee.  He wants a funeral.

                                      SARAH
                    You can t have a funeral.  The whole
                    sad point is nobody would notice if
                    I died.

      Felix chuckles, wanders the room with a jaundiced eye,
      scoffing at art, eating candies from a dish.

                                      FELIX
                    Did I mention the bi-curious morgue
                      attendant?

                                      SARAH
                    Tell Vic dead is dead and you never
                    want to see him again.

                                      FELIX
                    Well, I need personal effects.

                                      SARAH
                    What?

                                      FELIX (O.S.)
                    Your shit, Sarah.  Objects for him
                    to pine over. You could at least
                    help with your death.                                                                                      32. 


      Sarah pours over Beth, trying to get a handle on her.

                                      SARAH
                    This girl.  She s a hardass. A control
                    freak on anti-psychotics.  I think
                    her life was falling apart.

                                      FELIX
                      Thrilling, really, but can we get
                    the fucking elephant out of the room?

      He slaps a photo of Beth right in front of her.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    Look at her.  This could be your
                    story.

                                      SARAH
                    It s not.

                                      FELIX
                    You have to ask.

                                      SARAH
                    No I don t.

                                      FELIX
                    Every foster kid dreams of their
                    dramatic lost family.  Deep down, we
                    all hope we re special.

                                      SARAH
                    The last thing I am is special.

      Sarah flips him the picture of Beth s boyfriend.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    If that was my boyfriend, I d jump
                    in front of a train too.

                                      FELIX
                    Don t say that.  Paul is hot and you
                    know it.

      Felix opens the envelope from the safe deposit box, the one
      with the ID documents.  She takes them away from him.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    What are those?

                                      SARAH
                    Nothing.
                          (relents)
                    She had some birth certificates in
                    her safe deposit box.                                                                                      33. 


                                      FELIX
                    Whose birth certificates?

                                      SARAH
                    I don t know, okay.  One of them s
                    German.

      They examine them together. The three many-times-xeroxed
      birth certificates... different places of birth... but dates
      of birth all March or April, 1984.

                                      FELIX
                    Beth.   Katja Obinger . "Alison
                    Hendrix". Sarah, their birth dates
                    are within a month of yours.

                                      SARAH
                    So what?

                                      FELIX
                    Well, what is this? Maybe your bio-
                    mother was like a robo-mom who punched
                    out quadruplets.

                                      SARAH
                    Then the birthdays would be the same,
                    Felix. It s just a score.  A score
                    going out of control, okay?  It s
                    way too dangerous for Kira right
                    now.  And it s too dangerous for
                    you.

      Felix sinks.  He should have known.

                                      FELIX
                    Oh.  You re gonna disappear again.

                                      SARAH
                    Just for a bit.

                                      FELIX
                    I m so fucking stupid.

                                      SARAH
                    I have to, Felix. There s other weird
                    shit going on.  There was a black
                    car following her ...

                                      FELIX
                    A black car?  You must be terrified.

      He storms off to the door.  Sarah follows.                                                                                      34. 


                                      SARAH
                    Tomorrow I ll get through the bank,
                    leave you some money.  I promise
                    I ll be back in touch when I know
                    it s safe.

                                      FELIX
                    Keep your money.  Okay?  You re not
                    my fucking sister, you just make me
                    be your brother.

                                      SARAH
                    Felix ... I will call you tomorrow.

      Felix adjusts himself imperiously in a mirror.

                                      FELIX
                    I did my bit, Sarah.  Now you re
                    dead.

      Felix closes the door on her.  She groans, the drama.


      Sarah stands staring at Beth spread out on the table.  Then
      snaps to it, sorting the information back into corresponding
      piles.


      Shower running.  Sarah undresses.  Beneath the clothes,
      bruises hint at a rough exit from her life with Vic.

      Sarah lets the hot water pour over her, gathering strength.


      Sarah in a bathrobe, staring into Sarah s closet.

      She puts a small sports bag on the bed, starts picking a few
      items - functional clothing, some running shoes.

      She startles out of it -- a key in a lock!


      The door handle turns, someone coming in ...


      Beth frozen, listening as the door closes.

                                    PAUL (O.S.)
                    Beth?                                                                                      35. 


                                      SARAH
                          (under her breath)
                    Fuck ...

                                    PAUL (O.S.)
                    Beth?

      Sound of footfalls, receding, then approaching, right outside
      the door ... it s pushed open ...

      PAUL stands looking in.  30ish, leaner and better looking
      than expected.  Suit and loosened tie, travel-worn.  He seems
      cautious with her, not sure what to expect.

                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                    Hi.

                                      SARAH
                          (as Beth)
                    Hey.

      He takes in the bag on the bed.

                                    PAUL
                    Are you going somewhere?

                                      SARAH
                    No, gym stuff.

      Sarah tosses it in the cupboard.  He s expectant.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You re back early.

                                    PAUL
                    Well, I wanted to be here.  So?

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah?

                                    PAUL
                    How was the hearing?

                                      SARAH
                    Oh ... I couldn t do it.

                                    PAUL
                    You skipped it?

                                      SARAH
                    No.  I got sick to my stomach,
                    basically puked on them.                                                                                      36. 


                                    PAUL
                          (real concern)
                    Are you serious?

      He comes to hold her.  She sidesteps.

                                      SARAH
                    I m okay, don t worry.

      She sidesteps again but he cuts her off.  She can t meet his
      gaze.  He looks at her closer.

                                    PAUL
                    Beth ...?

                                      SARAH
                    What?

      He senses something amiss, beyond the immediate.  Sarah pushes
      past him.  He follows her out.

                                    PAUL
                    What s happened?

                                      SARAH
                    A lot.

                                    PAUL
                    I know, but you re ...


      There s no retreat.  She turns to challenge him.

                                      SARAH
                    I m what?

      He can t put his finger on it.

                                    PAUL
                    What did you do to your hair?

                                      SARAH
                    Nothing.  Got it cut.

                                    PAUL
                    It s longer.

                                      SARAH
                    It s just wet.

      Concerned, he reaches out to touch her face.

                                    PAUL
                      Something s different ...                                                                                      37. 


      In a corner, Sarah doesn t think.  She jumps him -- arms
      around his neck, kissing him deeply.  He s knocked back
      against the wall.

      Paul didn t know how much he needed this, and Sarah s not
      expecting his ardor.  He flips her around, back against the
      wall, hands inside her robe.

                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                    Bedroom ...

      The only way Sarah can do this is in charge.  She muscles
      him aggressively around again, pressing him to the wall.

                                      SARAH
                    Right here ...

      She undoes his belt.  Even in the midst of this madness,
      she s impressed by what she finds.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Oh man ...

      She goes up on her toes, lowers onto his cock and groans.

      They feel it, slowly, a few strokes.  Paul is rocked and
      game.  But wants it his way.  He turns her firmly down the
      hall, an order whispered in her ear.

                                    PAUL
                    Bedroom ...

      Sarah no longer cares to resist.  She lets him lead her.

                                      END ACT THREE                                                                                      38. 


                                            ACT FOUR


      Sarah wide awake in bed, her back to Paul, sleeping with his
      arm around her.  She s not okay with what she just did.  She
      disengages cautiously.


      In the dim light, she picks up his pants, finds his wallet. 
      His ID:  Paul Dierden.  Credit cards, cash.  Key chain - a
      Volvo key among them.  She puts it all back in the pants.


      She finds his briefcase.  Turns on a hall light, clicks open
      the latches:  Some files, some architectural drawings.  He s
      an engineer or a contractor.  Close it back up.


      She slips back into the bed.  In sleep, he puts his arm back
      around her.  She can t do it, moves away.


      Banging on the door.  Felix pulls on a robe.

                                    VIC (O.S.)
                    Felix!  Felix!

                                      FELIX
                    Oh for crying out loud ...

      He pulls open the door.  Vic is dishevelled and drunk.  Blood
      down the front of his shirt.

                                    VIC
                    I m sorry, man, I got nowhere to go.

                                      FELIX
                    A men s shelter?

      But he sighs and lets him in.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck happened to your face?

                                    VIC
                    I got in a fight.

                                      FELIX
                    Why, Vic?  Why are you such a dick?                                                                                      39. 


                                    VIC
                    I m angry, I don t know.
                          (near tears)
                    Felix, I can t sleep.  I keep seeing
                    her face.

                                      FELIX
                    Yeah, me too.

                                    VIC
                    She s gone, man.

      Vic collapses into a chair, a puddle. 

                                    VIC (CONT'D)
                    There s just no closure without a
                    fuckin', you know, memorial send off
                    or whatever.

      Felix regards him dryly, then decides - fuck you, Sarah.

                                      FELIX
                    Okay, Vic. The cremation's tomorrow.

                                    VIC
                    Tomorrow?  But I gotta tell Glen and
                    that bitch Sherry. And some of the
                    bikers from Hamilton, they d want to
                    be there.

                                      FELIX
                    We'll have a wake. They can come to
                    that. 

                                    VIC
                    A wake. That's what I'm talking about,
                    Felix. Coming together.

      Felix takes control, a practiced den mother.

                                      FELIX
                    Love to, but tonight, you need a
                    shower and a Xanax. In the morning,
                    we ll find you a suit.  You re not
                    going to Sarah s funeral looking
                    like that.


      Sarah asleep, the bed beside her empty.  Paul enters with
      coffee for her.  She wakes with a start, disoriented.

                                    PAUL
                    Easy, just coffee.                                                                                      40. 


                                      SARAH
                    Oh.  Thanks.

      He sits on the bed and hands it to her.

                                    PAUL
                    You want to tell me what happened at
                    the hearing?

                                      SARAH
                    I choked.  Nerves, I guess.  They re
                      reconvening for me, it ll be fine.

                                    PAUL
                    Are you still off your meds?

                                      SARAH
                          (beat)
                    Yes.

                                    PAUL
                    Then you didn t choke, you re just
                    finally feeling something.

      He slides his hand under the sheets.

                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                    Feeling like the real you.

      He leans in, kisses her deeply. Sarah can t help it -- it
      feels good even though she s about to screw the guy over.

                                      SARAH
                    Hey, uh.  Are you driving?

                                    PAUL
                    What do you mean?

                                      SARAH
                    I could use the Volvo today.

                                    PAUL
                    Use your own car.

                                      SARAH
                    Yeah ... can t find my keys.

                                    PAUL
                    They re in the thing, like they always
                    are.

                                      SARAH
                    Oh.  Sorry, yeah.  Still kinda asleep
                    here.                                                                                      41. 


      He smiles at her oddly, and heads out.

      Sarah listens to him leaving, on edge ... the door closes. 
      She hops up.


      She looks around for  the thing .  Tries a drawer, nothing. 
      Looks in a clay pot - spare change.  A little decorative box
      with a lid - bingo, keys.  She fishes out an electronic car
      key.


      From the closet, she retrieves the bag she packed and hastily
      hid last night.  She picks a new power suit from Beth s
      clothes.  Sooo not her style, but ...


      It fits like a glove.  In the mirror, Sarah does the make
      up, styles the hair,  becoming  Beth ...... 

                                      SARAH
                    Hello, Stephen, nice to see you again.

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      Sarah s funeral.  An oven door opens on a gas-fired inferno. 
      A plain wooden casket rolls into the flames. An UNDERTAKER,
      solicitous in black.

      Felix, bitter in dapper attire.  Vic in a bad suit, leaning
      on him.  Battling anger, battling tears, hugging Sarah s
      beat up old leather jacket.


      Sort Beth:  Photos and details she doesn t need put aside. 
      Wallet, passport, bankbook into purse. Sort the 3 birth
      certificates, they go into the purse too.


      Weeping Vic accepts a simple urn of ashes from the Undertaker. 
      Felix just want to get out of there.


       Beth  dressed for business -- purse and travel bags.  Foot
      tapping impatiently as the floors tick off too slowly:
      3,2,L,P1,P2 ... Ding.  The doors slide open.                                                                                      42. 



        A cavernous, echoing space, cars for miles.  Hit the
      electronic key, a car squawks - a nice Audi.

                                      SARAH
                    Sweet.


      Sarah gets in the car.  It's spotless.  She checks the arm
      rest compartment, nothing but a box of tissue.  Reaches over
      to open the glove compartment:  A pair of binoculars. 


      Art keeps well back, tailing her professionally, determined
      and calm.


      Sarah chews her lip, going over the plan, oblivious to the
      tails.


      Sarah sits waiting, briefcase in her lap.  Her foot taps
      nervously, she stills it.

      Her phone beeps:  Message From: Felix.  She opens it.

      GRAPHIC:  A photo of Sarah with text, a cheesy invitation. 
      "Please join us to commemorate the passing of our friend
      Sarah Manning ..."

                                      SARAH
                          (not in character)
                    Felix! Are you bloody serious.

      The Manager, Stephen Riggs enters, carrying a zippered pouch.
      He caught the accent.

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS
                      Everything all right?

                                      SARAH
                          (back to Beth)
                    Stephen. Nice to see you again. Sorry.
                    Dealing with the English.

                                      STEPHEN RIGGS
                    Well, all is in order.

      He unzips the pouch.  Inside -- banded wads of cash.  Sarah
      counts them.  Puts one into her purse, the rest into the
      brief case.


      Sarah should feel great.  She s pulled it off, she s on the
      road, but the unexpected  memorial  irks her. She gets on
      the phone, rolls her eyes at his voice mail.

                                      FELIX (O.S.)
                    Leave it for Felix.                                                                                      44. 


                                      SARAH
                    Yeah. Joke, right? You wouldn't
                    actually have a memorial because I
                    would have to kill you, then we'd
                    both be dead.


      Sarah bangs on the door, hope fading. Taking out her phone,
      she mutters a familiar refrain.

                                      SARAH
                    Felix ...

      On Felix's Memorial GRAPHIC again. "Please join us to
      commemorate the passing of our friend Sarah Manning ... 11
      am, Allenside Park."

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Allenside Park.  Where else?  Vic s
                    stupid beach.
                          (stews, then)
                    Well, you only die once ...


      A barren lot, clumps of bush along the water. The Audi parks
      overlooking the harbour.


      There, across the water in a sad little park encroached by
      industry, is Sarah s own memorial.  She can just make out
      the small group of people.

                                      SARAH
                    Pathetic.

      But a little amusing too.  She opens the glove box, takes
      out the binoculars.


      Sarah gets out of the car, walks a short distance down the
      shore to get a better view.

      She settles down and steadies the binoculars on the group. 
      Moans in dismay.

      SARAH S POV: Emotional Vic is delivering a eulogy.  He cradles
      the urn before a motley group of misfit MOURNERS - a couple
      of BIKERS with their old LADIES, a ROCKABILLY GUY, a teary-
      eyed, chain smoking girl, SHERRY.  And Felix, standing a
      little aside, perversely enjoying the whole charade.

      Sarah growls at him and pulls out her phone.


                                      SARAH (ON PHONE)
                    Felix! Felix?

      She s yelling into a dead phone.  Powerless, she hangs up,
      watches through the binoculars, trying to read body language.

      SARAH S POV:  Mrs. S is stern and concerned, interrogating
      him.  Felix placates, shepherding her back towards the car.
      Mrs. S gets angrily in and drives off.

      But WTF happened?  Sarah s gut-sick, a visceral reaction.
      She retreats to the car.  At a loss, she gets in.


      Slams the door.  The quiet interior, just her panicked
      breathing.  She tries to slow it down.  To take control.

      Movement behind her.  Sarah glances in the rearview mirror
      and sees herself.

      HERSELF.  In the backseat.

      Sarah whips around. Another one of her. KATJA OBINGER. 
      Pallid, sickly and pissed off. She waves an identical pink
      cell phone, has a thick German accent.

                                      KATJA
                    Beth!  Why you not follow my text?

      Sarah screams ...

                                        END ACT FOUR                                                                                      48. 


                                            ACT FIVE


      Sarah screams at her new Doppelganger, launches herself out
      of the car.


      Sarah reels. Katja gets out of the back. 

                                      KATJA
                      Entschuldigung!  Sorry!

                                      SARAH
                    Keep the fuck away from me.

                                      KATJA
                    Beth, it s Katja. 

                                      SARAH
                    Holy shit, holy, holy fuckin shit.

      Sarah retreats, circling the car, keeping it between them,
      Katja waving that pink cell phone.

                                      KATJA
                    Bitte, Beth, I need to see the Doctor.

                                      SARAH
                    See whoever you want.

                                      KATJA
                    The Doctor must call me.

                                      SARAH
                    Just stay back.

                                      KATJA
                    I m Katja. Katja Obinger, Beth.

                                      SARAH
                    I get it, okay?  The German. I've
                    seen your birth certificate.

                                      KATJA
                    Jah. You asked for it. For proof.

                                      SARAH
                    Proof of what?

                                      KATJA
                    All of it, Beth.                                                                                      49. 


      Katja has a coughing spasm, hacks up clotted blood into a
      handkerchief.  Begs Sarah over her bloody hands ...

                                      KATJA (CONT'D)
                    Please. I need the Doctor.

      Blood on her chin, on the pink cell phone.  Sarah is
      horrified.

                                      SARAH
                    I can t help you.

      She s worked around to the drivers door again, quickly gets
      in.


      But before she can lock the doors, Katja s leapt in the back.

                                      SARAH
                    Get out of the car.

                                      KATJA
                    No. Fear will drive you crazy, Beth.
                    You're police, we need you.

      Sarah has no response. Katja stares at her hard.

                                      KATJA (CONT'D)
                    What s going on over there?

                                      SARAH
                      A friend s funeral.

                                      KATJA
                    Why not go?  Why spy?

                                      SARAH
                    There s people I don t want to see.

      Katja leans forward, searching her features. Sarah tries to
      poker face her back, but it s so unsettling, an alter-self
      in a mirror.

                                      KATJA
                    Just one, I m a few, familyless too. 
                    Who am I?

      It s a riddle, a test.  Sarah balks. And Katja knows.

                                      KATJA (CONT'D)
                    You re not Beth.

      A rush of air and cracking glass.  A red mist momentarily
      blinds Sarah.                                                                                      50. 


                                      SARAH
                    Ahh!

      Time slows as ... Sarah opens her eyes.  There s blood
      droplets on the front windscreen.  She turns around.

      Katja is slumped, head on her chest.  Sarah can t see her
      face.  It doesn t compute.  She sees ...

      A dollar-sized hole in the rear passenger window.  An exit
      hole, spider-cracked, out the blood-misted front passenger
      side.

      Real-time rushes back with another rush of air and instant
      bullet hole through the windows.

      Sarah yelps, dives down.  Is she hit?  She can feel blood on
      the side of her head.  All instinct now as she turns the
      key.  The engine growls, she drops it in reverse.


      The Audi peels backwards, running over debris.

      Sarah stays low, peering out the rear window.  Hits a bump,
      yelps as Katja s still-seated body falls over.  Yelps as
      another bullet rips through the windshield.

      The Audi punches through a chain-link fence, skids Rockford-
      style into the street.

      Sarah shifts into first, lights up the tires.  She madly
      corrects the wheel as ...

      The Audi fishtails up onto the curb, bounces back into the
      street and speeds away.


      Sarah fumbles wads of kleenex as she drives, pressing some
      to the side of her head.  In the rearview, she sees she s
      just nicked.

      She gets a fresh tissue and tries to wipe down the windshield
      and dash.  It just smears.  Her hands shake uncontrollably.

      She forgets the bloody windshield.  Someone who never cries
      is about to cry.

                                      SARAH
                    What the hell is happening to me?

      A phone rings.  In the backseat.

      With dread, she looks back to see ... Katja s corpse flopped
      across the back seat.  Dead eyes staring back, her own face
      with an exit hole.

      Katja s pink cell lies under her blood-matted hair, lighting
      up with each ring.

      Sarah turns forward and just drives.  The phone stops ringing,
      a relief.

      Sarah startles as almost immediately, as a second phone rings.
      Same ring.  From her pocket she pulls out - the pink phone.
       Unknown Caller   

      Ring ... ring ... Does she answer it?  Sarah is torn a
      thousand ways. 

      She cranks the wheel.


      Phone ringing in her hand, Sarah slowly turns to look in the
      back seat. The dead German lies there, eyes staring, exit
      wound oozing.

      Sarah can't make sense of it. The fear is absolute. She
      catches herself in the rear view. There's blood droplets on
      her face, a deja vu of the pilot teaser.                                                                                      52. 


      She wipes away the blood with a surge of panic, breaks the
      stasis and bursts out of the car.
